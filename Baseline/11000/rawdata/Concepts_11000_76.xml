== Location ==
The collision between the oil tanker and the cargo vessel occurred at the Shela River in Sundarbans, [[Khulna Division]], Bangladesh. The site is near [[Mongla Port]], and is about {{convert|100|km|mi}} from [[Kolkata Port (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Kolkata Port]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The oil tanker was at anchor at the confluence between the Shela River and the Passur River in dense fog when the cargo vessel collided with it at 5am on December 9, 2014.&lt;ref name=Kumar-Rao&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maptia.com/aratikumarrao/stories/oil-spill-in-the-sundarbans |title=Oil spill in the Sundarbans |author= Kumar-Rao, Arati |date=24 December 2014 |publisher=Maptia |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is in a protected [[mangrove]] area, home to rare [[Irrawaddy dolphin|Irrawaddy]] and [[Ganges Dolphin|Ganges dolphins]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/12/bangladesh-oil-spill-threatens-rare-dolphins-20141211165442529249.html|title = Bangladesh oil spill threatens rare dolphins|last = |first = |date = |work = [[Aljazeera]]|accessdate = 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casualties and losses ==
[[File:The oil Tank.jpg|thumb|Salvaged oil tanker]]

Seven crew members of the sunken ship managed to swim ashore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India on alert after oil spill in Sundarbans|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/12/us-india-sundarbans-idUSKBN0JQ1BZ20141212|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the captain of the ship, Mokhlesur Rahman, died, and his body was recovered a few kilometers away from the spot where the ship sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Callousness cause for Sundarban environmental disaster|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2014/12/17/61220.php|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=observerbd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts estimated that {{currency|1000000000|BDT}} was lost as a result of the sinking of the oil-tanker.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.clickittefaq.com/more-stories/tk-100-cr-loss-feared-sundarban-oil-spill/|title = TK 100 cr. loss feared from Sundarban oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[The Daily Ittefaq]]|accessdate = 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents of the surrounding area are at a health risk. 
The government of Bangladesh told the local residents to collect the oil and sell it to the [[Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation]]. The local oil collectors faced health risks and various skin diseases, including hair fallout if furnace oil mixed with water contacts a person's face or hair.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Environmental issues ==

[[File:Golpata tree oil covered.jpg|thumb|Oil covered trees]]
Environmentalists warned that the event was an ecological "catastrophe",&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; as the spill occurred at a protected area where rare dolphins were present.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Experts expressed concerns that the oil spill will hamper the well-being of the aquatic organisms in the area. Wildlife near the river are at a risk of death, because the smell of oil makes breathing difficult.&lt;ref name=":722"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil spill in Sundarbans threatens food cycle|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57215/Oil-spill-in-Sundarbans-threatens-food-cycle|accessdate=19 December 2014|work=[[Prothom Alo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some images indicate that the disaster killed some animals.&lt;ref name="Global Voices Online"/&gt;

On 13 December 2014, a dead Irrawaddy dolphin was seen floating on the Harintana-Tembulbunia channel of the Shela River.&lt;ref name=":622"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/14/first-dead-dolphin-spotted|title = First dead dolphin spotted|last = Siddique|first = Abu Bakar|date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not confirmed that the dolphin's death was caused by the oil spill. According to the local residents, few dolphins have been seen in the area since the oil spill.
Oriental small-clawed otter (''Amblonyx cinereus'') aquatic carnivore animal lives in the aquatic ecosystem of Sundarbans.&lt;ref&gt;Bautista H. and Rahman K. M. M. (2016). Review On the Sundarbans Delta Oil Spill: Effects On Wildlife and Habitats. International Research Journal, 1(43), Part 2, pp: 93-96. DOI: 10.18454/IRJ.2016.43.143&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December 2014, two dead [[otter]]s were recovered from the Shela River by forest department workers. An [[autopsy]] of the two otters confirmed that they had died from ingesting oil. The otter is considered to be an [[endangered species]], and has been included in the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] endangered list.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57260/Two-otters-dead-in-oil-spill|title = Two otters dead in oil spill|last = Mahmud|first = Iftekhar|date = |work = [[Prothom Alo]]|accessdate = 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of forest department workers saw [[crocodile]]s, [[monitor lizard]]s and many other animals smeared with oil at the Chandpai range of the Sundarbans.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The oil spill is also posing a major threat to the forest's food cycle. Reports from various sources showed that the microorganisms, the primary level of the food cycle, are dying.&lt;ref name=":722"/&gt; The [[United Nations]] expressed deep concern over the oil spill, urging the government of Bangladesh to impose a "complete ban" on commercial vessels moving through the forest.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/18/un-sends-team-to-clean-up-sunderbans-oil-spill-in-bangladesh|title = UN sends team to clean up Sunderbans oil spill in Bangladesh|last = |first = |date = 18 December 2014|work = [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate = 19 December 2014|publisher = [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shajahan Khan]], the shipping minister of Bangladesh, told [[Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha]] that he has talked with environmental experts, and they said that there will likely be no major damage as a result of the oil spill.&lt;ref name=":622"/&gt; Researchers said that Khan's claim was "unscientific and misleading".&lt;ref name=":722"/&gt;

Ten species that are at risk as a result of the spill have been listed by [[National Geographic Traveller|The National Geographic Traveler]]. These species are the [[Irrawady dolphin]]s, [[Bengal tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[great egret]]s, [[rhesus macaque]]s, [[northern river terrapin]]s, [[black-capped kingfisher]]s, [[chital]]s, [[saltwater crocodile]]s, and [[horseshoe crab]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/20/bnp-probe-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = BNP to probe Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of White Rumped Vulture (''Gyps bengalensis'') over the Sundarbans sky also indicated the large scale death of wild fauna. The secondary
effect of oil spill is always much greater than the primary effects.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman K. M. M. &amp; Rakhimov I. I. (2015). Ecological Effects of Oil Spill on Bangladesh Sundarbans Biodiversity. International Scientific and Practical Conference "Complex Problems of Technosphere Safety";Voronezh: Voronezh State Technical University, Russia;Part.VI.258p:Pp:16-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil collection==
[[File:Oil collection by local residents of Sundarbans.jpg|thumb|Local residents collecting oil]]

After the spill, primarily [[Bangladeshi]] fishermen began to clean up the oil using sponges and sacks.&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; [[Padma Oil Company]], a government-owned corporation, bought the oil at a price of 30 takas per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/12/12/suranjit-peeved-over-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = Suranjit peeved over Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[Bdnews24.com]]|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangladeshi navy initially sent four ships to deal with the spill, and planned to use chemicals to disperse the oil,&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; but the plan was canceled, as there were concerns that dispersing the oil would further damage the ecology and biodiversity of the mangrove forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/13/dilly-dallying-delays-clean-sundarbans-spill|title = Dilly dallying delays clean-up of Sundarbans spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Bangladesh closed the Shela River to all vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/river-route-closed-after-sundarbans-oil-spill/article6683452.ece|title = River route closed after Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = [[The Hindu]]|accessdate = 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the sunken oil tanker, MS Harun &amp; Co., began salvage efforts, assisted by three private rescue vessels. The Bangladesh Forest Department filed a 1 billion taka lawsuit against the owners of the two cargo ships involved in the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/12/10/govt-files-tk-1-billion-compensation-suit-for-sundarbans-oil-spill|title = Govt files Tk 1 billion compensation suit for Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 12 January 2015, the government, with the help of local residents, the Bangladesh Navy, and the owner of the oil tanker, had collected {{convert|70000|l|impgal usgal}} of oil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Bangladesh government said that they do not have the capacity to manage oil spills.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{cite news |title=No capacity to tackle oil spills |url=http://www.hawker.com.bd/news_details.php?news_id=389549 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/dec/14/india-alert-after-sunderbans-oil-spill|title = India on alert after Sundarbans oil spill|last = |first = |date = |work = The Dhaka Tribune|accessdate = 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Relations Division of the Bangladesh government sent a letter to the United Nation's Bangladesh office on 15 December 2014, asking for help in the oil collection efforts. The United Nations accepted the request, and a team from the [[UNEP]] and [[OCHA]] went to the site of the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN agrees to help govt contain oil spread|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/57157/Govt-seeks-UN-help-for-Sundarbans|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=[[Prothom Alo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from the [[United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination]] arrived in the [[Dhaka]] to support the cleanup efforts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Adhikārivāda''' is the [[doctrine]] of special rights and privileges with regard to the right to universal [[knowledge]] of the [[Upanishads]]. 

[[Vivekananda]] rejected this doctrine which, in his view, was the outcome of pure [[selfishness]] and ignored both the infinite possibilities of the [[human]] [[soul]] and the fact that all men are capable of receiving knowledge if it is imparted in their own respective [[language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda Vol.5|publisher=Kartindo.com|page=361|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AAGNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA361&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;dq=adhikarivada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hd1g1wRqYv&amp;sig=a8cfyj_VJk53Ed_zvYqf4WczlWM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WO2QVNPZB4WNuAS2qoL4Aw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikarivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he claimed, there is no reason for access to the universal knowledge of the Upanishads to be restricted on the basis of [[caste]] or [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalit’s Inheritance in Hindu Religion|author=Mahendra Singh|publisher=Gyan Publishing|page=63|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7CoelGoA6l8C&amp;pg=PA341&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;dq=adhikarivada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vgJy6_sCBH&amp;sig=6nZYD6YbHb5k2osjhxJIvj4la2U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WO2QVNPZB4WNuAS2qoL4Aw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikarivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amour-propre''''' (French, "[[self-love]]") is a concept in the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that [[wikt:esteem|esteem]] depends upon the opinion of others.  Rousseau contrasts it with ''[[amour de soi]]'', which also means "self-love", but which does not involve seeing oneself as others see one.  According to Rousseau, ''amour de soi'' is more primitive and is compatible with wholeness and happiness, while ''amour-propre'' is an unnatural form of self-love that arose only with the appearance of society and individuals' consequent ability to compare themselves with one another. Rousseau thought that ''amour-propre'' was subject to corruption, thereby causing vice and misery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/rousseau/ Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778)] ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''amour-propre'' predates Rousseau and is found in the writings of [[Blaise Pascal]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Pierre Nicole]], [[Jacques Abbadie]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/title/L%2527amour-propre L'amour-propre] at Everything2.com&lt;/ref&gt; For Pascal, Christianity was the only true remedy to this wretched state of man known as ''amour-propre'', which for him is a direct consequence of the [[Fall of Man|Fall]], and in his writings the term generally refers to man's desire to satisfy his own needs and desires.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Autonoetic consciousness''' is the human ability to mentally place ourselves in the past, in the future, or in [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] situations, and to thus be able to [[self-awareness|examine our own thoughts]].

Our sense of self affects our behavior, in the present, past and future.  It relates to how we reflect on our own past behavior, how we feel about it, and this in turn determines if we do it again.{{sfn|Baddeley|Eysenck|Anderson|2009}}{{page needed|date=May 2011}}

It is [[episodic memory]] that deals with self-awareness, memories of the self and inward thoughts that may be projected onto future actions of an individual.{{sfn|Baddeley|Eysenck|Anderson|2009}}{{page needed|date=May 2011}} It was "proposed by [[Endel Tulving|[Endel] Tulving]] for self-awareness, allowing the rememberer to reflect on the contents of episodic memory".{{sfn|Baddeley|Eysenck|Anderson|2015|p=308}} Moreover, autonoetic consciousness involves behaviors such as mental time travel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schacter |first1=D.&amp;nbsp;L. |last2=Addis |first2=D.&amp;nbsp;R. |last3=Buckner |first3=R.&amp;nbsp;L. |year=2007 |title=Remembering the Past to Imagine the Future: The Prospective Brain |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=657–661}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suddendorf |first1=T. |last2=Corballis |first2=M.&amp;nbsp;C. |year=2007 |title=The Evolution of Foresight: What Is Mental Time Travel, and Is It Unique to Humans? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=30 |pages=299–313}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; self-projection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buckner |first1=R.&amp;nbsp;L. |last2=Carroll |first2=D.&amp;nbsp;C. |year=2007 |title=Self-Projection and the Brain |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=11 |pages=49–57}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and episodic future thinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atance |first1=C.&amp;nbsp;M. |last2=O'Neill |first2=D.&amp;nbsp;K. |year=2001 |title=Episodic Future Thinking |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=5 |pages=533–539}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; all of which have often been proposed as exclusively human capacities.{{sfn|Hills|Butterfill|2015|p=369}}

== The self ==
Autonoetic consciousness is important in our formation of our "self" identity.  What we have done in the past becomes a part of our "self" and the ability to reflect on this influences our behavior in the now.

In psychology, the self is often used for that set of attributes that a person attaches to himself or herself most firmly, the attributes that the person finds it difficult or impossible to imagine himself or herself without.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Perry |year=1995 |title=The Self |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/453/PerrySelf.pdf}}{{Self-published inline|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Identity is also used to describe this.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt; A person's gender is part of their identity but their profession, for example, may not be.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

In philosophy, the self is the agent, the knower and the ultimate locus of personal identity.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} This self, the identity of which is at the bottom of every action, and involved in every bit of knowledge, is the self philosophers worry about.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Nevertheless, care of the self is of utmost importance in the bios-logos relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Parrhesia, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}

A straightforward view of the self would be that the self is just the person, and that a person is a physical system.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} There are two problems with this view. First, the nature of freedom and consciousness has convinced many philosophers that there is a fundamentally non-physical aspect of persons.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} The second challenge stems from puzzling aspects of self-knowledge, as the knowledge we have of ourselves seems very unlike the knowledge we have of other objects in several ways.&lt;ref name="Perry 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

== The parietal cortex ==
&lt;!--[[Image:parietallobe.jpg|thumb|alt=The lobes of the brain including the parietal, highlighted.|The Brain, highlighting in red the ''[[Parietal Lobe]]''.]]--&gt;

The [[parietal cortex]] is strongly involved in autonoetic consciousness.  Damage to areas of the parietal cortex can lead to different functioning errors, including changes in personality.

The [[parietal lobe]]s can be divided into two functional regions.  One involves [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] and [[perception (psychology)|perception]], and the other is concerned with integrating sensory input, primarily with the visual system.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Parietal Lobes |publisher=Centre for Neuro Skills |work=TBI Resource Guide |url=http://www.neuroskills.com/tbi/bparieta.shtml}}{{Verify credibility|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first function integrates sensory information to form a single perception.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; The second function constructs a spatial coordinate system to represent the world around us.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Individuals with damage to the parietal lobes often show striking deficits, such as abnormalities in body image and [[spatial relation]]s.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Damage to the left parietal lobe can result in what is called [[Gerstmann's syndrome]] which includes right-left confusion, difficulty with writing, and difficulty with mathematics.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; It can also produce disorders of language, and the inability to perceive objects normally.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Damage to the right parietal lobe can result in neglecting part of the body or space, which can impair many [[self care|self-care]] skills such as dressing and washing.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; Right side damage can also cause difficulty in making things, denial of deficits, and drawing ability.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Bi-lateral damage can cause [[Bálint's syndrome]], a visual attention and motor syndrome.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; This is characterized by the inability to voluntarily control the gaze, inability to integrate components of a visual scene, and the inability to accurately reach for an object with visual guidance.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Left parietal-temporal lesions can affect verbal memory and the ability to recall strings of digits.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

The right parietal-temporal lobe is concerned with non-verbal memory.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt; Right parietal-temporal lesions can produce significant changes in personality.&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

Lesions in the right parietal lobe influence personality, and this could be because the parietal lobe has to do with our sense of self.  Our sense of self is strongly reflected in our personality.

Some common tests for parietal lobe function are: Kimura Box Test ([[apraxia]]) and the [[two-point discrimination|Two-Point Discrimination]] Test (somatosensory).&lt;ref name="TBI Resource Guide"/&gt;

During episodic retrieval, functional imaging studies consistently show differential activity in medial [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and medial parietal cortices.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}}

With [[positron emission tomography]], it has been shown that the medial regions are functionally connected and interact with lateral regions that are activated according to the degree of self-reference.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}}

For example, in one study, during retrieval of previous judgments of oneself, best friend, and the Danish Queen, activation increased in the left lateral [[temporal cortex]] and decreased in the right inferior parietal region with decreasing self-reference.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}} The decrease in parietal cortex activation may then prove it is a nodal structure in self representation, functionally connected to both the right parietal and the medial prefrontal cortices.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}} There was a decrease in the efficiency of retrieval of previous judgment of mental Self compared with retrieval of judgment of Other with [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] at a latency of 160&amp;nbsp;ms, confirming the hypothesis that the medial parietal cortex in this network is essential for episodic memory retrieval with self-representation.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}}

This network is strikingly similar to the network of the resting conscious state, suggesting that self-monitoring is a core function in resting [[consciousness]].{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}}

== Episodic memory and the self ==
For a coherent and meaningful life, conscious self-representation is mandatory.{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}} Autonoetic consciousness is thought to emerge by retrieval of memory of personally experienced events (episodic memory).{{sfn|Lou|Luber|Crupain|Keenan|2004|p=6827}} Without the ability to reflect on our past experiences, we would be stuck in a state of constant awakening, without a past and therefore unable to prepare for the future.

Episodic memory is the memory we have for our past experiences, which influence our now, and our future. This is different from procedural memory, which is our memory for how to do things. Episodic memories influence our thinking about ourselves, good and bad.

[[Autobiographical memory|Autobiographical memories]] can be retrieved from either the first person perspective, in which individuals see the event through their own eyes, or from the third person perspective, in which individuals see themselves and the event from the perspective of an external observer.{{sfn|Sutin|Robins|2008|p=1386}}

A growing body of research suggests that the visual perspective from which a memory is retrieved has important implications for a person's thoughts, feelings, and goals, and is integrally related to a host of self- evaluative processes.{{sfn|Sutin|Robins|2008|p=1386}}

== Event-related potentials ==
&lt;!--[[Image:erp.jpg|thumb|alt=An ERP reading comparing autonoetic and noetic consciousness.|An ERP reading demonstrating autonoetic consciousness compared to an ERP reading of noetic consciousness.]]--&gt;

[[Event-related potentials]] (ERPs) can measure autonoetic consciousness scientifically. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are a non-invasive method of measuring brain activity during cognitive processing.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"&gt;{{cite web |title=Electroencephalography/Event Related Potentials (EEG/ERP) Laboratory |url=http://brainlang.georgetown.edu/erplab.htm |dead-url=yes |department=Brain and Language Lab |location=Washington |publisher=Georgetown University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719200527/http://brainlang.georgetown.edu/erplab.htm |archive-date=19 July 2011 |access-date=17 March 2018}}{{Self-published inline|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transient electric potential shifts (so-called ERP components) are time-locked to the stimulus onset (e.g., the presentation of a word, a sound, or an image).&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt; Each component reflects brain activation associated with one or more mental operations.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;

In contrast to behavioral measures such as error rates and response times, ERPs are characterized by simultaneous multi-dimensional online measures of polarity (negative or positive potentials), amplitude, latency, and scalp distribution.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt; Therefore, ERPs can be used to distinguish and identify psychological and neural sub-processes involved in complex cognitive, motor, or perceptual tasks.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;

Unlike [[fMRI]], they provide extremely high time resolution, in the range of one millisecond.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;

The methodological advantages of ERPs have resulted in an ever increasing number of ERP studies in cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, neuropsychology, and neurology.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt; ERPs have also been used to identify patients who seem to be "brain-dead" but in fact are not.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;

There is an event-related potential (ERP) experiment of human recognition memory that explored the relation between conscious awareness and [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] activity of the brain.{{sfn|Duzel|Yonelinas|Mangun|Heinze|1997|p=5973}} ERPs were recorded from healthy adults while they made "remember" and "know" recognition judgments about previously seen words, reflecting "Autonoetic" and "Noetic" awareness, respectively.{{sfn|Duzel|Yonelinas|Mangun|Heinze|1997|p=5973}} The ERP effects differed between the two kinds of awareness while they were similar for "true" and "false" recognition.{{sfn|Duzel|Yonelinas|Mangun|Heinze|1997|p=5973}}

In a study of real-time noninvasive recordings of the brain's electrical activity (event-related potentials, ERPs), there was a common neural "signature" that is associated with self-referential processing regardless of whether subjects are retrieving general knowledge (noetic awareness) or re-experiencing past episodes (autonoetic awareness).{{sfn|Magno|Allan|2007|p=672}}

== Social anxiety disorder ==
[[Social anxiety disorder]] (SAD) is an example of how bad experiences can also lead to our behaviors.  It demonstrates how our thoughts influence our feelings about ourselves and therefore our actions in society around us.  It has to do with a person’s self-esteem, fear of failure, shame, fear of offending, and fear of strangers.

Cognitive models of social anxiety disorder believe the social self is a key psychological mechanism that maintains [[fear of negative evaluation]] in social and performance situations.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Consequently, a distorted self-view is evident when recalling painful autobiographical social memories, as reflected in linguistic expression, negative self-beliefs, and [[experiential avoidance|emotion and avoidance]].{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

To test this hypothesis, 42 adults diagnosed with SAD and 27 non-psychiatric healthy controls composed autobiographical narratives of distinct social anxiety related situations, generated negative self-beliefs, and provided emotion and avoidance ratings.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

Although narratives were matched for initial emotional intensity and present vividness, linguistic analyses demonstrated that, compared to the control group, the SAD group employed more self-referential, anxiety, and sensory words, and made fewer references to other people.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Social anxiety symptom severity, however, was associated with greater self-referential NSB in SAD only.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

SAD reported greater current self-conscious emotions when recalling autobiographical social situations, and greater active avoidance of similar situations than did the control group.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} Autobiographical memory of social situations in SAD may influence current and future thinking, emotion, and behavioral avoidance.{{sfn|Anderson|Goldin|Kurita|Gross|2008}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20874">'''Babies switched at birth''' are [[infant|babies]] who, because of either error or malice, are interchanged with each other at [[childbirth|birth]] or very soon thereafter, leading to the babies being unknowingly raised by parents who are not their biological [[parent]]s. The occurrence is not unknown but rarely discovered in real life{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, but is much more common as a [[plot device]] in novels and films, such as the TV series ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'' and ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]''.

==As a literary plot device==
The [[plot device]] of babies who are switched at birth, or in their cradles, has been a common one in American fiction since the 18th century.  It is one of the several identifiable characteristics of [[melodrama]] that are plot devices dealing with situations that are highly improbable in real life.&lt;ref name=Merish&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion To American Fiction 1780-1865|editor=Shirley Samuels|page=192|author=Lori Merish|chapter=Melodrama and American Fiction|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of this common theme has continued ever since.  The device was used a number of times by [[W. S. Gilbert]], including in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]]s ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.  In both cases, well-born babies were switched with commoners.  [[Mark Twain]] later used this plot device in ''[[The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'' (1893), where two babies, one white and one black, are switched at birth, resulting in both [[passing (racial identity)|passing]] for races that they are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Race, Citizenship, and Law in American Literature|editor=Ross Posnock|pages=174&amp;ndash;182|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-01093-4|chapter=The positivist alternative|author=Gregg Crane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the themes that [[television film]]s regularly exploited in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Movies at Home: How Hollywood Came to Television|author=Kerry Segrave|page=139|year=1999|publisher=McFarland &amp;amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-0654-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a popular theme in the 1990s and 21st century with (for examples) it being employed as a plot device in ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' (the characters [[Cindy "Mac" Mackenzie]] and [[Madison Sinclair]]), in ''[[Neighbours]]'' (the characters [[Bree Timmins]] and [[Anne Baxter (Neighbours)|Anne Baxter]]), ''[[Night and Day (TV series)|Night and Day]]'' (the characters Jane Harper and Della Wells) and in ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (children of [[Lauren Fenmore Baldwin]] and [[Sheila Carter]]).  A non-human example occurs in the ''[[Planet of the Apes (franchise)|Planet of the Apes]]'' franchise, when the son of intelligent apes Zira and Cornelius is swapped with a 20th-century circus ape's infant, in order to assure the survival of the offspring that can become sentient. In ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' the characters [[Juanita Solis (daughter)|Juanita Solis]] and [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Grace Sanchez|Grace Sanchez]] were switched at birth by a nurse named Teresa Pruitt. In the Philippine television series, ''[[Mara Clara]]'', the characters Mara [[Mara Clara|Davis]]/[[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|David]] and Clara [[Mara Clara|del]] [[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|Valle]] were switched at birth by Gary for revenge after his former lover was married to another man. On the [[ABC Family]] series ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'', the characters Bay and Daphne were switched at birth.

Baby switching storylines are a staple of daytime drama, as in the case of ''The Young and the Restless'' mentioned above. Other notable switched-at-birth storylines on American soaps include ''[[One Life to Live]]''{{-'}}s story, begun in 1979, in which prostitute Katrina Karr, who had planned to put her child up for adoption as soon as it was born, and former nun Jenny Vernon both gave birth to girls at the same hospital, at the same time. Jenny's baby died in the maternity ward as Karen Wolek and Marco Dane (posing as a doctor) visited the child. As they knew Katrina had planned to give up her baby girl, Karen and Marco switched the newborns. It was not until 1982 that the truth came out and Jenny tearfully gave baby Mary back to Katrina.

In 2008, another ''One Life to Live'' storyline saw Starr Manning pregnant with Cole Thornhart's baby. Her cousin Jessica Brennan was also pregnant with her late husband's baby. Starr went into labor as her father Todd Manning (later revealed to be his twin brother Victor) planned to kidnap his grandchild and raise the baby secretly with Cole's amnesiac mother Marty Saybrooke. Tess, one of Jessica's alter personalities, had taken control of Jessica's life and went into premature labor. Starr, with the help of the baby's adoptive mother Marcie McBain and Starr's mother Blair Manning, gave birth to a healthy girl, whom she named Hope. Tess's child, named Chloe, was stillborn. The trauma of Chloe's death resulted in the emergence of another alter, Bess, who took Jessica's deceased baby to the hospital and switched her with Starr's healthy child. Seven months later, Jessica realized what had happened and told the truth to her cousin.

Possibly the most complex storyline involving the switched-at-birth plot device ran simultaneously on ''[[All My Children]]'' and ''One Life to Live''.&lt;ref&gt;http://onelifetolive.about.com/library/news/blbaby_switch.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Involved were ''All My Children''{{-'}}s Bianca Montgomery and Babe Chandler, and ''One Life to Live''{{-'}}s Kelly Cramer Buchanan, as well as many other characters.

In [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, the baby Aegon Targaryen was switched with a commoner's baby at some point prior to the Sack of King's Landing in order to save him from being killed during the rebellion against the Targaryen dynasty. After the commoner's baby is killed, everyone believes that Aegon is dead when in fact he is preparing to take back his grandfather's throne.

In the 1971 manga/anime ''[[Wandering Sun]] / Nozomi in the Sun'' (''Sasurai no Taiyou''), Miki and Nozomi are two girls who were switched at birth by the nurse Michiko Nohara, who holds a personal grudge against one of the families involved. Miki should've been raised as the daughter of the poor but loving Mine family but instead is taken in by the rich and snobbish Kouda clan, and Nozomi the opposite. The deceit isn't properly revealed until almost the end of the series.

In the ''[[Umineko no naku koro ni]]'' visual novels, Rudolf Ushiromiya's wife Asumu and mistress/later second wife Kyrie were pregnant and gave birth at roughly the same time. Rudolf had the children switched when Asumu's child was stillborn so the affair wouldn't be uncovered, and after Asumu's death from an illness, he married Kyrie. The surviving child grows into the protagonist of the games, Battler Ushiromiya, who believes himself to be Asumu and Rudolf's son until later in the story.

In the game ''[[Tales of the Abyss]]'', Princess Natalia Luzu Kimlasca-Lanvaldear died few after birth so her nanny Maggie switched her with her also newborn granddaughter, Meryl Oakland. This causes Meryl's mother Sylvia (Maggie's own daughter) to commit suicide out of grief, and her father Badaq soon became the enemy general Largo the Black Lion. Meryl, now Natalia, is raised as the Princess and doesn't find out the truth until she's a teenager.

==In reality==

In real life, such a switch occurs rarely.&lt;ref name=Merish /&gt; Since many cases of babies switched at birth are likely undocumented or unknown, the following is presumably not an exhaustive list.

*In 1931, at the [[Leiden University Medical Center]], female babies Agnes van Vegten and Lenie van Duyn were switched. Suspicions did not rise until two decades later, when the girls met at a wedding and wondered at their mutual likeness to each other's family.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (1955, December 28). "CHANGELING" SUES PARENTS :Dutch Case Ruled Inadmissible. The Manchester Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1951, at a hospital in [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]], the babies of Mary Miller and Kay McDonald were accidentally switched. Mary Miller immediately suspected that a switch had occurred, as the baby she received weighed a full two pounds less than at the hospital. Mary Miller knew Kay McDonald, and assumed that it was their baby she had taken home.  However, a series of circumstances kept Mary Miller from actively pursuing her suspicion for 43 years, when she revealed to the now grown girls, Sue McDonald and Martha Miller, what she suspected of their births. Genetic tests later confirmed that a switch did in fact occur. The story was featured on an episode of the radio show ''[[This American Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1496358/public_radio_to_air_story_of_pdc_babies_switched_at/ View - redOrbit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1253 2011 | Archive | This American Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1953, at Pioneer Memorial Hospital in [[Heppner, Oregon]], two babies were switched. In May 2009, the women discovered they were switched. DeeAnn Angell of Fossil and Kay Rene Reed of Condon learned about the mistake from an 86-year-old woman who was a former neighbor. The former neighbor said that one of the girls' mothers, Marjorie Angell, insisted back in 1953 that she had been given the wrong baby after nurses returned from bathing them. But her concerns were ignored. With both sets of parents dead, the Reed and Angell siblings compared notes and family stories, learning that rumors of a mix-up had been around for years. Kay Rene Reed decided to get their DNA tested, and that confirmed the mistake. They both say they just have to move forward with their lives now, and they celebrated their latest birthday together.
*In March 1953, at San-Ikukai Hospital in Tokyo's Sumida Ward, hospital staff mistook a baby boy for another baby boy born 13 minutes later. This story was referred to as the tale of the Japanese "prince and pauper." Sixty years later, a 60-year-old Japanese truck driver discovered he was switched at birth after being born to a rich family. The man was raised by a single mother in a 100-square-foot apartment. The boy who was raised in his place by the rich family became the president of a real estate company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/11/29/247807768/japanese-prince-switched-at-birth-was-raised-a-pauper | title=Japanese 'Prince' Switched At Birth Was Raised A Pauper | publisher=NPR| date=Nov 29, 2013 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | author=Calamur, Krishnadev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Man born to wealthy parents lived in poverty after being switched at birth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc1tOM6Qn5Y|website=YouTube|publisher=Global Report News|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kimberly Mays and Arlena Twigg were switched at birth as a result of a [[medical error]] in a hospital in [[Wauchula, Florida]];&lt;ref name=Guggenheim&gt;{{cite book|title=What's Wrong With Children's Rights?|author=Martin Guggenheim|page=56|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-01721-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the events surrounding their case were subsequently dramatized as the made-for-TV movie ''[[Switched at Birth (film)|Switched at Birth]]''.
*In 1975, at least two known cases occurred in [[Norway House]], [[Manitoba]] of babies being switched at birth at the Norway House Hospital: Luke Monias and Norman Barkman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-men-switched-at-birth-1.3317638 "2 Manitoba men switched at birth dealing with 'stolen identity'"].

[[CBC Manitoba]], August 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Both pairs of boys were from the same small communities, and had been lifelong friends of their switch-mates before learning of the switches only in the mid-2010s.
*The Mixed-Up Brothers of [[Bogotá]] refers to two sets of [[identical twins]] that got separated at birth in 1988 and were raised as [[nonidentical twins]].

*The sons of two [[South Africa]]n women, Margaret Clinton-Parker and Sandra Dawkins, were accidentally switched at birth in 1989; the women sued in the [[High Court of South Africa]] in [[Johannesburg]] in 1995, demanding damages of [[South African rand|ZAR]]120,000 each from the government of the province of [[Gauteng]] for the error.&lt;ref name ="old"&gt;''Clinton-Parker v.

That was until one of the boys, Robin, at the age of 15, decided to leave Sandy Dawkins to go and live with his biological mother, Margaret Clinton-Parker.

*In 1992, it was discovered that Canadians Brent Tremblay and Marcus Holmes had been switched at birth 21 years earlier. The error was discovered when Brent and his twin, George Holmes, met each other at Carleton University in Ottawa.  The Children's Aid Society of Ontario later settled with the families involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/switched.asp snopes.com: Twins Switched at Birth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, it was discovered that Callie Johnson and Rebecca Chittum had been switched at birth in 1995 in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. The switch was discovered when a DNA test of Callie Johnson to determine paternity for [[child support]] found that she was not biologically related to either her purported father, Carlton Conley, or her purported mother, Paula Johnson. In a tragic coincidence, Callie's biological parents Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers died in a car accident the day after Paula Johnson learned of the results of the DNA test. Five others also died in the car accident, but Rebecca Chittum, Johnson's three-year-old biological daughter whom the deceased couple had been raising as their child, was at home with her supposed grandparents at the time of the accident. Over the next decade, Paula Johnson repeatedly grappled with Rebecca's purported grandparents for custody and visitation rights, until a judge determined that the two girls were old enough to express their own wishes with regard to seeing their biological relatives. In 2001, Carlton Conley married the sister of his biological daughter Rebecca's deceased adoptive father Kevin Chittum. Rebecca Chittum lived with the couple as of 2008 but had limited contact with her biological mother, while Callie lived with Paula Johnson and occasionally visited her biological relatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/168155 Two families, 10 years later - Roanoke.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001, it was reported that a 35-year-old woman from the [[Canary Islands]] had discovered that she was one of a set of [[identical twins]] and that she had been accidentally switched at birth with another girl. She grew up as an only child, until a friend of her twin mistook her for being that twin. But the person was shocked by the striking similarity in appearance and summoned them together. They took a DNA test, which proved they were identical twins. The twin who had grown up thinking that another girl was her twin said that the girl she thought was her twin looked nothing like her. Since the women were born in a state hospital, they sued the government for damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7422635.stm | work=BBC News | title=Spain twins sue over birth mix-up | date=May 27, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 9, 2006, two newborn girls were switched in a hospital in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] town of Trebic. The families did not find out until September 2007, when a couple of friends of one of the fathers made fun of him for not being the biological father of the baby. DNA tests proved that the girl was indeed switched. After days of investigation, the other family was found. The babies were gradually introduced to their biological parents and returned to their birth homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://czechdaily.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/babies-switched-at-birth-verdict-hospital-to-pay-33m// Switched At Birth Verdict: Hospital to Pay « The Czech Daily Word&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On October 10, 2011, it was discovered that two [[Russia]]n newborn girls were switched 12 years beforehand in a town in the [[Ural Mountains]]. The truth emerged after the ex-husband of one of the mothers refused to pay alimony for the child on the basis that she looked nothing like him. DNA tests proved that the child was neither's biological daughter. The other family was discovered across town with the biological daughter. The children will stay with their adoptive parents, and both families are demanding 5 million [[rubles]] in damage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15244382 Russian families sue child mix-up hospital ]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moses Cushworth, the son of U.K. citizen Rich Cushworth and his Salvadoran wife Mercedes "Mercy" Casanalles, was switched with another baby at a Salvadoran hospital in May 2015. Getting Moses out of El Salvador became a nine-month process requiring the help of U.K. Ambassador [[Bernhard Garside]] in obtaining a passport for the boy, due to the problems with the birth certificate.

==Anti-switch techniques==
Some hospitals take fingerprints, foot prints, or palm prints of newborns to prevent babies from being mixed up.  Nurses also double check with the mother, checking the identity of that person as well, in order to prevent errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Obstetrics for Nurses|author=Joseph Bolivar De Lee|publisher=W. B. Saunders|location=London and Philadelphia|year=1966|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Childhood and Adolescence: A Psychology of the Growing Person|author=Lawrence Joseph Stone and Joseph Church|year=1973|publisher=Random House UK Ltd|isbn=0-394-31723-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many hospitals also have policies in which a medical record number is assigned to an infant at birth, and bands with this number as well as the last name of the mother of the infant, the sex of the infant, and the date and time of birth are placed on the infant and the mother immediately after [[parturition]] before the mother and child are separated.  A band may also be placed on the father (or other person chosen by the mother) at the time of birth.

In the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] or conceptual sense, '''balance''' is used to mean a point between two opposite forces that is desirable over purely one state or the other, such as a balance between the metaphysical [[Law]] and [[Randomness|Chaos]] &amp;mdash; law by itself being overly controlling, chaos being overly unmanageable, balance being the point that minimizes the negatives of both.

More recently, the term "balance" has come to refer to a balance of power between multiple opposing forces. Lack of balance (of power) is generally considered to cause aggression by stronger forces towards weaker forces less capable of defending themselves. In the real world, unbalanced stronger forces tend to portray themselves as balanced, and use media controls to downplay this, as well as prevent weaker forces from coming together to achieve a new balance of power. In constructed worlds, such as in video gaming, where nearly all-powerful corporate interests strive to maintain a balance of power among players, players tend to be extremely vocal about what they see as unbalanced mechanics, providing the unbalance negatively affects them. Though the strong and unbalanced (or "overpowered") players commonly are vigorous in denial of any lack of balance, the comparative media equality among all player brings change quickly, to further a sense of balance.

==Artistic balance==
The twentieth century saw the development of both law and chaos in art (and art-music) to the point that the end product became unintelligible at an instinctive/emotional level. Many composers saw one or other of these controlling trends as superior to the other. The truth may lie in a fundamental acceptance of balance as the controlling force in art. In time, we may even come to accept balance between structural and emotional as the essence of beauty.

==Moral balance==
In philosophy, the concept of moral balance exists in various forms, one of them is the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]], which has virtue being between the extreme and the lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237719/Golden-Mean|title=Golden Mean (phylosophy) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophers—such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Pythagoreans]] (who related moral excellence with mathematical perfection)—applied the principle to ethics as well as politics. "Nothing in excess" was one of the three phrases carved into the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi.

In Buddhism, this concept is known as the middle way, or ''samatā'', which stated that the way to [[nirvana]] led between bodily sexual indulgence and self-mortification and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=35|title=BALANCE - A Guide to Buddhism A-Z|publisher=Guide to Buddhism A-Z|accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucian teachings contain the similar [[Doctrine of the Mean|doctrine of Zhōngyōng]]; the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/confuciu.htm|title=Key Passages in the Analects of Confucius|accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12640">'''Body cathexis''' is defined as the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction one feels towards various parts and aspects of his or her own body.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Jourard, S. M., &amp; Secord, P.F. (1955). Body cathexis and the ideal female figure. The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 50(2), 243-246. doi: 10.1037/h0041128&lt;/ref&gt; This evaluative dimension of [[body image]] is dependent on a person’s investment of mental and emotional energy in body size, parts, shape, processes, and functions, and is integral to one’s sense of [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Secord|first=Paul F.|last2=Jourard|first2=Sidney M.|title=The appraisal of body-cathexis: body-cathexis and the self.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0060689|journal=Journal of Consulting Psychology|volume=17|issue=5|pages=343–347|doi=10.1037/h0060689}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First recognized by Jourard and Secord, body cathexis is assessed by examining correlations between measures of self-concept or esteem and bodily attitudes. An individual’s evaluation of his or her own body tends to drive various behaviors, including clothing choices and weight management, and the existence of a universal ideal for certain dimensions of body type is, in many cases, a source of anxiety and insecurity.

While the body has been studied by psychologists from numerous different viewpoints, few recent reports of systematic empirical research into feelings about the body exist.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jourard|first=Sidney M.|last2=Secord|first2=Paul F.|date=1955-05-01|title=Body-Cathexis and Personality|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1955.tb00531.x/abstract|journal=British Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=130–138|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1955.tb00531.x|issn=2044-8295}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, body cathexis is of crucial importance to understanding personality, since feelings about the body closely correspond to feelings about the self and produce marked behavioral consequences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the substantial amount of attention individuals devote to the grooming and concern for bodily appearance, body cathexis is believed to be intrinsically related to the self-concept, with high self-esteem and self-acceptance serving as preventative factors against body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secord, P. F. &amp; Jourard, S. M. (1953). The appraisal of body cathexis: Body cathexis and the self. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 17(5), 343-347. doi: 10.1037/h0060689&lt;/ref&gt;

Among females in particular, one’s general attitude about the body is a significant personality variable with mental health implications.&lt;ref&gt;Kyung Song, H., &amp; Ashdown, S. P. (2013). Female apparel consumers’ understanding of body size and shape: Relationship among body measurements, fit satisfaction, and body cathexis. ''Clothing and Textiles Research Journal'', 31(3), 143-146. doi: 10.1177/0887302X13493127&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have examined the effects of bodily attitudes on consumer dissatisfaction or satisfaction with fit of apparel, disordered eating, and participation in weight loss programs.&lt;ref&gt;LaBat, K. L., &amp; DeLong, M. R. (1990). Body cathexis and satisfaction with fit of apparel. ''Clothing and Textiles Research Journal'', 8(''2''), 43-48. doi: 10.1177/0887302X9000800206&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body Cathexis Scale ==
First introduced by Secord and Jourard in 1953, the Body Cathexis Scale provides an objective measure of one’s feelings towards various aspects of his or her body.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Originally composed of 46 items, the questionnaire asks individuals to indicate the strength and direction of feeling he or she has about certain bodily parts and functions according to a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1, “strongly negative,” to 5, “strongly positive.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tucker, L. (1981). Internal structure, factor satisfaction, and reliability of the body cathexis scale. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 53(''3''), 891-896. doi: 10.2466/pms.1981.53.3.891&lt;/ref&gt;

The body cathexis items used in the scale include body characteristics such as “width of shoulders,” “facial complexion,” and “body build.”&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Individuals are to consider each of the items listed and assign a numerical score that best represents his or her feelings about the various body aspects. Total body cathexis (BC) is obtained by summing the ratings for each of the 46 characteristics and dividing by total number of items.

== Body Image and the Self ==
[[Body image]] is one of the most significant components of an individual’s self-concept. One's perception of his or her body and the feelings associated with this perceived image greatly influence overall satisfaction with the self and can predict levels of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The relationship between body image and the self-concept has been investigated extensively by Secord and Jourard, and as their research indicates, self-esteem scores and personal identification are highly correlated with body cathexis, acceptance, and overall satisfaction with physical body traits and functions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Among the few empirical studies relevant to the relatedness of the body and the self is that of Schilder, who – through a series of self-report questionnaires – procured evidence suggesting that negative feelings, associations, and memories about the body can probe higher levels of dissatisfaction with the self.&lt;ref&gt;Schilder, P. ''Psychotherapy''. New York: Norton, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; In approaching the problem of body cathexis appraisal, Secord and Jourard adapted Shilder’s methods to test their hypothesis that feelings about the body are correlated with overall feelings about the self.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In their study, the researchers developed a method for assessing an individual’s feelings towards his or her bodily features in order to ascertain whether or not the variables attained through these methods are relevant to personality theory. Using scales of body cathexis and self cathexis, the Maslow Test of Psychological Security-Insecurity, and an anxiety-related body cathexis homonym test, Secord and Jourard concluded that the body and self tend to be cathected to the same degree. Consequently, as suggested by the results of both the body cathexis and self cathexis scales (which represent attitudes about conceptual aspects of the self in correlation to the body), low body cathexis is significantly associated with anxiety, insecurity, and negative perceptions of the self.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Likewise, an individual’s perception of self-worth is a fluctuating attitude that can rise and fall with changing components of the physical self. This attitude, coined [[self-esteem]], is an evaluative component of the psychological self that is partially dependent upon one’s satisfaction with physical appearance. As various studies indicate, changes in body composition, perceptions of physical attractiveness, and overall body condition provide inferential support for the claim that body image is related to an individual’s self-esteem and perceived worth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melnick, M. J., &amp; Mookerjee, S. (1991). Effects of advanced weight-training on body cathexis and self-esteem. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 72(''3''), 1335-1345. doi: 10.2466/pms.1991.72.3c.1335&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex Differences ==
Because body image and body weight are a high priority in western culture, men and women alike face gender-based societal pressures to achieve an ideal body image, which in turn influences feelings about the body and preoccupation with size, shape, weight, and appearance.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; According to Salusso-Deonier and Schwarzkopf, gender is a salient factor in body image development, and due to sex differences in the management and enhancement of appearance, females tend to exhibit more negative cathexis responses to the body and self as compared to men.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Salusso-Deonier, C. J., &amp; Schwarzkopf, R. J. (1991). Sex differences in body cathexis associated with exercise involvement. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 73, 139-145. doi: 10.2466/pms.1991.73.1.139&lt;/ref&gt;

As their study suggests, body cathexis scores among females tend to decrease as body type varies from the ideal thin, while body cathexis scores among males show similar trends when one’s perceived body is fatter or thinner than the muscular ideal.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; However, though previous literature demonstrates that both men and women are concerned with weight and appearance, men generally have higher body cathexis than women. Cultural scripting, particularly male socialization that fosters exercise involvement and physical fitness, may be partially responsible for higher body cathexis scores among males, since participation in fitness activities tends to yield significant improvement in body satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Similarly, dysphoric body image experiences often mediated by specific contextual cues also promote sizable sex differences in body cathexis and the occurrence of negative body image emotions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muth|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Cash|first2=Thomas F.|date=1997-08-01|title=Body-Image Attitudes: What Difference Does Gender Make?1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb01607.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|language=en|volume=27|issue=16|pages=1438–1452|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb01607.x|issn=1559-1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to men, women are more strongly invested in their looks and tend to report a more negative overall body image evaluation. As the findings of their study confirm, Muth and Cash suggest that the gender-differential societal and personal standards of body attractiveness place women at a higher predisposition for less favorable, more invested, and more distressing body image attitudes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Associated Behaviors ==
Feelings about the body have marked behavioral consequences, and as both casual and clinical observations suggest, body cathexis and body perceptions play a significant role in garment fit satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;LaBat, K. L., &amp; DeLong, M. R. (1990). Body cathexis and satisfaction with fit of apparel. ''Clothing and Textiles Research Journal'', 2, 43-48. doi: 10.1177/0887302X9000800206&lt;/ref&gt; While the physical dimensions and product design of apparel are partially responsible for consumers’ dissatisfaction with clothing fit, consumers are often quick to blame themselves and their body type when a product does not work. For females in particular, fashionable clothing is often designed to fit a specific body type; thus, when a clothing article does not fit properly, the consumer tends to blame the poor fit on their body and not the design of the apparel – a result of the individual’s low body cathexis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Similarly, social stimuli may play a reciprocal role in anticipating behavior, contributing to the formation of negative feelings about the body.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Since consumers often rely on social information and preconceived notions of the ideal body image when shaping their self-concept, apparel fit may contribute to body cathexis and overall feelings about the self. Therefore, dissatisfaction with the fit of garments can lead to lower body cathexis and negative attitudes regarding overall appearance, body dimensions, and weight.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Along with garment fit satisfaction, research also indicates that body image attitudes and emotions may be correlated with [[disordered eating]] behaviors.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paxton, S. J., &amp; Franko, D.L. (2009). Body image and eating disorders. In M. A. Cucciare &amp; K. R. Weingardt (Eds.), ''Using Technology to Support Evidence-Based Behavioral Health Practices: A Clinician’s Guide'' (pp. 151-165). New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis Group. '' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Body dissatisfaction, especially negative attitudes about weight, is a significant risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms and low self-esteem, as well as unhealthy weight control strategies, such as skipping meals, fasting, crash dieting, and self-induced purging. Low body cathexis and preoccupation can contribute to the development of [[eating disorder]]s among female adolescents in particular, often a result of societal pressures and expectations to achieve the ideal, thin body type.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Carbon-neutral fuels are used in Germany and Iceland for [[Power storage#Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel|distributed storage of renewable energy]], minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency, and enabling transmission of wind, water, and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines. Such [[renewable fuels]] could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels, enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; A 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant has been built in Germany and it is being scaled up to 10 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft |date=May 5, 2010 |title=Storing green electricity as natural gas |publisher=''fraunhofer.de'' |url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010/04/green-electricity-storage-gas.html |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic hydrocarbons. They can be produced in chemical reactions between carbon dioxide, which can be captured from power plants or the air, and hydrogen, which is created by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy. The fuel, often referred to as [[electrofuel]], stores the energy that was used in the production of the hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Richard |author2=Eisaman |title=Energy Storage Via Carbon-Neutral Fuels Made From Carbon dioxide, Water, and Renewable Energy |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |date=2011 |url=http://www.uk-shec.org.uk/uk-shec/news/IEEE_Paper_6_3_5_finalx1x.pdf |accessdate=18 October 2012 |doi=10.1109/jproc.2011.2168369 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=440–460 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508220516/http://www.uk-shec.org.uk/uk-shec/news/IEEE_Paper_6_3_5_finalx1x.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.359.8746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal can also be used to produce the hydrogen, but that would not be a carbon-neutral source. Carbon dioxide can be captured and buried, making fossil fuels carbon-neutral, although not renewable. Carbon capture from exhaust gas can make carbon-neutral fuels carbon negative. Other hydrocarbons can be broken down to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide which could then be stored while the hydrogen is used for energy or fuel, which would also be carbon-neutral.&lt;ref name=Kleiner&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kleiner |first=kurt |title=Carbon Neutral Fuel; a new approach |journal=The Globe and Mail |date=17 January 2009 |pages=F4 |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=303830&amp;sr=HLEAD(CARBON-NEUTRAL+FUEL)+and+date+is+January+17%2C+2009 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most energy-efficient fuel to produce is [[hydrogen]] gas,&lt;ref name ="ubaposition"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/377/publikationen/uba_position_powertoliquid_engl.pdf |title =Integration of Power to Gas/Power to Liquids into the ongoing transformation process |date = June 2016|accessdate = August 10, 2017 |page =12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and which requires the fewest process steps to produce.

Methanol can be made from a chemical reaction of a carbon-dioxide molecule with three hydrogen molecules to produce methanol and water. The stored energy can be recovered by burning the methanol in a combustion engine, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and heat. [[Methane]] can be produced in a similar reaction. Special precautions against methane leaks are important since methane is nearly 100 times as potent as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in terms of [[Global warming potential]]. More energy can be used to combine methanol or methane into larger hydrocarbon fuel molecules.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

Researchers have also suggested using methanol to produce [[dimethyl ether]]. This fuel could be used as a substitute for diesel fuel due to its ability to self ignite under high pressure and temperature. It is already being used in some areas for heating and energy generation. It is nontoxic, but must be stored under pressure.&lt;ref name=Olah&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olah |first=George |author2=Alain Geoppert |author3=G. K.

All synthetic hydrocarbons are generally produced at temperatures of 200–300&amp;nbsp;°C, and at pressures of 20 to 50 bar. [[Catalyst]]s are usually used to improve the efficiency of the reaction and create the desired type of hydrocarbon fuel. Such reactions are exothermic and use about 3&amp;nbsp;mol of hydrogen per mole of carbon dioxide involved. They also produce large amounts of water as a byproduct.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt;

== Sources of carbon for recycling ==
The most economical source of carbon for recycling into fuel is [[flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion]] where it can be obtained for about USD $7.50 per ton.&lt;ref name=MacDowell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011/&gt;&lt;ref name= Pennline2010/&gt; Automobile exhaust gas capture has also been seen as economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting.&lt;ref name=Musadi2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Musadi |first=M.R. |last2=Martin |first2=P. |last3=Garforth |first3=A. |last4=Mann |first4=R. |date=2011 |title=Carbon neutral gasoline re-synthesised from on-board sequestrated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Chemical Engineering Transactions |volume=24 |pages=1525–30 |doi=10.3303/CET1124255 |url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/11/24/255.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since carbonic acid in seawater is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with atmospheric carbon dioxide, extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=DiMascio |first=Felice |last2=Willauer |first2=Heather D. |authorlink2=Heather Willauer |last3=Hardy |first3=Dennis R. |last4=Lewis |first4=M.

Proposals for this method involve using a caustic chemical to react with carbon dioxide in the air to produce [[carbonate]]s. These can then be broken down and hydrated to release pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas and regenerate the caustic chemical. This process requires more energy than other methods because carbon dioxide is at much lower concentrations in the atmosphere than in other sources.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

Researchers have also suggested using biomass as a carbon source for fuel production. Adding hydrogen to the biomass would reduce its carbon to produce fuel. This method has the advantage of using plant matter to cheaply capture carbon dioxide. The plants also add some chemical energy to the fuel from biological molecules. This may be a more efficient use of biomass than conventional [[biofuel]] because it uses most of the carbon and chemical energy from the biomass instead of releasing as much energy and carbon. Its main disadvantage is, as with conventional ethanol production, it competes with food production.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt;

== Renewable and nuclear energy costs ==

Nighttime [[wind power]] is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the [[load curve]] for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per [[kilowatt-hour]] in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; Typically, [[wholesale]] electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfuelist.com/ Electricity Price] ''NewFuelist.com'' (compare to [http://dotyenergy.com/Images/windprice-2010-W.jpg off-peak wind power price graph.]) Retrieved September 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce gasoline for less than [[petroleum]] fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last=Holte |first=Laura L. |last2=Doty |first2=Glenn N. |last3=McCree |first3=David L. |last4=Doty |first4=Judy M. |last5=Doty |first5=F.

In 2010, a team of process chemists led by [[Heather Willauer]] of the U.S. Navy, estimates that 100 megawatts of electricity can produce 41,000 gallons of [[jet fuel]] per day and shipboard production from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon. While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a [[carrier battle group]] costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive.&lt;ref name="jetsea"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Willauer |first=Heather D. |last2=Hardy |first2=Dennis R. |last3=Williams |first3=Frederick W. |date=September 29, 2010 |title=''Feasibility and Current Estimated Capital Costs of Producing Jet Fuel at Sea'' |publisher=Chemistry Division, Navy Technology Center for Safety and Survivability, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |location=Washington, DC |type=memorandum report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA539765 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greenhouse gas remediation ==
Carbon-neutral fuels can lead to greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide gas would be reused to produce fuel instead of being released into the atmosphere. Capturing the carbon dioxide in flue gas emissions from power plants would eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions, although burning the fuel in vehicles would release that carbon because there is no economical way to capture those emissions.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; This approach would reduce net carbon dioxide emission by about 50% if it were used on all fossil fuel power plants. Most [[coal power plant|coal]] and [[natural gas power plant]]s have been predicted to be economically retrofittable with [[carbon dioxide scrubber]]s for [[carbon capture]] to recycle flue exhaust or for [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=DiPietro |first=Phil |last2=Nichols |first2=Chris |last3=Marquis |first3=Michael |date=January 2011 |title=''Coal-Fired Power Plants in the United States: Examination of the Costs of Retrofitting with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture Technology, Revision 3'' |publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy |type=report NETL-402/102309 |docket=DOE contract DE-AC26-04NT41817 |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/energy-analyses/pubs/GIS_CCS_retrofit.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=House2011/&gt; Such recycling is expected to not only cost less than the excess [[economic impacts of climate change]] if it were not done, but also to pay for itself as global fuel [[economic demand|demand]] growth and [[peak oil]] shortages increase the price of [[petroleum]] and [[Fungibility|fungible]] [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name=Goeppert2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lackner2012/&gt;

Capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly from the air or extracting carbonic acid from seawater would also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment, and create a closed cycle of carbon to eliminate new carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt; Use of these methods would eliminate the need for fossil fuels entirely, assuming that enough renewable energy could be generated to produce the fuel. Using synthetic hydrocarbons to produce synthetic materials such as plastics could result in permanent sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

== Traditional fuels, methanol or ethanol ==
{{See also|Methanol economy}}

Some authorities have recommended producing [[methanol]] instead of traditional transportation fuels. It is a liquid at normal temperatures and can be toxic if ingested. Methanol has a higher [[octane rating]] than gasoline but a lower [[energy density]], and can be mixed with other fuels or used on its own. It may also be used in the production of more complex hydrocarbons and polymers. Direct methanol fuel cells have been developed by Caltech's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] to convert methanol and oxygen into electricity.&lt;ref name=Olah /&gt; It is possible to convert methanol into gasoline, jet fuel or other hydrocarbons, but that requires additional energy and more complex production facilities.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt; Methanol is slightly more corrosive than traditional fuels, requiring automobile modifications on the order of USD $100 each to use it.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steinberg1995&gt;{{Cite report |last=Steinberg |first=Meyer |date=August 1995 |title=''The Carnol Process for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Mitigation from Power Plants and the Transportation Sector |publisher=Department of Advanced Technology, Brookhaven National Laboratory |location=Upton, New York |type=informal report BNL–62110 |docket=(Prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-76CH00016) |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/100204-X2uZUC/webviewable/100204.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a method using [[carbon spikes]], [[copper nanoparticle]]s and nitrogen that converts carbon dioxide to [[ethanol]] was developed.&lt;ref name="CO2_to_ethanol" /&gt;

The sculptures are of thirteen figures, which depict adult [[vice]]s, such as alcoholism, drug addiction, and prostitution, that affect children.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1426475.stm|title=Moscow divided over vices statue|date=6 July 2001| publisher = [[BBC News]] |accessdate=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are perceptibly closing in on two unaware playmates, a girl and a boy, with the centrepiece figure being 'Indifference'.

The sculpture was commissioned by then-Mayor [[Yuri Luzhkov]] and sponsored by the state-owned oil company [[Rosneft]].  It was unveiled in 2001 amid some controversy. Some Muscovites worried that the graphic imagery would frighten children.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/guest/abramenkova.htm|title="ПАМЯТНИК ПОРОКАМ" ШЕМЯКИНА С ТОЧКИ ЗРЕНИЯ ПСИХОЛОГА (an interview with doctor of psychological sciences Vasilevnoy Abramenkovoy)| last=Shishova| first=Tatiana|date=5 December 2001|publisher=www.pravoslavie.ru|language=Russian|accessdate= 26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemiakin said that, "[The sculpture] ... was conceived and carried out by me as a symbol and a call to fight for the salvation of present and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.log-in.ru/articles/560/|title=The children –  victims of adult vices|last=Darina|first=Nikonov|publisher=www.log-in.ru|language=Russian|accessdate= 26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Bolshevism''' (German: ''Kulturbolschewismus''), sometimes referred to specifically as "'''art Bolshevism'''" or "'''music Bolshevism'''",&lt;ref&gt;Spotts, Frederic. ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics''. Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press (2002). pp.18;24. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a term widely used by critics in [[Nazi Germany]] to denounce [[modernism|modernist]] movements in the arts, particularly when seeking to discredit more [[nihilism|nihilistic]] forms of expression. This first became an issue during the 1920s in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]. German artists such as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Max Beckmann]] were denounced by [[Adolf Hitler]], the [[Nazi Party]] and other [[right-wing]] [[nationalism|nationalists]] as "cultural Bolsheviks".

== History ==
The development of [[modern art]] at the beginning of the 20th century &amp;ndash; but with roots going back to the 1860s &amp;ndash; denoted a revolutionary divergence from traditional artistic values to ones based on the personal perceptions and feelings of the artists.  This rejection of traditional authority &amp;ndash; intimately linked to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the advance of [[democracy]] as the preferred form of government &amp;ndash; was exhilarating to some, but extremely threatening to others, as it took away the security they felt under the old order, and the very cohesiveness of [[Western culture]] and civilization appeared to be in peril.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, H.W. and Janson, Anthony F. ''History of Art'' New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1991. p.615 {{ISBN|0-8109-3401-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modernist break occurred at around the same time as the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, and it was perhaps natural that those who felt threatened by the new artistic viewpoint would associate it with the group that came out on top after that revolution, the [[Bolshevism|Bolsheviks]] with their [[Marxist–Leninist]] political philosophy. In reality, the connection between the modernism and Bolshevism was extremely tenuous, and primarily a matter of both existing at the same unsettled time in European history.  Still, some artists in [[Western Europe]] drew inspiration from revolutionary ideals, to the extent that [[Dada]]ist [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] confidently declared in 1920 that Dada was a "German Bolshevist affair."&lt;ref name="CanningBarndt2013"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Canning|editor-first1=Kathleen|editor-last2=Barndt|editor-first2=Kerstin|editor-last3=McGuire|editor-first3=Kristin|last=Doherty|first=Brigid|title=Weimar Publics/weimar Subjects: Rethinking the Political Culture of Germany in the 1920s|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXP9AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|year=2013|location=New York|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-108-2|page=53|chapter=The Work of Art and the Problem of Politics in Berlin Dada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of new art with Bolshevism circulated in right-wing and nationalist discourse in the following years; it was, for example, the subject of a chapter in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. Amid [[Hitler's rise to power]] the Nazis denounced a number of contemporary styles as "cultural Bolshevism," notably [[abstract art]] and [[Bauhaus]] architecture. After seeing a colleague beaten by Nazi supporters for comments sympathetic to modern art, typographer [[Paul Renner]] published an essay against Nazi aesthetics titled "Kulturbolschewismus?" Around the same time, [[Carl von Ossietzky]] mocked the flexibility of the term in Nazi writings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cultural Bolshevism is when conductor [[Otto Klemperer|[Otto] Klemperer]] takes tempi different from his colleague [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|[Wilhelm] Furtwängler]]; when a painter sweeps a color into his sunset not seen in [[Lower Pomerania]]; when one favors birth control; when one builds a house with a flat roof; when a Caesarean birth is shown on the screen; when one admires the performance of [[Charlie Chaplin|[Charlie] Chaplin]] and the mathematical wizardry of [[Albert Einstein|[Albert] Einstein]]. This is called cultural Bolshevism and a personal favor rendered to Herr [[Stalin]]. It is also the democratic mentality of the brothers [[Heinrich Mann|[Heinrich and Thomas]]] [[Thomas Mann|Mann]], a piece of music by [[Paul Hindemith|[Paul] Hindemith]] or [[Kurt Weill|[Kurt] Weill]], and is to be identified with the hysterical insistence of a madman for a law giving him permission to marry his own grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl von Ossietzky|von Ossietzky, Carl]] in ''Weltbühne'' ("World Stage") (21 April 1931) quoted in Deák, István [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g6cJNfRN0cC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Cultural+Bolshevism+is+when+conductor+Klemperer+takes+tempi+different+from+his+colleague+Furtw%C3%A4ngler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EUnQY_axmJ&amp;sig=a63Fc6kqIdA_lfY0E39ghkUDiZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI4c3nub6VxwIVA6QeCh2NtgtU#v=onepage&amp;q=Cultural%20Bolshevism%20is%20when%20conductor%20Klemperer%20takes%20tempi%20different%20from%20his%20colleague%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler&amp;f=false ''Weimar Germany's Left-wing Intellectuals: A Political History of the Weltbühne and Its Circle'']. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1968. p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once in control of the government, the Nazis moved to suppress modern art styles and to promote art with national and racial themes.&lt;ref name="MichaudLloyd2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michaud|first1=Eric|last2=Lloyd|first2=Janet|title=The Cult of Art in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QR_9T_8VLPAC|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-4327-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[Weimar Germany|Weimar-era]] art personalities, including Renner, Huelsenbeck, and the Bauhaus designers, were marginalized.

{{Continuum mechanics |solid}}

'''Deformation''' in [[continuum mechanics]] is the transformation of a body from a ''reference'' configuration to a ''current'' configuration.&lt;ref name=Truesdell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Truesdell |first1=C. |last2=Noll |first2=W. |year=2004 |title=The non-linear field theories of mechanics |edition=3rd |publisher=Springer |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A configuration is a set containing the positions of all particles of the body.

A  deformation may be caused by [[structural load|external loads]],&lt;ref name=wu&gt;{{cite book|first=H.-C. |last=Wu |title=Continuum Mechanics and Plasticity |publisher=CRC Press |date=2005 |ISBN=1-58488-363-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[body force]]s (such as [[gravity]] or [[electromagnetic force]]s), or changes in temperature, moisture content, or chemical reactions, etc.

Strain is a description of deformation in terms of ''relative'' displacement of particles in the body that excludes rigid-body motions.  Different equivalent choices may be made for the expression of a strain field depending on whether it is defined with respect to the initial or the final configuration of the body and on whether the [[metric tensor]] or its dual is considered.

In a continuous body, a deformation field results from a [[Stress (physics)|stress]] field induced by applied [[force]]s or is due to changes in the temperature field inside the body. The relation between stresses and induced strains is expressed by [[constitutive equations]], e.g., [[Hooke's law]] for [[Linear elasticity|linear elastic]] materials. Deformations which are recovered after the stress field has been removed are called '''elastic deformations'''. In this case, the continuum completely recovers its original configuration. On the other hand, irreversible deformations remain even after stresses have been removed. One type of irreversible deformation is '''plastic deformation''', which occurs in material bodies after stresses have attained a certain threshold value known as the ''elastic limit'' or [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]], and are the result of [[Slip (materials science)|slip]], or [[dislocation]] mechanisms at the atomic level. Another type of irreversible deformation is '''viscous deformation''', which is the irreversible part of [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] deformation.

In the case of elastic deformations, the response function linking strain to the deforming stress is the [[Hooke's law#tensor expression|compliance tensor]] of the material.

==Strain==
{{see also|Stress measures|Strain rate}}
Strain is a measure of deformation representing the displacement between particles in the body relative to a reference length.

A general deformation of a body can be expressed in the form {{math|'''x''' {{=}} '''''F'''''('''X''')}} where {{math|'''X'''}} is the reference position of material points in the body.  Such a measure does not distinguish between rigid body motions (translations and rotations) and changes in shape (and size) of the body.  A deformation has units of length.

We could, for example, define strain to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \doteq \cfrac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{X}}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}\right)
     = \boldsymbol{F}'- \boldsymbol{I},
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|'''I'''}} is the [[Identity matrix|identity tensor]].
Hence strains are dimensionless and are usually expressed as a [[decimal|decimal fraction]], a [[percentage]] or in [[parts-per notation]]. Strains measure how much a given deformation differs locally from a rigid-body deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A strain is in general a [[tensor]] quantity.  Physical insight into strains can be gained by observing that a given strain can be decomposed into normal and shear components.  The amount of stretch or compression along material line elements or fibers is the ''normal strain'', and the amount of distortion associated with the sliding of plane layers over each other is the ''shear strain'', within a deforming body.&lt;ref name=rees&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be applied by elongation, shortening, or volume changes, or angular distortion.&lt;ref&gt;"Earth."Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] .[2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of strain at a [[Continuum mechanics|material point]] of a continuum body is defined as the totality of all the changes in length of material lines or fibers, the ''normal strain'', which pass through that point and also the totality of all the changes in the angle between pairs of lines initially perpendicular to each other, the ''shear strain'', radiating from this point. However, it is sufficient to know the normal and shear components of strain on a set of three mutually perpendicular directions.

If there is an increase in length of the material line, the normal strain is called ''tensile strain'', otherwise, if there is reduction or compression in the length of the material line, it is called ''compressive strain''.

===Strain measures===
Depending on the amount of strain, or local deformation, the analysis of deformation is subdivided into three deformation theories:
* [[Finite strain theory]], also called ''large strain theory'', ''large deformation theory'', deals with deformations in which both rotations and strains are arbitrarily large. In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] are significantly different and a clear distinction has to be made between them. This is commonly the case with [[elastomer]]s, [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically-deforming]] materials and other [[fluid]]s and biological [[soft tissue]].
* [[Infinitesimal strain theory]], also called ''small strain theory'', ''small deformation theory'', ''small displacement theory'', or ''small displacement-gradient theory'' where strains and rotations are both small. In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the body can be assumed identical. The infinitesimal strain theory is used in the analysis of deformations of materials exhibiting [[Deformation (engineering)#Elastic deformation|elastic]] behavior, such as materials found in mechanical and civil engineering applications, e.g. concrete and steel.
* ''Large-displacement'' or ''large-rotation theory'', which assumes small strains but large rotations and displacements.

In each of these theories the strain is then defined differently. The ''engineering strain'' is the most common definition applied to materials used in mechanical and structural engineering, which are subjected to very small deformations. On the other hand, for some materials, e.g. [[elastomers]] and polymers, subjected to large deformations, the engineering definition of strain is not applicable, e.g. typical engineering strains greater than 1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rees| first = David| title = Basic Engineering Plasticity: An Introduction with Engineering and Manufacturing Applications| publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann| year = 2006| page = 41| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4KWbmn_1hcYC| isbn = 0-7506-8025-3| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171222205706/https://books.google.com/books?id=4KWbmn_1hcYC| archivedate = 2017-12-22| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus other more complex definitions of strain are required, such as ''stretch'', ''logarithmic strain'', ''Green strain'', and ''Almansi strain''.

====Engineering strain====
The '''Cauchy strain''' or '''engineering strain''' is expressed as the ratio of total deformation to the initial dimension of the material body in which the forces are being applied. The ''engineering normal strain'' or ''engineering extensional strain'' or ''nominal strain'' {{mvar|e}} of a material line element or fiber axially loaded is expressed as the change in length {{math|Δ''L''}} per unit of the original length {{mvar|L}} of the line element or fibers. The normal strain is positive if the material fibers are stretched and negative if they are compressed. Thus, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ e=\frac{\Delta L}{L}=\frac{l -L}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|e}} is the ''engineering normal strain'', {{mvar|L}} is the original length of the fiber and {{mvar|l}} is the final length of the fiber. Measures of strain are often expressed in parts per million or microstrains.

The ''true shear strain'' is defined as the change in the angle (in radians) between two material line elements initially perpendicular to each other in the undeformed or initial configuration. The ''engineering shear strain'' is defined as the tangent of that angle, and is equal to the length of deformation at its maximum divided by the perpendicular length in the plane of force application which sometimes makes it easier to calculate.

====Stretch ratio====
The '''stretch ratio''' or '''extension ratio''' is a measure of the extensional or normal strain of a differential line element, which can be defined at either the undeformed configuration or the deformed configuration. It is defined as the ratio between the final length {{mvar|l}} and the initial length {{mvar|L}} of the material line.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \lambda=\frac{l}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

The extension ratio is approximately related to the engineering strain by

:&lt;math&gt;\ e=\frac{l-L}{L}=\lambda-1&lt;/math&gt;

This equation implies that the normal strain is zero, so that there is no deformation when the stretch is equal to unity.

The stretch ratio is used in the analysis of materials that exhibit large deformations, such as elastomers, which can sustain stretch ratios of 3 or 4 before they fail. On the other hand, traditional engineering materials, such as concrete or steel, fail at much lower stretch ratios.

====True strain====
The '''logarithmic strain''' {{mvar|ε}}, also called, ''true strain'' or ''Hencky strain'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hencky|first=H.|date=1928|title=Über die Form des Elastizitätsgesetzes bei ideal elastischen Stoffen|url=|journal=Zeitschrift für technische Physik|volume=9|pages=215–220|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Considering an incremental strain (Ludwik)

: &lt;math&gt;\ \delta \varepsilon=\frac{\delta l}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

the logarithmic strain is obtained by integrating this incremental strain:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \begin{align}
\int\delta \varepsilon &amp;=\int_{L}^{l}\frac{\delta l}{l}\\
\varepsilon&amp;=\ln\left(\frac{l}{L}\right)=\ln (\lambda) \\
&amp;=\ln(1+e) \\
&amp;=e-\frac{e^2}{2}+\frac{e^3}{3}- \cdots \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|e}} is the engineering strain. The logarithmic strain provides the correct measure of the final strain when deformation takes place in a series of increments, taking into account the influence of the strain path.&lt;ref name=rees/&gt;

====Green strain====
{{main|Finite strain theory#Finite strain tensors|l1=Finite strain theory}}
The Green strain is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \varepsilon_G=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\frac{l^2-L^2}{L^2}\right)=\tfrac{1}{2}(\lambda^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;

====Almansi strain====
{{main|Finite strain theory#Finite strain tensors|l1=Finite strain theory}}
The Euler-Almansi strain is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \varepsilon_E=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\frac{l^2-L^2}{l^2}\right)=\tfrac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Normal and shear strain===
[[File:2D geometric strain.svg|350px|right|thumb|Two-dimensional geometric deformation of an infinitesimal material element.]]

Strains are classified as either ''normal'' or ''shear''. A ''normal strain'' is perpendicular to the face of an element, and a ''shear strain'' is parallel to it. These definitions are consistent with those of [[normal stress]] and [[shear stress]].

====Normal strain====
For an [[isotropic]] material that obeys [[Hooke's law]], a [[normal stress]] will cause a normal strain. Normal strains produce ''dilations''.

Consider a two-dimensional, infinitesimal, rectangular material element with dimensions {{math|''dx'' × ''dy''}}, which, after deformation, takes the form of a [[rhombus]]. From the geometry of the adjacent figure we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathrm{length}(AB) = dx \,
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{length}(ab) &amp;= \sqrt{\left(dx+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}dx \right)^2} \\
&amp;= dx~\sqrt{1+2\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}+\left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}\right)^2} \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
For very small displacement gradients the squares of the derivatives are negligible and we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{length}(ab)\approx dx +\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx
 &lt;/math&gt;
The normal strain in the {{mvar|x}}-direction of the rectangular element is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \varepsilon_x = \frac{\text{extension}}{\text{original length}} = \frac{\mathrm{length}(ab)-\mathrm{length}(AB)}{\mathrm{length}(AB)}
     = \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the normal strain in the {{mvar|y}}- and {{mvar|z}}-directions becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_y = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} \quad , \qquad  \varepsilon_z = \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

====Shear strain====
{{Infobox Physical quantity
| bgcolour =
| name = Shear strain
| image =
| caption =
| unit = [[dimensionless|1]], or [[radian]]
| symbols = [[Gamma|{{mvar|γ}}]] or [[Epsilon|{{mvar|ε}}]]
| derivations = {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|[[Shear stress|''τ'']]|[[Shear modulus|''G'']]}}}}
}}
The engineering shear strain ({{math|''γ&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;''}}) is defined as the change in angle between lines {{overline|''AC''}} and {{overline|''AB''}}.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \gamma_{xy}= \alpha + \beta\,\!
 &lt;/math&gt;

From the geometry of the figure, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \tan \alpha &amp; =\frac{\tfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}dx}{dx+\tfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx}=\frac{\tfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}}{1+\tfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}} \\
    \tan \beta &amp; =\frac{\tfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}dy}{dy+\tfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}dy}=\frac{\tfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}}{1+\tfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}}
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
For small displacement gradients we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} \ll 1 ~;~~ \cfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} \ll 1
 &lt;/math&gt;
For small rotations, i.e. {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} are ≪ 1 we have {{math|tan ''α'' ≈ ''α''}}, {{math|tan ''β'' ≈ ''β''}}. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \alpha \approx \cfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} ~;~~ \beta \approx \cfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}
 &lt;/math&gt;
thus

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}= \alpha + \beta = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
By interchanging {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} and {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, it can be shown that {{math|''γ&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''γ&lt;sub&gt;yx&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

Similarly, for the {{mvar|yz}}- and {{mvar|xz}}-planes, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{yz}=\gamma_{zy} = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y} \quad , \qquad \gamma_{zx}=\gamma_{xz}= \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The tensorial shear strain components of the infinitesimal strain tensor can then be expressed using the engineering strain definition, {{mvar|γ}}, as

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \varepsilon_{xy} &amp; \varepsilon_{xz} \\
   \varepsilon_{yx} &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \varepsilon_{yz} \\
   \varepsilon_{zx} &amp; \varepsilon_{zy} &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \tfrac12\gamma_{xy} &amp; \tfrac12\gamma_{xz} \\
   \tfrac12\gamma_{yx} &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \tfrac12\gamma_{yz} \\
   \tfrac12\gamma_{zx} &amp; \tfrac12\gamma_{zy} &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Metric tensor===
{{main|Finite strain theory#Deformation tensors in curvilinear coordinates}}
A strain field associated with a displacement is defined, at any point, by the change in length of the [[tangent vector]]s representing the speeds of arbitrarily [[parametrized curves]] passing through that point.  A basic geometric result, due to [[Maurice Fréchet|Fréchet]], [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]], states that, if the lengths of the tangent vectors fulfil the axioms of a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] and the [[parallelogram law]], then the length of a vector is the square root of the value of the [[quadratic form]] associated, by the [[polarization formula]], with a [[positive definite]] [[bilinear map]] called the [[metric tensor]].

==Description of deformation==
Deformation is the change in the metric properties of a continuous body, meaning that a curve drawn in the initial body placement changes its length when displaced to a curve in the final placement. If none of the curves changes length, it is said that a [[rigid body]] displacement occurred.

It is convenient to identify a reference configuration or initial geometric state of the continuum body which all subsequent configurations are referenced from. The reference configuration need not be one the body actually will ever occupy. Often, the configuration at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} is considered the reference configuration, {{math|''κ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''B''')}}. The configuration at the current time {{mvar|t}} is the ''current configuration''.

For deformation analysis, the reference configuration is identified as ''undeformed configuration'', and the current configuration as ''deformed configuration''. Additionally, time is not considered when analyzing deformation, thus the sequence of configurations between the undeformed and deformed configurations are of no interest.

The components {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the position vector {{math|'''X'''}} of a particle in the reference configuration, taken with respect to the reference coordinate system, are called the ''material or reference coordinates''. On the other hand, the components {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the position vector {{math|'''x'''}} of a particle in the deformed configuration, taken with respect to the spatial coordinate system of reference, are called the ''spatial coordinates''

There are two methods for analysing the deformation of a continuum. One description is made in terms of the material or referential coordinates, called [[Continuum mechanics|material description or Lagrangian description]]. A second description is of deformation is made in terms of the spatial coordinates it is called the [[Continuum mechanics|spatial description or Eulerian description]].

There is continuity during deformation of a continuum body in the sense that:
* The material points forming a closed curve at any instant will always form a closed curve at any subsequent time.
* The material points forming a closed surface at any instant will always form a closed surface at any subsequent time and the matter within the closed surface will always remain within.

===Affine deformation===
A deformation is called an affine deformation if it can be described by an [[affine transformation]].  Such a transformation is composed of a [[linear transformation]] (such as rotation, shear, extension and compression) and a rigid body translation.  Affine deformations are also called homogeneous deformations.&lt;ref name=Ogden&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogden|first=R. W.|date=1984|title=Non-linear Elastic Deformations|publisher=Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, an affine deformation has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X},t) = \boldsymbol{F}(t)\cdot\mathbf{X} + \mathbf{c}(t)
 &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''x'''}} is the position of a point in the deformed configuration, {{math|'''X'''}} is the position in a reference configuration, {{mvar|t}} is a time-like parameter, {{mvar|'''F'''}} is the linear transformer and {{math|'''c'''}} is the translation.  In matrix form, where the components are with respect to an orthonormal basis,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{bmatrix}     x_1(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) \\ x_2(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) \\ x_3(X_1,X_2,X_3,t)    \end{bmatrix}
   = \begin{bmatrix}
     F_{11}(t) &amp; F_{12}(t) &amp; F_{13}(t) \\ F_{21}(t) &amp; F_{22}(t) &amp; F_{23}(t) \\ F_{31}(t) &amp; F_{32}(t) &amp; F_{33}(t)
   \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}     X_1 \\ X_2 \\ X_3   \end{bmatrix} +
   \begin{bmatrix}     c_1(t) \\ c_2(t) \\ c_3(t)    \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

The above deformation becomes ''non-affine'' or ''inhomogeneous'' if {{math|'''''F''''' {{=}} '''''F'''''('''X''',''t'')}} or {{math|'''c''' {{=}} '''c'''('''X''',''t'')}}.

===Rigid body motion===
A rigid body motion is a special affine deformation that does not involve any shear, extension or compression.  The transformation matrix {{mvar|'''F'''}} is [[orthogonal matrix|proper orthogonal]] in order to allow rotations but no [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]].

A rigid body motion can be described by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X},t) = \boldsymbol{Q}(t)\cdot\mathbf{X} + \mathbf{c}(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
 \boldsymbol{Q}\cdot\boldsymbol{Q}^T = \boldsymbol{Q}^T \cdot \boldsymbol{Q} = \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
In matrix form,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{bmatrix}     x_1(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) \\ x_2(X_1,X_2,X_3,t) \\ x_3(X_1,X_2,X_3,t)    \end{bmatrix}
   = \begin{bmatrix}
     Q_{11}(t) &amp; Q_{12}(t) &amp; Q_{13}(t) \\ Q_{21}(t) &amp; Q_{22}(t) &amp; Q_{23}(t) \\ Q_{31}(t) &amp; Q_{32}(t) &amp; Q_{33}(t)
   \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}     X_1 \\ X_2 \\ X_3   \end{bmatrix} +
   \begin{bmatrix}     c_1(t) \\ c_2(t) \\ c_3(t)    \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Displacement==
[[File:Displacement of a continuum.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 1. Motion of a continuum body.]]
A change in the configuration of a continuum body results in a [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement]]. The displacement of a body has two components: a rigid-body displacement and a deformation. A rigid-body displacement consists of a simultaneous translation and rotation of the body without changing its shape or size. Deformation implies the change in shape and/or size of the body from an initial or undeformed configuration {{math|''κ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''B''')}} to a current or deformed configuration {{math|''κ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''('''B''')}} (Figure 1).

If after a displacement of the continuum there is a relative displacement between particles, a deformation has occurred. On the other hand, if after displacement of the continuum the relative displacement between particles in the current configuration is zero, then there is no deformation and a rigid-body displacement is said to have occurred.

The vector joining the positions of a particle ''P'' in the undeformed configuration and deformed configuration is called the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]] {{math|'''u'''('''X''',''t'') {{=}} ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the Lagrangian description, or {{math|'''U'''('''x''',''t'') {{=}} ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt;'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the Eulerian description.

A ''displacement field'' is a vector field of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. It is convenient to do the analysis of deformation or motion of a continuum body in terms of the displacement field. In general, the displacement field is expressed in terms of the material coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf b(\mathbf X,t)+\mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = \alpha_{iJ}b_J + x_i - \alpha_{iJ}X_J&lt;/math&gt;

or in terms of the spatial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf b(\mathbf x,t)+\mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = b_J + \alpha_{Ji}x_i - X_J \,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;Ji&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the direction cosines between the material and spatial coordinate systems with unit vectors {{math|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \alpha_{Ji}=\alpha_{iJ}&lt;/math&gt;

and the relationship between {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ u_i=\alpha_{iJ}U_J \qquad \text{or} \qquad U_J=\alpha_{Ji}u_i&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that
:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf e_i = \alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t)=u_i\mathbf e_i=u_i(\alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J)=U_J\mathbf E_J=\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is common to superimpose the coordinate systems for the undeformed and deformed configurations, which results in {{math|'''b''' {{=}} 0}}, and the direction cosines become [[Kronecker delta]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \delta_{Ji}=\delta_{iJ}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = x_i - \delta_{iJ}X_J = x_i - X_i &lt;/math&gt;

or in terms of the spatial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = \delta_{Ji}x_i - X_J =x_J - X_J&lt;/math&gt;

===Displacement gradient tensor===
The partial differentiation of the displacement vector with respect to the material coordinates yields the ''material displacement gradient tensor'' {{math|'''∇&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;U'''}}. Thus we have:

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X},t) &amp; = \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X},t) - \mathbf{X} \\
 \nabla_\mathbf{X}\mathbf{u} &amp; = \nabla_\mathbf{X}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{I} \\
 \nabla_\mathbf{X}\mathbf{u} &amp; = \mathbf{F} - \mathbf{I} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
||      or    
|| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
u_i &amp; = x_i - \delta_{iJ} X_J = x_i - X_i\\
\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_K} &amp; = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_K}-\delta_{iK} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where {{math|'''F'''}} is the ''deformation gradient tensor''.

Similarly, the partial differentiation of the displacement vector with respect to the spatial coordinates yields the ''spatial displacement gradient tensor'' {{math|'''∇&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;U'''}}. Thus we have,

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) &amp;= \mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \\
\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf U &amp;= \mathbf I - \nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf X \\
\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf U &amp;= \mathbf I -\mathbf F^{-1}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
||      or    
|| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
U_J&amp; = \delta_{Ji}x_i-X_J =x_J - X_J\\
\frac{\partial U_J}{\partial x_k} &amp;= \delta_{Jk}-\frac{\partial X_J}{\partial x_k}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Examples of deformations==
Homogeneous (or affine) deformations are useful in elucidating the behavior of materials.  Some homogeneous deformations of interest are
* [[uniform extension]]
* [[pure dilation]]
* [[equibiaxial tension]]
* [[simple shear]]
* [[pure shear]]
Plane deformations are also of interest, particularly in the experimental context.

===Plane deformation===
A plane deformation, also called ''plane strain'', is one where the deformation is restricted to one of the planes in the reference configuration.  If the deformation is restricted to the plane described by the basis vectors {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[deformation gradient]] has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{F} = F_{11}\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_1 + F_{12}\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_2 + F_{21}\mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_1 + F_{22}\mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_2 + \mathbf{e}_3\otimes\mathbf{e}_3
 &lt;/math&gt;
In matrix form,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \begin{bmatrix} F_{11} &amp; F_{12} &amp; 0 \\ F_{21} &amp; F_{22} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the [[polar decomposition theorem]], the deformation gradient, up to a change of coordinates, can be decomposed into a stretch and a rotation.  Since all the deformation is in a plane, we can write&lt;ref name=Ogden/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{R}\cdot\boldsymbol{U} =
     \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta &amp; \sin\theta &amp; 0 \\ -\sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
     \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|θ}} is the angle of rotation and {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the [[finite strain theory|principal stretches]].

====Isochoric plane deformation====
If the deformation is isochoric (volume preserving) then {{math|det('''''F''''') {{=}} 1}} and we have
:&lt;math&gt;
    F_{11} F_{22} - F_{12} F_{21} = 1
 &lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \lambda_1\lambda_2 = 1
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Simple shear====
A [[simple shear]] deformation is defined as an isochoric plane deformation in which there is a set of line elements with a given reference orientation that do not change length and orientation during the deformation.&lt;ref name=Ogden/&gt;

If {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the fixed reference orientation in which line elements do not deform during the deformation then {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} and {{math|'''''F'''''·'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_{11}\mathbf{e}_1 + F_{21}\mathbf{e}_2 = \mathbf{e}_1 \quad \implies \quad F_{11} = 1 ~;~~ F_{21} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since the deformation is isochoric,
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_{11} F_{22} - F_{12} F_{21} = 1 \quad \implies \quad F_{22} = 1
 &lt;/math&gt;
Define
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma := F_{12}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Then, the deformation gradient in simple shear can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Now,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F}\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 = F_{12}\mathbf{e}_1 + F_{22}\mathbf{e}_2 = \gamma\mathbf{e}_1 + \mathbf{e}_2
   \quad \implies \quad
   \boldsymbol{F}\cdot(\mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_2) = \gamma\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_2 + \mathbf{e}_2\otimes\mathbf{e}_2
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_i = \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}&lt;/math&gt;
we can also write the deformation gradient as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}} +  \gamma\mathbf{e}_1\otimes\mathbf{e}_2
 &lt;/math&gt;

{{about|the general concept of design reviews|Design Reviews in [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] and [[NASA]]|Design review (US Government)}}

A '''design review''' is a milestone within a [[product development]] process whereby a [[design]] is evaluated against its [[requirements analysis|requirements]] in order to verify the outcomes of previous activities and identify issues before committing to - and if need to be re-prioritise - further work. The ultimate design review, if successful, therefore triggers the product launch or product release.

The conduct of design reviews is compulsory as part of [[design controls]], when developing products in certain regulated contexts such as [[medical devices]].

By definition, a review must include persons who are external to the design team.

==Contents of a design review==
In order to evaluate a [[design]] against its requirements, a number of means may be considered, such as:
*Physical tests.
*Engineering simulations.
*Examinations (Walk-through).

==Timing of design reviews==
Most formalised [[systems engineering process]]es recognise that the cost of correcting a fault increases as it progresses through the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|development process]].  Additional effort spent in the early stages of development to discover and correct errors is therefore likely to be worthwhile.  Design reviews are example of such an effort.
Therefore, a number of design reviews may be carried out, for example to evaluate the design against different sets of criteria (consistency, [[usability]], ease of [[language localisation|localisation]], environmental) or during various stages of the design process.

Kaajal Ahuja writes that the graffiti "Get Out" written on the walls of a Hindu temple in [[Bothell, Washington|Bothelo]] about an hour's drive south of Bellingham, brought back what she calls "painful memories (of the incidents of the early decades of the 20th century such as the eponymous feature article)" for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://swarajyamag.com/world/hindus-get-out|title=Hindus “Get Out”|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shefali Chandan writing in Jano conjectures that the emotions behind the circumstances that led to the [[ethnic cleansing]] of [[Bellingham riots|Bellingham in 1907]], in which white mobs went door to door to locate Indian immigrants and forced their expulsion, resulting in the entire community numbering about 200 leaving the town for good, found expression in the feature article written less than a year ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://janoed.com/dusky-peril-trade-unions-organize-keep-indians-america-simmering-tensions-erupt-bellingham-washington-c-1907/|title=A "Dusky Peril": Trade Unions Resent Indian Labor - Jano|date=2017-03-03|work=Jano|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elephant hunting''', which used to be an accepted activity '''in Kenya''', was banned in 1973, as was the [[ivory trade]]. Illegal hunting continues, as there is still international demand for [[elephant tusks]]. [[Kenya]] pioneered the [[destruction of ivory]] as a way to combat this [[black market]]. [[Elephant]] [[poaching]] continues to pose a threat to the population.

==Colonial Kenya==
During colonial times, elephant hunting in Kenya was seen as a sport for noblemen and was exploited by the colonial governors.&lt;ref name="History1915"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Museum of Natural History|title=The American Museum journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66seAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 May 2011|year=1915|publisher=American Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British East Africa]] was not unique in this: [[big-game hunting]] was popular in many parts of [[British Empire|the Empire]]. Among the [[white hunter]]s, the bull elephant was said to be the most exhilarating target. Small-bore [[rifle]]s appeared to be the preferred option and aiming at the brain instead of the heart was another preference. The motive was not always monetary. However, many hunters were indiscriminate in their choice of elephants to kill – young, old, male or female, it did not matter, as the primary purpose was ivory to sell and [[elephant meat]] to feed their hunting party.&lt;ref name="Steinhart2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinhart|first=Edward I.|title=Black poachers, white hunters: a social history of hunting in colonial Kenya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXaP-eY493cC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=6 May 2011|year=2006|publisher=James Currey|isbn=978-0-85255-960-4|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[East African Professional Hunter's Association]] was formed to regulate the industry and restrict its excesses. The Association, which came into being at the [[Fairmont The Norfolk Hotel|Norfolk Hotel]], Nairobi, stemmed from a desire to regulate hunting in the wake of technological developments like the safari vehicle, which had made accessing remote hunting areas much easier. During its existence it was able to accomplish much to conserve East African wildlife and become perhaps one of the most respected societies in the world of its kind.&lt;ref name=herne167&gt;{{cite book |title=White Hunters: The Golden Age of African Safaris |last=Herne |first=Brian |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC |location=New York |isbn= |page=167 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One of the most prolific of the white hunters was the Scottish adventurer [[W. D. M. Bell]], who is reported to have killed over a thousand elephants, spread across several African countries. &lt;ref name="Barclay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Edgar N|title=Big Game Shooting Records 1931|publisher=HF&amp;G Witherby|chapter=Chapter One - correspondence with WDM Bell and author}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the first of his memoirs, ''The Wanderings of an Elephant Hunter'' (1923), for more information. Some of the madness of the desire to shoot an elephant (albeit not in Kenya) is shown in ''[[White Hunter Black Heart]]'', a fictionalised version of what happened during the filming of the Hollywood classic ''[[The African Queen (film)|African Queen]]''.

In 1963, the [[History_of_Kenya#Independence|first year of independence]], the [[government of Kenya|Kenyan government]] issued 393 permits ([[hunting license]]s) for elephants.&lt;ref name="McNickle2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=McNickle|first=Dan|title=Teaching and Hunting in East Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdSHVaGcCwsC&amp;pg=PT275|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=19 March 2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4120-1935-4|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1950s and 1960s, the Kenyan poacher received approximately Shs. 3-4/lb ($.79–1.05/kg); by the 1970s, it was Shs. 100/kg ($12.74/kg), increasing the black market value for the primary producer from about one-fifth to one-third of the real value.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas-Hamilton, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ban, and ivory smuggling==
According to the American hunter [[Craig Boddington]], elephant hunting was made illegal in Kenya in 1973 and all animal hunting without a permit in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsafield.com/notes-from-afield/africas-elephant-explosion|title=Africa's elephant explosion|publisher=Sportsafield|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the late 1970s, the elephant population was estimated around 275,000, dropping to 20,000 in 1989.&lt;ref name="ifaw.org2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/Publications/Program_Publications/Elephants/asset_upload_file236_12046.pdf |title=Elephants on the High Street |date=March 2004 |publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfare |pages=18 |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928081306/http://www.ifaw.org/Publications/Program_Publications/Elephants/asset_upload_file236_12046.pdf |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 1977, Kenya lost more than half of its elephants.&lt;ref name="savetheelephants.org1979"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:aVmYNQzzD6wJ:www.savetheelephants.org/files/pdf/publications/1979%2520Douglas-Hamilton%2520African%2520Elephant%2520Ivory%2520Trade%2520Study.pdf+kenya+elephant+ivory&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjXA_YT_db_nctmmbthPos3ND898AdycIwZxSwqAQrLb1EIJtiFy256vXYlu78njDGIelvBtUYi8MCWD2QDoME2zD-lemLDTFdcthjgS-0H2z4G-GbaepaVoeawZDsvloI2C8Ix&amp;sig=AHIEtbRtWTmA6gOHe3MIqyQSFH3bpPFppg|title=AFRICAN ELEPHANT IVORY TRADE STUDY  FINAL REPORT|first=I. |last=Douglas-Hamilton|date=August 1979|work=savetheelephants.org|pages=19|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, [[Ngina Kenyatta]] (Mama Ngina), wife of then-President [[Jomo Kenyatta]], and other high-level government officials were allegedly involved in an ivory-smuggling ring that transported tusks out of the country in the state private aeroplane.&lt;ref name="Information1975"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Scientist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zE74f2fU1iwC&amp;pg=PA452|accessdate=8 May 2011|date=22 May 1975|publisher=Reed Business Information|page=452|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonner1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonner|first=Raymond|title=At the hand of man: peril and hope for Africa's wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXfwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1993|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-40008-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Society1980"&gt;{{cite book|title=Animal kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAEdAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1980|publisher=New York Zoological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wieland2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Munger1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munger|first=Edwin S.|title=Touched by Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06MMAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=1983|publisher=Castle Press|isbn=978-0-934912-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''New Scientist'' claimed that there was now documentary proof that at least one member of "Kenya's royal family" (the Kenyatta) had shipped over six tons of ivory to China.&lt;ref name="Information1975"/&gt; 

In the 1970s, 1900 elephants were killed in Kenya for their ivory tusks, increasing to 8300 elephants in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Lowery1997" /&gt;

==The worldwide ban on ivory trade==

In 1989, as a dramatic gesture to persuade the world to halt the ivory trade, President [[Daniel arap Moi]] [[Destruction_of_ivory#Kenya_and_the_first_fire|ignited twelve tons of elephant tusks]].&lt;ref name="Perlez1989"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/19/world/kenya-in-gesture-burns-ivory-tusks.html|title=KENYA, IN GESTURE, BURNS IVORY TUSKS|last=Perlez|first=Jane|date=July 19, 1989|publisher=[[The New York Times]]  |accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1990s the widespread ban on commercial ivory trading reduced the industry to a fraction of what it had been and elephant populations have stabilised.&lt;ref name="Wieland2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieland|first=Terry|title=A view from a tall hill: Robert Ruark in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CflNHBquJWAC&amp;pg=PA411|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=25 March 2004|publisher=Down East Enterprise Inc|isbn=978-0-89272-650-9|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; But illegal poaching and sale on the black market still poses a serious threat, as does government bribery. The largest poaching incident in Kenya since the ivory trade ban occurred in March 2002, when a family of ten elephants was killed.&lt;ref name="ifaw.org2004" /&gt;

Illegal elephant deaths decreased between 1990, when the [[CITES]] ban was issued, and 1997, when only 34 were illegally killed.&lt;ref name="Lowery1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/poach.htm|title=ICE Case Studies - CASE NUMBER: 33 - CASE MNEMONIC: POACH  - CASE NAME: Ivory Poaching |first=N. |last=Lowery |date=December 1997|publisher=[[American University]]|accessdate=9 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505054639/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/poach.htm |archive-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory seizures rose dramatically since 2006 with many illegal exports going to Asia.&lt;ref name="cnn.com2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-06/world/kenya.illegal.ivory_1_illegal-ivory-elephant-tusks-kenyan-elephants?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Kenya finds Illegal ivory in boxes disguised as diplomatic baggage |date=May 6, 2011 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513075330/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-06/world/kenya.illegal.ivory_1_illegal-ivory-elephant-tusks-kenyan-elephants?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poaching spiked seven-fold between 2007 and 2010.&lt;ref name="Straziuso2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37167109/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/ivory-trade-threatens-african-elephant/|title=Ivory trade threatens African elephant |last=Straziuso|first=Jason |author2=Michael Casey |author3=William Foreman |date=2010-05-15|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Large scale tourism promotion picked up in Kenya following the imposed hunting ban in Kenya since 1977. It has been noted that "photographic tourism", or non-consumptive wildlife use, [[Tourism in Kenya|is contributing 12% of Kenya’s GDP]]. Hence, some groups have recommended that tourism be promoted rather than any kind of hunting or consumptive wildlife use, as it could divert the attention of the government of Kenya from the policy goal of wildlife preservation.&lt;ref name=sport&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bornfree.org.uk/campaigns/further-activities/trophy-hunting/|title=Shooting animals for ‘sport’|accessdate=8 May 2011|publisher=Bornfree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Internet Archive Digital Library"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arkell-Hardwick|first1=Alfred|title=An ivory trader in North Kenia|date=1903|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/ivorytraderinnor00hard|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The current situation, including safari tourism==
[[File:Elephant576.JPG|thumb|An elephant skull with tusk removed by poachers near [[Voi]], [[Taita-Taveta District]].]]

Though elephant hunting has been banned for a 40-year period in Kenya, poaching has not reduced. Given the poverty of many of the people, and the high value of elephant tusks, they are shipped overseas and sold on the black market. Although Kenya has many national parks and reserves protecting wildlife, elephant populations are still at risk, a problem which is made worse by corruption and some officials supplementing their income with permitting poaching.&lt;ref name="AndersonGrove1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=David|last2=Grove|first2=Richard H.|title=Conservation in Africa: Peoples, Policies and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oclQ6rHRJAYC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=25 May 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-34990-1|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan government has attempted to crack down on elephant poaching with the aid of multi-nationals but has often been too late in preventing the poaching of many elephants whose tusks have been seized ''en masse'' in cases at [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport|Nairobi Airport]] and in [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Bangkok Airport]] where Kenyan tusks have often been imported.

Arrests continue at Nairobi's international airport, where 92 kilos{{clarify|reason=kilograms?|date=March 2014}} of raw ivory were seized in 2010, and 96 kilos{{clarify|reason=kilograms?|date=March 2014}} in 2011.&lt;ref name="voanews.com2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/04/29/kenya-seizes-traveler-carrying-elephant-ivory/ |title=Kenya Seizes Traveler Carrying Elephant Ivory |date=April 29, 2010 |publisher=Voice of America News |accessdate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506152540/http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/04/29/kenya-seizes-traveler-carrying-elephant-ivory/ |archivedate=6 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual case that received publicity in 2014 was the death of [[Satao (elephant)|Satao]], one of the world's largest elephants, in the [[Tsavo Trust]]. Despite [[Kenya Wildlife Service]] guards, poachers managed to shoot the bull with a poisoned arrows and cut off his tusks.

==Possible trophy hunting in the future==
[[Trophy hunting]], purely as sport and as a conservation action, is now being considered for adoption in Kenya, as such a programme appears to have yielded positive results in Namibia and South Africa under a programme titled "Community-Based Natural Resource Management" (CBNRM). Under this programme, while cash was offered as an incentive for sport hunting, the basic aim was wildlife control on the communal land, providing benefits to the community as a whole.&lt;ref name=trophy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conservationfinance.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/elephant-hunting/ |title=Elephant Hunting |accessdate=7 May 2011 |publisher=Conservation Finance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813225940/http://conservationfinance.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/elephant-hunting/ |archivedate=13 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed{{By whom|date=October 2011}} that trophy hunting might attract elephant poachers into moving into legal hunting and leaving elephant trading.

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s (FAO) report states: "Trophy hunting is generally self-regulating because low off-take is required to ensure high trophy quality and marketability in future seasons. Trophy hunting creates crucial financial incentives for the development and/or retention of wildlife as a land use over large areas in Africa, including in areas where ecotourism is not viable. Hunting plays an important role in the rehabilitation of degraded wildlife areas by enabling the income generation from wildlife without affecting population growth of trophy species."&lt;ref name=hunting&gt;{{Cite web|url=fttp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/aj114e/aj114e09.pdf|format=pdf|title=Trophy Hunting In Sub Saharan Africa: Economic Scale and Conservation Significance|accessdate=7 May 2011|publisher=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of trophy hunting has been adopted in 23 sub-Saharan African countries. The income generated in total in Africa is quoted to be USD 201 million/year, derived from about 18,500 international hunting clients covering an area of 1.4 million km².&lt;ref name=hunting/&gt; Since there is a lack of consensus among the clients about the efficacy of this method of biodiversity conservation in Africa, a study carried out by the [[Africa Wildlife Conservation Fund]] indicates that if Kenya makes trophy hunting legal again, nearly 90% of the clients would be interested to pursue this activity in that country. In this context, the importance of effective regulation of hunting operators and clients has also been highlighted.&lt;ref name=fund&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/Research_Team_at_African_Wildl/Romanach_Pubs/Potential%20of%20trophy%20hunting.pdf |format=pdf |title=Potential of trophy hunting to create incentives for wildlife conservation in Africa where alternative wildlife-based land uses may not be viable |pages=283, 286–287, 289 |accessdate=8 May 2011 |publisher=Africa Wildlife Conservation Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517024606/http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/Research_Team_at_African_Wildl/Romanach_Pubs/Potential%20of%20trophy%20hunting.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the disadvantages of trophy hunting is the possible publicity backlash, such as [[Zimbabwe]] experienced with the [[killing of Cecil the lion]].

'''Fleming's left-hand rule for electric motors''' is one of a pair of visual [[mnemonic]]s, the other being [[Fleming's right-hand rule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

When current flows through a conducting wire, and an external magnetic field is applied across that flow, the conducting wire experiences a force perpendicular both to that field and to the direction of the current flow (i.e they are mutually perpendicular) . A left hand can be held, as shown in the illustration, so as to represent three mutually orthogonal axes on the thumb, fore finger and middle finger. Each finger is then assigned to a quantity (mechanical force, magnetic field and electric current). The right and left hand are used for generators and motors respectively.

==Conventions==
* The direction of the mechanical force is the literal one
* The direction of the magnetic field is from north to south.
* The direction of the electric current is that of [[conventional current]]: from positive to negative.

===First variant===
* The '''Th'''u''m''b represents the direction of the '''Th'''rust on the conductor / ''M''otion of the Conductor
* The '''F'''ore finger represents the direction of the magnetic '''F'''ield
* The '''C'''entre finger represents the direction of the '''C'''urrent.

===Second variant===
* The Thu'''m'''b represents the direction of '''M'''otion resulting from the force on the conductor
* The '''F'''irst finger represents the direction of the magnetic '''F'''ield
* The Se'''c'''ond finger represents the direction of the '''C'''urrent.

===Third variant===
[[Robert J. Van de Graaff|Van de Graaff's]] translation of Fleming's rules is the FBI rule, easily remembered because these are the initials of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

===Fourth variant (FBI)===
* The '''F'''(Thumb) represents the direction of Force of the conductor
* The '''B'''(Forefinger) represents the direction of the Magnetic field
* The '''I'''(Centre finger) represents the direction of the Current.

This uses the conventional symbolic parameters of F (for [[Lorentz force]]), B (for [[magnetic flux density]]) and I (for [[electric current]]), and attributing them in that order (FBI) respectively to the thumb, first finger and second finger.
* The thumb is the force, F
* The first finger is the magnetic flux density, B
* The second finger is the electric current, I.

Of course, if the mnemonic is taught (and remembered) with a different arrangement of the parameters to the fingers, it could end up as a mnemonic that also reverses the roles of the two hands (instead of the standard left hand for motors, right hand for generators). These variants are catalogued more fully on the [[FBI mnemonics]] page.

=== Fifth variant (Fire the field, feel the force and kill the current) ===
This approach to remembering which finger represents which quantity uses some actions.  First of all you need to point your fingers like a pretend gun, with the index finger acting as the barrel of the gun and the thumb acting as the hammer. Then go through the following actions:

* "Fire the field" out through your index finger 
* "Feel the force" of the gun recoil up through your thumb 
* Finally you display your middle finger as you "kill the current"

==Distinction between the right-hand and left-hand rule==
[[Image:RightHandOutline.png|Fleming's right-hand rule|thumb|300px]]
Fleming's left-hand rule is used for [[electric motor]]s, while Fleming's right-hand rule is used for electric [[Electric generator|generators]].

Different hands need to be used for motors and generators because of the differences between cause and effect. 

In an electric motor, the electric current and magnetic field exist (which are the causes), and they lead to the force that creates the motion (which is the effect), and so the left hand rule is used. In an electric generator, the motion and magnetic field exist (causes), and they lead to the creation of the electric current (effect), and so the right hand rule is used.

To illustrate why, consider that many types of electric motors can also be used as electric generators. A vehicle powered by such a motor can be accelerated up to high speed by connecting the motor to a fully charged [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. If the motor is then disconnected from the fully charged battery, and connected instead to a completely flat battery, the vehicle will decelerate.  The motor will act as a generator and convert the vehicle's [[kinetic energy]] back to [[electrical energy]], which is then stored in the battery. Since neither the direction of motion nor the direction of the magnetic field (inside the motor/generator) has changed, the direction of the electric current in the motor/generator has reversed.  This follows from the [[second law of thermodynamics]] (the generator current must oppose the motor current, and the stronger current outweighs the other to allow the energy to flow from the more energetic source to the less energetic source).

The rule for motors can be recalled by remembering that "motors drive on the left in Britain". The rule for generators can be recalled by remembering that either the letters "g" and "r" is common to both "right" and "generator", or the phrase "Jenny is always right" ("Genny" being a common shortened version of Generator).

==Physical basis for the rules==
[[File:Manoderecha.svg|thumb|Prediction of direction of flux density (''B''), given that the current ''I'' flows in the direction of the thumb.]]

When electrons, or any [[charged particle]]s, flow in the same direction (for example, as an [[electric current]] in an [[electrical conductor]], such as a [[metal]] [[wire]]) they generate a cylindrical [[magnetic field]] that wraps round the conductor (as discovered by [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]). 

The direction of the induced magnetic field is sometimes remembered by ''Maxwell's corkscrew rule''. That is, if the conventional current is flowing away from the viewer, the magnetic field runs clockwise round the conductor, in the same direction that a [[corkscrew]] would have to turn in order to move away from the viewer. The direction of the induced magnetic field is also sometimes remembered by the [[right-hand grip rule]], as depicted in the illustration, with the thumb showing the direction of the conventional current, and the fingers showing the direction of the magnetic field. The existence of this magnetic field can be confirmed by placing magnetic compasses at various points round the periphery of an electrical conductor that is carrying a relatively large electric current.

If an external magnetic field is applied horizontally, so that it crosses the flow of electrons (in the wire conductor, or in the electron beam), the two magnetic fields will interact. [[Michael Faraday]] introduced a visual analogy for this, in the form of imaginary magnetic [[lines of force]]: those in the conductor form concentric circles round the conductor; those in the externally applied magnetic field run in parallel lines. If those on one side of the conductor are running (from the north to south magnetic pole) in the opposite direction to those surrounding the conductor, they will be deflected so that they pass on the other side the conductor (because magnetic lines of force cannot cross or run contrary to each other). Consequently, there will be a large number of magnetic field lines in a small space on that side of the conductor, and a dearth of them on the original side of the conductor. Since the magnetic field lines of force are no longer straight lines, but curved to run around the electrical conductor, they are under tension (like stretched elastic bands), with energy bound up in the magnetic field. Since this energetic field is now mostly unopposed, its build-up or expulsion in one direction creates — in a manner analogous to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] — a force in the opposite direction. Since there is only one moveable object in this system (the electrical conductor) for this force to work upon, the net effect is a physical force working to expel the electrical conductor out of the externally applied magnetic field in the direction opposite to that which the magnetic flux is being redirected to — in this case (motors), if the conductor is carrying conventional current ''upwards'', and the external magnetic field is moving ''away from'' the viewer, the physical force will work to push the conductor to the '''left'''. This is the reason for [[torque]] in an electric motor. (The electric motor is then constructed so that the expulsion of the conductor out of the magnetic field causes it be placed inside the next magnetic field, and for this switching to be continued indefinitely.)

Faraday's Law: the induced [[electromotive force]] in a conductor is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux in the conductor.

== Perspectives on future orientation ==
There are several different ways that future orientation has been observed and measured in [[research]]. The most prominent constructs include possible selves, [[optimism]], time perspective, [[Delay-discounting|delay discounting]]. While different in definition, all of these constructs are thought to tap into and impact how people think and plan for the future. Despite the many different ways that future orientation is investigated and measured, there is evidence that a hopeful and purposeful sense of the future is associated with positive outcomes.&lt;ref name=pmid23336772/&gt;&lt;ref name=inist19784309/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt;

=== Possible selves ===
The collection of self-representations or [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] that someone has about their self is referred to as their [[self-concept]], and this is formed based on past experiences and expectations about the future. Forming a self-concept about themselves in the future is referred to as possible selves. The research on possible selves, which includes positive or negative views of the self in the future, explains that the way that youth think of themselves in the future can guide and determine current behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0092-6566(03)00057-6|url=https://zenodo.org/record/997609 |title=Possible selves as roadmaps |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=130–49 |year=2004 |last1=Oyserman |first1=Daphna |last2=Bybee |first2=Deborah |last3=Terry |first3=Kathy |last4=Hart-Johnson |first4=Tamera }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, thinking of oneself in a desirable place in the future is motivating in two ways. First, it motivates individuals to work towards their desired future-self by doing things that help them reach their end goals. Secondly, individuals may also be motivated to avoid behaviors that can reduce the chances of reaching their desired self by compromising their goals. Hoped-for selves and feared selves impact future goals and aspirations. Through this, people can imagine the type of person they will become in the future.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

=== Optimism ===
[[Optimism]] is thought to be a broader form of [[hope]], that describes more generally positive [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectations]] for the future. This is typically measured in research using [[Survey methodology|surveys]] that include items like "I always look at the bright side of things". Optimism is typically examined with [[pessimism]], and is thought to be a trait that is consistent over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4029106 |year=1985 |author1=Scheier |first1=M. F. |title=Optimism, coping, and health: Assessment and implications of generalized outcome expectancies |journal=Health Psychology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=219–47 |last2=Carver |first2=C. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism has a strong influence on future orientation because optimistic people generally have positive expectations for their future and believe things will happen in their favour.&lt;ref name=pmid23855961&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/sltb.12044 |pmid=23855961 |title=The Role of Hope and Optimism in Suicide Risk for American Indians/Alaska Natives |journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=621–33 |year=2013 |last1=O'Keefe |first1=Victoria M. |last2=Wingate |first2=Laricka R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time perspective ===
Another way in which future orientation has been conceptualized is through time perspective. This line of research similarly focuses on how current behavior is not only determined by the present, but also the past and the future, because the past and future are present at a cognitive level. Two related components of the time perspective framework are time attitude and time orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future time perspective and motivation: Theory and research method |last=Nuttin |first=Joseph |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-89859-611-3 |location=New York }}{{pn|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time attitude'' refers to a person's negative or positive attitudes toward the past, present and future. ''Time orientation'' refers to the direction (i.e., past, present, or future) that most commonly motivates a person's behavior and thinking. Using this framework, studies have shown that people who focus on the past are more likely to have adverse [[mental health]] outcomes, those who focus on the present take more risks, and those who focus on the future are more [[Conscientiousness|conscientious]], plan, and consider future consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-07368-2_2 |chapter=Putting Time in Perspective: A Valid, Reliable Individual-Differences Metric |title=Time Perspective Theory; Review, Research and Application |pages=17–55 |year=2015 |last1=Zimbardo |first1=Philip G. |last2=Boyd |first2=John N. |isbn=978-3-319-07367-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delay discounting ===
Extending from the research on [[executive functioning]], [[Delay-discounting|delay discounting]] is defined as the extent to which a person prefers an immediate reward of less value compared to a delayed reward of more value.&lt;ref name=pmid24523304/&gt; The task that is used to measure delay discounting is a behavioral [[decision-making]] task in which people are asked to choose between an immediate reward of less value (e.g., $400 today) and a variety of delayed rewards of more value (e.g., $700 1 month from now or $800 six months from now).&lt;ref name=pmid19236391/&gt; How well someone performs on this task has been linked to development of [[brain regions]], specifically the [[Prefrontal lobe|pre-frontal lobe]], that are responsible for a person's reactions to rewards and punishments, and resistance to [[Impulse (psychology)|impulses]]. Delay discounting is used as a measure of future orientation because people need to be able to be motivated to work and plan in the present to receive the reward or reach their goal. It also provides a behavioral and neurological basis for future orientation.

== Conceptual frameworks ==

=== Thematic approach ===
This approach to understanding future orientation focuses on the content and [[Theme (linguistics)|themes]] individuals and groups refer to when they think about the future. This may be understood as the "cognitive representation" of the future, focusing on the specific images or domains that fill thoughts about the future. This approach of measuring future orientation gained popularity beginning in the 1980s. Traditionally, this would be measured by asking people to list their hopes and fears for the future through open-ended questions or questionnaires, which are then grouped into life domains (e.g., education, work and career, etc.). Due to the descriptive nature of this approach, the thematic approach has been particularly helpful in determining group differences in future orientation, such as [[gender]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00288058 |title=Adolescents' orientation toward the future: Sex role differentiation in a sociocultural context |journal=Sex Roles |volume=18-18 |issue=11–12 |pages=739–57 |year=1988 |last1=Seginer |first1=Rachel }}&lt;/ref&gt; lower and middle class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420100304 |title=Future orientation of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized delinquents and nondelinquents |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=247–78 |year=1980 |last1=Trommsdorff |first1=Gisela |last2=Lamm |first2=Helmut }}&lt;/ref&gt; younger and older adolescents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3434411 |year=1987 |author1=Nurmi |first1=J. E. |title=Age, sex, social class, and quality of family interaction as determinants of adolescents' future orientation: A developmental task interpretation |journal=Adolescence |volume=22 |issue=88 |pages=977–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid24277319&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02138916 |pmid=24277319 |title=Orientations to the future: A comparison of adolescents in Australia and Singapore |journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=129–51 |year=1987 |last1=Poole |first1=Millicent E. |last2=Cooney |first2=George H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00207599508246575 |title=Tracks and transitions-A comparison of adolescent future-oriented goals, explorations, and commitments in australia, israel, and finland |journal=International Journal of Psychology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=355–75 |year=1995 |last1=Nurmi |first1=Jari-Erik |last2=Poole |first2=Millicent E. |last3=Seginer |first3=Rachel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Core and culture-specific domains ====
Through the thematic approach, core and culture-specific domains of future orientation have been identified. Despite different physical conditions, cultural orientations, and beliefs about adult roles, people growing up in different [[Social environment|socio-cultural]] settings relate to a common core of four prospective life domains: [[education]], work and [[career]], marriage and family, and self concerns. Beyond these, people build their future according to the norms, values and life conditions in which they live (i.e., social context where they are from). For example, the [[Individualism|individualistic]] orientations and economic comfort of Western societies is reflected in how [[Australian]] adolescents commonly list [[leisure]] activities,&lt;ref name=pmid24277319/&gt; [[Germany|German]] adolescents include [[Materialism|material]] comfort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trommsdorff |first=Gisela |chapter=Group influences on judgments concerning the future |pages=145–65 |title=Studies in Decision Making: Social, Psychological, and Socio-Economic Analyses |editor1-first=Martin |editor1-last=Irle |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1982 |isbn=978-3-11-008087-2 |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Finland|Finnish]] adolescents list property and leisure activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0140-1971(91)90044-R |pmid=2050865 |title=The changing parent-child relationship, self-esteem, and intelligence as determinants of orientation to the future during early adolescence |journal=Journal of Adolescence |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=35–51 |year=1991 |last1=Nurmi |first1=Jari-Erik |last2=Pulliainen |first2=Harry }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific country regulation, such as mandatory [[military service]] for Israeli [[Jews|Jewish]] girls and boys and [[Druze in Israel|Druze]] boys, are also reflected in the lists of adolescents from different cultures.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt; Israeli Arab and Druze adolescents, growing up in societies that endorse [[Family oriented|family-oriented]] and [[Collectivism|collectivist]] values, also list others (i.e., family members) and the collective/community (i.e., my village, country, nation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0147-1767(98)00010-8 |title=Adolescent passage to adulthood: Future orientation in the context of culture, age, and gender |journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=309–28 |year=1998 |last1=Seginer |first1=Rachel |last2=Halabi-Kheir |first2=Hoda }}&lt;/ref&gt; on their list of hopes and fears for the future.

=== Component approach ===

==== Three processes model of future orientation ====
This [[Social influence|seminal]] model of future orientation is a three-component model including motivation, planning and evaluation.&lt;ref name=pmid23336772/&gt;&lt;ref name=inist19784309/&gt; [[Motivation]] refers to interests expressed by the goals the individuals set for themselves, [[planning]] refers to the plans and activities the individual will use to reach their goals, and [[evaluation]] refers to the individual's [[anticipation]] of successfully meeting these goals (i.e., [[optimism]]). Nurmi's&lt;ref name=pmid23336772/&gt;&lt;ref name=inist19784309/&gt; model focuses primarily on the cognitive representation of anticipated events, can be applied generally to all domains (e.g., education, work and career goals).

This model also generally applies to different life domains and includes three components that act as steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0743558400153001 |title=Defensive Pessimism and Optimism Correlates of Adolescent Future Orientation: A Domain-Specific Analysis |journal=Journal of Adolescent Research |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=307–26 |year=2000 |last1=Seginer |first1=Rachel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seginer |first1=Rachel |chapter=Adolescent Future Orientation: Intergenerational Transmission and Intertwining Tactics in Cultural and Family Settings |pages=208–29 |chapterurl={{Google books|Dx15AgAAQBAJ|page=208|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-last=Friedlmeier |editor1-first=Wolfgang |editor2-last=Chakkarath |editor2-first=Pradeep |editor3-last=Schwarz |editor3-first=Beate |year=2005 |title=Culture and Human Development: The Importance of Cross-Cultural Research for the Social Sciences |location=Hoboken |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-135-42093-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three components of future orientation include: [[motivation]]al, [[Cognition|cognitive]], and [[behavior]]al. ''Motivational component:'' Relates to the question of what makes people think about the future? Three variables have been suggested to impact this motivation: 1) the [[Value (ethics)|value]] of the considered life domain, the importance and relevance the individual gives to a domain (i.e., higher education, family life); 2) [[Expectancy-value theory|expectancy]]/confidence of hopes, goals and plans occurring and optimism towards these outcomes; 3) internal control is the extent to which the individual believes they have the [[Power (social and political)|power]] to control what happens to them. ''Cognitive component:'' How often a person thinks about their future in terms of different domains (i.e., [[higher education]], work or career) and how the person relates to these domains in either an [[Approach-avoidance conflict|approach]] (i.e., hopes) or [[Approach-avoidance conflict|avoidance]] (i.e., fears) manner.&amp;nbsp;''Behavioral component:'' Exploration of future options by seeking advice, gathering information, and evaluating their suitability for this goal based on personality and life circumstances. Commitment refers to the extent to which the individual has made up their mind and are pursuing a specific goal.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

==== Conceptual framework of Johnson, Blum, and Cheng (2014) ====
A third framework proposed was intended to take on an all encompassing approach to describing future orientation, specifically including [[Human development (biology)|developmental]] and [[Social environment|environmental]] factors.&lt;ref name=pmid24523304/&gt; The model includes a three-component model of future orientation that is meant to include many of the numerous conceptualizations of this construct. As such, the three components included in this model are: [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectations]], aspirations, and [[planning]]. Expectations includes a person's thoughts about the future (e.g., [[optimism]]), whereas aspirations captures a person's [[intention]]s and [[desire]]s for the future (e.g., possible selves). Planning includes a person's awareness and ability to create a plan of action to achieve their goals (e.g., time perspective and [[Delay-discounting|delay discounting]]). Unlike the previously described models, this model also places future orientation in the context of life history and [[Social environment|socio-cultural influences]]. Specifically, the model includes a horizontal axis, illustrating that future orientation develops across the lifespan (time) and is influenced by early experiences. It also includes a vertical axis which, based in [[developmental systems theory]], demonstrates that future orientation is influenced by individual attributes (labeled as competencies) as well as environmental factors (labeled as opportunities and constraints).&lt;ref name=pmid24523304&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/ijamh-2013-0333 |title=Future orientation: A construct with implications for adolescent health and wellbeing |journal=International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health |volume=26 |issue=4 |year=2014 |last1=Johnson |first1=Sarah R. Lindstrom |last2=Blum |first2=Robert W. |last3=Cheng |first3=Tina L. |pmc=4827712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Future orientation is innate. It is a person's thoughts, plans, motivations, hopes and feelings about his or her future. These concepts become more relevant in [[adolescence]] as future orientation increases with age, but they can be identified as early as [[infanthood]]. However, people have different experiences, cultural backgrounds and cognitive skills, all of which differ with age.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt; Studies showed that older teenagers have greater future orientation, as shown by an increased [[delayed gratification]], less [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] beliefs, and greater [[motivation]], time perspective, and planning.&lt;ref name=pmid24523304&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/ijamh-2013-0333 |title=Future orientation: A construct with implications for adolescent health and wellbeing |journal=International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health |volume=26 |issue=4 |year=2014 |last1=Johnson |first1=Sarah R. Lindstrom |last2=Blum |first2=Robert W. |last3=Cheng |first3=Tina L. |pmc=4827712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infancy ===
Evidence of future orientation has been identified as early as 2 months of age. Babies anticipated events through eye movements in experiments ran in laboratory settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/S15327078IN0403_05 |title=The Nature of Infants' Visual Expectations for Event Content |journal=Infancy |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=389–421 |year=2003 |last1=Adler |first1=Scott A. |last2=Haith |first2=Marshall M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haith1994&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haith |first1=Marshall M. |year=1994 |chapter=Visual Expectations as the First Step toward the Development of Future-Oriented Processes |pages=11–38 |chapterurl={{Google books|tWr-RDU9hWgC|page=11|plainurl=yes}} |title=The Development of Future-Oriented Processes |editor1-first=Marshall M. |editor1-last=Haith |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31306-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{INIST|4784246}} |last=Haith |first=Marshall M. |last2=Wentworth |first2=Naomi |last3=Canfield |first3=Richard L. |date=1993 |title=The formation of expectations in early infancy |journal=Advances in Infancy Research |volume=8 |pages=251–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments, babies were shown regular alternating and irregular sequence pictures. In the regular alternating sequence, an image appeared at one location, disappeared, and reappeared in another location. In the standard visual expectation paradigm&lt;ref name=Haith1994/&gt; pictures were shown repeatedly one to the right and one to the left of a visual center, separated by equal intervals. Infants' future orientation was observed in relation to the area they fixated before appearance of the picture (the side they expected the picture to appear) and the time it took them to react ([[reaction time]]). When the babies were shown regular left-right sequence, 3.5 months old babies anticipated the image more accurately and faster than did babies in the control condition, where pictures were presented at random with unequal intervals. When it comes to younger babies (2 months old), they could anticipate basic left-right designs.

=== Early childhood ===
After infancy, the expression and assessment of future orientation is mostly done verbally and is dependent on the child's understanding of the concept of time ([[past]], [[present]], and [[future]]). Children's knowledge and understanding of the future come from their sense of time. One of the challenges in relation to that is the ability to understand the differences between what already happened and what will happen. The ability to reconstruct the past and anticipate the future involve cognitive time travelling.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt; Even if children can correctly use time-related terms associated to the past and the future (such as yesterday and tomorrow), they may still have difficulties distinguishing these periods. Children's ability to anticipate the future develops over time.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt;

Future orientation is conceptually [[motivation]]al, social-cultural and cognitive, but research in relation to children's understanding of the future mainly includes cognitive aspects. Researchers tend to focus on semantic aspects of the future, such as the ability to distinguish between past and future, to organize events chronologically, and their ability to think of personal events that have not happened yet. Results from these studies state that future knowledge does not emerge before the age of 3.&lt;ref name=Friedman2005&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.lmot.2005.02.005 |title=Developmental and cognitive perspectives on humans' sense of the times of past and future events |journal=Learning and Motivation |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=145–58 |year=2005 |last1=Friedman |first1=William J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are differences in the approaches used to understand children's conception of the future. Friedman's ''model of spatial-like images''&lt;ref name=Friedman2005/&gt; suggests that knowledge of the future is based on representation of time patterns, while Weist ''theory of temporal systems in child language''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/s0166-4115(08)61039-0 |chapter=Time Concepts in Language and Thought: Filling the Piagetian Void from Two to Five Years |title=Time and Human Cognition: A Life-Span Perspective |volume=59 |pages=63–118 |series=Advances in Psychology |year=1989 |last1=Weist |first1=Richard M. |isbn=978-0-444-87379-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that future knowledge is represented in children's language.

As children gain knowledge of the future and the way it's expressed verbally, they can engage in greater future oriented behavior like planning. The distinctiveness of planning is its future-oriented aspect. Planning demonstrates an ability to set goals and relating them to actions and activities that lead to achieving these goals.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

==== Effect of parenting, siblings, and peers ====
Since time is a socially constructed concept, it can only be learned within [[social interactions]]. As such, children learn time-related concepts by listening and participating in conversations about the future. For the majority of children in this period, social interaction occurs in the home, and mainly with mothers.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt;

As children grow from 14 to 36 months of age, their mother's conversations about time increases from 36% to 58%. Also, mothers' conversations about the future is more complex than their conversations about the past. Conversations about the future, which use more hypothetical language and conventional time markers (e.g., "tomorrow", "next week", "next year"), tend to relate to general knowledge about events, compared to specific events about the past.&amp;nbsp;In addition, mothers' future talk actively involves children in their future and planning, which also gives children opportunities to learn time-related concepts and gain knowledge about the future.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

=== Middle childhood ===
In middle childhood, a time where children enter [[school]]s, there's a greater focus on their ability to project themselves into the future by sharing dreams, hopes, and fears about the future. Research shows that the hopes and fears of 2nd graders go back and forth between fantasy and [[reality]]. By grade 4, future orientation is based on reality, and grade 6, a greater part of it is dedicated to their future life and their [[Self-esteem|self esteem]].&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt; By the time they reach middle childhood, children develop the ability to evaluate themselves in relation to both to specific aspects of their functioning like their schooling, sports performance, or relationships with family and peers and to their global worth. This is even more prevalent as they approach [[adolescence]].{{fact|date=June 2017}}

=== Adolescence ===
In [[adolescence]], there is an increase in risky behaviours, such as unsafe sex, delinquency, and impulsivity. Future orientation and healthy self-esteem may both serve as protective factors against engaging in risky behavior. As asserted in problem behaviour theory, teenagers who have positive expectations for success of an optimistic view of their future are less likely to take part in problem behaviours. Adolescents who have greater future orientation are less likely to be delinquent, use drugs, or have school-related problems.&lt;ref name=JackmanMacPhee2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0272431615602756 |title=Self-Esteem and Future Orientation Predict Adolescents' Risk Engagement |journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=339–66 |year=2017 |last1=Jackman |first1=Danielle M. |last2=MacPhee |first2=David }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During adolescence, the sense of hopefulness for the future can facilitate positive development and successful transition into adulthood. High levels of hope have been associated with [[academic achievement]], [[social acceptance]], feelings of [[self-worth]], and global [[psychological well-being]].&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt; Adolescents who think critically about their future selves as well as have a positive sense of self are more likely to discover various aspects of their identity and turn out better than those who do not.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt;

Future orientation is also related to [[socioeconomic status]]. Teens that come from a poorer background and whose families receive public assistance tend to have greater [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] attitudes about the future. Higher levels of parents' [[academic achievement]] are also related to increased educational and career orientation. In addition, higher levels of future orientation are associated with less violent behaviors in teenage years.&lt;ref name=pmid21104432&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10464-010-9383-0 |pmid=21104432 |pmc=3107351 |title=Thinking About the Future as a Way to Succeed in the Present: A Longitudinal Study of Future Orientation and Violent Behaviors Among African American Youth |journal=American Journal of Community Psychology |volume=48 |issue=3–4 |pages=238–46 |year=2011 |last1=Stoddard |first1=Sarah A. |last2=Zimmerman |first2=Marc A. |last3=Bauermeister |first3=José A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JackmanMacPhee2015/&gt;

==== Effect of parenting ====
[[Parenting]] is associated with adolescents' future orientation. The way parental acceptance and [[autonomy]] granting is perceived by adolescents is associated with their motivation to participate in future thoughts and behaviors. Security related to maternal [[Attachment theory|attachment]], parental involvement, parental [[socialization]], and parental support are also related to adolescents' [[self-efficacy]] and [[motivation]] to engage in future thought. Adolescents who view their parents as supportive and encouraging express more optimism toward the future and build more extended and distinguished future orientation.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt; In a [[retrospective]] study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF03172767 |title=Home atmosphere and adolescent future orientation |journal=European Journal of Psychology of Education |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=33–43 |year=1990 |last1=Pulkkinen |first1=Lea }}&lt;/ref&gt; emerging adults' optimism about the future was related to the memory of time spent together with parents and their upbringing.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt;

==== Effect of siblings ====
Relationships with [[sibling]]s is associated to future orientation through [[self-agency]] that represents the interpersonal aspect of the self, as indicated by self-reliance, independence, and personal strength. This may be guided by adolescents' need for [[individuation]].{{fact|date=June 2017}}

==== Effect of peers ====
[[Peer group|Peers]] also play a role in future orientation in [[adolescence]]. They can serve as a source of warmth and support and as ways to socialize. Peers may provide essential information, encourage the development of cognitive skills and ideas, help kids and teens to assess their attitudes and beliefs, and improve their social understanding and [[social skills]].&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt; Positive parenting encourages positive peer relationships among children and adolescents, and negative parenting (indicated by [[Neglect|parental neglect]], anger, strict [[Child discipline|discipline]], or excluding children from relevant decisions) leads to associating with peers partaking in [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial behavior]] and noncompliant behavior, [[aggression]] toward peers, and school misconduct (externalizing behavior). [[Social cue]]s and influences from peers can influence what adolescents might achieve or how they might behave, in that those whose social influence is negative tend to have negative future selves and may engage in more risky behaviors.&lt;ref name=JackmanMacPhee2015/&gt;

=== Adulthood ===
Research on future orientation in [[adulthood]] is scarce, as the literature focuses on adolescence and emerging adulthood. However, younger adults (21–39 years old) generally tend to be more future oriented than older adults (60–86 years old), who tend to focus more on the past.&lt;ref name=pmid24144198&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0714980813000500 |pmid=24144198 |title=A Balanced Time Perspective in Adulthood: Well-being and Developmental Effects |journal=Canadian Journal on Aging |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=433–42 |year=2013 |last1=Webster |first1=Jeffrey Dean |last2=Ma |first2=Xiaodong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self and future orientation ==
Individuals who have a clear sense of self are less likely to have [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]] and externalizing behavior problems. These individuals also tend to have positive thoughts about their future and be more [[Confidence|confident]].&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt;

There are many associations between [[self-esteem]] and [[motivation]]. As an indicator of emotional health, self-esteem allows people to pay attention to current and future-oriented tasks. Also, the [[Expectancy-value theory|value-expectancy]] proposition suggests that one's positive self-evaluation has a direct effect on the value of a task and one's expectation in relation to task-specific success. People who value themselves also value the tasks they perform, and their sense of self-worth gives rise to expectations of success and attributions associated to an [[internal locus of control]].{{fact|date=June 2017}}

== Sex differences ==
[[Evolutionary psychology]] and [[gender role]] theory predict that in developing their future orientation adolescent girls will devote more time to relational areas like marriage and family, and adolescent boys will invest more in [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|instrumental]] domains such as work and career. This view differs depending on the time period and context. In the late 1950s in the [[United States]], studies confirmed the gender differences hypothesis, since girls often viewed future life as depending on the man they would marry. Girls' future orientation included fewer stories about the work and career domain and more stories about marriage and family. However, since the 1980s in the United States, Europe ([[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Poland]]), [[Australia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Israel]], studies only partly replicated those earlier findings. Some European studies showed that girls are more concerned with marriage and family and less with work and career issues than boys, other studies reported no differences. In general, girls have a stronger future orientation than boys. They tend to be more realistic, and have greater [[motivation]] and planning skills.&lt;ref name=pmid24523304/&gt; The overall effect of parents on adolescents' future outcomes is also greater for girls than for boys.&lt;ref name=Seginer2009/&gt;

== Environmental factors ==
Environmental factors like [[violence]] and [[poverty]] hinder a person's ability to think about the future and limit their [[hope]] for the future. Poverty may negatively influence the ability to think about the future, which can give rise to feelings of [[hopelessness]]. In the same way, life in a violent [[Neighbourhood|neighborhood]] may not lead one to be trustful and hopeful. Teens who grow up in violent environments may not be able to see a future for themselves and believe their only option is a life of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]]. If youth don't have positive expectations for the future and don't see their behaviors as being related to future goals, they may not be worried about consequence of risk taking behaviors like criminal involvement and violent behaviors. Equally, if individuals want a positive future for themselves they would engage in less compromising behaviors to guarantee that they reach their future goals.&lt;ref name=pmid21104432/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0025327 |pmid=21895358 |title=Future orientation, impulsivity, and problem behaviors: A longitudinal moderation model |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=1633–45 |year=2011 |last1=Chen |first1=Pan |last2=Vazsonyi |first2=Alexander T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

=== Academic achievement ===
Researchers looking at the connection between future orientation and [[academic achievement]] have found that students who envision a positive self in the future are motivated to succeed academically and plan for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/461940 |title=The Relation of Present and Possible Academic Selves during Early Adolescence to Grade Point Average and Achievement Goals |journal=The Elementary School Journal |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=3–17 |year=1999 |last1=Anderman |first1=Eric M. |last2=Anderman |first2=Lynley H. |last3=Griesinger |first3=Tripp }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inist19784309/&gt; For example, a study that looked at the connection between possible self in the future and academic achievement found that among sixth, seventh and eighth graders those who are more optimistic towards their possible self had higher grades than students who had a more limited view of their self in the future. Another study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0042085907311806 |title=Future Time Perspective, Hope, and Ethnic Identity Among African American Adolescents |journal=Urban Education |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=347–60 |year=2008 |last1=Adelabu |first1=D. H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at future orientation and academic achievement in low-income [[Rural area|rural]] and [[Urban area|urban]] African American adolescents in grades 7 to 12. They found that higher future orientation and ethnic identify were positively related to academic achievement (i.e., higher GPAs).

=== Problem behaviours ===
Future orientation may not only motivate future-oriented behaviors, such as pursuing academic achievements and future goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02087616 |pmid=24317715 |title=A longitudinal study of adolescents' future orientation (time perspective) |journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=131–47 |year=1979 |last1=Trommsdorff |first1=Gisela |last2=Lamm |first2=Helmut |last3=Schmidt |first3=Rolf W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also influence the decision making process about whether to engage in problem behaviors. If youth do not have positive expectations for the future and do not see current behaviors as linked to future goals they may not be concerned with the consequences of risk taking behaviors such as consuming substances, criminal involvement and violent behaviors. For example, a study found youth (who had previously been in trouble with that law) who had a positive future orientation were less likely to use [[marijuana]], had less [[Alcoholism|alcohol]] related problems (i.e., frequency and quantity of use), and believed there to be greater risks involved with alcohol and drug use.&lt;ref name=pmid16429605&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0743558403258860 |pmid=16429605 |pmc=1317100 |title=Relationships Between Future Orientation, Impulsive Sensation Seeking, and Risk Behavior among Adjudicated Adolescents |journal=Journal of Adolescent Research |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=428–445 |year=2004 |last1=Robbins |first1=Reuben N. |last2=Bryan |first2=Angela }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study&lt;ref name=pmid21104432/&gt; looked at the impact of positive future orientation over a span of 10 years in African American youth. This study found that higher levels of future orientation (i.e., thinking more often about the future) was associated with greater decreases in violent behavior (e.g., carried a knife, gotten in a fight at [[school]] or outside of school) over time. Overall, research suggests that thinking about, planning for and valuing future goals can decrease the chances that youth will participate in risky and dangerous behaviours.

The [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222648006_A_clustering_algorithm_based_on_graph_connectivity  '''HCS (Highly Connected Subgraphs) clustering algorithm''']&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.1016/S0020-0190(00)00142-3| title=A clustering algorithm based on graph connectivity | year=2000 | last1=Hartuv | first1=E. | last2=Shamir | first2=R. | journal=Information Processing Letters| volume=76 | issue=4-6 | pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the '''HCS algorithm''' , and other names such as '''Highly Connected Clusters/Components/Kernels''') is an algorithm based on graph connectivity for [[Cluster analysis]], by first representing the similarity data in a [[similarity graph]], and afterwards finding all the highly connected subgraphs as clusters. The algorithm does not make any prior assumptions on the number of the clusters. This algorithm was published by Erez Hartuv and [[Ron Shamir]] in 1998.

The HCS algorithm gives clustering solution, which is inherently meaningful in the application domain, since each solution cluster must have diameter 2 while a union of two solution clusters will have diameter 3.

== Similarity Modeling and Preprocessing ==

The goal of cluster analysis is to group elements into disjoint subsets, or clusters, based on similarity between elements, so that elements in the same cluster are highly similar to each other (homogeneity), while elements from different clusters have low similarity to each other (separation). Similarity graph is one of the models to represent the similarity between elements, and in turn facilitate generating of clusters. To construct a similarity graph from similarity data, represent elements as vertices, and elicit edges between vertices when the similarity value between them is above some threshold.

== Algorithm ==

In the similarity graph, the more edges exist for a given number of vertices, the more similar such a set of vertices are between each other. In other words, if we try to disconnect a similarity graph by removing edges, the more edges we need to remove before the graph becomes disconnected, the more similar the vertices in this graph. [[Minimum cut]] is a minimum set of edges without which the graph will become disconnected.

{{See also|Connectivity (graph_theory)}}

HCS clustering algorithm finds all the subgraphs with n vertices such that the minimum cut of those subgraphs contain more than n/2 edges, and identifies them as clusters. Such a subgraph is called a [[Highly Connected Subgraph]] (HCS). Single vertices are not considered clusters and are grouped into a singletons set S.

{{See also|Minimum cut}}

Given a similarity graph G(V,E), HCS clustering algorithm will check if it is already highly connected, if yes, returns G, otherwise uses the minimum cut of G to partition G into two subgraphs H and H', and recursively run HCS clustering algorithm on H and H'.

== Example ==

The following animation shows how the HCS clustering algorithm partitions a similarity graph into three clusters.

[[File:HCS Algorithm.gif]]

== Pseudocode ==

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vb"&gt;
1  function HCS(G(V,E))   
2    if G is highly connected
3      then return (G)
4    else
5     (H1,H2,C) ← MINIMUMCUT(G)
6      HCS(H1)
7      HCS(H2)
8    end if
9  end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The step of finding the minimum cut on graph G is a subroutine that can be implemented using different algorithms for this problem. See below for an example algorithm for finding minimum cut using randomization.

== Complexity ==

The running time of the HCS clustering algorithm is bounded by N x f(n,m). f(n,m) is the time complexity of computing a minimum cut in a graph with n vertices and m edges, and N is the number of clusters found. In many applications N &lt; &lt; n.

For fast algorithms for finding a minimum cut in an unweighted graph: {{See also|Karger's algorithm}}

== Proof of correctness ==

The clusters produced by the HCS clustering algorithm possess several properties, which can demonstrate the homogeneity and the separation of the solution.

'''Theorem 1''' The diameter of every highly connect graph is at most two.

''Proof:'' We know the edges of minimum cut must be greater or equal than the minimum degree of the graph. If the graph G is highly connected, then the edges of the minimum cut must be greater than the number of vertices divided by 2. So the degree of vertices in the highly connected graph G must be greater than half the vertices. Therefore, for any two vertices in this graph G, there must be at least one common neighbor, as the distance between them is two.

{{See also|Distance (graph theory)}}

'''Theorem 2''' (a) The number of edges in a highly connected subgraph is quadratic. (b) The number of edges removed by each iteration of the HCS algorithm is at most linear.

''Proof:'' (For a) From Theorem 1 we know every vertex must have more than half of the total vertices as neighbors. Therefore, the total number of edges in a highly connect subgraph must be at least (n/2) x n x 1/2, where we sum all the degrees of each vertex and divide by 2.

(For b) Each iteration HCS algorithm will separate a graph containing n vertices into two subgraphs, so the number of edges between those two components is at most n/2.

Theorem 1 and 2a provide a strong indication to the homogeneity, as the only better possibility in terms of the diameter is that every two vertices of a cluster are connected by an edge, which is both too stringent and also a [[Clique problem|NP-hard problem]].

Theorem 2b also indicates separation since the number of edges removed by each iteration of the HCS algorithm is at most linear in the size of the underlying subgraph, contrast to the quadratic number of edges within final clusters.

== Variations ==

'''Singletons adoption''': Elements left as singletons by the initial clustering process can be "adopted" by clusters based on similarity to the cluster. If the maximum number of neighbors to a specific cluster is large enough, then it can be added to that cluster.

'''Removing Low Degree Vertices''': When the input graph has vertices with low degrees, it is not worthy to run the algorithm since it is computationally expensive and not informative. Alternatively, a refinement of the algorithm can first remove all vertices with a degree lower than certain threshold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12410">The '''Harvard–Yenching Classification System''' is a  library classification system for Chinese language materials in the United States of America. It was devised by [[Alfred Kaiming Chiu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{zh|t=裘開明 | s=裘开明 |p=Qiú Kāimíng|w=Ch'iu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; K'ai&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Ming&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (1898–1977). The system was primarily created for the classification of Chinese language materials in the [[Harvard–Yenching Library]] which was founded in 1927 at the [[Harvard–Yenching Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene W. Wu, "The Founding of the Harvard–Yenching Library," ''Journal of East Asian Libraries'' 101.1  (1993):  65-69.     [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/jeal/vol1993/iss101/16/]&lt;/ref&gt;

During that early period other systems, such as the early edition of the [[Library of Congress Classification]], did not consist of appropriate subject headings to classify the Chinese language materials, particularly the ancient published materials.  As many American libraries started to collect the ancient and contemporary published materials from China, a number of American libraries subsequently followed Harvard University to adopt Harvard–Yenching classification system, such as the East Asian Library of the University of California in Berkeley, Columbia University, The University of Chicago, Washington University in St. Louis etc.

In addition to American libraries, the libraries of other universities in the world including England, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore etc. also followed Harvard University to adopt the system.  During the period from the 1930s to the 1970s, the use of the system became popular for classifying not only Chinese language materials but also other East Asian materials including Korean and Japanese language materials.

During the period from the 1970s to the 1980s, a comprehensive subset of subject headings for Chinese language materials was gradually established in the Library of Congress Classification System so that almost a full spectrum of ancient and contemporary Chinese topics can be widely covered. As a result of this, the Library of Congress Classification System eventually replaced the Harvard–Yenching Classification System for all Chinese language materials acquired after the 1970s in many American Libraries.

Though the system has largely been phased out, the system is still being used in some libraries for Chinese language materials acquired prior to the Library of Congress update. Such previously acquired books are normally stored in separate stacks in libraries. However, some of the university libraries in the Commonwealth countries of the United Kingdom such as England, Australia and New Zealand still continue to use the Harvard–Yenching system; for example, the Institute for Chinese Studies Library of the University of Oxford, University of Sydney, and University of Auckland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17077">'''Hot cognition''' is a hypothesis on [[motivated reasoning]] in which a person's thinking is influenced by their emotional state. Put simply, hot cognition is cognition coloured by emotion.&lt;ref name="Brand1985/1986"&gt;{{Citation | title = Hot cognition: Emotions and writing behavior | year = 1985–1986 | author = Brand, A. G. | journal = JAC | pages = 5–15 | volume = 6 | jstor=20865583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot cognition contrasts with '''cold cognition''', which implies [[cognitive processing]] of information that is independent of emotional involvement.&lt;ref name=Roiser2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roiser JP, Sahakian BJ |title=Hot and cold cognition in depression |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=139–49 |year=2013 |pmid=23481353 |doi=10.1017/S1092852913000072 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Roiser/publication/236037717_Hot_and_cold_cognition_in_depression/links/55ad05de08ae98e661a2b04b.pdf?origin=publication_detail&amp;ev=pub_int_prw_xdl&amp;msrp=eKJt8qSZ7siklAvA1aEmeepeuB1AK-8o62RCvDbqRigLzP_SlwHa91mRHpFkOduwLedldNFM4bZiqJO-V3ubXScUVf_1K1DpCjoVNtbJohg.A7M6iOMLwYghXkDTj2lTZGuACtL7jhZrIspmVbqvEBN5RpmruseKNI3sGILMR_q4wdv9pJWZ2cvlnLJVxCTnMw.M8tyzlLPYV4qxm9hIdlVYAKc7PUs8VBZ2WWljrcejwfNaX6MI-Vr0DfAWeFERcweYlC7Tv5z1Ow5r0JheYxt8Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot cognition is proposed to be associated with cognitive and physiological arousal, in which a person is more responsive to environmental factors. As it is automatic, rapid and led by emotion,&lt;ref name="LodgeTaber2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lodge|first1=Milton|last2=Taber|first2=Charles S.|title=The Automaticity of Affect for Political Leaders, Groups, and Issues: An Experimental Test of the Hot Cognition Hypothesis|journal=Political Psychology|volume=26|issue=3|year=2005|pages=455–482|issn=0162-895X|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; hot cognition may consequently cause biased and low-quality decision making.&lt;ref name="HuijbregtsWarren2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huijbregts|first1=Stephan C.

Abelson. This idea became popular in the 1960s and the 1970s. An example of a biased decision caused by hot cognition would be a juror disregarding evidence because of an attraction to the defendant.&lt;ref name="Brand1985/1986"/&gt;

Decision making with cold cognition is more likely to involve logic and critical analysis.&lt;ref name="Kunda1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunda|first1=Ziva|title= The case for motivated reasoning.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=108|issue=3|year=1990|pages=480–498|issn=0033-2909|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480|pmid=2270237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when an individual engages in a task when displaying cold cognition, the stimuli is likely to be emotionally neutral and the "outcome of the test is not motivationally relevant" to the individual.&lt;ref name="Roiser"/&gt; An example of a critical decision using cold cognition would be concentrating on the evidence before drawing a conclusion.

Hot and cold cognition form a dichotomy within [[Executive functions|executive functioning]]. Executive functioning has long been considered as a domain general cognitive function, but there has been support for separation into "hot" affective aspects and "cold" cognitive aspects.&lt;ref name="ZelazoMller2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelazo|first1=Philip David|title=Blackwell Handbook of Childhood Cognitive Development|last2=Mller|first2=Ulrich|year=2002|pages=445–469|doi=10.1002/9780470996652.ch20|chapter=Executive Function in Typical and Atypical Development|isbn=9780470996652}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognized that executive functioning spans across a number of cognitive tasks including [[working memory]], [[cognitive flexibility]] and [[reasoning]] in active goal pursuit. The distinction between hot and cool cognition implies that executive function may operate differently in different contexts.&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hongwanishkul|first1=Donaya|last2=Happaney|first2=Keith R.|last3=Lee|first3=Wendy S.

Performance on hot and cold tasks improves most rapidly during the preschool years,&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"/&gt; but continues into adolescence. This co-occurs with both structural and functional development associated with the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Diamond2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Adele|title=Principles of Frontal Lobe Function|year=2002|pages=466–503|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195134971.003.0029|chapter=Normal Development of Prefrontal Cortex from Birth to Young Adulthood: Cognitive Functions, Anatomy, and Biochemistry|isbn=9780195134971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific areas within the PFC are thought to be associated with both hot and cold cognition. Hot cognition is likely to be utilized during tasks that require the regulation of emotion or motivation, as well as reevaluating the motivational significance of a stimulus. The ventral and medial areas of the prefrontal cortex (VM-PFC) are implicated during these tasks. Cold cognition is thought to be associated with executive functions elicited by abstract, deconceptualized tasks, such as card sorting. The area of the brain that is utilized for these tasks is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC). It is between the ages of 3 years and 5 years that the most significant change in task completion is seen.&lt;ref name="ZelazoMller2002"/&gt; Age-related trends have been observed in tasks used to measure hot cognition, as well as cold cognition.&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"/&gt; However, the age at which children reach adult-like functioning varies. It appears as though children take longer to fully develop hot executive functioning than cold.&lt;ref name="PrencipeKesek2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prencipe|first1=Angela|last2=Kesek|first2=Amanda|last3=Cohen|first3=Julia|last4=Lamm|first4=Connie|last5=Lewis|first5=Marc D.|last6=Zelazo|first6=Philip David|title=Development of hot and cool executive function during the transition to adolescence|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=108|issue=3|year=2011|pages=621–637|issn=0022-0965|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2010.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lends support to the idea that hot cognition may follow a separate, and perhaps delayed, developmental trajectory as opposed to cold cognition.&lt;ref name="ZelazoCarlson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zelazo|first1=Philip David|last2=Carlson|first2=Stephanie M.|title=Hot and Cool Executive Function in Childhood and Adolescence: Development and Plasticity|journal=Child Development Perspectives|year=2012|pages=n/a–n/a|issn=1750-8592|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research done on these neurological areas suggests there may be some plasticity during the development of both hot and cold cognition. While the preschool years are ones of extreme sensitivity to the development of prefrontal cortex, a similar period is found in the transition into adolescence.&lt;ref name="ZelazoCarlson2012"/&gt; This gives rise to the idea that there may be a possible time window for intervention training, which would improve cognitive abilities and executive functioning in children and adolescents.

==Assessment==
This section explains the most common tasks that are used to measure hot and cold cognitive functioning. The cool tasks are neutrally affective and measure executive function abilities such as cognitive flexibility and working memory. In other words, there is nothing to be gained or lost by performing these tasks. The hot tasks also measure executive function, but these tasks result in emotionally significant consequences.&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"/&gt;

===Hot function tasks===
====Iowa gambling task====
In the [[Iowa gambling task]] participants are initially given $2,000 facsimile dollars and asked to win as much money as possible. They are presented with four decks of cards that represent either a gain or loss in money. One card from each deck is drawn at a time. Consistently choosing a card from the advantageous decks results in a net gain, whereas choosing from a disadvantageous deck results in a net loss. Each card from the disadvantageous deck offers a higher reward than the advantageous deck, but also a higher and more variable loss.

====Delay of gratification====
Studies have been conducted on the concept of delay of gratification to test whether or not people are capable of waiting to receive a reward in order to increase the value of the reward. In these experiments, participants can choose to either take the reward they are immediately presented with or can choose to wait a period of time to then receive a higher valued reward. Hot cognition would motivate people to immediately satisfy their craving for the present reward rather than waiting for a better reward.&lt;ref name="Roiser"&gt;{{Citation | title = Hot and cold cognition in depression | author = Roiser, J.P. | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Education Institute | pages = 1092–8529 | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | issn = 1092-8529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neutral versus negative syllogisms tasks====
The influence that beliefs can have on logical reasoning may vary as a result of emotions during cognitive processes. When presented with neutral content,  this will typically lead to the exhibition of the belief-bias effect. In contrast, content that is emotionally charged will result in a diminished likelihood of beliefs having an influence. The impact of negative emotions demonstrates the capability they have for altering the process underlying logical reasoning. There is an interaction that occurs between emotions and beliefs that interferes with the ability that an individual has to reason.&lt;ref name="Goel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goel | first1 = V. | last2 = Vartanian | first2 = O. | year = 2011 | title = Negative emotions can attenuate the influence of beliefs on logical reasoning | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 121–131 | doi=10.1080/02699931003593942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold function tasks===
The cool tasks are neutrally affective and measure executive function abilities such as cognitive flexibility and working memory. In other words, there is nothing to be gained or lost by performing these tasks. The hot tasks also measure executive function, but these tasks result in emotionally significant consequences.&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hongwanishkul|first1=Donaya|last2=Happaney|first2=Keith R.|last3=Lee|first3=Wendy S. C.|last4=Zelazo|first4=Philip David|title=Assessment of Hot and Cool Executive Function in Young Children: Age-Related Changes and Individual Differences|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|volume=28|issue=2|year=2005|pages=617–644|issn=8756-5641|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2802_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self Ordered Pointing====
In this task an array of items is presented to participants. The position of these items then randomly changes from trial to trial. Participants are instructed to point to one of these items, but then asked to not point to that same item again. In order to perform well on this task, participants must remember what item they pointed to and use this information to decide on subsequent responses.

====Wisconsin Card Sort Task (WCST)====
The [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Task|Wisconsin Card Sort Task]] requires participants to sort stimulus cards that differ in dimensions (shape, colour, or number). However, they are not told how to sort them. The only feedback they receive is whether or not a match is correct. Participants must discover the rule according to dimension. Once the participant matches a certain number of correct cards, the dimension changes and they must rediscover the new rule. This requires participants to remember the rule they were using and cognitively change the rule by which they use to sort.

====Dimensional Change Card Sort Task (DCCS)====
Participants are required to sort stimulus cards based on either shape or colour. They are first instructed to sort based on one dimension (colour) in a trial, and then it switches to the other (shape) in the following trial. "Switch" trials are also used where the participant must change back and forth between rules within a single trial. Unlike the WCST, the rule is explicitly stated and does not have to be inferred. The task measures how flexible participants are to changing rules. This requires participants to shift between dimensions of sorting.

==Recent evidence==
Research has demonstrated emotional manipulations on decision making processes. Participants who are induced with enthusiasm, anger or distress (different specific emotions) responded in different ways to the risky-choice problems, demonstrating that hot cognition, as an automatic process, affects decision making differently. Another example of hot cognition is a better predictor of negative emotional arousal as compared to cold cognition when they have a personal investment, such as wanting your team to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madrigal|first1=R|title=Hot vs. cold cognitions and consumers' reactions to sporting event outcomes|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=18|issue=4|year=2008|pages=304–319|issn=1057-7408|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2008.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, hot cognition changes the way people use decision-making strategies, depending on the type of mood they are in, positive or negative. When people are in a positive mood, they tend to use compensatory, holistic strategies. This leads to a shallow and broad processing of information. In a negative mood people employ non-compensatory, narrow strategies which leads to a more detail-oriented and thorough processing of information. In the study participants were shown movie clips in order to induce a mood of happiness, anger or sadness and asked to complete a decision-making task. Researchers found that participants in the negative mood condition used more non-compensatory, specific decision-making techniques by focusing on the details of the situation. Participants in the positive mood condition used more compensatory, broad decision making techniques by focusing on the bigger picture of the situation. Also, hot cognition has been implicated in automatic processing and [[autobiographical memory]]. Furthermore, hot cognition extends outside the laboratory as exhibited in political process and criminal judgments. When police officers were induced with sadness they were more likely to think the suspect was guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ask|first1=Karl|last2=Granhag|first2=Pär Anders|title=Hot cognition in investigative judgments: The differential influence of anger and sadness.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=31|issue=6|year=2007|pages=537–551|issn=1573-661X|doi=10.1007/s10979-006-9075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if police officers were induced with anger there was no difference in judgments. There are also clinical implications for understanding certain disorders. Patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa went through intervention training, which included hot cognition as a part of emotional processing development, did not show any improvement after this training.&lt;ref name="Goel"/&gt; In another clinical population, those diagnosed with bipolar disorder exaggerated their perception of negative feedback and were less likely to adjust their decision making process in the face of risky-choices (gambling tasks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roiser|first1=Jonathan P|last2=Cannon|first2=Dara M|last3=Gandhi|first3=Shilpa K|last4=Tavares|first4=Joana Taylor|last5=Erickson|first5=Kristine|last6=Wood|first6=Suzanne|last7=Klaver|first7=Jacqueline M|last8=Clark|first8=Luke|last9=Zarate Jr|first9=Carlos A|last10=Sahakian|first10=Barbara J|last11=Drevets|first11=Wayne C|title=Hot and cold cognition in unmedicated depressed subjects with bipolar disorder|journal=Bipolar Disorders|volume=11|issue=2|year=2009|pages=178–189|issn=1398-5647|doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00669.x|pmc=2670985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31456">{{Other uses|Interpretation (disambiguation)}}

An '''interpretation''' is an assignment of meaning to the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a [[formal language]]. Many formal languages used in [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[theoretical computer science]] are defined in solely [[syntax|syntactic]] terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]].

The most commonly studied formal logics are [[propositional logic]], [[predicate logic]] and their [[modal logic|modal]] analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that provides the [[extension (predicate logic)|extension]] of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate ''T'' (for "tall") and assign it the extension {''a''} (for "Abraham Lincoln"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant ''T'', and does not make a claim about whether ''T'' is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'.  Though ''we'' may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.

An interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the [[truth value]]s of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]], the interpretation is called a [[model (model theory)|model]] of that sentence or theory.

== Formal languages ==
{{main|Formal language}}

A formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of ''sentences'' (variously  called ''words'' or ''[[well formed formula|formulas]]'') built from a fixed set of ''letters'' or ''symbols''. The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the ''[[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]'' over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called ''[[Well-formed_formula|well-formed formulæ]]'' (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (''P'' or ''Q'') is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.

=== Example ===
A formal language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined with the
alphabet &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \{ \triangle, \square \}&lt;/math&gt;, and with a word being in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; if it begins with &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and is composed solely of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

A possible interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; could assign the decimal digit '1' to &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; and '0' to &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\triangle \square \triangle&lt;/math&gt; would denote 101 under this interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Logical constants ===
In the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols ([[logical constant]]s) and the non-logical symbols.  The idea behind this terminology is that ''logical'' symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while ''non-logical'' symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.

Logical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols ∀ ("all") and ∃ ("some"), symbols for [[logical connective]]s ∧ ("and"), ∨ ("or"), ¬ ("not"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.

== General properties of truth-functional interpretations ==
Many of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called ''truth functional'';{{dubious|reason=The article 'Truth-functional' gives a more restricted definition: the truth-value of a compound sentence should be a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences.|date=September 2015}} they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be ''[[satisfiable|satisfied]]'' by that assignment.

No sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation,{{dubious|reason=Except for paraconsistent logic.|date=September 2015}} but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations.  A sentence is ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is ''inconsistent''. A sentence φ is said to be ''logically valid'' if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if φ is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies ψ then φ is said to be a ''[[logical consequence]]'' of ψ).

=== Logical connectives ===
Some of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are [[logical connective|truth-functional connectives]] that represent truth functions&amp;nbsp;— functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).

The truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be [[logical constant]]s, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.

This is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:
*¬Φ is True [[iff]] Φ is False.
*(Φ ∧ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True and Ψ is True.
*(Φ ∨ Ψ) is True iff Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ → Ψ) is True iff ¬Φ is True or Ψ is True (or both are True).
*(Φ ↔ Ψ) is True iff (Φ → Ψ) is True and (Ψ → Φ) is True.

So under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.

Now it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula ''F'': (Φ ∨ ¬Φ). If our interpretation function makes Φ True, then ¬Φ is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct Φ of ''F'' is True under that interpretation, ''F'' is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of Φ makes it False, and if so, ¬Φ is made True by the negation function. That would make ''F'' True again, since one of ''F''s disjuncts, ¬Φ, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for ''F'' are the only possible logical interpretations, and since ''F'' comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.

== Interpretation of a theory ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

An ''interpretation of a theory'' is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a [[many-to-one]] correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a ''full interpretation'', otherwise it is called a ''partial interpretation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Haskell Curry]] |title=Foundations of Mathematical Logic |publisher=Mcgraw Hill |date=1963}} Here: p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations for propositional logic ==
The formal language for [[propositional logic]] consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives.  The only [[non-logical symbol]]s in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.

The standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the [[truth value]]s true and false. This function is known as a ''truth assignment'' or ''valuation'' function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign [[truthbearer]]s instead.

For a language with ''n'' distinct propositional variables there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable ''a'', for example, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;=2 possible interpretations: 1) ''a'' is assigned '''T''', or 2) ''a'' is assigned '''F'''. For the pair ''a'', ''b'' there are 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned '''T''', 2) both are assigned '''F''', 3) ''a'' is assigned '''T''' and ''b'' is assigned '''F''', or 4) ''a'' is assigned '''F''' and ''b'' is assigned '''T'''.

Given any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.

== First-order logic ==
Unlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]].  The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol.  In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number [[arity]] is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.

For example, in the language of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and ·, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)

Again, we might define a first-order language '''L''', as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.

=== Formal languages for first-order logic ===
Given a signature σ, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of σ-formulas. Each σ-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols.  The formal definition of the set of σ-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol "=" for equality (see the section "[[#Interpreting equality|Interpreting equality"]] below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.

=== Interpretations of a first-order language ===
To ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.
* A [[domain of discourse]]&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called the "universe of disourse"&lt;/ref&gt; ''D'', usually required to be non-empty (see below).
* For every constant symbol, an element of ''D'' as its interpretation.
* For every ''n''-ary function symbol, an ''n''-ary function from ''D'' to ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a function ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'').
* For every ''n''-ary predicate symbol, an ''n''-ary relation on ''D'' as its interpretation (that is, a subset of ''D&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'').
An object carrying this information is known as a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] ({{not a typo|of}} signature σ), or σ-structure, or ''L''-structure, or as a "model".

The information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its [[free variable]]s, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the [[T-schema]], which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, {{nowrap|φ &amp; ψ}} is satisfied if and only if both φ and ψ are satisfied.

This leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} and {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}}. The domain of discourse forms the [[range (mathematics)|range]] for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence {{nowrap|∀ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of φ(''x''), where ''x'' is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula {{nowrap|∃ ''x'' φ(''x'')}} is satisfied if there is at least one element ''d'' of the domain such that φ(''d'') is satisfied.

Strictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula φ(''d'') mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of φ, because ''d'' is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.

Some authors also admit [[propositional variable]]s in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values ''true'' and ''false.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Because the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property&lt;ref&gt;The extension of a property (also called an attribute) is a set of individuals, so a property is a unary relation. E.g. The properties "yellow" and "prime" are unary relations.&lt;/ref&gt;(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are [[Extensional definition|extensional]]&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Extension (predicate logic)]]&lt;/ref&gt; not [[Intensional definition|intensional]].

=== Example of a first-order interpretation ===
An example of interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of the language '''L''' described above is as follows.
* Domain: A chess set
* Individual constants: a: The white King b: The black Queen c: The white King's pawn
* F(x): x is a piece
* G(x): x is a pawn
* H(x): x is black
* I(x): x is white
* J(x, y): x can capture y

In the interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of L:
* the following are true sentences: F(a), G(c), H(b), I(a) J(b, c),
* the following are false sentences: J(a, c), G(a).

=== Non-empty domain requirement === &lt;!--Please preserve this section heading; it is being used in another article --&gt;
As stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as
::&lt;math&gt;(\phi \lor \exists x \psi) \leftrightarrow \exists x (\phi \lor \psi)&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''x'' is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence
:&lt;math&gt;[\forall y (y = y) \lor \exists x ( x = x)] \equiv \exists x [ \forall y ( y = y) \lor x = x]&lt;/math&gt;
fails in any structure with an empty domain.  Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Hailperin | first1=Theodore | title=Quantification theory and empty individual-domains |mr=0057820 | year=1953 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=18 | pages=197–200 | doi=10.2307/2267402 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2267402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Quine | first1=W. V. | title=Quantification and the empty domain |mr=0064715 | year=1954 | journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=19 | pages=177–179 | doi=10.2307/2268615 | issue=3 | publisher=Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor=2268615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.

=== Interpreting equality ===
The equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.

The first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if ''a'' = ''b'' and ''R''(''a'') holds then ''R''(''b'') holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for [[set theory]] or the signature for [[second-order arithmetic]] in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.

The second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a ''normal model'', so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called ''first order logic with equality'', but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.

There are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an [[equivalence relation]] and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an [[elementary substructure|elementarily equivalent]] interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.

=== Many-sorted first-order logic ===
A generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one ''sort'' of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.

One example of many-sorted logic is for planar [[Euclidean geometry]]. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation ''E'' which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the [[Euclidean plane]], the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation ''E''(''p'',''l'') holds if and only if point ''p'' is on line ''l''.

== Higher-order predicate logics ==
A formal language for [[higher-order logic|higher-order predicate logic]] looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc.  All of these types of variables can be quantified.

There are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. ''Full semantics'' require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. ''Henkin semantics'', which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain ''D'', a collection of subsets of ''D'', a collection of functions from ''D'' to ''D'', etc.  The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.

== Non-classical interpretations ==
The interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of [[non-classical logic]] (such as [[intuitionistic logic]]), and in the study of modal logic.

Interpretations used to study non-classical logic include [[topological model]]s, [[Boolean-valued model]]s, and [[Kripke model]]s.  [[Modal logic]] is also studied using Kripke models.

== Intended interpretations ==
Many formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.

The intended interpretation is called the ''standard model'' (a term introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]] in 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Anthonie Meijers|title=Philosophy of technology and engineering sciences|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51667-1|series=Handbook of the Philosophy of Science|volume=9|author=Roland Müller|chapter=The Notion of a Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Peano arithmetic]], it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are [[isomorphic]] to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the [[Peano axioms]]. There are also [[Peano axioms#Nonstandard models|non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms]], which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.

While the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal [[deductive system|syntactical rules]], it naturally affects the choice of the [[formal grammar|formation]] and [[transformation rules]] of the syntactical system. For example, [[primitive notion|primitive signs]] must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; [[sentential formula]]s are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] [[declarative sentence]]s; [[axiom|primitive sentences]] need to come out as [[Truth|true]] [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in the interpretation; [[rules of inference]] must be such that, if the sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; is directly [[formal proof|derivable]] from a sentence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_i \to \mathcal{I}_j&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a true sentence, with {{imp}} meaning [[material conditional|implication]], as usual. These requirements ensure that all [[formal proof|provable]] sentences also come out to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rudolf Carnap]] |title=Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications |publisher=Dover publications| location=New York |date=1958 |isbn=9780486604534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of [[non-standard model]]s is an example). When we speak about 'models' in [[empirical science]]s, we mean, if we want [[reality]] to be a model of our science, to speak about an ''intended model''. A model in the empirical sciences is an ''intended factually-true descriptive interpretation'' (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same [[domain of discourse]] as the intended one, but other [[value assignment|assignments]] for [[non-logical constant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hans Freudenthal |title=The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences (Colloquium proceedings)|publisher=Springer |isbn= 978-94-010-3669-6 |date=Jan 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|reason=Every chapter is written by a different author.|date=September 2015}}

=== Example ===

Given a simple formal system (we shall call this one &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;) whose alphabet α consists only of three symbols &lt;math&gt;\{ \blacksquare, \bigstar, \blacklozenge \}&lt;/math&gt; and whose formation rule for formulas is:
: 'Any string of symbols of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; which is at least 6 symbols long, and which is not infinitely long, is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;. Nothing else is a formula of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt;.'

The single [[axiom schema]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; is:

: " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ast \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ast&lt;/math&gt; " (where " &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; " is a [[metasyntactic variable]] standing for a finite string of " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; "s )

A formal proof can be constructed as follows:
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

In this example the theorem produced " &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare \ \bigstar \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacklozenge \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare \ \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; " can be interpreted as meaning "One plus three equals four." A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as "Four minus three equals one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Geoffrey Hunter]] |title=Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First Order Logic| publisher=University of California Press |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

== Other concepts of interpretation ==
There are other uses of the term "interpretation" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.

In model theory, a structure ''A'' is said to interpret a structure ''B'' if there is a definable subset ''D'' of ''A'', and definable relations and functions on ''D'', such that ''B'' is isomorphic to the structure with domain ''D'' and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain ''D'' that is used, but rather ''D'' modulo an equivalence relation definable in ''A''.  For additional information, see [[Interpretation (model theory)]].

A theory ''T'' is said to interpret another theory ''S'' if there is a finite [[extension by definition]]s ''T''′ of ''T'' such that ''S'' is contained in ''T''′.

In [[psychoanalytic theory]], the '''Jocasta complex''' is the [[incest]]uous [[sexual desire]] of a mother towards her son.&lt;ref&gt;Jon E. Roeckelein. Elsevier's dictionary of psychological theories. Elsevier, 2006. {{ISBN|0-444-51750-2}}. Page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond de Saussure]] introduced the term in 1920 by way of analogy to its logical converse in psychoanalysis, the [[Oedipus complex]], and it may be used to cover different degrees of attachment,&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Campbell, ''Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary'' (2009)  p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; including domineering but asexual mother love – something perhaps particularly prevalent with an absent father.

==Origins==

The Jocasta complex is named for [[Jocasta]], a Greek queen who unwittingly married her son, [[Oedipus]]. The Jocasta complex is similar to the [[Oedipus complex]], in which a child has sexual desire towards their parent(s). The term is a bit of an extrapolation, since in the original story Oedipus and Jocasta were unaware that they were mother and son when they married. The usage in modern contexts involves a son with full knowledge of who his mother is.

==Analytic discussion==

[[Theodor Reik]] saw the "Jocasta mother", with an unfulfilled adult relationship of her own and an over-concern for her child instead, as a prime source of neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sutherland, ''Breakdown'' (Oxford 1998) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Devereux]] went further, arguing that the child's Oedipal complex was itself triggered by a pre-existing parental complex (Jocasta/[[Laius]]).&lt;ref&gt;George Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) pp. 209–10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] also explored the other (parental) side of the Oedipus complex, pointing to related family dramas such as "mother sleeping with daughter's boyfriend ... when mother has no son to play Jocasta with".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural analogues==
* [[Atossa]], in the Greek tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'', has been seen as struggling in her dreams with a Jocasta complex.&lt;ref&gt;George Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
* Indian folk-tales often feature figures, like Jocasta, expressing maternal desire for their sons.&lt;ref&gt;L. Edmunds/A. Dundes, ''Oedipus: A Folklore Casebook'' (1995) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Through popular usage and the work of Karpman and others, Karpman's triangle has been adapted for use in structural analysis (''defining the conflict roles of persecutor, victim, and rescuer'') and transactional analysis (''diagramming how participants switch roles in conflict'').&lt;ref name=berneaward&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karpmen, MD|first1=Stephen|title=Eric Berne Memorial Scientific Award|url=http://www.karpmandramatriangle.com/pdf/AwardSpeech.pdf|website=karpmandramatriangle.com|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Karpman used triangles to map conflicted or drama-intense relationship transactions.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; The Karpman Drama Triangle models the connection between personal responsibility and power in conflicts, and the destructive and shifting roles people play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murdoch, B.Ed.|first1=Edna|title=The Karpman Drama Triangle|url=http://coachingsupervisionacademy.com/thought-leadership/the-karpman-drama-triangle/|website=Coaching Supervision Academy|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined three roles in the conflict; Persecutor, Rescuer (the one up positions) and Victim (one down position). Karpman placed these three roles on an inverted triangle and referred to them as being the three aspects, or faces of drama. Karpman, who had interests in acting and was a member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], chose the term "drama triangle" rather than the term "conflict triangle" as the Victim in his model is not intended to represent an actual victim, but rather someone feeling or acting like a victim.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

# '''The Victim:''' The Victim's stance is ''"Poor me!"'' The Victim feels victimized, oppressed, helpless, hopeless, powerless, ashamed, and seems unable to make decisions, solve problems, take pleasure in life, or achieve insight. The Victim, if not being persecuted, will seek out a Persecutor and also a Rescuer who will save the day but also perpetuate the Victim's negative feelings.
# '''The Rescuer:'''  The rescuer's line is "Let me help you." A classic enabler, the Rescuer feels guilty if he/she doesn't go to the rescue. Yet his/her rescuing has negative effects: It keeps the Victim dependent and gives the Victim permission to fail. The rewards derived from this rescue role are that the focus is taken off of the rescuer. When he/she focuses their energy on someone else, it enables them to ignore their own anxiety and issues. This rescue role is also very pivotal because their actual primary interest is really an avoidance of their own problems disguised as concern for the victim’s needs.
# '''The Persecutor:''' (a.k.a. Villain) The Persecutor insists, ''"It's all your fault."'' The Persecutor is controlling, blaming, critical, oppressive, angry, authoritative, rigid, and superior.

Initially, a drama triangle arises when a person takes on the role of a victim or persecutor. This person then feels the need to enlist other players into the conflict. As often happens, a rescuer is encouraged to enter the situation.&lt;ref name=berne_hello&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berne, MD|first1=Eric|title=What Do You Say After You Say Hello?|date=1973|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780553232677|pages=186, 188, 307, 346}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enlisted players take on roles of their own that are not static, and therefore various scenarios can occur. For example, the victim might turn on the rescuer, the rescuer then switches to persecuting.

The motivations for each participant and the reason the situation endures is that each gets their unspoken (and frequently unconscious) psychological wishes/needs met in a manner they feel justified, without having to acknowledge the broader [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]] or harm done in the situation as a whole. As such, each participant is acting upon their own [[selfish]] needs, rather than acting in a genuinely responsible or [[altruistic]] manner.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Thus any character from all of three in this triangle might ''"ordinarily come on like a plaintive victim; it is now clear that the one can switch into the role of Persecutor providing it is 'accidental' and the one apologizes for it"''.&lt;ref name=berne_hello/&gt;

The motivations of the rescuer are the least obvious. In the terms of the drama triangle, the rescuer is someone who has a mixed or covert motive and is actually benefiting [[wikt:ego|egoically]] in some way from being "the one who rescues". The rescuer has a surface motive of resolving the problem and appears to make great efforts to solve it, but also has a hidden motive to not succeed, or to succeed in a way that they benefit. For example, they may get a self-esteem boost or receive respected rescue status, or derive enjoyment by having someone depend on them and trust them – and act in a way that ostensibly seems to be trying to help, but at a deeper level plays upon the victim in order to continue getting a payoff.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.

In some cases, the relationship between the victim and the rescuer can be one of [[codependency]]. The rescuer keeps the victim dependent on them by encouraging their victimhood. The victim gets their needs met by having the rescuer take care of them.

In general, participants tend to have a primary or habitual role (victim, rescuer, persecutor) when they enter into drama triangles. Participants first learn their habitual role in their family of origin. Even though participants each have a role with which they most identify, once on the triangle, participants rotate through all the positions, going completely around the triangle.&lt;ref name=forrest&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forrest, SW|first1=Lynne|title=The Three Faces of Victim — An Overview of the Drama Triangle|url=http://www.lynneforrest.com/articles/2008/06/the-faces-of-victim/|website=lynneforrest.com|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each triangle has a ''payoff'' for those playing it. The ''antithesis'' of a drama triangle lies in discovering how to deprive the actors of their payoff.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

==Historical context==

'''Family therapy movement.''' After World War II, therapists observed that while many battle-torn veteran patients readjusted well after returning to their families, some patients did not; some even regressed when they returned to their home environment. Researchers felt that they needed an explanation for this and began to explore the dynamics of family life – and thus began the family therapy movement. Prior to this time, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts focused on the patient’s already-developed psyche and downplayed outside detractors. Intrinsic factors were addressed and extrinsic reactions were considered as emanating from forces within the person.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

'''Transactions analysis.''' In the 1950s, Eric Berne, M.D. developed Transactional Analysis – a method for studying interactions between individuals. This approach was profoundly different than that of Freud. While Freud relied on asking patients about themselves, Berne felt that a therapist could learn by observing what was communicated (words, body language, facial expressions) in a transaction. So instead of directly asking the patient questions, Berne would frequently observe the patient in a group setting, noting all of the transactions that occurred between the patient and other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eric Berne Family|title=Transactional Analysis|url=http://www.ericberne.com/transactional-analysis/|website=Eric Berne, M.D.|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triangles/triangulation.''' The theory of [[Triangulation (psychology)|triangulation]] was originally published in 1966 by [[Murray Bowen| Murray Bowen, M.D.]] as one of eight parts of Bowen's family systems theory.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Murray Bowen, M.D., a pioneer in family systems theory, began his early work with schizophrenics at the [[Menninger Foundation|Menninger Clinic]], from 1946 to 1954. Triangulation is the “process whereby a two-party relationship that is experiencing tension will naturally involve third parties to reduce tension”.&lt;ref name=Rabstejnek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabstejnek, P.E., M.B.A., Ph.D.|first1=Carl V.|title=Family Systems &amp; Murray Bowen Theory|url=http://www.houd.info/bowenTheory.pdf|website=houd.info|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, when people find themselves in conflict with another person, they will reach out to a third person. The resulting triangle is more comfortable as it can hold much more tension because the tension is being shifted around three people instead of two.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

Bowen studied the [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] of the ''mother and her schizophrenic child'' while he had them both living in a research unit at the Menninger clinic. Bowen then moved to the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)]], where he resided from 1954 to 1959. At the NIMH Bowen extended his hypothesis to include the ''father-mother-child'' [[Triad (sociology)|triad]]. Bowen considered ''differentiation'' and ''triangles'' the crux of his theory, Bowen Family Systems Theory. Bowen intentionally used the word ''triangle'' rather than ''triad''. In Bowen Family Systems Theory, the triangle is an essential part of the relationship.

Couples left to their own resources oscillate between closeness and distance. Two people having this imbalance often have difficulty resolving it by themselves. To stabilize the relationship, the couple often seek the aid of a third party to help re-establish closeness. A triangle is the smallest possible relationship system that can restore balance in a time of stress. The third person assumes an outside position. In periods of stress, the outside position is the most comfortable and desired position. The inside position is plagued by anxiety, along with its emotional closeness. The outsider serves to preserve the inside couple’s relationship. Bowen noted that not all triangles are constructive – some are destructive.&lt;ref name=Rabstejnek/&gt;

'''Pathological/perverse triangles.''' In 1968, [[Nathan Ackerman| Nathan Ackerman, MD]] conceptualized a destructive triangle. Ackerman stated ''“we observe certain constellations of family interactions which we have epitomized as the pattern of family interdependence, roles those of destroyer or persecutor, the victim of the scapegoating attack, and the family healer or the family doctor.'' Ackerman also recognize the pattern of attack, defense, and counterattack, as shifting roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weeks, PhD|first1=Gerald R.|last2=L'Abate, PhD|first2=Luciano|title=Paradoxical Psychotherapy: Theory &amp; Practice With Individuals Couples &amp; Families|date=August 15, 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781138009400|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karpman triangles.''' In 1968, Stephen Karpman, M.D. theorizes the Karpman Drama Triangle in an article titled  ''Fairy tales and script drama analysis''. Karpman was a recent graduate of [[Duke University School of Medicine]] and was doing post post-graduate studies under Eric Berne at the time.&lt;ref name=triangle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karpman MD|first1=Stephen|title=Fairy tales and script drama analysis|journal=Transactional Analysis Bulletin|date=1968|volume=26|issue=7|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transactional analysis==
{{main|Transactional analysis}}

Eric Berne, a Canadian-born psychiatrist, created the theory of transactional analysis, in the middle of the 20th century, as a way of explaining human behavior. Berne's theory of transactional analysis was based on the ideas of [[Freud]] but was distinctly different. Freudian psychotherapists focused on talk therapy as a way of gaining insight to their patients' personalities. Berne believed that insight could be better discovered by analyzing patients’ social transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transactional Analysis|url=http://www.disorders.org/transactional-analysis/|website=disorders.org|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Games'' in transactional analysis refers to a series of transactions that is complementary (reciprocal), ulterior, and proceeds towards a predictable outcome. In this context, the Karpman Drama Triangle is a "game".

Games are often characterized by a switch in roles of players towards the end. The number of players may vary. Games in this sense are devices used (often [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]ly) by people to create a circumstance where they can justifiably feel certain resulting feelings (such as [[anger]] or superiority) or justifiably take or avoid taking certain actions where their own inner wishes differ from societal expectations. They are always a substitute for a more genuine and full adult emotion and response which would be more appropriate. Three quantitative variables are often useful to consider for games:
: '''Flexibility''': "The ability of the players to change the currency of the game (that is, the tools they use to play it). 'Some games...can be played properly with only one kind of currency, while others, such as exhibitionistic games, are more flexible",&lt;ref name=berne-games&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berne, M.D.|first1=Eric|title=Games People Play|date=1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|pages=45, 57|location=New York|isbn=978-0345410030}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that players may shift from words, to money, to parts of the body.
: '''Tenacity''': "Some people give up their games easily, others are more persistent", referring to the way people stick to their games and their resistance to breaking with them.
: '''Intensity''': "Some people play their games in a relaxed way, others are more tense and aggressive. Games so played are known as easy and hard games, respectively",&lt;ref name=berne-games/&gt; the latter being played in a tense and [[aggressive]] way.&lt;ref name="berne-games"/&gt;

The consequences of games may vary from small paybacks to paybacks built up over a long period to a major level. Based on the degree of acceptability and potential harm, games are classified into three categories, representing first degree games, second degree games, and third degree games:
* socially acceptable,
* undesirable but not irreversibly damaging 
* may result in drastic harm.&lt;ref name="berne-games"/&gt;

The Karpman triangle was an adaptation of a model that was originally conceived to analyze the [[play-action pass]] and the [[draw play]] in American football and later adapted as a way to analyze movie scripts. Karpman is reported to have doodled thirty or more diagram types before settling on the triangle. Karpman credits the movie ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' as being a [[testbed]] for refining the model into what Berne coined as the Karpman Drama Triangle.&lt;ref name=berneaward/&gt;

Karpman now has many variables of the Karpman triangle in his fully developed theory, besides role switches. These include space switches (private-public, open-closed, near-far) which precede, cause, or follow role switches, and script velocity (number of role switches in a given unit of time).&lt;ref name=berne_hello/&gt; These include the ''Question Mark triangle, False Perception triangle, Double Bind triangle, The Indecision triangle, the Vicious Cycle triangle, Trapping triangle, Escape triangle, Triangles of Oppression, and Triangles of Liberation, Switching in the triangle,'' and ''the Alcoholic Family triangle.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karpman, M.D.|first1=Stephen B.|title=The New Drama Triangles USATAA/ITAA Conference Lecture|url=http://karpmandramatriangle.com/pdf/thenewdramatriangles.pdf|website=karpmandramatriangle.com|accessdate=August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While transactional analysis is the method for studying interactions between individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solomon Ph.D.|first1=Carol|title=Transactional Analysis|url=http://www.ericberne.com/transactional-analysis/|website=Eric Berne, MD|publisher=University of California at San Francisco|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one researcher postulates that drama-based leaders can instill an organizational culture of drama. ''Persecutors'' are more likely to be in leadership positions and a ''prosecutor culture'' goes hand in hand with cutthroat competition, [[Culture of fear#In the workplace|fear]], blaming, manipulation, high [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] and an increased risk of lawsuits. There are also ''victim cultures'' which can lead to low morale and low [[Employee engagement|engagement]] as well as an [[Conflict avoidance#Conflict avoidance in the workplace|avoidance of conflict]], and ''rescuer cultures'' which can be characterized as having a high dependence on the leader, low initiative and low innovation.&lt;ref name="Regier2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nate Regier|title=Conflict without Casualties: A Field Guide for Leading with Compassionate Accountability|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ek75DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32|date=24 April 2017|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|isbn=978-1-5230-8262-9|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic models==
'''The Winner's Triangle''' was published by Acey Choy in 1990 as a therapeutic model for showing patients how to alter social transactions when entering a triangle at any of the three entry points. Choy recommends that anyone feeling like a victim think more in terms of being ''vulnerable and caring'', that anyone cast as a persecutor adopt an ''assertive'' posture, and anyone recruited to be a rescuer should react by being "caring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choy|first1=Acey|title=The Winner's Triangle|journal=Transactional Analysis Journal|date=1990|volume=20|issue=1|page=40|url=http://scribd.com/doc/52446575/TAJ-1990-Acey-Choy-The-winners-triangle-r#scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Vulnerable'' –  a victim should be encouraged to accept their vulnerability,  problem solve, and be more self-aware.
* ''Assertive'' – a persecutor should be encouraged to ask for what they want, be assertive, but not be punishing.
* ''Caring'' – a rescuer should be encouraged to show concern and be caring, but not over-reach and problem solve for others.

'''The Power of TED''', first published in 2009, recommends that the "victim" adopt the alternative role of ''creator'', view the persecutor as a ''challenger'', and enlist a ''coach'' instead of a rescuer.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Power of TED|last=Emerald|first=David|publisher=Polaris Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-09968718-0-8|edition=3rd|location=|pages=1–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Creator'' – victims are encouraged to be outcome-oriented as opposed to problem-oriented and take responsibility for choosing their response to life challenges. They should focus on resolving "dynamic tension" (the difference between current reality and the envisioned goal or outcome) by taking incremental steps toward the outcomes he or she is trying to achieve.
* ''Challenger'' – a victim is encouraged to see a persecutor as a person (or situation) that forces the creator to clarify his or her needs, and focus on their learning and growth.
* ''Coach'' – a rescuer should be encouraged to ask questions that are intended to help the individual to make informed choices. The key difference between a rescuer and a coach is that the coach sees the creator as capable of making choices and of solving his or her own problems. A coach asks questions that enable the creator to see the possibilities for positive action, and to focus on what he or she does want instead of what he or she does not want.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

'''Kendell Geers''' is a [[South Africa]]n conceptual artist.

==Life==
Kendell Geers was born in Johannesburg into a white working-class Afrikaans family during the time of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Salon | Artist Talk | Manifesta 9: FIRED UP by Kendell Geers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGJDXFKIz0U&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becoming aware of the political struggles in his country, he ran away from home at the age of 15 to get involved in the anti-apartheid movement. 
Kendell finished his schooling at the end of 1984. At the beginning of 1985, to avoid conscription, he enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for a Fine Arts degree.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Siebrits,States of Emergency 1985-1990, "Irrespektiv." BOM / Actar, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1988, Kendell Geers was one of 143 young men who publicly refused to serve in the South African Defence Force and faced either a life in exile or six years' imprisonment in a civilian jail.&lt;ref&gt;Merret, C., Saunders, C., in Switzer L., Adhikari M., ''South Africa's Resistance'', Ohio University Press, 2000, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he left South Africa and lived for a brief period in exile in the United Kingdom and New York where he worked as an assistant to artist [[Richard Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Clive Kellner, Kendell Geers 1988-2012, Prestel, 2012, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was only after [[Nelson Mandela]] and other political prisoners' release from prison, that Geers could return from exile to Johannesburg without fear of being imprisoned. In 1990, he returned to [[Johannesburg]] where he worked as an artist, and art critic, curator and performance artist. The first work of art he created back on South African soil was "Bloody Hell", a ritual washing of his white [[Afrikaaner]] [[Boer]] body with his own fresh blood.&lt;ref name="Fin de Partie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sans|first=Jerome|title=Hang Grenades From My Heart|year=2012|publisher=Blue Kingfisher|isbn=9789881506474|pages=23–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rejecting everything his family and his community stood for, in 1993 he changed his name to Kendell Geers and his date of birth to May 1968 as a political act, reclaiming his identity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Bourriaud, ''Kendell Geers: A Proletarian Gnosis'', ''Kendell Geers 1988-2012'', Munich, Prestel, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Brussels in 2003.

==Work==
Sometimes described as a political artist, Kendell Geers is known best for using a variety of colors and materials that signal danger such as sirens, broken glass, and barbed wire in an attempt to examine power structures, social injustices, and establishment values. Geers has worked with different media ranging from objects to large scale installation, neon works, performances and video.
Geers also uses words as a means to explore the coding and reinterpretation of language and its meaning and to communicate with his audience.

===Early work===
His work had heavily political elements from 1988 to 2000, during which time Geers, explored the moral and ethical contradictions of the apartheid system through his practice.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; He developed a visual vocabulary characterized by provocation as well as humor by using found objects such as barbed wire or glass shards. By appropriating historical events and ideas, he focused on questions of relationship between individual and society. It was in this context that Geers changed his date of birth to May 1968, the start of the student and civil revolution, and joined every political party in the period before South Africa’s first democratic elections, from the extreme right-wing to the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition traces the shift and the development of Kendell Geers' aesthetic language|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=59989#.US94rjdhAqA|work=Art Daily|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, he expressed his doubts about the fetishization of party politics.

He participated in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1993, the first time since the anti-[[Apartheid]] boycotts that South African artists had been invited.

From 1999 until 2004, Geers worked as the curator and art consult for [[Gencor]] which was later bought out by [[BHP Billiton]]. The collection focused on artists and works of art that were central to the [[apartheid|Anti-Apartheid Movement]] spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Williamson, South African Art in the Nineties: Part I, II &amp; III, [http://www.artthrob.co.za/00jan/news.html Artthrob]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Geers edited and published ''Contemporary South African Art,'' with essays by [[Okwui Enwezor]], [[Olu Oguibe]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary South African Art'', Jonathan Ball Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|978-1-86842-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiated by his move to Brussels in 2000, his later European period is characterized by a more poetic aesthetic.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; Here, Geers transferred his incendiary practice into a post-colonial and increasingly global context, suggesting more universal themes like terrorism, spirituality, and mortality. As such, the artist’s life and work can be said to constitute a living archive composed of political events, photographs, letters, and literary texts that serve as a source of inspiration and represent a continuation of his oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=haus der kunst|url=http://www.hausderkunst.de/index.php?id=132&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 a Geers retrospective called "1988-2012" opened at the [[Haus der Kunst]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=welt&gt;{{cite news|last=Reitter-Welter|first=Barbara|title=Hinweis warnt vor Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article113480460/Hinweis-warnt-vor-Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung.html|newspaper=Die Welt|date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The exhibition divided his life and work into two decade-long periods, the first political phase until 2000, and the later more poetic phase.

===Manifesto===
In 2011 Geers wrote a Manifesto in which through a series of statements, he explores the link between political and natural revolutions, mourns the loss of our talent for revolution and the underlying causes, and gives us clues on how to remember our inner selves to live a more true life.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Arts: A Journal of South-North Cultural and Media Studies 27(6), An Van Dienderen &amp; Kris Rutten, 2013, p. 655-660.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{taxation}}
The '''Leibzoll''' ([[German language|German]]: "body tax") was a special [[tariff|toll]] which Jews had to pay in most of the European states in the [[Middle Ages]] and up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.

== Rate of the toll ==

The origin of the Leibzoll may be traced to the political position of the Jews in Germany, where they were considered crown property and, therefore, under the king's protection. In his capacity as [[Holy Roman emperor]] the king claimed the exclusive rights of the jurisdiction and taxation of the Jews, and retained responsibility for the protection of their lives and their property. He granted them protection either by a guard or by safe-conduct; chiefly by the latter, for the Jews, being extensive travelers, when they went on long business trips could not always be accompanied by imperial guards. The first instance of the granting of one of these safe-conducts occurred under [[Louis le Débonnaire]] (814–840), and a specimen of it may be found among the documents preserved in the "[[formulary (medieval)|Liber Formularum]]" of that period. According to this document the king grants freedom of travel and exemption from all taxes to three Jews of Lyons "neque teloneum, neque paravereda aut mansionaticum, aut pulveraticum, aut cespitaticum, aut ripaticum, aut rotaticum, aut portaticum, aut herbaticum prædictis Hebræis exigere præsumant" (De Rozières, "Recueil Général des Formules Usitées dans l'Empire des Francs," i. 41–43, Paris, 1859–1871; Simson, "Jahrbücher des Fränkischen Reiches Unter Ludwig, dem Frommen," i. 393–396, Leipsic, 1874–76). For such a safe-conduct the Jews were required to pay a certain fee; but this, being understood, is not stated anywhere, as the payment constitutes the only reason for the exemption from other taxes. The stipulations regulating the tolls of Raffelstetten, {{Interlanguage link multi|Lorch (Oberösterreich)|de}}, issued between 904–906, are to be interpreted in the same manner—the Jews, as privileged merchants, shall not pay more than the regular toll ("justum theloneum"). The law expressly states this conforms with the ancient custom ([[Pertz]], "Mon. Germaniæ Leges," iii. 480; [[Georg Waitz]], "Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte", iv. 1, 70, Kiel, 1884; Scherer, "Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden," p. 110, Leipsic, 1901); the same is stated in the charter granted to the Jews of Worms, 1090 ("Zeitschrift für die Gesch. der Juden in Deutschland," i. 139). When the Jews passed under the jurisdiction of the territorial rulers, this principle was acknowledged. [[Frederick II of Austria]], in his law on the Jews, issued 1244, decreed that within the limits of his state they should not pay more than the legal rate of toll—the same rate that all other citizens had to pay (Scherer, l.c. p. 181). As in the stipulations regulating the {{Interlanguage link multi|tolls of Raffelstetten|de|3=Raffelstettener Zollordnung}}, and as in the law of Frederick II, only customs duties for goods or slaves were mentioned: therefore a personal tax was unknown.

As the Jews in increasing numbers passed under territorial jurisdiction, the exemption from personal tax, which was granted them as long as they remained crown property, was no longer respected, for each territorial ruler considered himself entitled to levy taxes on all foreign Jewish subjects who passed through his territory. But these taxes continued as customs duties until, with the growing hostility of the free cities, and with the frequent expulsion from vast territories which became the rule in the fifteenth century, those rulers who had expelled the Jews from their domains determined on the adoption of a policy of keeping them away from their borders. International relations, however, would not permit of the disregard of a passport granted by a foreign ruler to one of his subjects, so when Jews visited a territory in which no Jew was permitted to settle they were subjected to the payment of a toll.

== Development of Leibzoll ==

Owing to the weakness of the imperial power of the Holy Roman Empire, Jews expelled from a place could easily settle in the vicinity, and on the strength of their passports do business in the place from which they had been expelled. So the Jews expelled from [[Nuremberg]] in 1499 settled in [[Fürth]]; those expelled from [[Nördlingen]] (1507) settled in {{Interlanguage link multi|Kleinerdlingen|de}}; those who could not gain entrance into the city of [[Lübeck]] settled in the village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Lübeck-Moisling|de}}—all places of settlement within easy walking distance of the cities in which they were denied residence. On the passports issued to them by their respective sovereigns they could engage in trade in the latter places, at least during the day, and, therefore, since the local governments wished to enforce the decrees excluding the Jews, they were driven to adopt new measures ("R. E. J." viii. 212). Administrators soon recognized the financial utility of the Leibzoll, and the territorial rulers in the German empire levied such a toll from all traveling Jews, whether foreigners or their own subjects. In Nuremberg the average annual value of the toll for the last ten years during which Leibzoll was levied (1797–1806) was 2,448 [[South German gulden|florins]] (Barbeck, "Gesch. der Juden in Nürnberg und Fürth," p. 106, Nuremberg, 1878).

The wording of the laws sometimes also suggests an intention of humiliating the Jews. For example, an ordinance of [[Philip V of Spain]] (1703) fixes the toll for a wagon-load of merchandise, one head of cattle, or one Jew, when passing over the bridges of [[Luxembourg]], at four [[sols]] ("R. E. J." viii. 208). Sometimes the humiliation lay in the form in which the tax was levied. In some places a Jew passing a toll-gate had to cast dice in remembrance of the crucifixion (Grätz, "Gesch." 3d ed., viii. 14); elsewhere, as in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]], in [[Saxony]], Jews were forced to pay for a guard to follow them as long as they remained within the city. Even after the Leibzoll had been officially abolished, as in Austria by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1782, Jews entering Vienna or staying there for some time had to pay a special tax which differed from Leibzoll only in name. The same may be said of Nuremberg, where Leibzoll was abolished theoretically in 1800, but was levied practically until 1806 under the name of "Passier- und Eintrittsgeld". In [[Warsaw]], where the French government had emancipated the Jews, the Russian government re-introduced the Leibzoll under the name of "Tagzettel", requiring every Jew entering the city to pay five silver [[groschen]] for the first day and three for every additional day he remained ("Allg. Zeit. des Jud." 1862, p. 12).

== Exemptions ==

Certain exemptions from Leibzoll were granted. Under the Austrian law of 1244, corpses were exempt. [[Albert III, Duke of Austria]] gave free safe-conduct to three Austrian Jews to bring "[[Etrog|etrogim]]" from [[Triest]] free of duty in 1389 (Scherer, l.c. p. 535). The Jews living within the territory of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Elector of Mayence]] were exempted from Leibzoll when they were traveling to attend one of the regular landtags, or to meetings of the district congregations (see Bamberger, "Histor. Berichte über die Juden der Stadt Aschaffenburg," p. 26, Strasburg, 1900). As a mark of special favor, court Jews or [[Mentha|mint]]-farmers were exempt from the payment of such tolls (see [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]]). Later the exemption was extended to manufacturers; and [[Hirsch David]], [[velvet]]-manufacturer of Berlin, was exempted by the king (1731) because his business required him to travel frequently ("Allg. Zeit. des Jud." 1902, p. 477). When Meyerbeer went to Vienna, the "Judenamt" received orders to treat him "not as a Jew, but as a cavalier" (ib. 1847, p. 91). Native Jews were often exempted, for a fixed sum, from paying this toll, but naturally this freed them from it only within the confines of their own country. Thus the Jews of Saxony were exempt from the Leibzoll by an order dated 16 April 1773 (Levy, "Geschichte der Juden in Sachsen," p. 71, Berlin, 1901). The Jews of Berlin compromised with the elector, in 1700, by paying 1,000 [[ducats]] annually; this sum ("Jüdische Presse," 22 Aug. 1902) exempted only those who were in the possession of a lawful charter ("Schutzbrief"), which had replaced the old safe-conduct ("Judengeleit"), and who therefore were called "vergleitete Juden" or ''escorted Jews''.

In December, 1787, [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of [[Prussia]] abolished the Leibzoll in Berlin, and in July, 1788, he abolished it in other places. The abolition of the toll was due largely to the exertions of [[David Friedländer]]. In 1791 the [[Bishop of Salzburg]] also abolished the toll in his own dominions.

Notwithstanding the liberal spirit which these abolitions showed, the majority of the German states still clung to the tax. With the advent of the French, however, some of them were compelled to abolish the Leibzoll. Early in July, 1798, the French general Cacatte informed the members of the government at [[Nassau-Usingen]] that, at the order of the division commander Freitag, the special taxes of the Jews were to be abolished, as they were repugnant to justice and humanity. In consequence of this order the Jews on the left bank of the [[Rhine]] were relieved from the payment of Leibzoll. At the conclusion of the [[peace of Lunéville]] (21 July 1801) the toll was re-imposed.

== Wolf Breidenbach ==

At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Jews of Germany found a courageous champion in {{Interlanguage link multi|Wolf Breidenbach|de}}, who worked persistently for the abolition of this impost. Perceiving that ample resources would be required to carry on his campaign, and not being personally able to command these, he invoked the aid of the German and foreign Jews in 1803, asking them to subscribe to the fund raised for this purpose. He instituted negotiations with the minor German princes at the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|Diet of Ratisbon]] (1804), and, aided by [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg|Dalberg]], the imperial chancellor, succeeded in obtaining free passage for the Jews throughout the Rhine provinces and [[Bavaria]]. It was largely due to his efforts that the Leibzoll was abolished in [[Kurhessen]], [[Hohenlohe]], [[Neuwied]], [[Wied-Runkel]], [[Braunfels]], [[Solms-Rödelheim]], and also in [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]] (September, 1806). The emancipation of the Jews from these imposts created much antagonism; and among those opposed to it were such men as Paalzow, Grattenauer, and Buchholz. In the northern [[Hanse]] towns the French garrisons compelled the burghers to relieve the Jews from the payment of the Leibzoll, and, notwithstanding much opposition, secured the privilege for the Jews of [[Hamburg]], [[Lübeck]], and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. The Leibzoll was abolished in [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] 23 April 1823, through the efforts of [[Israel Jacobson]], court agent to the [[Duke of Brunswick]]. Although the tax had been almost universally abolished, its collection still continued from the Jews visiting [[Vienna]] in the reign (1804–1835) of [[Francis I of Austria]]. Of the German states, [[Saxony]] was the last to abolish it.

== Russia ==

Up to 1862 the Polish Jews visiting [[Russia]] were treated as foreigners, and as such were not admitted into the interior of the empire. On the other hand, the Russian Jews had great difficulty in entering Poland, and those who went there for business had to pay a "Geleitzoll." In 1826 the representatives of the Jewish community of [[Kovno]] petitioned the government for the abolition of the tax, which amounted then to fifteen [[Polish florins]]. By order of Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] this application was referred to the [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich]], then [[Viceroy]] of Poland, who stated that he considered the abolition of the tax inexpedient, but proposed decreasing its amount and regulating it according to age, sex, and business occupation. He deemed it advisable to introduce a similar tax in Russia, and suggested that each Polish Jew entering Russia, and each Russian Jew entering Poland, should be supplied with a pass descriptive of the place of its issuance, the bearer's business, etc. The local police was to be charged with the inspection of the passes. In consequence of this report, Emperor Nicholas ordered the minister of finance to communicate with the proper authorities, and to draft the regulations for the introduction of the tax in question. After a prolonged correspondence with the Polish authorities the minister found the proposed measure to be inexpedient, not only because of the decrease in the revenues which it would effect, but also because of possible complications and abuses in its enforcement. The "Geleitzoll", therefore, remained until abolished by an [[ukase]] of 24 May 1862.

[[File:loi m.gif|thumb|A typical LOI]]A '''letter of intent''' ('''LOI''' or '''LoI''', and sometimes capitalized as ''Letter of Intent'' in legal writing, but only when referring to a specific document under discussion) is a document outlining one or more agreements between two or more parties before the agreements are finalized. The concept is similar to a [[Heads of agreement (law)|heads of agreement]], [[term sheet]] or [[memorandum of understanding]]. Such outlined agreements may be mergers and acquisitions transaction agreements,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.themalawyer.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ma-letters-of-intent/|title = What you need to know about M&amp;A letters of Intent|date = July 20, 2015|accessdate = August 28, 2015|website = The M&amp;A Lawyer Blog|publisher = Jasso Lopez PLLC|last = Lopez|first = Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; joint venture agreements, real property lease agreements and several other categories of agreements that may govern material transactions.
* LOIs resemble short, written [[contract]]s, but are usually in tabular form and not binding on the parties in their entirety. Many LOIs, however, contain provisions that are binding, such as those governing [[non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure]], [[governing law]], [[Exclusive right|exclusivity]] or [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] to negotiate in [[good faith]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An LOI may sometimes be interpreted by a court of law as binding the parties to it if it too-closely resembles a formal contract and does not contain clear disclaimers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mintz.com/newsletter/2013/Advisories/3203-0713-NAT-COR/index.html|title = When a Non-binding Term Sheet Becomes Binding|date = July 8, 2013|accessdate = August 28, 2015|website = Mintz Levin|publisher = Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo PC|last = Burwell|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter of intent may be presented by one party to another party and subsequently negotiated before execution (or signature). If carefully negotiated, an LOI may serve to protect both parties to a transaction. For example, a seller of a business may incorporate what is known as a non-solicitation provision, which would restrict the buyer's ability to hire an employee of the seller's business should the two parties not be able to close the transaction. On the other hand, an LOI may protect the buyer of a business by expressly conditioning its obligation to complete the transaction if is unable to secure financing for the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exitpromise.com/letter-of-intent-to-buy-or-sell-a-business/|title=Letter of Intent to Buy A Business - Exit Promise|author=|date=11 March 2013|website=exitpromise.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes of an LOI ==
Common purposes of an LOI are:
* To allow parties to sketch out fundamental terms quickly before expending substantial resources on negotiating definitive agreements, finalizing due diligence, pursuing third-party approvals and other matters&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* To declare officially that the parties are currently negotiating, as in a [[merger]] or [[joint venture]] proposal
* To provide safeguards in case a deal collapses during negotiation
* To verify certain issues regarding payments made for someone else (''e.g.'', credit card payments)

Potential downsides to using an LOI may include:
* The parties may engage in protracted negotiations on only a subset of a deal’s terms
* Management time and focus may be diverted
* Alternative opportunities may be missed and markets may move against the parties during negotiations
* Parties may reduce their lack of a workable deal framework into an LOI, with a hope of making progress later
* Public disclosure obligations may be inadvertently triggered
* The risk of leaks, exacerbated by the desire of some to tout the LOI to the world, or shop it to other parties&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specific examples==
{{See also|National Letter of Intent}}
In [[academia]], a letter of intent is part of the application process,{{clarify|date=November 2011|reason=For what? Grad school? Grants?}} in which it is also known as a statement of purpose or [[Admissions essay|application essay]]. In education in the [[United States]], letters of intent are also frequently reached between high school senior athletes and colleges/universities, for the reservation of [[athletic scholarship]]s for the athletes upon graduation from high school.  [[Head teacher|School administrator]]s in [[secondary education]] often require a letter of intent before approving the formation of a [[Extracurricular activity|student club]].

In [[real estate]], in cases where the [[real property]] in question is not listed on a [[multiple listing service]], there may not be an easy way to notify the owner of the property and other interested parties of intent to purchase. Often it is necessary to officially begin the process of a purchase, and allow all peripheral interested parties to begin any other processes, with a letter of intent. For example, a multimillion-dollar loan for a commercial property may require a letter of intent before a financial institution will allow personnel to spend time working on said loan necessary for the completion of the sale. The same may be followed at the time of purchase by any company. A tenant and landlord may sign a letter of intent prior to signing a lease agreement to stipulate rental rates and all regulations of the future tenancy.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

In the [[solicitation]] of government grants, a letter of intent is highly encouraged but it is not required or binding, and does not enter into the review of a subsequent application.  The information that it contains allows agency staff to estimate the potential workload and plan the review.&lt;ref name="WSHCA"&gt;Typical example: {{Citation|author= |title=2008 Grant Solicitation for Consumer-Controlled Health Record Bank Pilots |url=http://www.hca.wa.gov/hit/documents/officialhrbgrant051408.pdf |accessdate=2008-05-21 |publisher=Washington State Health Care Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723192909/http://www.hca.wa.gov/hit/documents/officialhrbgrant051408.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within non-dualism, Lila is a way of describing all [[reality]], including the [[cosmos]], as the outcome of creative play by the divine absolute ([[Brahman]]).

==Modern interpretations==

{{quote|{{Anchor|misra}}Brahman is full of all perfections. And to say that Brahman has some purpose in creating the world will mean that it wants to attain through the process of creation something which it has not. And that is impossible. Hence, there can be no purpose of Brahman in creating the world. The world is a mere spontaneous creation of Brahman. It is a Lila, or sport, of Brahman. It is created out of Bliss, by Bliss and for Bliss. Lila indicates a spontaneous sportive activity of Brahman as distinguished from a self-conscious volitional effort. The concept of Lila signifies freedom as distinguished from necessity.|Ram Shanker Misra|''The Integral [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitism]] of [[Sri Aurobindo]]''}}

{{quote|{{Anchor|zimmer_campbell}}The relation of [[Purusha|Purusa]] to [[Prakrti]]—the unfolding force of nature—becomes here a relation of male to female. This is expressed in the Siva temple in the core image of the sivalinga, an expression of male ([[Lingam|linga]]) and female ([[yoni]]) union. The basic [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic]] motif of an unfolding or flowering cosmos is expressed here specifically in the relation of male to female, as well as in terms of consciousness and intentionality (in the concept of lila as the divine play of male and female). As such, the core [[Shaivism|saivite]] image of cosmogony as the flowering of consciousness and sexual union rather than the sacrificial act. This theme resonates with other Hindu doctrines, such as [[Tantra]] and [[Shaktism|Sakta]].|[[Heinrich Zimmer]] and [[Joseph Campbell]]|''Philosophies of India''}}

{{Quote|{{Anchor|bastin}}The Vendantic yogi never tires of stating that [[Moksha|kaivalya]], "isolation-integration", can be attained only by turning away from the distracting allure of the world and worshiping with single-pointed attention the formless Brahman-Atman; to the Tantric, however—as to the normal child of the world—this notion seems pathological, the wrong-headed effect of a certain malady of intellect. (...) "I like eating sugar," as [[Ramprasad Sen|Ramprasad]] said, "but I have no desire to become sugar." Let those who suffer from the toils of [[samsara]] seek release: the perfect devotee does not suffer; for he can both visualize and experience life and the universe as the revelation of that Supreme Divine Force ([[shakti]]) with which he is in love, the all-comprehensive Divine Being in its cosmic aspect of playful, aimless display (lila)—which precipitates pain as well as joy, but in its bliss transcends them both.|Rohan Bastin|''The Domain of Constant Excess: Plural Worship at the Munnesvaram Temples in [[Sri Lanka]]''}}

{{Quote|{{Anchor|capra}}The basic recurring theme in Hindu mythology is the creation of the world by the self-sacrifice of God—"sacrifice" in the original sense of "making sacred"—whereby God becomes the world which, in the end, becomes again God. This creative activity of the Divine is called lila, the play of God, and the world is seen as the stage of the divine play. Like most of  Hindu mythology, the myth of lila has a strong magical flavour. Brahman is the great magician who transforms himself into the world and then performs this feat with his "magic creative power", which is the original meaning of maya in the Rig Veda. The word maya—one of the most important terms in Indian philosophy—has changed its meaning over the centuries. From the might, or power, of the divine actor and magician, it came to signify the psychological state of anybody under the spell of the magic play. As long as we confuse the myriad forms of the divine lila with reality, without perceiving the unity of Brahman underlying all these forms, we are under the spell of maya. (...) In the Hindu view of nature, then, all forms are relative, fluid and ever-changing maya, conjured up by the great magician of the divine play. The world of maya changes continuously, because the divine lila is a rhythmic, dynamic play. The dynamic force of the play is karma, an important concept of Indian thought. Karma means "action". It is the active principle of the play, the total universe in action, where everything is dynamically connected with everything else. In the words of the Gita Karma is the force of creation, wherefrom all things have their life.|[[Fritjof Capra]]|''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975)}}

==Implications==
Hindu denominations differ on how a human should react to awareness of Lila. [[Karma Yoga]] allows a joyful embrace of all aspects of life ("intentional acceptance") while maintaining distinction from the Supreme, while [[Bhakti Yoga|Bhakti]] and [[Jnana Yoga]] advocate striving for oneness with the Supreme. Lila is an important idea in the traditional worship of [[Krishna]] (as prankster) and [[Shiva]] (as dancer), and has been used by modern writers like [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]], [[Fritjof Capra]], and [[Alan Watts]].

Lila is comparable to the Western [[theology|theological]] position of [[Pandeism]], which describes the Universe as God taking a physical form in order to experience the interplay between the elements of the Universe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38880">The '''McGurk effect''' is a [[perception|perceptual]] phenomenon that demonstrates an interaction between [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] and [[Visual perception|vision]] in [[speech perception]]. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound.&lt;ref name="Nath 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Nath |first1= A.R. |last2= Beauchamp |first2= M.S. |title= A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion |journal= NeuroImage |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages= 781–787 |date=Jan 2012 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024 |pmid= 21787869 |pmc= 3196040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Calvert |first1=Gemma |last2=Spence |first2= Charles |last3= Stein |first3= Barry E. |title= The handbook of multisensory processes |date=2004 |publisher= MIT Press |location= Cambridge, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-262-03321-3 |oclc= 54677752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boersma 2001"&gt;{{Cite web |last= Boersma |first= Paul |title= A constraint-based explanation of the McGurk effect |url= http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/papers/McGurk3.pdf |date=2011 |accessdate= 19 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, they may be more likely to experience the McGurk effect.&lt;ref name="Massaro 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Massaro |first1=D.W. |last2=Cohen |first2=M.M. |title= Tests of auditory-visual integration efficiency within the framework of the fuzzy logical model of perception |journal= Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume= 108 |issue=2 |pages= 784–789 |date=Aug 2000 |doi= 10.1121/1.429611 |pmid= 10955645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at [[sensory integration]] have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt; Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.

==Background==
It was first described in 1976 in a paper by [[Harry McGurk]] and [[John MacDonald (developmental psychologist)|John MacDonald]], titled "Hearing Lips and Seeing Voices" in ''Nature'' (23 Dec 1976).&lt;ref name=McGurk1976&gt;{{cite journal |title= Hearing lips and seeing voices |author= McGurk H., MacDonald J. |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |year=1976 |volume= 264 |issue= 5588 |pages= 746–8 |pmid= 1012311 |doi= 10.1038/264746a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was discovered by accident when McGurk and his research assistant, MacDonald, asked a technician to dub a video with a different [[phoneme]] from the one spoken while conducting a study on how infants perceive language at different developmental stages. When the video was played back, both researchers heard a third phoneme rather than the one spoken or mouthed in the video.&lt;ref name="Haskins Laboratories"&gt;{{cite web |title= The McGurk Effect: Hearing lips and seeing voices|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/featured/heads/mcgurk.html |accessdate= 2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect may be experienced when a video of one [[phoneme]]'s production is dubbed with a sound-recording of a different phoneme being spoken. Often, the perceived phoneme is a third, intermediate phoneme. As an example, the syllables /ba-ba/ are spoken over the lip movements of /ga-ga/, and the perception is of /da-da/. McGurk and MacDonald originally believed that this resulted from the common [[Phonetics|phonetic]] and visual properties of /b/ and /g/.&lt;ref name="maintwo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barutchu|first=Ayla |author2=Crewther |author3=Kiely |author4=Murphy |title=When /b/ill with /g/ill becomes /d/ill: Evidence for a lexical effect in audiovisual speech perception|journal=European Journal of Cognitive Psychology|year=2008|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1080/09541440601125623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two types of illusion in response to incongruent audiovisual stimuli have been observed: fusions ('ba' auditory and 'ga' visual produce 'da') and combinations ('ga' auditory and 'ba' visual produce 'bga').&lt;ref name="backfour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colin | first1 = C. | last2 = Radeau | first2 = M. | last3 = Deltenre | first3 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Top-down and bottom-up modulation of audiovisual integration in speech | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 541–560 | doi=10.1080/09541440440000168}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the brain's effort to provide the consciousness with its best guess about the incoming information.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;O’Shea, M. (2005). ''The Brain: A Very Short Introduction.'' Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The information coming from the eyes and ears is contradictory, and in this instance, the eyes (visual information) have had a greater effect on the brain and thus the fusion and combination responses have been created.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

Vision is the primary sense for humans,&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt; but speech perception is [[multimodal interaction|multimodal]], which means that it involves information from more than one sensory modality, in particular, [[Hearing (sense)|audition]] and [[Visual perception|vision]]. The McGurk effect arises during phonetic processing because the integration of audio and visual information happens early in speech perception.&lt;ref name="maintwo" /&gt; The McGurk effect is very robust; that is, knowledge about it seems to have little effect on one's perception of it. This is different from certain [[optical illusion]]s, which break down once one 'sees through' them. Some people, including those that have been researching the phenomenon for more than twenty years, experience the effect even when they are aware that it is taking place.&lt;ref name="backfour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="infeight"&gt;Rosenblum, L. D. (2010). ''See what I'm saying: The extraordinary powers of our five senses''. New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of people who can identify most of what is being said from [[Lip reading|speech-reading]] alone, most people are quite limited in their ability to identify speech from visual-only signals.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt; A more extensive phenomenon is the ability of visual speech to increase the intelligibility of heard speech in a noisy environment.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt; Visible speech can also alter the perception of perfectly audible speech sounds when the visual speech stimuli are mismatched with the auditory speech.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt; Normally, speech perception is thought to be an auditory process;&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt; however, our use of information is immediate, automatic, and, to a large degree, unconscious&lt;ref name="infeight" /&gt; and therefore, despite what is widely accepted as true, speech is not only something we hear.&lt;ref name="infeight" /&gt; Speech is perceived by all of the senses working together (seeing, touching, and listening to a face move).&lt;ref name="infeight" /&gt; The brain is often unaware of the separate sensory contributions of what it perceives.&lt;ref name="infeight" /&gt; Therefore, when it comes to recognizing speech the brain cannot differentiate whether it is seeing or hearing the incoming information.&lt;ref name="infeight" /&gt;

It has also been examined in relation to witness testimony. Wareham and Wright's 2005 study showed that inconsistent visual information can change the perception of spoken utterances, suggesting that the McGurk effect may have many influences in everyday perception. Not limited to syllables, the effect can occur in whole words&lt;ref name="maintwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="backsix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentilucci | first1 = M. | last2 = Cattaneo | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Automatic audiovisual integration in speech perception | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 167 | issue = 1| pages = 66–75 | doi=10.1007/s00221-005-0008-z | pmid=16034571}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have an effect on daily interactions that people are unaware of. Research into this area can provide information on not only theoretical questions, but also it can provide therapeutic and diagnostic relevance for those with disorders relating to audio and visual integration of speech cues.&lt;ref name="brainone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 = G. | last2 = Thielmann | first2 = A. | last3 = Ziegler | first3 = W. | year = 2009 | title = The influence of visual and auditory information on the perception of speech and non-speech oral movements in patients with left hemisphere lesions | url = | journal = Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 208–221 | doi=10.1080/02699200802399913| pmid = 19283578 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal factors==

===Damage===
Both [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres of the brain]] make a contribution to the McGurk effect.&lt;ref name="brainsix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baynes | first1 = K. | last2 = Fummell | first2 = M. | last3 = Fowler | first3 = C. | year = 1994 | title = Hemispheric contributions to the integration of visual and auditory information in speech perception | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 55 | issue = 6| pages = 633–641 | doi=10.3758/bf03211678}}&lt;/ref&gt; They work together to integrate speech information that is received through the auditory and visual senses. A McGurk response is more likely to occur in right-handed individuals for whom the face has privileged access to the right hemisphere and words to the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name="brainsix" /&gt; In people that have had [[Corpus callosotomy|callosotomies]] done, the McGurk effect is still present but significantly slower.&lt;ref name="brainsix" /&gt; In people with [[lesion]]s to the left hemisphere of the brain, visual features often play a critical role in speech and language therapy.&lt;ref name="brainone" /&gt; People with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain show a greater McGurk effect than normal controls.&lt;ref name="brainone" /&gt; Visual information strongly influences speech perception in these people.&lt;ref name="brainone" /&gt; There is a lack of susceptibility to the McGurk illusion if left hemisphere damage resulted in a deficit to visual segmental speech perception.&lt;ref name="braineight"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = K. | last2 = Baum | first2 = S. | last3 = Cuddy | first3 = L. | last4 = Munhall | first4 = K. | year = 2002 | title = A case of impaired auditory and visual speech prosody perception after right hemisphere damage | url = | journal = Neurocase | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 314–322 | doi=10.1093/neucas/8.4.314}}&lt;/ref&gt; In people with right hemisphere damage, impairment on both visual-only and audio-visual integration tasks is exhibited, although they are still able to integrate the information to produce a McGurk effect.&lt;ref name="braineight" /&gt; Integration only appears if visual stimuli is used to improve performance when the auditory signal is impoverished but audible.&lt;ref name="braineight" /&gt; Therefore, there is a McGurk effect exhibited in people with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain but the effect is not as strong as a normal group.

===Disorders===

====Dyslexia====
[[Dyslexia|Dyslexic]] individuals exhibit a smaller McGurk effect than normal readers of the same [[Chronology|chronological]] age, but they showed the same effect as reading-level age-matched readers.&lt;ref name="braintwo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bastien-Toniazzo | first1 = M. | last2 = Stroumza | first2 = A. | last3 = Cavé | first3 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Audio-visual perception and integration in developmental dyslexia: An exploratory study using the McGurk effect | url = | journal = Current Psychology Letters | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 2–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexics particularly differed for combination responses, not fusion responses.&lt;ref name="braintwo" /&gt; The smaller McGurk effect may be due to the difficulties dyslexics have in perceiving and producing [[consonant cluster]]s.&lt;ref name="braintwo" /&gt;

====Specific language impairment====
Children with [[specific language impairment]] show a significantly lower McGurk effect than the average child.&lt;ref name="brainthree"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norrix | first1 = L. | last2 = Plante | first2 = E. | last3 = Vance | first3 = R. | last4 = Boliek | first4 = C. | year = 2007 | title = Auditory-visual integration for speech by children with and without specific language impairment | url = | journal = Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research | volume = 50 | issue = 6| pages = 1639–1651 | doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2007/111)| pmid = 18055778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They use less visual information in speech perception, or have a reduced attention to [[articulatory gestures]], but have no trouble perceiving auditory-only cues.&lt;ref name="brainthree" /&gt;

====Autism spectrum disorders====
Children with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) showed a significantly reduced McGurk effect than children without.&lt;ref name="brainfour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mongillo | first1 = E. | last2 = Irwin | first2 = J. | last3 = Whalen | first3 = D. | last4 = Klaiman | first4 = C. | year = 2008 | title = Audiovisual processing in children with and without autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = [[Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders]] | volume = 38 | issue = 7| pages = 1349–1358 | doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0521-y| pmid = 18307027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the stimulus was nonhuman (for example bouncing a tennis ball to the sound of a bouncing beach ball) then they scored similarly to children without ASD.&lt;ref name="brainfour" /&gt; Younger children with ASD show a very reduced McGurk effect; however, this diminishes with age. As the individuals grow up, the effect they show becomes closer to those that did not have ASD.&lt;ref name="brainfive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = N. | last2 = Isaac | first2 = C. | last3 = Milne | first3 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A comparison of the development of audiovisual integration in children with autism spectrum disorders and typically developing children | url = | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 40 | issue = 11| pages = 1403–1411 | doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1000-4| pmid = 20354776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the weakened McGurk effect seen in people with ASD is due to deficits in identifying both the auditory and visual components of speech rather than in the integration of said components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = J. H. G. | last2 = Massaro | first2 = D. W. | last3 = Peel | first3 = N. J. | last4 = Bosseler | first4 = A. | last5 = Suddendorf | first5 = T. | year = 2004 | title = Visual–auditory integration during speech imitation in autism | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422204000757 | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 25 | issue = 6| pages = 559–575 | doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2004.01.008| pmid = 15541632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language-learning disabilities====
Adults with language-learning disabilities exhibit a much smaller McGurk effect than other adults.&lt;ref name="brainseven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norrix | first1 = L. | last2 = Plante | first2 = E. | last3 = Vance | first3 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Auditory-visual speech integration by adults with and without language-learning disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Communication Disorders | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 22–36 | doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2005.05.003| pmid = 15950983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These people are not as influenced by visual input as most people.&lt;ref name="brainseven" /&gt; Therefore, people with poor language skills will produce a smaller McGurk effect. A reason for the smaller effect in this population is that there may be uncoupled activity between anterior and posterior regions of the brain, or left and right hemispheres.&lt;ref name="brainseven" /&gt;

====Alzheimer’s disease====
In patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), there is a smaller McGurk effect exhibited than in normals.&lt;ref name="brainnine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delbeuck | first1 = X. | last2 = Collette | first2 = F. | last3 = Van der Linden | first3 = M. | year = 2007 | title = Is Alzheimer's disease a disconnection syndrome? Evidence from a crossmodal audio-visual illusory experiment | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 45 | issue = 14| pages = 3315–3323 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.05.001 | pmid=17765932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often a reduced size of the [[corpus callosum]] produces a hemisphere disconnection process.&lt;ref name="brainnine" /&gt; Less influence on visual stimulus is seen in patients with AD, which is a reason for the lowered McGurk effect.&lt;ref name="brainnine" /&gt;

====Schizophrenia====
The McGurk effect is not as pronounced in [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] individuals as in normal individuals. However, it is not significantly different in adults.&lt;ref name="brainten"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearl | first1 = D. | last2 = Yodashkin-Porat | first2 = D. | last3 = Nachum | first3 = K. | last4 = Valevski | first4 = A. | last5 = Aizenberg | first5 = D. | last6 = Sigler | first6 = M. | last7 = Weizman | first7 = A. | last8 = Kikinzon | first8 = L. | year = 2009 | title = Differences in audiovisual integration, as measured by McGurk phenomenon, among adult and adolescent patients with schizophrenia and age-matched healthy control groups | url = | journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 186–192 | doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.06.004| pmid = 19216897 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenia slows down the development of audiovisual integration and does not allow it to reach its developmental peak. However, no degradation is observed.&lt;ref name="brainten" /&gt; Schizophrenics are more likely to rely on auditory cues than visual cues in speech perception.&lt;ref name="brainten" /&gt;

====Aphasia====
People with [[aphasia]] show impaired perception of speech in all conditions (visual-only, auditory-only, and audio-visual), and therefore exhibited a small McGurk effect.&lt;ref name="braineleven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Youse | first1 = K. | last2 = Cienkowski | first2 = K. | last3 = Coelho | first3 = C. | year = 2004 | title = Auditory-visual speech perception in an adult with aphasia | url = | journal = Brain Injury | volume = 18 | issue = 8| pages = 825–834 | doi=10.1080/02699000410001671784| pmid = 15204322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest difficulty for aphasics is in the visual-only condition showing that they use more auditory stimuli in speech perception.&lt;ref name="braineleven" /&gt;

==External factors==

===Cross-dubbing===
Discrepancy in vowel category significantly reduced the magnitude of the McGurk effect for fusion responses.&lt;ref name="facone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K.

===Mouth visibility===
The McGurk effect is stronger when the right side of the speaker's mouth (on the viewer's left) is visible.&lt;ref name="facfive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls | first1 = M. | last2 = Searle | first2 = D. | last3 = Bradshaw | first3 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Read my lips: Asymmetries in the visual expression and perception of speech revealed through the McGurk effect | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 138–141 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.01502011.x| pmid = 14738522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to get more visual information from the right side of a speaker's mouth than the left or even the whole mouth.&lt;ref name="facfive" /&gt; This relates to the hemispheric attention factors discussed in the brain hemispheres section above.

===Visual distractors===
The McGurk effect is weaker when there is a visual distractor present that the listener is attending to.&lt;ref name="facsix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tiippana | first1 = K. | last2 = Andersen | first2 = T. S. | last3 = Sams | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Visual attention modulates audiovisual speech perception | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 457–472 | doi=10.1080/09541440340000268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual attention modulates audiovisual speech perception.&lt;ref name="facsix" /&gt; Another form of distraction is movement of the speaker. A stronger McGurk effect is elicited if the speaker's face/head is motionless, rather than moving.&lt;ref name="faceight"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Irwin | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Whalen | first2 = D. H. | last3 = Fowler | first3 = C. A. | year = 2006 | title = A sex difference in visual influence on heard speech | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 582–592 | doi=10.3758/bf03208760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllable structure===
A strong McGurk effect can be seen for click-vowel syllables compared to weak effects for isolated clicks.&lt;ref name="facseven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brancazio | first1 = L. | last2 = Best | first2 = C. T. | last3 = Fowler | first3 = C. A. | year = 2006 | title = Visual influences on perception of speech and nonspeech vocal-tract events | url = | journal = Language and Speech | volume = 49 | issue = 1| pages = 21–53 | doi=10.1177/00238309060490010301| pmid = 16922061 | pmc = 2773261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the McGurk effect can happen in a non-speech environment.&lt;ref name="facseven" /&gt; [[Phonology|Phonological]] significance is not a necessary condition for a McGurk effect to occur; however, it does increase the strength of the effect.&lt;ref name="facseven" /&gt;

===Gender===
Females show a stronger McGurk effect than males. Women show significantly greater visual influence on auditory speech than men did for brief visual stimuli, but no difference is apparent for full stimuli.&lt;ref name="faceight" /&gt; Another aspect regarding gender is the issue of male faces and voices as stimuli in comparison to female faces and voices as stimuli. Although, there is no difference in the strength of the McGurk effect for either situation.&lt;ref name="facfour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K. | last2 = Kuhl | first2 = P. | last3 = Meltzoff | first3 = A. | last4 = Stevens | first4 = E. | year = 1991 | title = Integrating speech information across talkers, gender, and sensory modality: Female faces and male voices in the McGurk effect | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 50 | issue = 6| pages = 524–536 | doi=10.3758/bf03207536}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a male face is dubbed with a female voice, or vice versa, there is still no difference in strength of the McGurk effect.&lt;ref name="facfour" /&gt; Knowing that the voice you hear is different from the face you see – even if different genders – doesn’t eliminate the McGurk effect.&lt;ref name="infeight" /&gt;

===Familiarity===
Subjects who are familiar with the faces of the speakers are less susceptible to the McGurk effect than those who are unfamiliar with the faces of the speakers.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facnine" /&gt; On the other hand, there was no difference regarding voice familiarity.&lt;ref name="facnine" /&gt;

===Expectation===
[[Semantics|Semantic]] [[wikt:congruency|congruency]] had a significant impact on the McGurk illusion.&lt;ref name="facten"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Windmann | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Effects of sentence context and expectation on the McGurk illusion | url = | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 212–230 | doi=10.1016/j.jml.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is experienced more often and rated as clearer in the semantically congruent condition relative to the incongruent condition.&lt;ref name="facten" /&gt; When a person was expecting a certain visual or auditory appearance based on the semantic information leading up to it, the McGurk effect was greatly increased.&lt;ref name="facten" /&gt;

===Self influence===
The McGurk effect can be observed when the listener is also the speaker or [[Manner of articulation|articulator]].&lt;ref name="faceleven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sams | first1 = M. | last2 = Mottonen | first2 = R. | last3 = Sihvonen | first3 = T. | year = 2005 | title = Seeing and hearing others and oneself talk | url = | journal = Cognitive Brain Research | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 429–435 | doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.11.006| pmid = 15820649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While looking at oneself in the mirror and articulating visual stimuli while listening to another auditory stimulus, a strong McGurk effect can be observed.&lt;ref name="faceleven" /&gt; In the other condition, where the listener speaks auditory stimuli softly while watching another person articulate the conflicting visual gestures, a McGurk effect can still be seen, although it is weaker.&lt;ref name="faceleven" /&gt;

===Temporal synchrony===
[[Time|Temporal]] [[Synchronization|synchrony]] is not necessary for the McGurk effect to be present.&lt;ref name="factwelve"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munhall | first1 = K. | last2 = Gribble | first2 = P. | last3 = Sacco | first3 = L. | last4 = Ward | first4 = M. | year = 1996 | title = Temporal constraints on the McGurk effect | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 | doi=10.3758/bf03206811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects are still strongly influenced by auditory stimuli even when it lagged the visual stimuli by 180 milliseconds (point at which McGurk effect begins to weaken).&lt;ref name="factwelve" /&gt; There was less tolerance for the lack of synchrony if the auditory stimuli preceded the visual stimuli.&lt;ref name="factwelve" /&gt; In order to produce a significant weakening of the McGurk effect, the auditory stimuli had to precede the visual stimuli by 60 milliseconds, or lag by 240 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt;

===Physical task diversion===
The McGurk effect was greatly reduced when attention was diverted to a [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] task (touching something).&lt;ref name="facthirteen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alsius | first1 = A. | last2 = Navarra | first2 = J. | last3 = Soto-Faraco | first3 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Attention to touch weakens audiovisual speech integration | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 183 | issue = 1| pages = 399–404 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-007-1110-1 | pmid = 17899043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Touch is a sensory perception like vision and audition, therefore increasing attention to touch decreases the attention to auditory and visual senses.

===Gaze===
The eyes do not need to [[fixation (visual)|fixate]] in order to integrate audio and visual information in speech perception.&lt;ref name="facfifteen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paré | first1 = M. | last2 = Richler | first2 = C. | last3 = Hove | first3 = M. | last4 = Munhall | first4 = K. | year = 2003 | title = Gaze behavior in audiovisual speech perception: The influence on ocular fixations on the McGurk effect | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 533–567 | doi=10.3758/bf03194582}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no difference in the McGurk effect when the listener was focusing anywhere on the speaker's face.&lt;ref name="facfifteen" /&gt; The effect does not appear if the listener focuses beyond the speaker's face.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt; In order for the McGurk effect to become insignificant, the listener's gaze must deviate from the speaker's mouth by at least 60 degrees.&lt;ref name="facfifteen" /&gt;

==Other languages==
People of all languages rely to some extent on visual information in [[speech perception]], but the intensity of the McGurk effect can change between languages. Dutch,&lt;ref name="lantwo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sekiyama | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Cultural and linguistic factors in audiovisual speech processing: The McGurk effect in Chinese subjects | url = | journal = Perception and Psychophysics | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 73–80 | doi=10.3758/bf03206849}}&lt;/ref&gt; English, Spanish, German, Italian and Turkish &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erdener|first=D.|date=December 2015|title=The McGurk illusion in Turkish|url=http://www.turkpsikolojidergisi.com/PDF/TPD/76/en/02.pdf|journal=Turkish Journal of Psychology|volume=30|issue=76|pages=19–31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; language listeners experience a robust McGurk effect, while it is weaker for Japanese and Chinese listeners.&lt;ref name="lanseven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bavo | first1 = R. | last2 = Ciorba | first2 = A. | last3 = Prosser | first3 = S. | last4 = Martini | first4 = A. | year = 2009 | title = The McGurk phenomenon in Italian listeners | url = | journal = Acta Otorhinolaryngologica Italica | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 203–208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most research on the McGurk effect between languages has been conducted between English and Japanese. There is a smaller McGurk effect in Japanese listeners than in English listeners.&lt;ref name="lantwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lanone"&gt;Hisanaga, S., Sekiyama, K., Igasaki, T., Murayama, N. (2009).

Retrieved from http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/eurospeech_1995/e95_1699.html&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural practice of [[Eye contact#Cultural differences|face avoidance]] in Japanese people may have an effect on the McGurk effect, as well as [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] and [[Syllable#Structure|syllabic structures]] of the language.&lt;ref name="lantwo" /&gt; This could also be why Chinese listeners are less susceptible to visual cues, and similar to Japanese, produce a smaller effect than English listeners.&lt;ref name="lantwo" /&gt; Studies have also shown that Japanese listeners do not show a developmental increase in visual influence after the age of six, as English children do.&lt;ref name="lanone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lanthree" /&gt; Japanese listeners are more able to identify an incompatibility between the visual and auditory stimulus than English listeners are.&lt;ref name="lantwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lanthree" /&gt; This result could be in relation to the fact that in Japanese, [[consonant cluster]]s do not exist.&lt;ref name="lantwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lanfour" /&gt; In noisy environments where speech is unintelligible, however, people of all languages resort to using visual stimuli and are then equally subject to the McGurk effect.&lt;ref name="lantwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lanfour" /&gt; The McGurk effect works with speech perceivers of every language for which it has been tested.&lt;ref name="infeight" /&gt;

==Hearing impairment==
Experiments have been conducted involving hard of hearing individuals as well as individuals that have had [[cochlear implant]]s. These individuals tend to weigh visual information from speech more heavily than auditory information.&lt;ref name="hearingone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rouger | first1 = J. | last2 = Fraysse | first2 = B. | last3 = Deguine | first3 = O. | last4 = Barone | first4 = P. | year = 2008 | title = McGurk effects in cochlear-implanted deaf subjects | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1188 | issue = | pages = 87–99 | doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2007.10.049 | pmid=18062941}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to normal hearing individuals, this is not different unless there is more than one syllable, such as a word.&lt;ref name="hearingone" /&gt; Regarding the McGurk experiment, responses from cochlear implanted users produced the same responses as normal hearing individuals when an auditory [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] stimulus is dubbed onto a visual [[velar consonant|velar]] stimulus.&lt;ref name="hearingone" /&gt; However, when an auditory [[dental consonant|dental]] stimulus is dubbed onto a visual [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] stimulus, the responses are quite different. The McGurk effect is still present in individuals with impaired hearing or using cochlear implants, although it is quite different in some aspects.

==Infants==
By measuring an infant's attention to certain [[Audio-visual|audiovisual]] stimuli, a response that is consistent with the McGurk effect can be recorded.&lt;ref name="Calvert 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="infeight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="infthree"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bristow | first1 = D. | last2 = Dehaene-Lambertz | first2 = G. | last3 = Mattout | first3 = J. | last4 = Soares | first4 = C. | last5 = Gliga | first5 = T. | last6 = Baillet | first6 = S. | last7 = Mangin | first7 = J.

In the [[English law|English]] system of [[common law]], judges have devised a number of '''mechanisms''' to allow them to cope with [[judicial precedent|precedent decisions]].

==Issues of the common law==
According to [[Montesquieu]], it is [[Parliament]] that has the rightful power to legislate, not the judiciary.  The legal fiction is that judges do not make law, they merely "declare it".  Thus, common law is declaratory, and this is often retrospective in effect.  For example, see ''[[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds#The Shaw v DPP case|Shaw v DPP]]'' &lt;ref&gt;1962 AC 220 HL&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Conspiracy (criminal)|R v Knuller]]''&lt;ref&gt;1973 A C 435&lt;/ref&gt;  In the search for justice and fairness, there is a tension between the needs for, on one hand, predictability and stability, and "up-to date law", on the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Darbyshire on the English Legal System'' - 2017 - 12th ed - Penny Darbyshire&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a hierarchy of courts, and a hierarchy of decisions.  All lower courts are bound by the judgments from higher courts; and higher courts are not bound by decisions from lower courts.
	
With one exception, [[courts of record|courts of record]] are bound by their own precedent decisions. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] used to be bound by its own decisions, but in 1966 it issued a [[Practice Direction]] declaring that it would no longer feel so constrained;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[R v Shivpuri]]'' 1986, the House of Lords overruled its own decision in ''[[Anderton v Ryan]]'', made less than a year earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] is similarly free to depart from earlier decisions.  By contrast, the Court of Appeal is bound by its own decisions, although for a period [[Lord Denning]], [[Master of the Rolls|MR]], acted as though it were not.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Intention to be legally bound#Classical usage|Connell v MIB]]'' Lord Denning addressed but ignored the Court of Appeal's recent judgment in ''[[Coward v MIB]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the end of his career, Denning relented and acknowledged that the Court of Appeal was indeed bound by its own precedents.&lt;/ref&gt; Inferior courts are not strictly courts of record, but some, such as [[employment tribunal]]s methodically report their own cases, and have built up a specialist body of common law.  Courts such as the [[magistrates court]] cannot establish precedent.

Even if a court is bound to observe a precedent decision, it does not follow that the whole of the judgment is binding.  One must distinguish between ''[[ratio decidendi]]'' and ''[[obiter dicta]]''.  ''Ratio decidendi'' is the "reason for the decision", and forms the crux of the cases; whereas  ''obiter dicta'' is "other things that are said", i.e. matters said in passing, judicial asides, hypothetical issues, and broad issues. ''Ratio decidendi''  is binding on other courts,  whereas ''obiter dicta'' is persuasive only.

An effective test to see if a part of the judgment is ''ratio'' or ''obiter'' is "[[Eugene Wambaugh|Wambaugh's Inversion Test]]", whereby one must invert the question, and ask, "would the decision have been different without this part of the judgment?".  In other words, ask, "Is it '''crucial'''?".  If not, it is ''obiter dicta''.

If a judgment establishes a broad principle of law, then strictly speaking that principle is too wide to be said to be ''ratio decidendi''.  Nevertheless, if that broad principle is approved and applied by later courts, then the principle will eventually be treated as ''ratio''.  A particular example is the broad "neighbour principle", enunciated by [[Lord Atkin]] in ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''  1932, which has become the basis of the modern law of negligence.  When judges may face conflicting precedents, they may select the preferable case.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|Wagon Mound (No. 1)]]'', the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] opted to follow ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' rather than ''[[Re Polemis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissenting judgments are not ''ratio'', and so must be ''obiter''.  Sometimes, with the passage of time, more attention is given to the dissenting judgment that to the majority judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''English Legal System'' - 2015 - Slapper &amp; Kelly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''[[Junior Books v Veitchi]]''  1984, and ''[[Candler v Crane, Christmas &amp; Co]]'' 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish decisions (and decisions from the USA and common law jurisdictions in the Commonwealth) are, like ''obiter dicta'', merely persuasive in England.

==The mechanisms==

If faced with a binding judicial precedent, a court has a number of ways to respond to it, and may use the following legal devices and mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;[https://sixthformlaw.info/01_modules/mod2/2_1_1_precedent_mechanics/02_precedent_reversing_overuling_distinguishing.htm 6th form law]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Applying''' - simply following the precedent, and using its ''ratio'' in the current case.
* '''Approval''' - showing approval of the earlier case, without necessarily applying it.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Coward v MIB|Albert v M.I.B.]]'' [1971] 2 All ER 1345, the House of Lords approved Denning's decision in ''Connell v MIB''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Overruling''' - declaring the precedent to be wrong, making it bad law.&lt;ref&gt;A lower court may not overrule a judgment from a higher court.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The court in ''[[Murphy v Brentwood DC]]'' overruled  ''[[Anns v Merton London Borough Council]]'' 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Disapproval''' - showing disapproval of the earlier case, without necessarily overruling it.&lt;ref&gt;The court in ''[[Murphy v Brentwood DC]]'' also disapproved [[Lord Denning]]'s controversial analysis of [[Negative and positive rights|rights and duties]] in ''[[Dutton v Bognor Regis UDC]]'' 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''[[Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris (International) Ltd|The Great Peace]]'' the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] disapproved ''[[Solle v Butcher]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''[[Per incuriam]]''''' - declaring the precedent to be mistaken, because the earlier court failed to take note of a crucial precedent or statute.&lt;ref&gt;Lower courts, afraid of seeming impertinent or [[lèse-majesté|worse]], are disinclined to declare a precedent from a higher court to be ''per incuriam''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Foakes v Beer]]'' 1884 is arguably ''per incuriam'' for ignoring ''[[Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson ]]'' is arguably ''per incuriam'' for ignoring ''[[Derry v Peek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Distinguishing]]''' -	failing to follow a case because of a material distinction of fact.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Distinguishing#Examples|Read v Lyons]]'' 1947, the court distinguished ''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' on the basis that there had been "no escape" in the current case.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In both ''[[Balfour v Balfour]]'' (1919) and ''[[Merritt v Merritt]]'' (1971) a wife claimed against her husband for alleged breach of contract. In ''Balfour'' her claim failed for lack of intention to create legal relations; but in ''Merritt'', ''Balfour'' was distinguished and it was held the spouses had intended to be bound.[http://www.lawmentor.co.uk/glossary/D/distinguishing/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2426">In [[ethics]], questions regarding the '''morality of violence''' ask under what conditions, if any, the use of [[violence]] can be morally justified. Three prominent views on the morality of violence are (1) the [[pacifist]] position, which states that violence is always immoral, and should never be used; (2) the [[utilitarian]] position, which states that violence can be used if it brings about a net "good" for society; (3) a hybrid of these two views which both looks at what good comes from the use of violence, while also examining the types of violence used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Rapoport, David C. &amp; Alexander, Yonah|title=The Morality of terrorism: religious and secular justifications|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-231-06752-2|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqlgBwP86YoC&amp;pg=PA383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theologians have traditionally argued against the morality of violence, arguing that Christians should love their enemies as well as their friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pottenger, John R.|title=The political theory of liberation theology: toward a reconvergence of social values and social science|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-7914-0118-7|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5q2lpkCh24C&amp;pg=PA146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benito Mussolini]] often spoke about the morality of violence, arguing that violence was moral, and that it had spiritual importance as an expression of human will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kallis, Aristotle A.|title=Fascist ideology: territory and expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922-1945|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-21611-1|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pyKts5L3Na4C&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neue Slowenische Kunst''' (a [[German language|German]] phrase meaning "New Slovenian Art"), a.k.a. '''NSK''', is a controversial [[politics|political]] [[art collective]] that formed in [[Slovenia]] in [[1984 in music|1984]], when Slovenia was part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].  NSK's name, being German, is compatible with a theme in NSK works: the complicated relationship [[Slovenes]] have had with [[Germans]].  The name of NSK's music wing, [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]], is also the German name of the Slovene capital [[Ljubljana]]. The name created controversy because some felt it evoked memories of the Nazi annexation of Slovenia during the [[Second World War]]. It also refers to Slovenia's previous seven centuries as part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, Alexei.  Interrogation Machine.  MIT Press, 2005. p 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

NSK's best-known member is also its founder, the musical group [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]]. Other NSK members include groups such as [[IRWIN]] (visual art), [[Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre]] (also known as Red Pilot and Cosmokinetic Theatre Noordung), [[New Collective Studio]] (graphics; also known as New Collectivism), Retrovision (film and video), and the [[Department of Pure and Applied Philosophy]] (theory).&lt;ref name="state of art"&gt;Anonymous. "State of Art: the new Slovene Avant Garde" (2004). [[Northwest Film Forum]] and Scala House, program for exhibit November 18&amp;ndash;November 24, 2004 at Northwest Film Forum, [[Seattle]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hackett"&gt;Regina Hackett. "[https://archive.is/20120913130102/http://www.seattlepi.com/visualart/200214_visual19.html Slovenian art collective is adept at working politics and art]". ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', November 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The founding groups of the NSK were Laibach, IRWIN, and Scipion Nasice Sisters Theater. Membership has traditionally been open to all artistic groups who show an interest in challenging the norms and taboos of Slovene national identity.&lt;ref&gt;James Gow &amp; Cathie Carmichael, ''Slovenia and the Slovenes: A Small State and the New Europe'', C. Hurst &amp; Company, 2001, pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
NSK art often draws on symbols drawn from [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] or extreme [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements, often reappropriating totalitarian [[kitsch]] in a visual style reminiscent of [[Dada]]. NSK artists often [[wiktionary:juxtaposition|juxtapose]] symbols from different (and often incompatible) political ideologies. For example, a 1987 NSK-designed poster caused a scandal by winning a competition for the Yugoslavian [[Youth Day#Yugoslavia|Youth Day]] Celebration. The poster [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] a painting by [[Nazism|Nazi]] artist [[Richard Klein (artist)|Richard Klein]], replacing the [[flag of Nazi Germany]] with the [[Flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav flag]] and the [[German eagle]] with a dove.&lt;ref name="hackett"/&gt; Intended as an ironic joke, the painting soon fell foul of the authorities, who interpreted it as equating Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] with [[Adolf Hitler]]. It was later reproduced on the cover of ''[[Mladina]]'' magazine, and that particular issue was subsequently banned.&lt;ref&gt;Gow &amp; Carmichael, ''Slovenia and the Slovenes'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Both IRWIN and Laibach are emphatic about their work being collective rather than individual. Laibach's original songs and arrangements are always credited to the group itself, and individual musicians are not listed on their [[album cover]]s. At one point, there were even two separate groups touring under the name Laibach at the same time. Both had members of the original group. Similarly, the IRWIN artists never sign their work individually; instead, they are "signed" with a [[Rubber stamp|stamp]] or [[wikt:certificate|certificate]] indicating approval as a work from the IRWIN collective.

The NSK was the subject of a 1996 [[documentary film]] entitled ''[[Predictions of Fire]]'' (''Prerokbe Ognja''),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which was written and directed by [[Michael Benson (filmmaker)|Michael Benson]]. Among those interviewed is Slovenian intellectual [[Slavoj Žižek]].

==NSK State==
Since 1991, the NSK has claimed to be a sovereign [[Sovereign state|state]] of sorts,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; a claim similar to that of [[micronation]]s.  As such, displays of its members' work are performed under the guise of an embassy, or a territory of the supposed "state". Since 1994, the NSK has maintained [[Consulate general|consulates]] in several cities, including [[Umag]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It has also gone so far as to issue passports &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and postage stamps. In 2006, Laibach recorded the NSK National Anthem for their LP ''[[Volk (album)|Volk]]''. The anthem adopts its melody from another Laibach song, "The Great Seal." It includes a recitation of an excerpt from [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous "[[We shall fight them on the beaches]]/We shall never surrender" speech.

NSK passports are considered an art project. As such, they are not valid for travel. However, many desperate people have fallen for a scam in which they are issued a NSK passport. Most of these scams originate in Nigeria and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2014}}

In 2010, the first NSK Citizens Congress was held in Berlin. It was followed by a "NSK Rendez-Vous" in Lyon, France, where Alexei Monroe revealed NSK's aim : to make people "aware that totalitarianism isn't a discrete historical phenomenon which went on from 1933 to 1989 and then it's over so let's have a nice triumph of liberal democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title=NSK à Lyon : Perspektive 2/2  | url=http://www.captainspauldings.com/article.php?article=UID_4d4d234e900b0  | deadurl=yes  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708115204/http://www.captainspauldings.com/article.php?article=UID_4d4d234e900b0  | archivedate=2011-07-08  | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2011, another "NSK Rendez-Vous" took place in London. In 2012, yet another "NSK Rendez-Vous" was set to take place in [[New York City]]'s [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://times.nskstate.com/nsk-ny-moma/|title=NSK Passport Office, New York &amp; NSK Rendezvous MoMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2017 saw NSK set up a pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]] where [[Slavoj Žižek]] stated that "the uniqueness of NSK is this idea of the 'stateless state'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170515-a-passport-from-a-country-that-doesnt-exist |title=A passport from a country that does not exist |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NSK Folk Art Exhibitions ==

A diverse collection of intriguing artefacts created by the citizens of the NSK State in Time. This virtual state, formed in 1992, today contains over fourteen thousand citizens from Dublin and Taipei to Sarajevo and New York. As it has evolved over the last 20 years, members have developed a strong sense of collective identity, which has manifested itself in the creation of a unique Folk Art, expressing citizens' devotion to the state and ideologies of NSK.

'''NSK Folk Art at Calvert 22'''

This is presented in parallel with IRWIN - Time for A New State Calvert 22 exhibits a selection of 'NSK Folk Art'.  Works on display include NSK passports, stamps, plates and films made by NSK state members. Exhibited works are from IRWIN and NSKSTATE.COM collection NSK Folk Art.  NSK Folk Art is part of a London wide presentation in cooperation with Tate, who will be hosting a Symposium and which will also include a music performance at Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, an exhibition of archival material at Chelsea Space (Chelsea College of Art) and a seminar at UCL.
'''Artists:''' Peter Blase, Christian Chrobok, Charles Krafft, Danaja, Christian Matzke, Public Movement, Astrid Thingplatz, Valnoir &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=calvert22|url=http://calvert22.org/exhibitions/nsk-folk-art/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1st NSK Folk Art Biennale - NSK: Past – Present – Future'''

The exhibition ''NSK: Past – Present – Future'' marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of NSK by depicting the development of the Slovenian artist collective "Neue Slowenische Kunst" from its birth within the context of Yugoslavian alternative culture in the 80s through the founding of the NSK State in Time in 1991, and offers a glimpse into the future.
'''Selected artists''' that participated in the '1st NSK Folk Art Biennale' : Annelise Bully (France), Julio Canto Chollet (Brasil), Jacques Gassmann (Germany), [[Kurt Grüng]] (Great Britain) Martin Höfer (Germany), KavecS (Greece), Kenji Konishi (Japan), Avi Pitchon (Israel), Detlef Schweiger (Germany)

'''The 2nd NSK State Folk Art Biennale'''

Burren College of Art is pleased to announce 'The 2nd NSK State Folk Art Biennale' as this year's Burren Annual exhibition. The 2nd NSK State Folk Art Biennale will bring together over 30 international artists and collectives including special guests and NSK founding members, IRWIN. The NSK State was created in 1992 as a project of the Neue Slowenische Kunst artists' collective (founded in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 1984). In response to the break up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the NSK collective created a virtual state in time and without territory, to examine and question nationalism, national boundaries and the utopian desires underpinning social formations. The NSK State produces passports, opens temporary consulates, and currently has over 14,000 citizens.  The 1st NSK Folk Art Biennale took place in Leipzig in 2014, and featured a wide range of works generated by NSK citizens and artists who critically examined the contemporary nation state and questions of power, history and identity, as well as the artistic legacy created by NSK. The 2nd NSK State Folk Art Biennale will be the second major NSK related event in Ireland, following the NSK State Dublin week of events held in Dublin in 2004, in which all the NSK groups participated and at which an NSK passport office was opened.
'''Artists:''' Athanasios Anagnostopoulos (GR), Caul Audiac (IE), Zbigniew Bogusławski (PL), Vera Bremerton (IT), Carsten Busse (DE), Christian Chrobok (DE), Patrick Corcoran (IE), Dominic Corrigan (IE), Shane Cullen (IE), Haris Hararis (GR), IRWIN (SL), Marilyn Lennon (IE), Llewyn Maire (US), Russell MacEwan (UK), Emily McMehen &amp; Geoffrey Sautner (CA &amp; UK/IE), Valnoir (FR), Nikkita Morgan (IE), Lili Anamarija No (SL), Kevin Noble (US), NSK Lipsk (DE), NSKNY (US), Noël O'Callaghan (IE), Maurice O'Connell (IE), Alan Phelan (IE), Avi Pitchon (IS), David K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">In [[law]], '''nonacquiescence''' is the intentional failure by one branch of the government to comply with the decision of another to some degree.  It tends to arise only in governments that feature a strong [[separation of powers]], such as in the [[United States]], and is much rarer in governments where such powers are partly or wholly fused.  In the context of [[lawsuit]]s, [[executive branch|executive]] nonacquiescence in [[judiciary|judicial]] decisions can lead to bizarre [[Kafkaesque]] situations where parties discover to their chagrin that their legal victory over the government is an empty one.{{fact|date=March 2014}}{{POV-inline|date=March 2014}} Nonacquiescence can also possibly lead to a [[constitutional crisis]], given certain critical situations and decisions.

In the [[United States]], certain [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] agencies are notorious for practicing nonacquiescence (essentially, ignoring court decisions that go against them and refusing to accept their validity as [[binding precedent]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory C. Sisk, ''Litigation with the Federal Government'' (Philadelphia: American Law Institute, 2006), 418-425.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert J.

Chater'', 99 F.3d 286, 287-88 (8th Cir. 1996); ''Johnson v. U.S. Railroad Retirement Board'', 969 F.2d 1082 (D.C. Cir. 1992); ''Allegheny General Hospital v. NLRB'', 608 F.2d 965 (3d Cir. 1979); and ''Lopez v. Heckler'', 713 F.2d 1432 (9th Cir.), rev'd on other grounds sub nomine ''Heckler v. Lopez'', 463 U.S. 1328 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[American Bar Association]],&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda McMillion, "A Little Compliance Can't Hurt," ''[[ABA Journal]]'', August 1997, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has not yet been able to pass a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] formally prohibiting or punishing such behavior.{{POV-inline|date=March 2014}}

The [[United States|U.S.]] [[Internal Revenue Service | Internal Revenue Service (IRS)]] uses the term ''nonacquiescence'' in its actions on decision to indicate that the IRS disagrees with a court ruling and will not follow its precedent nationwide.&lt;ref name="irs36"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal Revenue Manual, 36.3.1.4|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part36/irm_36-003-001.html#d0e157|publisher=Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dept of Treasury|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not necessarily mean that the IRS will refuse to follow the ruling of the court on that particular case; rather it means that the IRS will not apply the ruling to ''other'' cases.  In some cases of nonacquiesence, the IRS may follow the decision's precedent within the jurisdiction of the case in question, but not apply it in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="irs36"/&gt;

The '''northern spotted owl''' (''Strix occidentalis caurina'') is one of three [[spotted owl]] [[subspecies]]. A western [[North America]]n bird in the family [[Strigidae]], genus ''[[Strix (genus)|Strix]]'', it is a medium-sized dark brown owl sixteen to nineteen inches in length and one to one and one sixth pounds. Females are larger than males. The wingspan is  approximately 42 inches.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern spotted owl primarily inhabits [[old growth forests]] in the northern part of its range ([[Canada]] to southern [[Oregon]]) and landscapes with a mix of old and younger forest types in the southern part of its range (Klamath region and [[California]]). The subspecies' range is the [[Pacific]] coast from extreme southern [[British Columbia]] to [[Marin County]] in northern California. It nests in cavities or on platforms in large trees and will use abandoned nests of other species. Spotted owls form long-term pair bonds (divorce is an uncommon occurrence) and remain in the same geographical areas year after year.

Most spotted owls inhabit federal lands ([[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], [[Bureau of Land Management]], and [[National Park Service]] lands), although significant numbers occur on state lands in all three states, and on private and tribal properties.

==Diet==
The northern spotted owl is primarily nocturnal. Its diet consists mainly of wood rats (Neotoma sp.) and [[flying squirrel]]s, although it will also eat other small mammals, reptiles, birds and insects. They will often swallow their catch whole and regurgitate pellets of indigestible hair, feathers and bones. Males and females both hunt, except during nesting, when males do most of the hunting. They can take prey on the ground and in flight.
Northern spotted owls are one of the few owls with dark-colored eyes. Most owls have yellow to red-orange colored eyes.

==Behavior==
The northern spotted owl is intolerant of habitat disturbance. Each nesting pair needs a large amount of land for hunting and nesting, and will not migrate unless they experience drastic seasonal changes, such as heavy snows, which make hunting difficult. Their flight pattern is distinct, involving a series of rapid wingbeats interspersed with [[gliding (flight)|gliding flight]]. This technique allows them to glide silently down upon their prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | publisher = [[Defenders of Wildlife]]
 | accessdate = October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Northern spotted owls are ready to reproduce at two years of age, but do not typically breed until they are three years old. Male and females mate in February or March and the female lays two or three eggs in March or April. She then incubates the eggs for 30 days. After hatching, the young owls remain in the nest where the adult female provides primary care until they fledge in 34 to 36 days. The hunting and feeding is done by the male during this time. The young owls remain with the parents until late summer to early fall. They leave the nest and form their own winter feeding range. By spring, the young owls' territory will be from 2 to 24 miles from the parents.&lt;ref name="Does Anybody Give a Hoot"&gt;Brokaw, Jeanne (Nov/Dec 1996). "[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1996/11/does-anybody-give-hoot Does Anybody Give a Hoot?]" ''Mother Jones''. Accessed April 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status==
There are fewer than 100 pairs of Northern Spotted Owl left in British Columbia, Canada, 1,200 pairs in Oregon, 560 pairs in Northern California, and 500 pairs in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The worldwide [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species status for the spotted owl species is "[[Near Threatened]]" with a decreasing population trend.&lt;ref&gt;BirdLife International (2013) [http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22689089/0 ''Strix occidentalis'']. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2014.3.&lt;/ref&gt; As the IUCN Red List does not track subspecies, this status is applied to species across its whole range in Canada, the United States and Mexico.

The Canadian population, declared endangered by the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] under the 2002 [[Species at Risk Act]], now{{when|date=June 2014}} numbers less than 100 breeding pairs of birds. In British Columbia, Canada, {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, only 6 pairs are known in the wild, down from historic numbers of 500 pairs.&lt;ref name='vansun'&gt;{{cite news|author=Pynn, Larry |publisher=The Vancouver Sun |date=March 24, 2010 |title=Light dims on B.C.'s wild spotted owls |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Light+dims+wild+spotted+owls/2722270/story.html |accessdate=March 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328205802/http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Light+dims+wild+spotted+owls/2722270/story.html |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern spotted owl was listed as a [[threatened species]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]] throughout its range of northern California, Oregon and Washington by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] on June 23, 1990&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register 55 FR 26114-26194. [http://www.fws.gov/pacific/ecoservices/endangered/recovery/pdf/NSO_5-yr_Summary.pdf  Northern Spotted Owl Five-year Review] at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&lt;/ref&gt; citing loss of [[Old-growth forest|old-growth habitat]] as the primary threat. The USFWS previously reviewed the status of the northern spotted owl in 1982, 1987 and 1989 but found it did not warrant listing as either threatened or endangered. Logging in [[United States National Forest|national forests]] containing the northern spotted owl was stopped by court order in 1991.&lt;ref name="Does Anybody Give a Hoot"/&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
[[File:NorthernSpottedOwlOregonZoo.jpg|thumb|left|Northern spotted owl, [[Oregon Zoo]], [[Portland, Oregon]]]]
In 2007 a Captive Breeding and Release Program was created in Langley, British Columbia, Canada, with the goal of producing owls in captivity for release into protected habitat to prevent the extirpation of the species from Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsobreedingprogram.com Northern Spotted Owl Breeding Program ]&lt;/ref&gt; The short-term goals of the Program include growing the captive population to 10 breeding pairs and releasing 10-20 offspring per year into the 300,000 hectares of protected old-growth forest. Long-term the Breeding Program aims to recover the wild population to self-sustaining numbers, approximately 300 adults, over the next 10–20 years. Thus far the Program has produced 8 captive-bred Northern Spotted Owls, including 2 second-generation offspring, and plans to begin releases in 2018 or 2019.

==Controversy==
In 1990, the logging industry estimated up to 30,000 of 168,000 jobs would be lost because of the owl's status, which agreed closely with a Forest Service estimate.&lt;ref name='satchell'&gt;Satchell, M. (June 25, 1990) ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', Vol. 108, Issue 25, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvests of timber in the Pacific Northwest were reduced by 80%, decreasing the supply of lumber and increasing prices.&lt;ref name="Does Anybody Give a Hoot"/&gt; However, jobs were already declining because of dwindling old-growth forest harvests and automation of the lumber industry.&lt;ref name='satchell'/&gt; One study at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] by environmental scientists argued that logging jobs had been in a long decline and that environmental protection was not a significant factor in job loss.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite journal|last=Freudenburg |first=William R. |author2=Lisa J. Wilson |author3=Daniel O'Leary |year=1998 |title=Forty Years of Spotted Owls? A Longitudinal Analysis of Logging-Industry Job Losses |journal=Sociological Perspectives |volume=41 |issue=#1 |pages=1–26 |url=http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/freudenburg_pdf%27s/40yrsSpottedOwls.pdf |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |doi=10.2307/1389351 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830195041/http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/freudenburg_pdf%27s/40yrsSpottedOwls.pdf |archivedate=August 30, 2006 |jstor=1389351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1947 to 1964, the number of logging jobs declined 90%. Starting with the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964, environmental protection saved 51,000 jobs in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Guglielmino, Janine (Summer 1997). ''American Forests'', Vol. 103, Issue 2, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy pitted individual loggers and small sawmill owners against environmentalists. Bumper stickers reading ''Kill a Spotted Owl—Save a Logger'' and ''I Like Spotted Owls—Fried'' appeared to support the loggers.&lt;ref name='satchell'/&gt; Plastic spotted owls were hung in effigy in Oregon sawmills.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Larry (December 1999). ''Wood &amp; Wood Products'', Vol. 104, Issue 13, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The logging industry, in response to continued bad publicity, started the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.&lt;ref name='Sustainable Forestry Initiative'&gt;[http://www.aboutsfi.org/ Sustainable Forestry Initiative]. aboutsfi.org&lt;/ref&gt; While timber interests and conservatives have cited the northern spotted owl as an example of excessive or misguided environmental protection, many environmentalists view the owl as an "[[indicator species]]," or "canary in a coal mine" whose preservation has created protection for an entire threatened ecosystem.&lt;ref name="AmLands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlands.org/issues.php?subsubNo=1089232287&amp;article=1179268431&amp;PHPSESSID=ab0b4467aa4d0c7ec783288fde180221 |title=American Lands Alliance Action Alert |date=May 15, 2007 |publisher=Americanlands.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613212741/http://www.americanlands.org/issues.php?subsubNo=1089232287&amp;article=1179268431&amp;PHPSESSID=ab0b4467aa4d0c7ec783288fde180221 |archivedate=June 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection of the owl, under both the Endangered Species Act and the National Forest Management Act, has led to significant changes in forest practices in the northwest. President Clinton's controversial [[Northwest Forest Plan]] of 1994 was designed primarily to protect owls and other species dependent on old-growth forests while ensuring a certain amount of timber harvest. Although the result was much less logging, industry automation and the new law meant the loss of thousands of jobs.&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0627/p02s01-sten.html|title = Northern spotted owl's decline revives old concerns|date = June 27, 2007|publisher = Christian Science Monitor|author = Knickerbocker, Brad|accessdate = June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new jobs were created for biologists conducting surveys for spotted owls and other rare organisms that occur in their range.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The debate has cooled somewhat over the years, with little response from environmentalists as the owl's population continues to decline by 7.3 percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.olympicpeninsulaaudubon.org/shell.php?page=conserve_barred_owl How Should We Manage the Barred Owl?]" ''Olympic Peninsula Audubon Society.'' Accessed April 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] reaffirmed that the owl remained threatened, but indicated that invasion by [[barred owl]]s into the range and habitat of the spotted owl was also a cause of declining spotted owl populations.

In 2007, the USFWS proposed a new recovery plan intended to guide all management actions on lands where spotted owls occur, and to aid in recovery of the species. Early proposals were criticized by environmental groups as significantly weakening existing protections for the species. The Obama administration reversed proposals that would have increased logging on Bureau of Land Management administered lands. Recent discussion has been focused on two novel approaches. One of these would emphasize wildfire management as key to owl persistence on the east side of the Cascades, and in the Klamath province. Another proposal, on control of [[barred owl]] populations through culling,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson DH, White GC, Franklin AB, Diller LV, Blackburn I, Pierce DJ, Olson GS, Buchanan JB, Thrailkill J, Woodbridge B, Ostwald M. (2008). ''Study designs for Barred Owl removal experiments to evaluate potential effects on Northern Spotted Owls''. Report prepared for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Lacey, WA and Yreka, CA. Olympia, WA: Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. 32 p.&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticized by some animal rights and other activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Verhovek, Sam Howe |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=June 4, 2007 |title=To protect spotted owl, larger rival is targeted |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-owls4jun04,1,7172559.story?track=rss&amp;ctrack=2&amp;cset=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal biologists were considering in 2010 whether to kill barred owls to see if that would help the spotted owls.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Jeff (December 10, 2009).

== Relations with tribes ==
Northern Spotted Owls range on 500,000 acres of the 7.6 percent of private forestlands managed by Native American tribes in the state of Washington. The U.S. treats tribes as sovereign nations, therefore each tribe develops their own management plans for the northern spotted owls in their area. However, the government expects all private land owners (including native tribes) to comply with the Endangered Species Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Offences Against the Person Act''' (with its variations) is a stock [[short title]] used for legislation in the [[United Kingdom]], in the [[Republic of Ireland]], in [[Hong Kong]], in [[New Zealand]], in [[Tasmania]] and in [[Antigua and Barbuda]], relating to [[offences against the person]]. It seems to have been derived from the [[long title]] of the Act which has come to be known as the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1828]]. It is sometimes abbreviated to '''OAPA''', as in "OAPA 1861".

The Bill for an Act with this short title will have been known as a '''Offences Against the Person Bill''' during its passage through Parliament.

"Offences Against the Person Acts" may be a generic name either for legislation bearing that short title or for all legislation which relates to offences against the person. It is not a term of art.

In [[Stoicism#Ethics and virtues|Stoic ethics]], '''''oikeiôsis''''' ({{lang-grc|οἰκείωσις}}, {{lang-la|conciliatio}}) is a technical term variously translated as "appropriation," "orientation," "familiarization," "affinity," "affiliation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/#H2|title= Stoic Ethics, 2009, William O. Stephens}}, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; and "endearment."&lt;ref name="Richter, Daniel S 2011, pg 75"&gt;Richter, Daniel S, ''Cosmopolis: Imagining Community in Late Classical Athens and the Early Roman Empire,'' Oxford U. press, 2011, pg 75&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oikeiôsis'' signifies the perception of something as one’s own, as belonging to oneself. The theory of ''oikeiôsis'' can be traced back to the work of the first Stoic philosopher, [[Zeno of Citium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramelli, Ilaria, ''Hierocles the Stoic: Elements of Ethics, Fragments and Excerpts,'' 2009, pg xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;
The Stoic philosopher [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]] saw it as the basis for all animal impulses as well as human ethical action. According to [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], "those who followed Zeno stated that ''oikeiôsis'' is the beginning of justice".&lt;ref name="Richter, Daniel S 2011, pg 75"/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Oikeiôsis'' is rooted in the word ''[[oikos]]'' (οἶκος).&lt;ref name="Richter, Daniel S 2011, pg 75"/&gt; [[Oikos]] is the word for household, house, or family, and can be seen in modern English words like [[economics]] and [[ecology]] (Greek oiko- to Classical Latin oeco- to Medieval Latin eco-). Similarly, the term ''Oikeiotes'' denotes the sense of belonging, the opposite of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Animal Minds and Human Morals: The Origins of the Western Debate,'' pg 123&lt;/ref&gt; The term invokes the sense of being "at home", of belonging to and by extension becoming "familiarized" with something.

==Hierocles' theory==
In his ''Elements of Ethics'' ({{lang|grc|Ἠθικὴ στοιχείωσις}}), the philosopher [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]] began his account of ''oikeiôsis'' by looking at the beginning of the life of animals. In the initial stage of perception, an animal is only aware of their bodies and sensations as "belonging to itself", this awareness is the ''proton oikeion'', the "first thing that is one's own and familiar".&lt;ref&gt;Ramelli, Ilaria, ''Hierocles the Stoic: Elements of Ethics, Fragments and Excerpts,'' 2009, pg xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; This self-awareness is continuous as well as dependent on the perception of external objects. This is why according to [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]], children are afraid of the dark, because their weak sense of self fears death in the absence of external entities.&lt;ref name=RI2&gt;Ramelli, Ilaria, ''Hierocles the Stoic: Elements of Ethics, Fragments and Excerpts,'' 2009, pg xl&lt;/ref&gt; Hierocles argued that the impulse of [[self-preservation]] arises out of ''oikeiôsis'': "an animal, when it has received the first perception of itself, immediately becomes its own and familiar to itself and to its constitution".&lt;ref name=RI2/&gt; In perceiving itself and becoming familiar to itself, an animal finds value in itself and its own well-being.&lt;ref name=RI3&gt;Ramelli, Ilaria, ''Hierocles the Stoic: Elements of Ethics, Fragments and Excerpts,'' 2009, pg xli&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]] divided the many forms of ''Oikeiôsis'' as internal and external. Internal forms of ''oikeiôsis'' included appropriation of the self as well as of one's constitution, external forms included familiarization with other people and an orientation towards external goods.&lt;ref name=RI3/&gt; ''Oikeiôsis'' is the basis for Hierocles' theory of "appropriate acts" ({{lang|grc|καθήκοντα}}) because it is in "accordance with nature" since animals use appropriation to project themselves externally and thus care for others (such as their offspring). Stoics see these acts as a duty because, according to [[Cicero]], "all duties derive from principles of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Ramelli, Ilaria, ''Hierocles the Stoic: Elements of Ethics, Fragments and Excerpts,'' 2009, pg xlviii&lt;/ref&gt; In Hierocles' other ethical work, ''On Appropriate acts'' (of which only fragments survive), he outlined a theory of duty based on concentric circles. Beginning with the self and then our immediate family, Hierocles outlined how humans can extend their ''oikeiôsis'' towards other human beings in widening circles, such as our [[Ethnic group|ethnos]] and eventually the entire [[human race]]. The distance from the center acts as a standard by which we may measure the strength of our ties and therefore our duties towards other people.&lt;ref&gt;Ramelli, Ilaria, ''Hierocles the Stoic: Elements of Ethics, Fragments and Excerpts,'' 2009, pg lvi&lt;/ref&gt; Hierocles argued that there was an ethical need for a "contraction of circles", to reduce the distance between the circles as much as possible and therefore increase our familiarization with all of mankind (while still retaining the strongest affinity within our immediate circle).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9311">'''Pay as you throw''' (PAYT) (also called trash metering, unit pricing, variable rate pricing, or user-pay) is a usage-pricing model for disposing of [[municipal solid waste]]. Users are charged a rate based on how much waste they present for collection to the municipality or local authority.

A variety of models exist depending on the region and municipality. Waste is measured by weight or size while units are identified using different types of bags, tags, containers or even [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]]. Services for waste diversion, like [[recycling]] and [[composting]], are often provided free of charge where pay-as-you-throw systems are implemented.&lt;ref name="Batllevell"&gt;Batllevell, Marta and Kenneth Hanf. “The fairness of PAYT systems: Some guidelines for decision-makers.” Waste Management 28 (2008): 2793-2800.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main types of pay-as-you-throw programmes:
- Full-unit pricing: users pay for all the garbage they want collected in advance by purchasing a tag, custom bag, or selected size container.
- Partial-unit pricing: the local authority or municipality decides on a maximum number of bags or containers of garbage, with collection paid for by taxes. Additional bags or containers are available for purchase should the user exceed the permitted amount
- Variable-rate pricing: users can choose to rent a container of varying sizes (some programs offer up to five), with the price corresponding to the amount of waste generated.&lt;ref name="Kelleher"&gt;Kelleher, Maria, et al. “Taking out the Trash: How to Allocate the Costs Fairly.” C.D. Howe Institute Commentary 213 (2005): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The two most traditional approaches to disposing of municipal solid waste are a flat-rate system or municipal taxes. All users pay the same municipal taxes regardless of how much waste they present for pickup.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski"&gt;Bilitewski, Bernd. “Pay-as-you-throw – A tool for urban waste management.” Editorial. Waste Management 28 (2008): 2759.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the flat-rate system there is no incentive to reduce waste produced.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"&gt;Reichenbach, Jan. “Status and prospects of pay-as-you-throw in Europe – A review of pilot research and implementation studies.” Waste Management 28 (2008): 2809-2814.&lt;/ref&gt;

PAYT is based on two guiding principles of environmental policy: the [[polluter pays principle]] and the [[shared responsibility]] concept.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt; The rationale for PAYT can be divided into three broad categories:

===Economic===
Under a PAYT scheme, some or all of the costs of waste management can be removed from property tax bills, providing more independence in the management and financial of residential waste system.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;  Waste management services are then treated just like other utilities such as electricity or water that are charged by unit of consumption.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski" /&gt;

===Environmental===
PAYT program are an effective tool in increasing waste separation and recycling, and also encourage waste minimization. The result is significant energy savings from transportation, increases in material recovery from recycling, and reduction in pollution from landfills and incinerators. And thus reduce the load of landfills.&lt;ref name="Bilitewski" /&gt; PAYT programs also indirectly encourage producers to develop more efficient designs and environmentally friendly product life cycles.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;

===Social===
Waste collections costs are distributed more fairly among the population, and in proportion to the amount of waste each user generates.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; Free riders are no longer able to have their behavior subsidized, and PAYT is said to promote community sustainability.  Lower-income families tend to produce less waste and thus pay lower waste collection fees.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt;

==Diversion effects and risks==
Charging for waste can also sometimes result in illegal dumping ([[fly-tipping]]) or the waste being passed to unlicensed or illegal disposal methods.&lt;ref name="Batllevell" /&gt;  In practice, increased litter, open burning, and illegal dumping have not been observed by most pay-as-you-throw communities, especially when combined with easier recycling and composting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdhec.gov/library/OR-0608.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="massdep"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/recycle/reduce/pay-as-you-throw-basics-for-municipalities.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Municipalities in Massachusetts have typically observed a reduction in trash larger than the increase in recycling, but this is believed to be due to people formerly bringing in trash from other communities (where presumably there is no free pickup) to the homes of friends and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://radioboston.wbur.org/2011/04/12/mass-recycling-program&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political opposition==
When there is a change to any established municipal service, public resistance is common.&lt;ref name="Kelleher"/&gt;  The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection recommends making PAYT programs revenue-neutral by reducing taxes at the same time as introducing trash fees, so residents don't see the trash fee as a new cost.&lt;ref name="massdep"/&gt;

==Implementation==
Urban communities usually offer curbside collection while rural communities provide drop-off collection service.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; Both the European Union and the US Environmental Protection Agency have published handbooks for introducing PAYT.&lt;ref name="Sakai"&gt;Sakai, S., et al. “Unit-charging programs for municipal solid waste in Japan.”  Waste Management 28 (2008): 2815-2825.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
PAYT programs operated in California, Michigan, New York and Washington as early as the 1970s, although The City of San Francisco “had practiced a kind of PAYT scheme since 1932.” &lt;ref name ="Reichenbach" /&gt; By 2000, 6,000 communities in the U.S. (20%) and 200 in Canada had implemented user fees for waste management.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;  In 2002 North Americans disposed of 24 million tonnes of waste, with residential sources accounting for 9.5 million tonnes.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt; PAYT programs resulted in residential waste declining from 9 - 38% and increased recycling from 6 – 40%.&lt;ref name="Kelleher" /&gt;

===Europe===
{{See also|Waste management in Switzerland}}

Austria was the first country to implement individual waste charging in 1945, but PAYT did not catch on until the 1980s when efficient and secure electronic identification systems became available.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"/&gt; The first city in Europe to implement an electronic identification and billing system for waste charges was Dresden, Germany.&lt;ref name= "Bilitewski"/&gt; The first experience in Spain was in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Puig Ventosa, I. "Charging systems and PAYT experiences for waste management in Spain". Waste Management 2008, 28, 2767–2771&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, the European Waste Policy has required that “part of the costs not covered by revenues from material reuse must be recovered on the polluter-pays principle.” Versions of PAYT are present in municipalities all over Europe.&lt;ref name="Reichenbach"/&gt;

===Asia===
After being introduced in the 1970s, 954 municipalities (30%) in Japan have implemented PAYT programs.&lt;ref name="Sakai" /&gt; The city of [[Taipei]] currently runs a scheme where households and companies purchase specially printed blue bin bags, and place waste in it. The municipal waste management department collects only rubbish placed within these special bags. Called the "Per Bag Trash Collection Fee", this scheme encourages usage of recyclable packaging, as those do not need a special bag and are disposed free of charge. As a result, Taipei's waste volume is down 35.08%, and recycling has increased 2.6-fold from 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/29/AR2007112901887.html What I Picked Up About Trash in Taipei - washingtonpost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; PAYT is also implemented in Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Seonghoon. “The Effects of unit pricing system upon household solid waste management: The Korean Experience.” The Journal of Environmental Management 57 1999): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

PAYT pricing has also been recently introduced in parts of Bangalore through the wastepicker cooperative Hasiru Dala, founded by [[Nalini Shekar]]. The organization followed the 2-bin 1-bag&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2bin1bag.in/|title=2Bin1Bag - Divide &amp; Conquer Waste|website=2Bin1Bag - Divide &amp;amp; Conquer Waste|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; segregation method, and charged differently for compost-able waste and landfill rejects, while paying for recyclables. Apartments serviced through this pricing mechanism showed a significant reduction in their garbage footprint.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54433">'''Privacy in education''' refers to the broad area of ideologies, practices, and legislation that involve the privacy rights of individuals in the education system. Concepts that are commonly associated with privacy in education include the [[expectation of privacy]], the [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]] (FERPA), the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA). The majority of privacy in education concerns are prevalent to the protection of student data, such as educational records and other personal information, both inside and outside the traditional classroom setting as well as the privacy and confidentiality of medical records. Many scholars are engaging in an academic discussion that covers the scope of students’ privacy rights, from student in K-12 and even higher education, and the management of student data in an age of rapid access and dissemination of information. 

== Expectation of Privacy ==
"[[Expectation of privacy]]," similar to the "[[right to privacy]]," is a phrase that describes the natural desire of humans to maintain their sense of privacy. There is currently no legal definition in the American law that explicitly grants humans the right to privacy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott-Hayward|first=C. S.|date=2015|title=Does Privacy Require Secrecy? Societal Expectations of Privacy in the Digital Age|url=|journal=American Journal of Criminal Law|volume=43(1)|pages=19–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] is utilized by people in court cases to defend themselves from actions that involve certain infringements upon their privacy, such as searches that require warrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, over the years, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has found it difficult to determine an impartial non-biased meaning for "expectation of privacy" because there are too many subjective variables to consider.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Student Expectation of Privacy ==
In line with the general meaning of "expectation of privacy," student expectation of privacy refers to a student's inherent right to privacy in the school system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=A. A.|date=2001|title=Do Children Have Privacy Rights in the Classroom?|url=|journal=Studies In Philosophy &amp; Education|volume=20(3)|pages=245–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of student expectation of privacy, especially in the pre-collegiate levels, include the protection of a student's academic record from being viewed by anyone other than the academic instructor, the student's parents or guardians, and the students themselves. There have been many legal cases regarding the privacy concerns of pupils' academic records, for example the [[Owasso Independent School District v. Falvo]] that was handled by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. This particular case began in October 1998 when Kristja J. Falvo filed a lawsuit against the Owasso Independent School District on the premise that the grading practice employed in her children's classroom, peer grading, was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and of FERPA. Additionally, peer grading embarrassed her children in front of their peers, which could be interpreted as a violation of a student's expectation of privacy in the classroom. When the case reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]], it was ruled in October 2000 that peer grading was not a violation of the constitutional Fourteenth Amendment but was, in fact, a violation of FERPA. The Tenth Circuit judges reasoned so by closely interpreting the statue in FERPA about privacy protection of "educational records." Since it was agreed upon that teacher grade books were considered "educational records," the Tenth Circuit decided that anything that went into these grade books, including student grades written on student work, were also considered "educational records" and thus subject to FERPA's privacy protection policies. After the court decision was released, peer grading practices were banned in school districts within the Tenth Circuit regional borders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dinger|first=D. R.|date=2001|title=Johnny saw my test score, so I'm suing my teacher: Falvo v. Owasso Independent School District, peer grading, and a student's right to privacy under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act|url=|journal=Journal of Law &amp; Education|volume=30(4)|pages=575–626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many citizens and scholars were opposed to the Tenth Circuit's decision, and the case ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001. In 2002, the Supreme Court Justices officially ruled that peer grading was not a violation of FERPA. They reasoned that student grades on student work were not considered "educational records" until the teacher had physically recorded the grades into a grade book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2001/00-1073|title=Owasso Independent School District No. I-011 v. Falvo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, peer grading returned as a common grading practice in classrooms across the United States.

Other examples of student expectation of privacy include the right of children to withhold personal information from teachers within in a traditional classroom setting. Such topic remains as a contentious educational privacy concern in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some argue that teachers should know more information about students in order to help support them in their academic endeavors. Others argue that teachers should refrain from prying into the personal lives of children because, like adults, children should have the right to privacy and determine the amount of information that they reveal to teachers. Still others make the claim that children are too young to make this decision for themselves and should consult their parents prior to revealing anything personal to their teachers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Student Educational Records ==
Student educational records, according to the FERPA statue, is defined as "those records, files, documents, and other materials which--(i) contain information directly related to a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ===
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 was propelled by New York Senator James Buckley who promoted the importance of protection and privacy of educational records of students who attended primary and secondary schooling. As a federal legislation, FERPA grants students under the age of 18 and their parents the right to manage their educational records, which may include data about their academic performance, medical information, behavioral analysis, and more. Thus, when parents or guardians feel that their children's educational records have been exposed to the public in some way, they are able to file claims against the school district as a violation of FERPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Kent M.|date=2001|title=Family-Friendly FERPA Policies: Affirming Parental Partnerships|url=|journal=New Directions For Student Services|volume=94|pages=39–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For students over the age of 18, particularly those enrolled in postsecondary education institutions, FERPA can be vague and unclear about the disclosure of educational records to parents. Since individuals aged 18 and over are recognized as adults by the law, FERPA separates students in postsecondary education and their parents in terms of access to educational records such as health and drug records.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Thomas R.|date=Summer 2008|title=Navigating State and Federal Student Privacy Laws to Design Educationally Sound Parental Notice Policies.|url=|journal=New Directions For Student Services|volume=122|pages=81-104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Baker, many controversial issues may arise. For example, Baker writes that "FERPA regulation 99.31(a)(8) allows disclosure to parents without the student's prior written authorization if the student is 'dependent' on the parents as defined by the Internal Revenue Code."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, there may be circumstances under which financially dependent students would not want their private records accessed by their parents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, FERPA authorizes the release to parents or guardians of information about recorded drug or alcohol use by students under the age of 21. If the underage and illegal drug or alcohol use resulted in legitimate concerns and disciplinary action, school administrators can notify and disclose details to parents without the students' permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Teressa L.|date=2014|title=Student Privacy Rights--History, Owasso, and FERPA.|url=|journal=Journal Of Higher Education Theory &amp; Practice|volume=14(4)|pages=34-47|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common Core ===

As the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]] are being developed and implemented in schools across the United States, some academics are bringing awareness to the potential privacy concerns of student data and educational records. According to Stacie Hunt, the Common Core system creates a large student database that keeps track of student performance and information from pre-K to college and even beyond. Federal government and other agencies are able to gain access to this database, analyze student data records, and sell pertinent information to the schools and districts overall. This creates a privacy concern about student data being spread and utilized by third-parties without the students', or their parents', explicit permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Stacie|date=2016|title=Data Collection on School-aged Children through Common Core|url=|journal=I/S: A Journal of Law &amp; Policy for the Information Society|volume=12 |issue=305|pages=1–23|hdl=1811/80039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational Technology ("Edtech") ===

[[Educational technology]] ("edtech") is an emerging field in the area of education. According to Dylan Peterson, "edtech represents a broad category of educational products and services used in schools and by private individuals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Dylan|date=2016|title=EdTech and Student Privacy: California Law as a Model|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2130&amp;context=btlj|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|volume=31|pages=961–995|doi=10.15779/Z38T840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy concerns surround the fact that large amounts of data of each student using edtech are collected and stored in a wide database that can be accessed by schools. This data may be personal to the students and they may not wish for others to view it. However, edtech companies claim that without storing as much student data as possible, it would be more difficult to create programs that effectively address the students' educational needs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Students with Disabilities ===
To help improve programs that benefit the educational experience of students with disabilities, some scholars propose a digitalized database of student records that are updated in real time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stahl|first=William|date=|title=Student Data Privacy, Digital Learning, and Special Education: Challenges at the Intersection of Policy and Practice.|url=|journal=Journal of Special Education Leadership|volume=29(2)|pages=79–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is so that educators can keep track of important information about students with various disabilities and monitor their academic performances for educational purposes. While these scholars support the idea of disclosure of data of students with disabilities, they make it very clear that strong legislation and policies must be enforced to protect the privacy of such data. It is currently a debate whether or not digitalized student data that can be accessed by many parties is really beneficial to support individuals with disabilities in school. Some are not comfortable with the idea that the data is updated frequently and disseminated widely, while others believe that the acquisition of such data is necessary to improve programs and enrich educational experiences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Privacy in Higher Education ==

=== Historical Perspective  ===
Since the 1970's, the commonly held perspective was that the right to privacy was an evaluation of individual worth. Further, [[technology]], even before the [[World Wide Web]], was perceived as having potentially negative effects such as allowing information to be breached.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grayson|first=Lawrence|date=1978|title=Education, Technology, and Individual Privacy|url=|journal=Educational Communication and Technology|volume=26(3)|pages=195-206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there were not many violations warranted that would urge legislation to act and shift their attention to protecting privacy in education or primarily individual privacy in general. Technology was also viewed as a source to uncover values, behaviors, motives and thoughts but at the same time, many thought that only qualified professionals had access to personal data. &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; However, specifically in higher education, there was a perspective that individuals were susceptible to having their information breached. Thus, the role of education in the 1970's was viewed as one that safeguarded its students and staff to ensure privacy and prevent data from being breached given the technology that existed. 

=== College Dormitory Searches ===
In many public and private colleges and universities across the United States, enrolled students typically live on campus in college-operated [[Dormitory|dormitories]]. Since students live in these dormitories for the duration of about one year, many personalize and consider their dormitory rooms as their personal and personalized living space.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemons|first=B. R.|date=2012|title=Public Education and Student Privacy: Application of the Fourth Amendment to Dormitories at Public Colleges and Universities.|url=|journal=Brigham Young University Education &amp; Law Journal|volume=(1)|pages=31–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these dormitories are property owned by colleges and often students must waive their right to privacy for college representatives to conduct searches for safety purposes. While some believe that dormitory searches are effective for maintaining a safe community on campus, others believe that these searches are a violation of student privacy. Many cases have been filed by students in which they were caught with illegal substances in their dormitories during searches that these students felt were an invasion of their private living spaces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, only public or government-related searches with warrants are protected under the Fourth Amendment. Oftentimes college dormitory searches would be regarded as private searches and thus undergo lawsuits that claim a violation of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, in the case ''[[Morale v. Grigel]]'', a Resident Assistant at the New Hampshire Technical Institute searched a student's room on multiple occasions even though the student was not present in the room at all times. Once the Resident Assistant found marijuana in the room, the student was arrested for possessing illegal substances on college campus property. The student then filed a lawsuit against the Resident Assistant on the grounds that the searches were private and thus violated his Fourth Amendment right to protection from private searches. However, the court concluded that the Resident Assistant's employment status rendered him as a government agent and thus his searches were conducted on behalf of the college, a government-related institution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Social Networks ===
Within social networks, or particular websites that enable the sharing of information as well as communication among individuals, there exists a level of privacy that students prefer to keep their personal information or social life private from school personnel or faculty in order to avoid context collapse. 

==== '''Facebook''' ====
Technology enables the creation of one's own social presence through informal settings as well as formal settings that allow for the connection of student and instructors for academic purposes. &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennen Vanessa and Kerry Burner J.|first=|date=2017|title=Identity, context collapse, and Facebook use in higher education putting presence and privacy at odds|url=|journal=Distance Education|volume=38(2)|pages=173-192|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in higher education using Facebook typically censor or block their information from instructors. Thus, [[Facebook]] is primarily used to interact with friends and family rather than instructors. &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; By students blocking their information, they believe that they avoid context collapse that may cause confusion of who the person really is. Typically, students prefer to be present in the classroom and have their social life private from formal settings. &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Learning Analytics ===
With the improvement of technology, more data has become available within higher education. Administrators are then able to learn more about students in order to implement forms of improving student's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picciano|first=Anthony G.|date=2012|title=The Evolution of Big Data and Learning Analytics in American Higher Education|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eric/docview/1238188091/AC784AD901ED497EPQ/10?accountid=14496|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|volume=16|pages=9-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through learning analytics, which is defined as the focus on "students and their learning behaviors, gathering data from course management and student information systems in order to improve student success," administrators are able to obtain real-time empirical data such as insights and responses of student's learning processes. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ifenthaler, Dirk and Clara Schumacher|first=|date=2016|title=Student perceptions of privacy principles for learning analytics|url=|journal=Educational Technology Research &amp; Development|volume=64(5)|pages=923-938|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slade, Sharon and Paul Prinsloo|first=|date=2013|title=Learning Analytics: Ethical Issues and Dilemmas|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=57(10)|pages=1510-1529|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the privacy issues arise in how student data is collected, stored, analyzed and presented to [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; There arises ethical issues of "location and interpretation of data; informed consent, privacy, and de-identification of data; and classification and management of data." &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Students believe that data about them is elaborate and personalized and at the same time hold a conservative view about learning analytics. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Learning analytics]] helps obtain real time data for higher education learning processes but, at the same time may hinder the development of students such as critical thinking and autonomous learning. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  It is not as simple as saying that learning analytics will benefit students and thus increase their success and retention rates. &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is such because procedures to regulate access are put in place while at the same time bias and lack of validity and comprehension affect the ability to obtain data that will then be used for the benefit of students.

=== Data Breaches ===
As of 2017, there has been over 30 [[Data breach|data breaches]] since 2005. The susceptibility to breaches creates threats to institutional research (IR) professionals who store and manage student data within the regulatory structure that controls data management. &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=Katie|date=2017|title=The Legal Implications of Storing Student Data: Preparing for and Responding to Data Breaches|url=|journal=New Directions for Institutional Research|volume=|pages=37-48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further than this, student information is then brought to light which can threaten them as well. As vast amounts of data continues to be actively collected, potential breaching through hacking, physical theft, and by vendors becomes more probable. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Preventative Measures''' &lt;p&gt;Those who study the implications of data breaches emphasize that data should be kept to a minimum and that steps should be taken in order to see who can be trusted to regulate this information in order to keep data private and not accessible to all employees. &lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=Katie|date=2017|title=The Legal Implications of Storing Student Data: Preparing for and Responding to Data Breaches|url=|journal=New Directions for Institutional Research|volume=|pages=37-48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also talk about investing in educating employees about what can and cannot be done with data. Further, they state that institutions should use the resources available at their own college/university in order to most effectively implement policies and procedures to keep data private. Exercising caution against [[third-party vendors]] that help with data is advised and further that there should be a contract established that 1) defines who exactly who will be working with data, 2) makes clear that data is sensitive and thus should be handled with care, 3) and includes security procedures that  describe the exact responsibility of the vendor just in case data is breached. &lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writers who investigate data breaches in higher education advise that research professionals should understand that data breaches are bound to happen and that it is better to implement policies and take preventative measures in the first place to ensure the security of data. &lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Educational Records in Higher Education ===
'''Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)'''

The [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act|Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974]] limits the “disclosure of certain information contained in a student’s education record to third parties” which includes parents if the student has not given consent. &lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tribbensee|first=Nancy|date=2008|title=Privacy and Confidentiality: Balancing Student Rights and Campus Safety|url=|journal=Journal of College and University Law|volume=34(2)|pages=393-418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third parties can be parents, family, another institution (mental health providers), or pursuants of a subpoena or court order (law enforcement). It gives colleges and universities the right to "inspect and review" educational records that can disclosed if 1) consent is given by the student, 2) if the information falls within the definition of "directory information" (information that is not considered harmful such as name, major and address), 3) if the information is of "legitimate educational interest" (if an official needs to review the education records in order to fulfill their responsibilities within the University), 4) the student is tax dependent, 5) if it regards drugs or alcohol violations, 6) if it involves serious conduct violations, and 7) when it involves health or safety emergencies &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

For example, if a student in a residence hall is diagnosed with a contagious disease (measles), has a serious eating disorder, has suicidal ideation, binge drinks heavily, or has erratic and angry behaviors. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Furthermore, information can be released if it entails disciplinary information such as a student who is an “alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense." &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; However, there have been cases where troubled students remain in college, without the college or university advising parents about their "strange" behavior, which resulted in students to take their own lives. The cases of [[Jain v. Iowa|J&lt;i&gt;ain v. Iowa&lt;/i&gt;]]'', [[Shin v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'' and &lt;i&gt;[[Mahoney v. Allegheny College]]&lt;/i&gt; exemplify this issue. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Nonetheless, according to FERPA, disclosures are considered to be made in “good faith based upon the available facts.”&lt;p&gt;Educational records are covered by FERPA. They are not just academic records, class schedules or transcripts but also financial records, disciplinary records, "disability accommodation records, photographs, e-mails, and electronic database records." &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Official documentation is needed to fall under FERPA even if this entails a personal experience or observation.&lt;/p&gt;What is not covered under FERPA are: law enforcement records, treatment records, and sole possession records and instead fall under other laws or considerations. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

'''In Loco Parentis''' 

Due to the influence of FERPA, there has been a shift from ''in loco parentis'', to &lt;i&gt;in sin parentibus&lt;/i&gt;, and back to &lt;i&gt;i[[In loco parentis|n loco parentis]]&lt;/i&gt;. ''In sine parentibus'' means "without parents" meanwhile in loco parentis means "in place of the parent." &lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Britton|date=2007|title=Students Rights: From In Loco Parentis to Sine Parentibus and Back Again? Understanding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act in Higher Education"|url=|journal=Brigham Young University Education &amp; Law Journal|volume=2(6)|pages=321-350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as represented by FERPA, the shift to &lt;i&gt;in loco parentis&lt;/i&gt; within higher education is the act of the school taking over the legal responsibility of parents. &lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This means that college authorities stand in place of parents.

The role of FERPA is to enhance student achievement through greater parent involvement as well as protecting the private interests of students. Yet, the shift toward &lt;i&gt;in loco parentis&lt;/i&gt; also comes with concerns related to educational records. More specifically, there is a concern about the extent to which large and powerful institutions obtain information to their advantage such as data that is gathered by researchers and policymakers. &lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newton, Kenneth B. and Diana C. Pullin|first=|date=1996|title=Balancing Privacy and Confidentiality Rights with Duties and Disclosure and Dissemination of Federal Education Statistics|url=|journal=Journal of Law &amp; Education|volume=25(1)|pages=1-54|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand there are concerns that relate to the university itself disclosing information. For example, under FERPA, the school can disclose information about students to parents if it includes alcohol and drug related incidents any time if they are under 21. &lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Because of reasons like these, there is a concern that there may be "systematic disclosure policies" that become out of control and thus harm student rights and privacy. &lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

'''Privacy vs. Confidentiality'''

Within student records there is a difference between what is privacy and what is confidentiality. Privacy is more of a legal concept and is defined as the "right of a person to withhold himself and his property from public scrutiny if he so chooses." &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caruso|first=Lawrence|date=1971|title=Privacy of Student and Confidentiality of Student Records|url=|journal=Case Western Law Review|volume=22(3)|pages=379-389|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus privacy gives the individual the right to be let alone which means that the university itself does not have the right to pry into student's personal affairs or reveal student information unless there are explicit and valid reasons in doing so or permission has been granted by the student. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Yet even giving permission does not mean that the student has given permission to have all of their information revealed from then on but rather than permission is granted within the particular circumstance.

On the other hand, confidentiality means that files and records of students are not authorized to be disclosed to third parties such as not disclosing information that is received in confidence from a patient and physician. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Given this, authors who focus on confidentiality ask questions such as:&lt;p&gt;1) Does the communication originate in confidence?&lt;/p&gt;2) Is the element of confidentiality essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relationship between the parties?&lt;p&gt;3) Is the relationship one that must be fostered??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) Will there result an injury that is greater than any benefits which may be gained from that disclosure?&lt;/p&gt;If the answers are "yes" then the university may be legally bound to not disclose information unless it overrides the interest. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Medical Records ===
The terms privacy and confidentiality arise when it comes to medical records. 

'''Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996'''

The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] provides privacy to data that is related to medical or mental health records that are legally more restrictive than FERPA in regards to confidentiality. HIPAA includes provisions that “intend to facilitate the creation of a national system for the electronic transmission and exchange of medical record information” such as access to information that is individually identifiable like health plans and health care. &lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodward, Beverly and Dale Hammerschmidt|first=|date=2003|title=Requiring Consent Vs. Waiving Consent for Medical Records Research: A Minnesota Law Vs. the U.S. (HIPAA) Privacy Rule|url=|journal=Health Care Analysis|volume=11(3)|pages=207-218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act “defined protected health information so as to exclude individually identifiable health information that is included in education records covered by FERPA and that is in treatment records that are exempted from FERPA.” &lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tribbensee|first=Nancy|date=2008|title=Privacy and Confidentiality: Balancing Student Rights and Campus Safety|url=|journal=Journal of College and University Law|volume=34(2)|pages=393-418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between educational records and treatment records is that treatment records fall under federal and state law while educational records fall under FERPA. Nevertheless, the documentation of patient and caregiver is confidential meaning that medical records will not be disclosed unless consent is given or there is a belief that disclosing records is crucial. &lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; Furthermore, generally, health care providers do not disclose information unless they meet a standard that falls above the required FERPA health or safety exception, or consent is given, and thus is limited in providing information within the constraints of the confidentiality among patient and provider. &lt;ref name=":142" /&gt;

'''Integration of Mental and Physical Records''' 

In some instances, college campuses have begun to integrate physical and mental health needs of patients. This means that medical records are becoming more shared among physicians as well as counselors or psychologists that work with students. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davenport|first=Robin G.|date=2017|title=The Integration of Health and Counseling Services on College Campuses: Is There a Risk in Maintaining Student Patients' Privacy?|url=|journal=Journal of College Student Psychotherapy|volume=31(4)|pages=268-280|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, medical providers, separately, have the obligation to withhold confidential information as an ethical duty and state privacy regulations. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; For example, health providers such as counselors, also have the obligation to be confidential and not disclose private information. However, as medical providers move towards integrated care, such that mental and physical records are shared amongst themselves, there arises a confidentiality challenge that may lead to college students to fall behind in school. Since confidentiality is compromised as information is disclosed among providers that use this method of continuity care, less students utilize therapy because they refuse to disclose private information that can then be shared with others. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This simultaneously fuels the stigma towards college counseling. Thus, as more information becomes disclosed, less college students seek counseling due to lack of confidentiality as medical records of patients are disclosed between medical providers, when legally the obligation of these medical providers is to abide and guarantee privacy and confidentiality by withholding patient's information unless under specific circumstances.

Further, outside of sharing information among medical providers, there is also the issue of sharing information with [[Research|researchers]]. They claim that medical records are difficult to access but when they are, it opens up the door for research. &lt;ref name=":123"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodward, Beverly and Dale Hammerschmidt|first=|date=2003|title=Requiring Consent Vs. Waiving Consent for Medical Records Research: A Minnesota Law Vs. the U.S. (HIPAA) Privacy Rule|url=|journal=Health Care Analysis|volume=11(3)|pages=207-218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, at the same time it opens the door to privacy and confidentiality risks.

'''Electronic Health Records''' &lt;p&gt;Since technology continues to revolutionize, [[Medical record|medical records]] have become accessible as electronic health records. This allows information to be shared more easily but appears to create a challenge for stigma management and disclosing information during medical appointments.&lt;/p&gt;An in-depth interview study called "Negotiating stigma in health care: disclosure and the role of electronic health records" was made that took into account sexual minority men (gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men) in the U.S. to seek how they viewed electronic health records. &lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stablein, Timothy; Joseph Lorenzo Hall; Chauna Pervis and Denise L. Anthony|first=|date=2015|title=Negotiating stigma in health care: disclosure and the role of electronic health records|url=|journal=Health Sociology Review|volume=24(3)|pages=227-241|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What the study found is that there were concerns of privacy in terms of how the electronic aspect creates a barrier to be open and talk about seemingly confidential information as well as how it may challenge the right to confidentiality and privacy. On the other hand, the study also found that electronic health records may benefit by improving communication among providers when sharing information and further, to provide better care especially after the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical and Health Act]] invested billions in the adoption of electronic health records to improve the quality of care. &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The study concludes that technology may enhance medical care yet at the same time fuel the stigma that seeking medical help is bad and thus would hinder patients to make appointments, to attend counseling with certain providers, or disclose personal information such as [[sexual identity]] and [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV status]] that they believe will be shared to others without their consent. &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''State Laws''' 

Federal regulations allow states to place their own regulations, to either increase or decrease the requirements for disclosure, but states who do are few. &lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegler|first=Gregory|date=1996|title=What Should Be the Scope of Privacy Protections for Student Health Records? A Look at Massachusetts and Federal Law|url=|journal=Journal of Law Education|volume=25(2)|pages=237-270|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Minnesota State Law

In 1996 the state of [[Minnesota]] placed a law regarding medical records that appeared to be more stringent than HIPAA. Minnesota law attempted to obtain a "written general authorization for such release from the patient" as a form to impede the activities of researchers or providers to share information without given consent. &lt;ref name=":124"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodward, Beverly and Dale Hammerschmidt|first=|date=2003|title=Requiring Consent Vs. Waiving Consent for Medical Records Research: A Minnesota Law Vs. the U.S. (HIPAA) Privacy Rule|url=|journal=Health Care Analysis|volume=11(3)|pages=207-218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitals in Minnesota even made brochures that highlight patient's rights to confidentiality and that they can give consent in writing if they allow for their medical records to be released outside of the facility. Thus, the law required health care providers to obtain a written consent and authorization from patients in order for medical records to be released and used for research. &lt;ref name=":124" /&gt; However, researchers themselves campaigned against the law and the law was not successful in enforcing the right that patients have to refuse their information to be released. Meanwhile, the patients themselves wanted information as to what information is being used within their medical records.

As of 2006, under Minnesota's state rights, individuals have the right to: see and get a copy of their medical records, have information added to their medical records in order to make them accurate, file a complaint, and importantly, sue in state court for violations of their rights under state law. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pritts, Joy, Nina L. Kudszuz, Health Policy Institute and Georgetown University|first=|date=2006|title=Your Medical Record Rights in Minnesota: A Guide to Consumer Rights under HIPAA|url=|journal=The National Library of Medicine|volume=|pages=1-30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Massachusetts State Law 

The [[Massachusetts]] state law imposed the requirement that a person has the right against the unreasonable interference of privacy and states that the superior court shall have jurisdiction to enforce a person's right and thus must award damages if need be. &lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegler|first=Gregory|date=1996|title=What Should Be the Scope of Privacy Protections for Student Health Records? A Look at Massachusetts and Federal Law|url=|journal=Journal of Law Education|volume=25(2)|pages=237-270|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the law there are strict privacy protections classified as medical. Records are considered educational records unless there exists there need be heightened confidentiality such as child abuse, AIDS, substance abuse, immigration status, pregnancy and abortion. &lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; Further, it is considered a medical record if a school-based clinic is under “operation of an outside entity or by a physician under any employment arrangement” and considered educational records if not considered for heightened confidentiality. &lt;ref name=":152" /&gt;

If an individual believes that their right to privacy they have the right to file a complaint with the Officer for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Health and Human services against health care providers, with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine against doctors and with the Department of Public Health against hospitals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pritts, Joy; Health Policy Institute; Georgetown University|first=|date=2005|title=Your Medical Record Rights in Massachusetts: A Guide to Consumer Rights under HIPAA|url=|journal=Georgetown University|volume=|pages=1-29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* California State Law

The [[Confidentiality of Medical Information Act]] (CMIA) is a California state law that includes more information than HIPAA in regards to medical records. &lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/cfceducation-foundationyour-medical-privacy-rights/confidentiality-of-medical-information-act/|title=The Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA)|last=|first=|date=2011-2012|website=Education Foundation: Consumer Federation of California|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main function is to protect confidentiality of identifiable medical information obtained by an individual's health care provider. It applies to licenses providers such as physicians and nurses. It prohibit medical providers to disclose medical information without obtaining authorization first and that any medical information about an individual is preserved in confidentiality by anyone who comes in contact with it. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;An individual whose confidentiality is not respected may obtain $1,000 and the amount of actual damages and for the person or entity that discloses confidential information is liable for an administrative fine. &lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Student and Professional Archetypes ===
'''Students With Disabilities''' 

Tension on campus arises because as of the event of 9/11 some people on campus are fearful or overreact in demanding to know which students have conduct records or a disability accommodation. &lt;ref name=":143"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tribbensee|first=Nancy|date=2008|title=Privacy and Confidentiality: Balancing Student Rights and Campus Safety|url=|journal=Journal of College and University Law|volume=34(2)|pages=393-418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tension of whether the information will be used to discriminate or treat students unfairly. Nevertheless, the distribution of this information is not limited by FERPA among school officials as long as the disclosure is done due to "legitimate educational interests." &lt;ref name=":143" /&gt;

'''Foreign Students''' 

The event of 9/11 impacted the release of information of students with visas and leads to the questioning of the responsibility and obligation of universities to report foreign student's information. Foreign individuals granted the opportunity to study in the U.S. for a period of time are given one of three visas: [[F visa|F-1]] for academic studying, [[J-1 visa|J-1]] for exchange visitors, and [[M-1 visa|M-1]] for vocational training. &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khatcheressian|first=Laura|date=2003|title=FERPA and the Immigration and Naturalization Service: A Guide for University Counsel on Federal Rules for Collecting, Maintaining and Releasing Information About Foreign Students|url=|journal=Journal of College and University|volume=29(2)|pages=457-484|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the government claims that there are no accurate records of the 547,000 individuals holding student status (as of 2003). &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Meanwhile, universities are supposed to report information the information of F-1 and M-1 students to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)]] such as their name, date and place of birth, current address, student status, degree program, field of study, etc. &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; For those with J-1 visas, the sponsoring organization is to report information such as the individuals activities and compliance. Yet, if they do not necessarily report the information they are at least required to keep track of their foreign student's information.

Importantly, regulations are not addressed in regards to how FERPA applies. The school may release information if the student is no longer enrolled if it needs to comply with judicial order, if it lawfully issues a subpoena, or if there are "specific and articulable facts” that show that a student’s education record may contain information relevant to investigation or prosecution.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Information can also be disclosed if it includes the protection of health or safety of students, especially if it is to “protect the health and safety of Americans.” Further, students who were issued [[I-20A forms|I-20A]] or [[I-20M forms|I-20M]] forms (F-1 and M-1 students) or [[J-1 visa|DS-2019]] forms (J-1 students) automatically grant consent to any information needed to determine immigrant’s status or release information that's related to the individual’s compliance with the Exchange Visitor Program. &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Yet, this information is stated to be only given to certain organizations such as the INS or the [[United States Department of State|Department of State.]] &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''Librarians''' 

* Privacy Assessment 

Librarians themselves take part in protecting the right of library users privacy. Typically, the library itself aims to protect user's information primarily regarding what they do when they use technology, such as using computers to surf the web. According to [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] in 2014, 95 percent of librarians agree or strongly agree individuals should control their personal information and many agree that there are threats to the privacy of their users. &lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmer|first=Michael|date=2014|title=Librarians' Attitudes Regarding Information and Internet Privacy|url=|journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy|volume=84(2)|pages=123-151|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by the Office for Intellectual Freedom which obtained over 1,000 responses of librarians and library professionals found is that the [[Library Bill of Rights]] is honored which believe that everyone is entitled to "freedom of access, freedom to read texts and view images, and freedom of thought and expression" &lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; The [[Librarian's Code of Ethics]] and the adoption of the [[Privacy Act of 1974]] also illuminate not just on a librarian level but also on a federal level that privacy is to be protected. &lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voeller|first=Stacy|date=2007|title=Privacy Policy Assessment for the Livingston Lord Library At Minnesota State University Moorhead|url=|journal=Library Philosophy and Practice|volume=|pages=1-29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other non-governmental acts that protect the right to privacy and thus limit the information that can be collected are:

[[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act|Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]]

[[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]]

[[Credit Reporting Act]]

Further, the [[Library 2.0]] tools and services enhance what the user can do but at the same time track, collect and retain data that then may affect individuals especially since the recent dominance of social media. Yet, because of librarian's belief of protecting the rights of users, they take their own initiative in protecting user's information by destroying access logs daily, posting warning signs, and teaching users about privacy issues. &lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; This is especially done in order for information to not be obtained outside of legal restrictions.

Specifically, the Livingston Lord Library (LLL) of Minnesota State University's mission is to support both cultural and academic experiences and to encourage lifelong learning. Thus, their particular library provides resources that allows individuals to enhance their knowledge and skills. At the same time, they work to maintain their image of believing in confidentiality such that people can exercise their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right. &lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Yet, there is not specific documentation as of 2007 that displays what privacy is to them. &lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Nevertheless, there are examples of librarians exerting effort to ensure confidentiality and privacy by protecting their user's information.

=== Role of Campus Privacy Officers ===
[[Campus privacy officer|Campus Privacy Officers]] (CPO's) are individuals within the institution who have the institutional responsibility for anything that regards privacy, they make sure that privacy is upheld within higher education. &lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bermann, Sol, Susan Blair, Sara Chambers, Michael Corn, Denise Dolezal, Patrick Feehan, Jeff Gassaway, Lisa Ho, Gary Miller, Sarah Morrow, Geoffrey Nathan,  Leonard Nelson, Jane Rosenthal, Scott Schafer, and Kent Wada|first=|date=2016|title=The Higher Educational CPO Primer, Part 1 Welcome Kit for Chief Privacy Officers in Higher Education|url=|journal=Higher Education Information Security Council|volume=|pages=1-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet they are relatively new in the United States but nevertheless have been growing since 2002. Their role or function in higher education is:

“sustaining an environment where faculty and student are free to inquire, experiment, discover, speak, and participate in discourse is without intimidation, protecting against and responding to modern-day cybersecurity threats, protecting the interests of individuals and assuring they have appropriate influence over data about themselves, pursuing opportunities for use of data in medical treatment, research, and student success, and enabling shared governance” &lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Their activities include maintaining: data privacy policies, notices, personal data inventory, governance structure and to respond to both complaints and requests from individuals, among other tasks. &lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

A few of the major issues that CPO's focus on are :

* Education records and FERPA
* HIPAA
* "Big data, algorithms, analytics, and usage"
* "Contractual agreements"
* "Information security monitoring and the privacy impact of surveillance" &lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Controversies ===
'''University of California Berkeley''' 

In 1964 students at UC Berkeley protested against the ban that prevented them from engaging in political activity on campus. FBI Director J.Edgar Hoover got involved because he thought that the Free Speech Movement had to do with Communism that aimed to disrupt Capitalism and thus U.S. government. &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/21/159373688/student-subversives-and-the-fbis-dirty-tricks|title=Student 'Subversives' and the FBI's 'Dirty Tricks'|last=Fresh Air|first=|date=2012|website=NPR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, Seth Rosenfield's book "Subersives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power" demonstrates how Hoover investigated the movement and specifically student activists such as Mario Savio through "'intense surveillance and harassment.'" &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Further, when Clark Kerr, former president of Berkeley and then vice chancellor of the University of California system, lifted the ban on political engagement and further against "Communist speakers" the FBI targeted him and tried to get him fired. Hoover had ordered agents to find information about Kerr and leak it to the Board of Regents in order to show that Kerr was not fulfilling his role as president and thus had to be fired. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Essentially, what it points to is that in the 1960's the FBI took on the role of trying to eliminate Communism within the UC Berkeley campus by investigating particular individuals in order to see if they were really Communist or in the case of Kerr to fire them for lifting the ban on political engagement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/fbi-records-free-speech-movement-must-be-disclosed|title=FBI records on Free Speech Movement must be disclosed|last=Freedom of Information|first=|date=1995|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that this is a breach in privacy because the FBI surveilled and investigated individuals without their consent. Others say that it was needed in order to make sure that no Communist activity was taking place particularly on the Berkeley campus due to the Free Speech Movement.  

'''Princeton University'''

In 2002 [[Princeton University|Princeton University’s]] admission staff accessed a Yale University website used to inform applicants that they have been admitted. &lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Margaret|date=2003|title=FERPA: Only a Piece of the Privacy Puzzle|url=|journal=Journal of College and University Law|volume=29(3)|pages=679-718|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of Yale University accessing private information was brought to light. As a result, Yale University responded that it would improve their website with additional security to prevent another breach. Meanwhile, Princeton University responded by announcing the resignation of the top Princeton  admissions official. &lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Some say that acts like these raise the issues of student record privacy in the digital world. 

'''University of Oregon''' 

In 2015 a woman who said she was raped by three basketball players sued the University of Oregon for disclosing her mental health records to an attorney. &lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/09/391876192/college-rape-case-shows-a-key-limit-to-medical-privacy-law|title=Shots: Health News From NPR|last=Foden-Vencil|first=Kristian|date=2015|work=College Rape Case Shows A Key Limit to Medical Privacy Law|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case gave rise to employees from the counseling center to write an open letter to the university community as a form to show that they were disturbed by the university's actions. Yet, officials argue that because the women claimed to have emotional distress then the university had the right to her medical records under FERPA. &lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; An attorney named Steve McDonald argued that HIPAA did not apply in this case. Meanwhile, Lynn Daggett, a FERPA specialist, stated that the university has the right to get access to student medical records, especially if entails the need for legal defense. This led to Denise Horn, a U.S. Department of Education representative of the time, to write a statement addressing that higher education institutions should comply with FERPA but also respect the expectation of confidentiality between patient and counselor/therapist. &lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">In [[United States]] law, a '''roving wiretap''' is a [[wiretap]] that follows the surveillance target. For instance, if a target attempts to defeat a regular wiretap by [[burner phone|throwing away a phone]] and acquiring a new one, another surveillance order would usually need to be applied for to tap the new one. A "roving wiretap", once authorised, follows the target rather than a specific phone device, and would give the surveilling body permission to tap second and subsequent phones without applying for new surveillance orders.

In the US, it is allowed under amendments made to Title III of the ''[[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]]'' (the "Wiretap Statute") in 1988 by the ''[[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]]'', and was later expanded by section 604 of the ''[[Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999]]''.&lt;ref name="HR3694"&gt;''[[U.S. Government Printing Office]]''.[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3694enr.txt.pdf H.R. 3694]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Progress"&gt;Fred E.

'''Sanguino3 G-Code''' is the protocol by which 3rd-generation [[RepRap Project]] electronics communicate with their host machine, as well as the protocol by which the RepRap host communicates with its subsystems.&lt;ref name="protocol spec" /&gt; It can also be written in a binary format to storage for later replay, usually in a file with a ".s3g" extension.&lt;ref name="replicat" /&gt;

The protocol is intended as a simplification of [[G-code]], to ease processing by the somewhat limited CPU of the Sanguino, an [[Arduino]]-based controller.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4727">'''Schur–Weyl duality''' is a mathematical theorem in [[representation theory]] that relates irreducible finite-dimensional representations of the [[general linear group|general linear]] and [[symmetric group|symmetric]] groups. It is named after two pioneers of representation theory of [[Lie group]]s, [[Issai Schur]], who discovered the phenomenon, and [[Hermann Weyl]], who popularized it in his books on [[quantum mechanics]] and [[classical groups]] as a way of classifying representations of [[unitary group|unitary]] and general linear groups.

Schur–Weyl duality can be proven using the [[double centralizer theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Etingof, Pavel |author2=Golberg, Oleg |author3=Hensel, Sebastian |author4=Liu, Tiankai |author5=Schwendner, Alex |author6=Vaintrob, Dmitry |author7=Yudovina, Elena |title=Introduction to representation theory. With historical interludes by Slava Gerovitch|year=2011|zbl=1242.20001}}, Theorem 5.18.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Schur–Weyl duality forms an archetypical situation in representation theory involving two kinds of [[symmetry]] that determine each other. Consider the [[tensor]] space

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{C}^n &lt;/math&gt; with ''k'' factors.

The [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''k'' letters [[group action|acts]] on this space (on the left) by permuting the factors,

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma(v_1\otimes v_2\otimes\cdots\otimes v_k) = v_{\sigma^{-1}(1)}\otimes v_{\sigma^{-1}(2)}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{\sigma^{-1}(k)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The general linear group ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of invertible ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrices acts on it by the simultaneous [[matrix multiplication]],

: &lt;math&gt; g(v_1\otimes v_2\otimes\cdots\otimes v_k) = gv_1\otimes gv_2\otimes\cdots\otimes gv_k, \quad g\in GL_n. &lt;/math&gt;

These two actions [[Equivariant map|commute]], and in its concrete form, the Schur–Weyl duality asserts that under the joint action of the groups ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the tensor space decomposes into a direct sum of tensor products of irreducible modules for these two groups that determine each other,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{C}^n = \sum_D \pi_k^D\otimes\rho_n^D. &lt;/math&gt;

The summands are indexed by the [[Young diagram]]s ''D'' with ''k'' boxes and at most ''n'' rows, and representations &lt;math&gt;\pi_k^D&lt;/math&gt; of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with different ''D'' are mutually non-isomorphic, and the same is true for representations &lt;math&gt;\rho_n^D&lt;/math&gt; of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The abstract form of the Schur–Weyl duality asserts that two algebras of operators on the tensor space generated by the actions of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are the full mutual [[centralizer (ring theory)|centralizer]]s in the algebra of the endomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}_\mathbb{C}(\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{C}^n).&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
Suppose that ''k'' = 2 and ''n'' is greater than one. Then the Schur–Weyl duality is the statement that the space of two-tensors decomposes into symmetric and antisymmetric  parts, each of which is an irreducible module for ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^n = S^2\mathbb{C}^n \oplus \Lambda^2\mathbb{C}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of two elements and has two irreducible representations, the [[trivial representation]] and the [[sign representation]]. The trivial representation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives rise to the symmetric tensors, which are invariant (i.e. do not change) under the permutation of the factors, and the sign representation corresponds to the skew-symmetric tensors, which flip the sign.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15702">In [[computer science]], '''separation of concerns''' ('''SoC''') is a design principle for separating a [[computer program]] into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate [[concern (computer science)|concern]]. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate. A program that embodies SoC well is called a [[modularity (programming)|modular]]&lt;ref name=laplante&gt;{{cite book|last=Laplante|first=Phillip|title=What Every Engineer Should Know About Software Engineering|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0849372283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFHYk0KWAEgC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WQ_aUNn5DYjNiwLS54GADQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; program. Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by [[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulating]] information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface. Encapsulation is a means of [[information hiding]].&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Dr. R. J.|title=Managing Complexity in Software Engineering|year=1990|publisher=IEE|isbn=0863411711|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXtHeZt8ZowC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WQ_aUNn5DYjNiwLS54GADQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).&lt;ref name=microsoft&gt;{{cite book|title=Microsoft Application Architecture Guide|year=2009|publisher=Microsoft Press|isbn=0-7356-2710-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9on897Ep7AC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22+%22layered+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0xPaUKKJMITmiwKhiYDYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of separation of concerns is simplifying development and maintenance of computer programs. When concerns are well-separated, individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated independently. Of special value is the ability to later improve or modify one section of code without having to know the details of other sections, and without having to make corresponding changes to those sections.

== Implementation ==
The mechanisms for modular or object-oriented programming that are provided by a [[programming language]] are mechanisms that allow developers to provide SoC.&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite paper|last=Painter|first=Robert Richard|title=Software Plans: Multi-Dimensional Fine-Grained Separation of Concerns|citeseerx = 10.1.1.110.9227|publisher=Penn State}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[object-oriented programming]] languages such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[C++]], [[Delphi programming language|Delphi]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] can separate concerns into [[Object (computer science)|objects]], and architectural [[Design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]] like [[Model-view-controller|MVC]] or [[Model-view-presenter|MVP]] can [[separation of presentation and content|separate content from presentation]] and the data-processing (model) from content.
[[Service-orientation|Service-oriented design]] can separate concerns into [[Service (Systems Architecture)|services]]. [[Procedural programming]] languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] can separate concerns into [[procedure (computer science)|procedure]]s or [[Subroutines|functions]]. [[Aspect-oriented programming]] languages can separate concerns into [[aspect (computer science)|aspects]] and [[Object (computer science)|objects]].

Separation of concerns is an important design principle in many other areas as well, such as [[urban planning]], [[architecture]] and [[information design]].&lt;ref name=garofalo&gt;{{cite book|last=Garofalo|first=Raffaele|title=Building Enterprise Applications with Windows Presentation Foundation and the Model View ViewModel Pattern|year=2011|publisher=Microsoft Press|isbn=0735650926|pages=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WJ5oQT0dcUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22separation+of+concerns%22+%22urban+planning%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CxjaUK-hN-yVjAKz84D4Cg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22separation%20of%20concerns%22%20%22urban%20planning%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to more effectively understand, design, and manage complex interdependent systems, so that functions can be reused, optimized independently of other functions, and insulated from the potential failure of other functions.

Common examples include separating a space into rooms, so that activity in one room does not affect people in other rooms, and keeping the stove on one circuit and the lights on another, so that overload by the stove does not turn the lights off. The example with rooms shows encapsulation, where information inside one room, such as how messy it is, is not available to the other rooms, except through the interface, which is the door. The example with circuits demonstrates that activity inside one module, which is a circuit with consumers of electricity attached, does not affect activity in a different module, so each module is not concerned with what happens in the other.

== Origin ==
The term ''separation of concerns'' was probably coined by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] in his 1974 paper "On the role of scientific thought".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{quote |Let me try to explain to you, what to my taste is characteristic for all intelligent thinking. It is, that one is willing to study in depth an aspect of one's subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, all the time knowing that one is occupying oneself only with one of the aspects. We know that a program must be correct and we can study it from that viewpoint only; we also know that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained&amp;nbsp;—on the contrary!— by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called '''"the separation of concerns"''', which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by "focusing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously.}}

Fifteen years later, it was evident the term '''Separation of Concerns''' was becoming an accepted idea. In 1989, Chris Reade wrote a book titled "Elements of Functional Programming"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Reade | first = Chris | authorlink = Chris Reade | title = Elements of Functional Programming
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley Longman | year = 1989 | location =  Boston, MA, USA | isbn = 0-201-12915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes separation of concerns:
{{quote |The programmer is having to do several things at the same time, namely,
# describe what is to be computed;
# organise the computation sequencing into small steps;
# organise memory management during the computation.}}
Reade continues to say,
{{quote |Ideally, the programmer should be able to concentrate on the first of the three tasks (describing what is to be computed) without being distracted by the other two, more administrative, tasks. Clearly, administration is important, but by separating it from the main task we are likely to get more reliable results and we can ease the programming problem by automating much of the administration.

The '''separation of concerns''' has other advantages as well. For example, program proving becomes much more feasible when details of sequencing and memory management are absent from the program. Furthermore, descriptions of what is to be computed should be free of such detailed step-by-step descriptions of how to do it, if they are to be evaluated with different machine architectures. Sequences of small changes to a data object held in a store may be an inappropriate description of how to compute something when a highly parallel machine is being used with thousands of processors distributed throughout the machine and local rather than global storage facilities.

Automating the administrative aspects means that the language implementor has to deal with them, but he/she has far more opportunity to make use of very different computation mechanisms with different machine architectures.}}

== Examples ==

=== Internet protocol stack ===
Separation of concerns is crucial to the design of the Internet. In the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], great efforts have been made to separate concerns into well-defined [[OSI Model|layers]]. This allows protocol designers to focus on the concerns in one layer, and ignore the other layers. The Application Layer protocol SMTP, for example, is concerned about all the details of conducting an email session over a reliable transport service (usually TCP), but not in the least concerned about how the transport service makes that service reliable. Similarly, TCP is not concerned about the routing of data packets, which is handled at the [[Internet Layer]].

=== HTML, CSS, JavaScript ===
[[HTML|HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML), [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), and [[JavaScript]] (JS) are complementary languages used in the development of webpages and websites. HTML is mainly used for organization of webpage content, CSS is used for definition of content presentation style, and JS defines how the content interacts and behaves with the user. Historically, this was not the case: prior to the introduction of CSS, HTML performed both duties of defining semantics and style.

=== Subject-oriented programming ===
[[Subject-oriented programming]] allows separate concerns to be addressed as separate software constructs, each on an equal footing with the others. Each concern provides its own class-structure into which the objects in common are organized, and contributes state and methods to the composite result where they cut across one another. Correspondence rules describe how the classes and methods in the various concerns are related to each other at points where they interact, allowing composite behavior for a method to be derived from several concerns. [[Subject-oriented programming#Multi-Dimensional Separation of Concerns, Hyper/J and the Concern Manipulation Environment|Multi-dimensional Separation of Concerns]] allows the analysis and composition of concerns to be manipulated as a multi-dimensional "matrix" in which each concern provides a dimension in which different points of choice are enumerated, with the cells of the matrix occupied by the appropriate software artifacts.

=== Aspect-oriented programming ===
[[Aspect-oriented programming]] allows [[cross-cutting concern]]s to be addressed as primary concerns. For example, most programs require some form of [[computer security|security]] and [[Data logging|logging]]. Security and logging are often secondary concerns, whereas the primary concern is often on accomplishing business goals. However, when designing a program, its security must be built into the design from the beginning instead of being treated as a secondary concern. Applying security afterwards often results in an insufficient security model that leaves too many gaps for future attacks. This may be solved with aspect-oriented programming. For example, an aspect may be written to enforce that calls to a certain API are always logged, or that errors are always logged when an exception is thrown, regardless of whether the program's procedural code handles the exception or propagates it.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software build automation ===
Most project organization tasks are seen as secondary tasks. For example, [[build automation]] is an approach to automating the process of compiling source code into binary code. The primary goals in build automation are reducing the risk of human error and saving time.

=== Levels of analysis in artificial intelligence ===
In [[cognitive science]] and [[artificial intelligence]], it is common to refer to David Marr's [[David Marr (neuroscientist)#Levels_of_analysis|levels of analysis]].  At any given time, a researcher may be focusing on (1) what some aspect of intelligence needs to compute, (2) what algorithm it employs, or (3) how that algorithm is implemented in hardware.  This separation of concerns is similar to the [[interface (computing)|interface]]/implementation distinction in software and hardware engineering.

=== Normalized Systems ===

In [[Normalized Systems]] separation of concerns is one of the four guiding principles. Adhering to this principle is one of the tools that helps reduce the combinatorial effects that, over time, get introduced in software that is being maintained. In Normalized Systems separation of concerns is actively supported by the tools.

=== SoC via partial classes ===
Separation of concerns can be implemented and enforced via [[partial class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Blank stop sign octagon.svg|thumb|upright|A red [[octagon]] symbolizes "stop" even without the word.|alt=Silhouette of a red octagon]]

A '''symbol''' is a mark, sign  or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is [[know]]n or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for "STOP". On a map, a blue line might represent a river. [[Numeral system|Numerals]] are symbols for [[number]]s. [[Alphabet]]ic letters may be symbols for sounds. Personal names are symbols representing individuals. A red rose may symbolize love and compassion. The [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.

In [[cartography]], an organized collection of symbols forms a [[Legend (map)#Map symbology|legend]] for a map.

==Etymology==
The word ''symbol'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σύμβολον ''symbolon'', meaning "token,  watchword" from σύν ''syn'' "together" and βάλλω ''bállō'' " "I throw, put." The sense evolution in Greek is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" was first recorded in 1590, in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=symbol&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In considering the effect of a symbol on the psyche, in his seminal essay ''The Symbol without Meaning'' [[Joseph Campbell]] proposes the following definition:
''A symbol is an energy evoking, and directing, agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|title=Flight of the Wild Gander:- The Symbol without Meaning|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|location=California|isbn=1-57731-210-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, expanding on what he means by this definition Campbell says:

:"a symbol, like everything else, shows a double aspect. We must distinguish, therefore between the 'sense' and the 'meaning' of the symbol. It seems to me perfectly clear that all the great and little symbolical systems of the past functioned simultaneously on three levels: the corporeal of waking consciousness, the spiritual of dream, and the ineffable of the absolutely unknowable. The term 'meaning' can refer only to the first two but these, today, are in the charge of science – which is the province as we have said, not of symbols but of signs. The ineffable, the absolutely unknowable, can be only sensed. It is the province of art which is not 'expression' merely, or even primarily, but a quest for, and formulation of, experience evoking, energy-waking images: yielding what [[Sir Herbert Read]] has aptly termed a 'sensuous apprehension of being'.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Symbol without Meaning p153''&lt;/ref&gt;
Jared Elisha defined symbolism that is something that stands for another, it can be place, object, or a person

[[Heinrich Zimmer]] gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols.

:"Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Heinrich Zimmer; edited by Joseph|title=Philosophies of India|year=1969|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-01758-1|pages=1–2|edition=9. paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Signs and Symbols, ''it is stated that ''A symbol ... is a visual image or sign representing an idea -- a deeper indicator of a universal truth.''&lt;ref&gt;Dorling Kindersley Limited. Signs and Symbols. p.6. {{ISBN|978-0-7566-3393-6}}. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbols are a means of complex communication that often can have multiple levels of meaning.&lt;ref name= "Womack"&gt;Womack, Mari. Symbols and Meaning: A Concise Introduction. California: AltaMira Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This separates symbols from [[sign]]s, as signs have only one meaning.

Human cultures use symbols to express specific ideologies and social structures and to represent aspects of their specific culture.  Thus, symbols carry meanings that depend upon one’s cultural background; in other words, the meaning of a symbol is not inherent in the symbol itself but is culturally learned.&lt;ref name="Womack" /&gt;

Symbols are the basis of all human understanding and serve as vehicles of conception for all human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Susanne K.  A Theory of Art, Developed From: Philosophy in a New Key. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols facilitate understanding of the world in which we live, thus serving as the grounds upon which we make judgments.&lt;ref name="Catherine"&gt;Palczewski, Catherine, and Ice, Richard, and Fritch, John. Rhetoric in Civic Life. Pennsylvania: Strata Publishing, Inc., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, people use symbols not only to make sense of the world around them, but also to [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] and cooperate in society through [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Symbols and semiotics==

[[Semiotics]] is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues.  Semiotics is linked with both [[linguistics]] and psychology.  Semioticians thus not only study what a symbol implies, but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society.  Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both [[denotation]] and [[connotation]].

==Psychoanalysis, rhetoric and archetypes==
Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], who studied [[archetype]]s, proposed an alternative definition of symbol, distinguishing it from the term ''[[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]''. In Jung's view, a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted this with ''symbol'', which he used to stand for something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise.  An example of a symbol in this sense is [[Christ]] as a symbol of the [[archetype]] called ''[[Self in Jungian psychology|self]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christ, A symbol of the self CW vol 9i Aion RKP 1958&lt;/ref&gt; For example, written languages are composed of a variety of different symbols that create words, p. . Through these written words humans communicate with each other. [[Kenneth Burke]] described ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a "[[Definition of man|symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal]]" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling. But the man's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of "blubber" representing something inedible in his mind. In addition, the symbol of "blubber" was created by the man through various kinds of [[learning]].

Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the [[The Interpretation of Dreams|theory of dreams]] but also to "normal symbol systems". He says they'''{{clarify|date=December 2013}}'''&lt;!--What is "they"?--&gt; are related through "substitution", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--The meaning of what?--&gt;. In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--This is still not clear.  These last two sentences do not clearly support or explain the one before it--&gt;.

[[Jean Dalby Clift]] says that people not only add their own interpretations to symbols, they also create personal symbols that represent their own understanding of their lives: what she calls "core images" of the person.  She argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Dalby Clift, ''Core Images of the Self: A Symbolic Approach to Healing and Wholeness''.  Crossroad, 1992. {{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfil psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as "the hero," "the princess" and "the witch" have remained popular for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130629202403/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6039-7 Indick, William. Ancient Symbology in Fantasy Literature: A Psychological Study. Jefferson: McFarland &amp;, 2012. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paul Tillich==

[[Paul Tillich]] argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities.  For Tillich a symbol always "points beyond itself" to something that is unquantifiable and mysterious; symbols open up the "depth dimension of reality itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol.
When a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the "symbol is taken for reality." The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality which are otherwise inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of context in symbolism==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
A symbol's [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] may be modified by various factors including popular usage, [[history]], and contextual [[intent (law)|intent]].

===Historical meaning===
The history of a symbol is one of many factors in determining a particular symbol's apparent meaning. Consequently, symbols with emotive power carry problems analogous to [[false etymologies]].

===Context===
The context of a symbol may change its meaning.  Similar five-pointed stars might signify a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officer or a member of the [[armed services]], depending upon the [[uniform]].

== Symbols in Cartography ==
[[File:Cartographic Symbols.jpg|thumb|The three categories of cartographic symbol shapes.]]
Symbols are used in cartography to communicate geographical information (generally as point, line, or area features).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles of map design |last=Tyner |first=Judith A. |date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=9781606235447 |location=New York |oclc=437300476}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other symbols, visual variables such as size, shape, orientation, texture, and pattern provide meaning to the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cartography : thematic map design |last=Dent |first=Borden D. |last2=Torguson |first2=Jeffrey |last3=Hodler |first3=T. W. |isbn=0072943823 |edition=6th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |oclc=184827987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form, or shape, of a cartographic symbol is classified into one of three main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=How maps work : representation, visualization, and design |last=MacEachren |first=Alan M. |date=1995 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=0898625890 |location=New York |oclc=31078855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial/Representational''' - a shape or image that clearly resembles the geographic feature being symbolized and can be interpreted without a legend.

'''Associative''' - a mixture of pictorial and geometric elements that produce an easily recognizable shape.

'''Abstract/Geometric''' - completely arbitrary shapes chosen to represent a certain feature.

==Symbolic action==
A '''symbolic action''' is an action that has no, or little, practical effect but symbolizes, or signals, what the actor wants or believes.  The action conveys meaning to the viewers.

Symbolic action may overlap with [[symbolic speech]], such as the use of [[flag burning]] to express hostility or saluting the flag to express patriotism.&lt;ref name="Bagossy2008"&gt;Bagossy, Renate. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LyziXxw238C&amp;pg=PA16 The Difficulty of the Amendment Process of the Constitution of the United States of America and Freedom of Speech and its limits]''. GRIN Verlag; 2008-08-11 [cited 5 November 2012]. {{ISBN|9783640129546}}. p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to intense public criticism, businesses, organizations, and governments may take symbolic actions rather than, or in addition to, directly addressing the identified problems.&lt;ref name="Bednar2008"&gt;Bednar, Michael Kay. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Fyefq5LV8sC How Symbolic Action Affects the Media as a Governance Mechanism]''. ProQuest; 2008. {{ISBN|9780549738817}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic actions are sometimes derided as [[slacktivism]].

The term has since been adopted as the name of numerous groups, schools, and businesses.

==Architecture and planning==
A group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners from the [[Bay Area]], founded in late 1939 through the merging of two groups of [[architects]], one from [[San Francisco]] and the other from the [[University of California]], Berkeley, called themselves Telesis. Philosophically, the group also evolved from several larger international architectural movements, which included CIAM ([[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]]) and MARS ([[MARS Group|Modern Architectural Research Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Chermayeff|Chermayeff, Serge]], "Telesis: The Birth of a Group." ''New Pencil Points'' (July 1942), pp.&amp;nbsp;45&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their stated aim was to research the development and implications of what architectural critic [[Lewis Mumford]] called the Second Bay Area Regional Style. As set forth in their founding statement, the group believed that "People and the Land make up the environment which has four distinct parts--a place to Live, Work, Play, and the Services which integrate these and make them operate. These components must be integrated in the community and urban region through rational planning, and through the use of modern building technology."—from ''The Things Telesis Has Found Important''

Noted Telesis members included [[William Wurster]], [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]], [[Vernon DeMars]], [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Grace Morley|Grace McCann Morley]], [[Geraldine Scott|Geraldine Knight Scott]], [[Joseph Allen Stein]], Jack Hillmer, Francis Violich, and T. J. Kent, Jr. In addition to internal research and [[working group]]s that investigated such topics as speculative housing, industrial design, and the relationship of the physical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous architectural styles, the group also organized several influential exhibitions on contemporary architecture and planning with the support of the San Francisco Museum of Art. Professional and personal papers from many of Telesis's members are collected in the [http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/cedarchives/ Environmental Design Archives] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Sociology==

The mechanics of society fall under two general groups: social statics and social dynamics. Social dynamics is further divided into social genesis and social telesis. Social telesis may be further divided into individual telesis and collective telesis.&lt;ref&gt;Outlines of Sociology, Lester F. Ward, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Telesis: Progress consciously planned and produced by intelligently directed effort.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social telesis: The intelligent direction of social activity towards the achievement of a desired and understood end.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines"&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Collective telesis: Adaptation of means to ends by society.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of SocioL, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Individual telesis: The conscious adaptation of conduct by an individual to the achievement of his own consciously apprehended ends.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

Telesis (Greek: Telos, end, + -osis, condition), defined as "the intelligent direction of effort toward the achievement of an end.", has also been a term used in the context of [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] to refer to "infocognitive potential", a concept originating from [[Christopher Langan]] and his theory of everything, the CTMU.  In his 2002 paper on the CTMU, Langan defines telesis in the following passage:&lt;ref&gt;Langan, C.M. 2002. [http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf] ''The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory'' pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Laws do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the objects and attributes on which they act and which they accept as parameters. Similarly, objects and attributes do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the rules of structure, organization and transformation that govern them. It follows that the active medium of cross-definition possesses logical primacy over laws and arguments alike, and is thus pre-informational and pre-nomological in nature…i.e., telic. Telesis, which can be characterized as “infocognitive potential”, is the primordial active medium from which laws and their arguments and parameters emerge by mutual refinement or telic recursion.}}

'''Transition Engineering''' is the professional engineering discipline that deals with the application of the principles of science to the design, innovation and adaptation of engineered systems that meet the needs of today without compromising the ecological, societal and economic systems on which future generations depend to meet their own needs. Just as [[safety]] considerations are incorporated into design parameters in all engineering fields, [[sustainability]] thinking is built into Transition Engineering. Transition engineering is emerging as a field to give engineers the tools necessary to address sustainability in design and management of engineered systems. Transition engineering is a cross-disciplinary field that addresses the issues of future resource availability and identifies, then realizes opportunities to increase [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]].

== Overview ==

Engineering professions emerge when new technologies, new problems or new opportunities arise. This was the case when [[safety engineering]] grew in the early 1900s to combat the high workplace injury and fatality rates. In the 1960s, [[Environmental engineering]] emerged as a discipline to reduce industrial pollution and mitigate impacts on [[environmental health]] and [[water quality]]. [[Quality engineering]] came about with the increase in [[mass production]] techniques during WWII and the need to confirm the quality of the products.

There are two serious problems driving the emergence of Transition Engineering; the exponential growth in the concentration of [[carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere]] and the lack of growth and imminent decline of conventional oil production known as [[peak oil]]. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere recently exceeded 400ppm, a level that Earth has not known for 800,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=carbon_ppm_milestone&gt;{{cite news|last=Montaigne|first=Fen|title=Record 400ppm CO2 milestone 'feels like we're moving into another era'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/14/record-400ppm-co2-carbon-emissions|publisher=Guardian Environment Network|accessdate=2013-05-19|location=London|date=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Transition engineering aims to take advantage of the current access to the remaining lower cost and higher [[EROI]] energy resources to re-develop all aspects of urban and industrial engineered systems to adapt as fossil fuel use is dramatically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Susan Krumdieck|Krumdieck]]|first=Susan|title=Transition Engineering of Urban Transportation for Resilience to Peak Oil Risks|journal=ASME 2011 International Mechanical Engineering Congress|date=2011-11-17|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The idea behind transition engineering has sprouted from many different roots, both technical and non-technical. The concept of [[sustainable development]] has been around since 1987 and the problem of [[sustainability]] was a driving force in the development of transition engineering. The [[Transition Town]] movement provided further inspiration as it showed that there were many groups of people around the world motivated to prepare for [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]]. [[Transition towns]] and [[ecovillages]] demonstrate the need for engineers to build systems that manage un-sustainable risks and provide people with [[sustainable]] options. Engineers are ethically required to "hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public" and answer society's need for sustainable development&lt;ref name=Code_of_ethics&gt;{{cite web|last=National Society of Professional Engineers|title=NSPE Code of Ethics for Engineers|url=http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/CodeofEthics/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of [[safety engineering]] provided much of the inspiration for transition engineering. At the beginning of the 1900s, business owners viewed workplace safety as a wasted investment and politicians were slow to change. After the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire]] in [[New York City]] killed 156 trapped workers, 62 engineers came together to investigate how to make the workplace a safer place to be. This eventually lead to the formation of the [[American Society of Safety Engineers]].&lt;ref name=ASSE_history&gt;{{cite web|last=American Society of Safety Engineering|title=About ASSE -History|url=http://www.asse.org/about/history.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As safety engineering manages the risks of unsafe conditions, transition engineering manages the risks of unsustainable conditions. To give engineers a better grasp of sustainability, transition engineering defines the problem as UN-sustainability. This is similar to the problem of un-safe conditions that is the purpose of safety engineering. We do not necessarily know what a perfectly safe system looks like, but we do know what unsafe systems look like and how to improve them; the same applies to unsustainability of systems. By reducing unsustainability issues we take steps in the right direction&lt;ref name=survival_spectrum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumdieck|first=Susan|title=The Survival Spectrum, the key to Transition Engineering of Complex Systems|journal=University of Canterbury, Mechanical Engineering|year=2010|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Seven Step Method ==

The Transition Engineering method involves 7 steps to help engineers develop projects to deal with changing unsustainable activities. As a discipline, Transition Engineering recognizes that "Business as Usual" projections of future scenarios from past trends are not valid because the underlying conditions have changed sufficiently from the conditions of the past. For example, the projection of future oil supply in 2050 from data prior to 2005 would give an expectation of a 50% increase in demand over that time-frame. However, the actual production rate of conventional oil has not increased since 2005 and is projected to decline by more than 50% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krumdieck|first=Susan |author2=Page, S. |author3=Dantas, A.|title=Urban form and long-term fuel supply decline: A method to investigate the peak oil risks to essential activities|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|year=2010|volume=5|issue=44|pages=306–322|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2010.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#History: First, historical data are gathered and historical trends understood in cultural and political contexts. All historical aspects of the system are considered. Transition Engineering investigates the effects that technology and social developments have on energy and resource demand. How did we get to where we are now? Why are we here? What factors put us here?
#Present: This step assesses the current situation. All current capabilities, investments, assets and condition/age of the assets, and liabilities are considered. Energy use is audited and its end-use behavior is assessed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Organisation for Standardisation|title=ISO 500001 Energy Management|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso50001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Future: Scenarios from all areas of study are considered to get a consensus view of both inertial trajectories of current trends, and limitations of carrying capacity and resource scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Shift Project|title=Science for Energy Scenarios|url=http://science-and-energy.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transition Engineers apply the science of climate change, petroleum geology, ecology, hydrology etc. to describe the "forward operating environment". Determining the probability of each future outcome creates a future operating environment envelope. This gives engineers and decision makers constraints with varying levels of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Energy Agency|title=IEA Scenarios and Projections|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/scenariosandprojections/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Energy Information Administration|title=International Energy Outlook|url=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Path Break Concepts: Innovation takes place in this step when current assumptions about behavior and economics are set aside in favor of consideration of the forward operating environment at the end-point of the time-frame of study. The TE innovator places him/herself in the future and uses the future design constraints to come up with realistic and workable concepts. The path-break concept is not futuring.
#Backcasting: The path break concepts are analysed to see how they differ from the current situation. In this step, the barriers and strategies to change existing systems are also analysed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=The Natural Step|title=Backcasting|url=http://www.naturalstep.org/backcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Trigger Events: Although existing systems carry a large amount of inertia, if the right trigger is applied at the right time, a great amount of change is possible. Triggers can be either disastrous events such as economic collapse, or external changes such as a corporate merger, new law, or new staff. They can also be engineered change projects. The trigger event for safety engineering was the “Triangle shirtwaist factory fire.” (reference) The challenge is to communicate the advantages and benefits of adaptive change, and to initiate a disruptive event that enables an organization to get out of the rut. See [[Change Management]]
#Shift Projects: Finally, by planning for future supply and demand, change projects are realized to make best use of the current available resources. Through these projects, society will be more resilient to peak oil and climate change events.

== Global Association for Transition Engineering (GATE) ==

GATE opened the first group in the UK in Feb 2014. GATE is a Professional Engineering Institution; a membership association and learned society, and comprises an emerging network of engineers and non-engineers that share the idea that engineers are responsible for changing engineered systems in order to adapt to reducing fossil fuel and other unsustainable resources. Transition Engineering is a change management discipline. Like Safety Engineering, Transition Engineering uses and audit and stock-take of current system design and operation to quantify the risks to essential activities and resources over a time-frame of study. The time-frame of study should be commensurate with the lifetime of the assets involved in the activity. An activity is anything that the engineered system supports, for example manufacturing, sewage treatment, mobility, or food preservation. Transition Engineering recognizes that the analytical methods of strategic analysis over a life-cycle time-frame are at odds with most economic analyses that discount values with time. The strategic analysis carried out by Transition Engineers seeks to avoid stranded investment by recognizing resource risks. A classic example of stranded investments is the North Atlantic Cod Fishery - where the largest number of bottom trawling ships (e.g. those ships responsible for destroying the Cod spawning beds) were manufactured in the year that the fish stocks collapsed.&lt;ref name="fishwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/cod/species_pages/atlantic_cod.htm|title=NOAA - FishWatch: Atlantic Cod|publisher=fishwatch.gov|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=International Society of Transition Engineering|title=ISTE|url=http://www.transitionengineering.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Global Association for Transition Engineering is registered charity number 1166048, registered with the UK Charity Commission on 14 March 2016. It is a "Charitable Incorporated Organisation" or CIO.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12453">The '''International Wages for Housework Campaign''' was a feminist global social movement, which grew out of the International Feminist Collective in [[Italy]] in 1972 and organized resistance and public debate on the social formations produced by gendered labor and [[reproductive labor]], for example domestic work like [[Homemaking|housework]], [[childcare]], [[gender discrimination]], and the socially reinforced performance of [[gender roles]], gendered desire, and leisure inequality. The Campaign's platform included the women's right to work outside of the home, [[Unemployment benefits in Italy|unemployment benefits]], parental leave, and equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdallacosta1.htm|title=The door to the garden|last=www.generation-online.org|first=Mariarosa Dalla Costa + EE + AB|website=www.generation-online.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com" /&gt; The Campaign was formed in [[Padua]], Italy by [[Selma James]], [[Brigitte Galtier]], [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]], and [[Silvia Federici]]. A major tenet of the campaign was that reproductive labor is the foundation of industrial work, in its important role in the maintenance and care of gendered male workers, yet a type of labor not recognized as productive enough to be [[wage labor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Selma|title=Is Transformation Possible? They Say We Can't. We Must|jstor=20838923|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=38|issue=1|page=42|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The demands for the Wages for Housework used [[Marxist]] frameworks to think through the reliance of capitalist economies on exploitative labor practices against certain populations.&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"&gt;[http://nplusonemag.com/more-smiles-more-money "More Smiles, More Money." N+1 Magazine. August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]] and some participants in the Wages for Housework campaign were enmeshed in the intellectual movement ''[[operaismo]],'' which developed around factory strikes in [[Northern Italy]] in the 1970s. The Wages for Housework Campaign shared with ''operaismo'' the idea that the fair working conditions including wage is key to the social recognition of labor. ''Operaismo'' encouraged workers to act in their direct interests, and engage in factory strikes to demand better conditions. The Wages for Housework campaign applied also shared discussions about the [[social factory]] with [[operaismo]]; whereby "the whole of society lives as a function of the factory and the factory extends its exclusive domination to the whole of society".&lt;ref name="F&amp;S"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tronti|first1=Mario|title=Factory and Society|url=https://operaismoinenglish.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/factory-and-society/|website=Operaismo in English|accessdate=6 May 2017|date=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign activities included student protests, community workshops, and direct action protest. 

Wages for Housework published a [[autonomist Marxism|Marxist autonomist]] journal, ''Matériaux pour l’intervention.'' Several publications grew out of its ideas, which expanded on the claims of the original group and of more general topics in labor and exploitation. In Italy, ''Quaderni rossi,'' published by [[Raniero Panzieri]], and [[Mario Tronti]], dealt with a variety of topics relating to the class struggle.

==United States==
In 1973, [[Silvia Federici]] helped start Wages for Housework groups in the US and in 1975, the Wages for Housework opened an office in [[Brooklyn]], New York at 288 B. 8th St. The New York group was called the "Wages for Housework Committee."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/permanent-reproductive-crisis-interview-silvia-federici|title = Permanent Reproductive Crisis: An Interview with Silvia Federici|date = March 2013|accessdate = |website = Meta Mute|publisher = Mute|last = Vishmidt|first = Marina}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/sexualhealth/WagesForHousework.pdf Flyers] handed out in support of the New York Wages for Housework Committee [http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/workforce/Wages_for_Housework.pdf called for all women] to join regardless of marital status, nationality, sexual orientation, number of children, or employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/workforce/Wages_for_Housework.pdf|title = The Campaign for Wages for Housework|date = 1975|accessdate = 22 October 2015|website = bcrw.barnard.edu|publisher = Barnard Center for Research on Women|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Federici published ''Wages Against Housework,'' the book most commonly associated with the movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Branches of the Wages for Housework Committee appeared in other cities across America. They were organized in [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Tulsa]], and [[Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Poor Workers' Union: Rebuilding Labor from Below|last = Tait|first = Vanessa|publisher = South End Press|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0896087149|location = Boston|pages = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these committees, other autonomous organizations that fall within the Wages for Housework campaign began to organize within the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC500_scans/500.020.Wages.for.Housework.pdf|title = The International Wages for Housework Campaign|date = |accessdate = 10 October 2015|website = Freedomarchives.org|publisher = The Freedom Archives|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1974 International Black Women for Wages for Housework was founded by Margaret Prescod and Wilmette Brown in New York City. Prescod also founded the Black Women for Wages for Housework in Los Angeles alongside Sidney Ross-Risden in 1980. The Black Women for Wages for Housework focused on not only unpaid housework for the average housewife, but specific issues of black and third world women. They called for reparations for "slavery, imperialism and neo-colonialism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-07/news/vw-4294_1_unremunerated-work|title = Waging the War Over Wages: Fight for Homemaker Pay has Seen Ups, Downs|date = May 1987|accessdate = 6 November 2015|website = latimes|publisher = Los Angeles Times|last = Hendrix|first = Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975|last = Love|first = Barbara|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0252031892|location = Chicago|pages = 368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-28/news/vw-5698_1_unpaid-work|title = Campaign Catches On: L.A.

Both San Francisco and Philadelphia were home to Wages Due Lesbians, an organization that was first created in Britain in 1975. Wages Due Lesbians called for wages for housework along with extra wages for lesbians for "the additional physical and emotional housework of surviving in a hostile and prejudiced society, recognized as work and paid for so all women have the economic power to afford sexual choices."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wages Due Lesbians also worked alongside The Lesbian Mothers' National Defense Fund, founded in 1974 and based in Seattle, which aimed to help lesbian mothers who were a part of custody cases after coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lmndf/lmndf|title = The Lesbian Mothers National Defense Fund, the 1970s through 1990s|date = |accessdate = 6 November 2015|website = outhistory.org|publisher = Out History|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The A to Z of the Lesbian Liberation Movement: Still the Rage|last = Myers|first = JoAnne|publisher = Scarecrow Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0810863279|location = Plymouth|pages = xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco was also home to the U.S. PROStitutes Collective (US PROS). US PROS was created in 1982 to help decriminalize prostitution and also prevent men, women, and children from being forced into prostitution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = US PROS Collective|url = http://uspros.net/|website = US PROS Collective|accessdate = 2015-10-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Tulsa housed the No Bad Women, Just Bad Laws Coalitions. It was founded by Ruth Taylor Todasco in 1981 and also focused on the decriminalization of sex work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1965|last = Love|first = Barbara|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0252031892|location = Chicago|pages = 463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hivandthelaw.com/sites/default/files/null/Overs_SexworkerRights.pdf|title = 'No Bad Women, Just Bad Laws': Three Decades of Sex Work Law Reform Advocacy|date = 2012|accessdate = 22 October 2015|website = HIV and the Law|publisher = Criminalize Hate Not HIV|last = Overs|first = Cheryl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social wage campaigns==
Wages for Housework is part of more general [[social wage]] campaigns in the 1970s interested in [[late capitalism]].  These campaigns used analysis of [[Fordist]] compromises during the twentieth century to argue that [[family wages]] or social security payments had amounted to wages paid for housework in the advanced capitalist West.&lt;ref name=Himmelweit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Himmelweit|first=Susan F | last2 = Mohun | first2 = Simon | author-link1 = Susan Himmelweit | title = Domestic labour and capital |journal= Cambridge Journal of Economics |date=1977 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 15–31 |url =http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/1/15.full.pdf+html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/features/1988/03/05/wages/ Zoë Fairbairns, "Wages For Housework", ''New Internationalist'', issue 181, March 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other autonomous organizations interested in compensation for domestic labor were formed in 1975: Black Women for Wages for Housework, Wages Due Lesbians, the [[English Collective of Prostitutes]] (ECP) and some years later WinVisible (women with visible and invisible disabilities).

==Recent history==
In recent years,{{When|date=June 2015}} the demands of the Wages for Housework Campaign have been applied to many more recent debates in the gendered aspects of labor including, reproductive rights, sex work, and demands for women in leadership roles in business.&lt;ref name="nplusonemag.com"/&gt;

Silvia Federici and several others from the early campaign have continued to publish books and articles related to the demands of Wages for Housework including Fererici's 2012 book, ''Revolution at Point Zero: Housework, Reproduction, and Feminist Struggle.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="856">'''Waste exchange''' is where the [[waste]] product of one process becomes the [[raw materials]] for a second process. This is similar to using [[pre-consumer recycling]] material in a product. This represents a way of reducing [[waste disposal]] through [[reuse]] for that which cannot be eliminated. In this way waste exchange practices are high on the [[waste hierarchy]].

There are free online services for businesses and other organisations that help to keep reusable items in circulation and out of [[landfill]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastex.org.uk Eastex Material Exchange&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onlinewastexchange.com Onlinewastexchange.com - Online waste and recycling materials exchange (B2B waste trading platform)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Neo-fascism}}

'''Wotansvolk''' is a form of [[White nationalism|white nationalist]], [[neo-völkisch]] paganism which was founded in the early 1990s by Ron McVan, Katja Lane and [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]] (1938–2007) while Lane was serving a 190-year prison sentence for his actions in connection with the white separatist revolutionary [[domestic terrorist]] organization [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]], of which he was a member. After the founding of 14 Word Press by David Lane and his wife Katja to disseminate her husband's writings, Ron McVan joined the press in 1995 and founded Temple of Wotan (co-writing a book by that name). 14 Word Press - Wotansvolk proceeded to publish several books for the practice of Wotanism before becoming defunct in the early 2000s.

==History==
Wotansvolk was launched after Lane published an article in 1995 titled "Wotan's Folk", which gave the group its name. ''Wotan'' is the Germanic name for [[Odin]], a central figure in [[Norse mythology]] and other [[Germanic mythology|Germanic mythologies]]. Lane had been publishing white supremacist and neopagan work under the name "14 Word Press" with his wife Katja Lane, and Ron McVan, an artist who had become involved with [[white separatism]] in the 1970s after reading the works of [[Ben Klassen]]. During this time, Wotansvolk published monthly pamphlets, maintained a [[website]], and made and sold Odinist religious objects. The publishers also operated a prison outreach program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2004|p=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, prison groups in the [[United States|US]] were linked with Wotansvolk. Research by [[Mattias Gardell]] indicated "a pagan revival among the white prison population, including the conversion of whole [[prison gang]]s to the ancestral religion....Partly due to the reputation of Lane and its association with the legendary [[The Order (white supremacist group)|Brüders Schweigen]], Wotansvolk's name-recognition is high among the Aryan prison population".&lt;ref name="Gardell217"&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of The Order were practicing Wotanists, including its founder [[Robert Jay Mathews|Robert Mathews]], David Lane and Richard Scutari along with Richard Kemp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2000/neo-pagans-peter-georgacarakos-david-lane-and-richard-scutari-publishing-prison|title=Neo-Pagans Peter Georgacarakos, David Lane and Richard Scutari Publishing from Prison|author=|date=|website=SPLCenter.org|access-date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wotansvolk is one of many groups active in prisoner outreach, but, according to Gardell, "Wotansvolk seem[ed] more successful in its outreach efforts than other Asatrú/Odinist programs".&lt;ref name="Gardell217" /&gt; Non-racist versions of Asatrú and Odinism are protected{{By whom|date=August 2017}} as free speech, but violent and racist religious materials, such as Wotanism, may be banned or restricted from prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Pitcavage of the Anti-Defamation League Discusses Race-Based Gangs and other Extremists in Prison|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/mark-pitcavage-anti-defamation-league-discusses-race-based-gangs-and-other-extremists|access-date=29 May 2017|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Winter 2002|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court Requires Prisons Give Special Consideration to Racist Pagans|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2009/supreme-court-requires-prisons-give-special-consideration-racist-pagans|access-date=29 May 2017|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Fall 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Wotansvolk practitioners see their [[religion]] as being rooted in ancestral European paganism which was driven underground, calling it the true spiritual heritage of the "Euro-Tribes".{{cn|date=May 2017}} Followers of the movement often selectively cite [[Carl Jung]]'s theories of an "Aryan [[collective subconscious]]" or [[race-soul]], specifically his 1936 essay "Wotan".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2004|pp=208, 210–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Wotanism in modern times emphasizes [[white nationalism]], [[white separatism]] and an [[ethnocentric]], pan-European interpretation of [[modern Paganism]].

Unlike many [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic neopagans]] within [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], most Wotanists do not exclusively revere the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] pantheon of [[Asatru]] but rather all the deities of European mythology. Wotanists may reject [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], include [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] ideas, and see David Lane as a [[prophet]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Lane's followers see the [[14 words]] and the [[88 Precepts]] as [[religious text|scripture]] and they primarily see the gods as [[Jungian archetypes]], although Lane said one could be a [[deist]], a [[pantheist]], or an [[atheist]] and still be Wotansvolk.&lt;ref&gt;see: Gambanreidi Statement; Wotanism by Professor Carl Gustav Jung Compiled by the late, Jost Turner [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/gambanreidi.geo/wotanjung.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:28:02]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVan and Lane have described many rituals and practices, none of which are required of practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2004|pp=214–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Wotanists consider the ''[[Hávamál]]'' to be their holiest text while rites of practice are taken from Lane's writings.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Lane often used 'Odinist' and 'Wotanist' as synonymous in his writings, and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] regards Lane's Wotanism as a form of Odinism.&lt;ref name="SPLC1998"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Brand of Racist Odinist Religion on the March|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1998/new-brand-racist-odinist-religion-march|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Winter 1998|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane stated that he had chosen the name "Wotanism" in conscious contrast to [[Anti-Racist Action|anti-racist]] heathens and those motivated by "universalist" ideology who Lane deemed were advancing [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]].{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Although Lane was contemptuous of [[Christianity]], viewing it as part of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world, he viewed the [[Bible]] as containing secret codes hidden by pre-Christian, non-Jewish Aryan masters. Lane stated that this [[Bible code]] was carried over into the [[King James Version]], which he believed [[Sir Francis Bacon]] had translated. Lane also taught something which he called "Pyramid Prophecy" which according to him, said his name and birth-date were prophesied in the Bible as being connected to the coming of the [[Antichrist]], and embodying the spirits of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Thor]], and [[David|King David]] while being described as "the ''Man'' of prophecy", the "''666 Man''" and the "''Joseph Smith of Wotanism''".{{sfnp|Gardell|2003|p=381}}

Universalist Asatruars (notably [[The Troth]]) and some non-folkish [[Odinists]] have rejected what they perceive as an attempt to appropriate the revival of the ancient native faith of [[northern Europe]] for [[political]] and [[racial]] ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|pp=273–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folkish Odinists, such as [[Stephen McNallen]] of the [[Asatru Folk Assembly]], generally support Lane's version of Wotanism and the [[Fourteen Words]].&lt;ref name="SPLC1998"/&gt; Lane issued a declaration called "Moral Authority", as well, which calls the [[United States]] a "[[Flag of the United States|Red, White and Blue]] traveling mass murder machine" intent on committing [[White genocide conspiracy theory|genocide against white people]]. According to the declaration, "true moral authority belongs to those who resist" this purported genocide.&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=lane |title=David Lane |website=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103094309/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=lane |archivedate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2004|pp=202–204, 381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
