'''Aarón Sáenz Garza''' (1 June 1891 &amp;ndash; 26 February 1983) was a Mexican politician.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wThaAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Aarón+Sáenz+Garza+1983&amp;dq=Aarón+Sáenz+Garza+1983&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP4IuoutvXAhWE2KQKHRObBgYQ6AEIMDAC Profile of Aarón Sáenz Garza]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]].

Sáenz Garza served as [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] during Calles' time as president. During his tenure, he continuously defended the Calles Administration's decision to cut oil to the United States when US Secretary of State Frank Kellog tried to bargain for a deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,722820,00.html |title=MEXICO: Vexful Waiting |work=Time |date=1926-12-06 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846094,00.html |title=Foreign News: Secrets |work=Time |date=1927-03-14 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became [[Governor of Nuevo León]] and maintained close ties with Calles; as governor, he even sat with Calles when he questioned the assassin of President-elect Alvaro Obregon in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786965,00.html |title=MEXICO: Must keep calm! |work=Time |date=1928-07-30 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also announced that Calles had plans to nominate him as the Chairman of the National Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928342-2,00.html |title=MEXICO: New President |work=Time |date=1928-12-10 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Pascual Ortiz Rubio]] appointed him [[Secretary of Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Public Education]] on February 1930.  By 1934, Saenz had been dubbed as the "Shadow of Calles" and was named Governor of Mexico's Federal District by Mexican President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748144,00.html |title=MEXICO: Palm Down |work=Time |date=1934-12-10 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cardenas and the Mexican Congress, however, soon turned on both Calles and Saenz and condemned their continued persecution against Catholics in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788523-2,00.html |title=MEXICO: Ossy, Ossy, Boneheads |work=Time |date=1935-02-04 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving office in 1935, Saenz established a sugar corporation and quickly revolutionized sugar production in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Aarón Sáenz; Mexico's revolutionary capitalist, James C. Hefley, pg. 93&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as the "king of Mexican sugar", founding a dynasty which survives until this date, led by his son Aaron Saenz Couret and grandson Aaron Saenz Hirschfeld, at the head of the leading sugar company in Mexico.  At one point, he held a virtual monopoly of Mexico's sugar industry.&lt;ref name=ipm&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858259-5,00.html |title=MEXICO: The Domino Player |work=Time |date=1953-09-14 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His monopoly, however, was brought down during the administration of Mexican president [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortines]] by 1953.&lt;ref name=ipm /&gt;
Saenz was married to Margarita Couret, with whom he had eight sons. 

He died on 26 February 1983.

==Businesses==
For some time they all managed varied branches of the family's businesses, most of which have ceased to exist or passed into others' ownership. 
Most notable among these were:

*[[Mexicana de Aviación]] (Now bankrupt)
*Sugar mills
*Seguros Atlas—merged with Seguros Comercial America in the 90's and afterwards sold to France's [[AXA]]
*Banca Confía—nationalized in 1982, only to be re privatized by [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]]'s administration and passing into the hands of [[Jorge Lankenau]]'s insurance group, later to be merged with [[Grupo Financiero Banamex|Banamex]] and acquired by [[Citibank]] during President [[Ernesto Zedillo]]'s administration.

==Legacy==
Aarón Sáenz was related to [[Raul Saenz]], a prominent Mexican businessman in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] state, as well as [[Moises Saenz]], a prominent Mexican educator and diplomat.

{{nihongo|'''Astellas Pharma Inc.'''|アステラス製薬株式会社|Asuterasu Seiyaku Kabushiki-gaisha}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[pharmaceutical company]], formed on 1 April 2005 from the merger of {{nihongo|'''Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.'''|山之内製薬株式会社|Yamanouchi Seiyaku Kabushiki-gaisha}} and {{nihongo|'''Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.'''|藤沢薬品工業株式会社|Fujisawa Yakuhin Kōgyō Kabushiki-gaisha}}.

Astellas is a member of the [[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group]] (MUFJ) [[keiretsu]].

==History==
===Early foundations===
Fujisawa Shoten was started in 1894 by Tomokichi Fujisawa in [[Osaka]], and was renamed Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. in 1943. Yamanouchi Yakuhin Shokai was started in 1923 by Kenji Yamanouchi in Osaka.  The company was renamed Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. in 1940 and moved to Tokyo in 1942. Both companies started their overseas expansion at about the same time, opening offices in [[Taiwan]] in 1962 and 1963, respectively, and in the United States and Europe from 1977 onwards.

===Recent times and mergers===
Fujisawa acquired Lyphomed in 1990 and thereafter established its US R&amp;D center in [[Deerfield, Illinois]]. Yamanouchi's R&amp;D center in [[Leiderdorp]] was established with the acquisition of the pharmaceutical division of Royal Gist Brocades in 1991. Fujisawa and Yamanouchi combined in a "merger of equals," forming Astellas Pharma on 1 April 2005. At least some of its older products continue to be distributed under the original brand, ostensibly due to high brand-name recognition.&lt;ref&gt;"Yamanouchi Pimafucin (natamycin) product line manufactured at least up to 11/2007"&lt;/ref&gt; Astellas had a collaboration agreement with CoMentis from 2008 to 2014 focused on development of [[BACE inhibitor|beta-secretase inhibitor]] therapeutics for [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Astellas Ends Alzehimer's Collaboration with CoMentis | date=November 15, 2014 | work=[[Gen. Eng. Biotechnol. News]] | volume=34 | issue=20 | page=14 | type=paper | department=Discovery &amp; Development }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2010, Astellas acquired [[OSI Pharmaceuticals]] for $4.0 billion. In December 2014, Astellas expanded its 18-month-old collaboration with Cytokinetics, focusing on the R&amp;D and commercialization of skeletal muscle activators. The companies announced they will advance the development of CK-2127107 (a fast skeletal troponin activator) into Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of [[spinal muscular atrophy]] and possibly other [[neuromuscular]] conditions. The companies have extended their R&amp;D program focusing on the discovery of additional skeletal sarcomere activators through into 2016. The collaboration is expected to generate more than $600 million for Cytokinetics as well as $75 million in milestone payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-cytokinetics-expand-muscle-drug-collaboration/81250735/|title=Astellas, Cytokinetics Expand Muscle Drug Collaboration - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015 the company announced its move to acquire [[Ocata Therapeutics]] (formerly Advanced Cell Technology) for $379 million.&lt;ref name="genengnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-to-acquire-ocata-therapeutics-for-379m/81251957/|title=Astellas to Acquire Ocata Therapeutics for $379M - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 14, 2016, Astellas has not been able to acquire a majority of Ocata's common stock, which is necessary to complete the acquisition. The first deadline in the acquisition was November 17, 2015, and due to Astellas' failure to acquire a majority of Ocata's common stock, the deadline was extended to January 21, 2016. Many long-term stockholders have vowed to fight this acquisition by every legal means available to them, because they claim that the Astellas offer represents a huge discount - not a premium - to what they say is Ocata's true value. The deal was finally completed in February 2016.&lt;ref name="genengnews.com"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.astellas.us/news-releases?item=137160).|title=Astellas Announces Results of Tender Offer to Acquire All Outstanding Shares of Ocata Therapeutics and Changes to Subsidiaries|website=Newsroom.astellas.us|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in November 2015 the company announce it would sell its dermatology business to [[LEO Pharma]] for $725 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/leo-pharma-buys-astellas-dermatology-business-for-725m/81251969/|title=LEO Pharma Buys Astellas' Dermatology Business for $725M - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 Astellas announced it would acquire Ganymed Pharmaceuticals for $1.4 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-to-acquire-ganymed-pharmaceuticals-for-up-to-14b/81253378|title=Astellas to Acquire Ganymed Pharmaceuticals for Up to $1.4B - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the company announced it would acquire Belgium-based drug discovery firm Ogeda for up to a total €800 million, strengthening its late-stage pipeline with Ogeda's drug candidate, [[fezolinetant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astellas-to-buy-gpcr-drugs-firm-ogeda-for-up-to-800m/81254129|title=Astellas to Buy GPCR Drugs Firm Ogeda for up to €800M - GEN|website=GEN|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, the company announced that it exercised an option to purchase Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Mitobridge, which is developing treatments for [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] and age-related [[diseases]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.astellas.com/en/news/9926|title=Astellas Acquires Mitobridge Under Existing Collaboration  {{!}} Astellas Pharma Inc.

In 2016, the [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry]] gave Astellas a year-long suspension, after complaints it had "purposely misled the PMCPA." Audits afterwards found that Astellas was not adequately overseeing and training nurses, and had failed to provide complete prescribing information for several medicines. The company was suspended for a second year, and threatened with permanent expulsion in June 2017 for breaches of guidelines of the UK’s pharmaceutical industry trade body.&lt;ref name=ft-shocking&gt;{{cite news |last=Megaw |first=Nicholas |date=June 23, 2017 |title=Drugmaker Astellas sanctioned for ‘shocking’ patient safety failures |url=https://www.ft.com/content/288e2eef-3013-37d4-8cc3-9a0ead8f6bcd | work=[[Financial Times]] |location=United Kingdom |access-date=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Astellas announced it would acquire Quethera Limited for $109 million&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/astellas-announces-acquisition-of-quethera/?s=79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/astellas-expands-gene-therapy-investment-acquires-u-k-based-quethera-for-109-million/?s=79&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boutique Week''' is a bi-annual shopping event in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami. Boutique Week was launched in October 2010 in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles with over 40 [[boutiques]] participating in each city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919143430/http://www.boutiqueweek.net/ |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the participating boutiques offers their merchandise at a discount of at least 25% off during the selected week.

==support==
Boutique Week is supported by local government in these cities as an effort to stimulate the economy and raise awareness for small local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view%3Dpage%26pageId%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023054400/http://boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view=page&amp;pageId=3 |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page%3Dhappenings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708081449/http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page=happenings |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Broadway''' (officially known as '''Prakasam Salai''', after the freedom fighter [[T. Prakasam]]) is one of the historical thoroughfares of the commercial centre of [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. The road runs north–south connecting [[China Bazaar Road, Chennai|China Bazaar Road]] in the south with Ibrahim Sahib Street (Old Jail Road) in the north. The road divides George Town into Muthialpet and Peddanaickenpet.

Up until the 16th century, the road and the surrounding region, being near the coast, had many sand ridges. As the sea level rose, it inundated these regions, where several lagoons and ridges were left behind when the sea withdrew. The sandy ridges remained places of safety, where settlements were established. Several valleys ran around the ridges, which rose up to about 12&amp;nbsp;feet in height. Some of these valleys served as drainage channels. Until the late 18th century, the area on which the present day's road lies remained one such unwanted drainage channel,&lt;ref name="CMDA_StructureOfChennai"&gt;{{cite web

Much of the area was owned by [[Stephen Popham]], a former British [[member of parliament|MP]] and later the advocate general in [[Calcutta]], who moved to Madras in 1778. He is credited with establishing a modern police force in the city in 1782.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"&gt;{{cite news

The area where the [[Government General Hospital, Chennai|General Hospital]], Madras United Club and the [[Park Town, Chennai|Park Town]] post office stand today was then a hill known locally as Narimedu (literally 'mound of foxes'), which was named 'Hoggs Hill' by the British. When the British considered it as a security threat to [[Fort St. George]] and decided to level the area, Popham negotiated with them to buy the earth removed from the hill to fill the ditch. The thoroughfare thus created came to be known as 'Popham's Broadway'.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"/&gt;

By the 1890s, the road became known for two food establishments, the first of which was that of P. Venkatachellum, whose condiments and chutneys were popular in [[England]]. He is credited with the creation of [[Mulligatawny|mulligatawny soup]] from the local recipe of ''milagu rasam'' (''milagu thanni''). The other restaurant was Harrison's, established in 1891, which today is a contemporary hotel in [[Nungambakkam]].&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"/&gt;

The road was also home to the city's first private hospital run in the 1900s by physician T. A. Sankaranarayanan,&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"/&gt; decades before the advent of the [[Apollo Hospitals]], the country's first modern corporate hospital, established in 1983.

==The present-day road==
Today, the road has morphed into one of the most important commercial streets of George Town. Several commercial establishments, especially those of opticians, have their shops on this street.&lt;ref name="IndiaToday_HistoryBehindBroadway"/&gt; The [[Broadway bus terminus]], the largest bus terminus of the [[Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai)|Chennai Metropolitan Transport Corporation]], is located on the southern end of the road.

The road will also house the Mannadi Metro Rail station of the [[Chennai Metro Rail]] under construction.

A '''cartel''' is a group of apparently independent producers whose goal is to increase their collective profits by means of [[price fixing]], limiting supply, or other [[anti-competitive practices|restrictive practices]]. Cartels typically control selling prices, but some are organized to control the prices of purchased inputs. [[Competition law|Antitrust]] [[law|laws]] attempt to deter or forbid cartels. A single entity that holds a [[monopoly]] by this definition cannot be a cartel, though it may be guilty of abusing said monopoly in other ways. Cartels usually occur in [[oligopoly|oligopolies]], where there are a small number of sellers and usually involve [[commodity|homogeneous products]]. 

In general, cartels can be divided into domestic and international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Regulating Competition: Cartel registers in the twentieth-century world|last=Fellman|first=Susanna|last2=Shanahan|first2=Martin|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138021648|location=London|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Export cartels constitute a special case of international cartels. Unlike other cartels they are legal in virtually all jurisdictions, despite their harmful effects on affected markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martyniszyn |first1=Marek |title=Export Cartels: Is it Legal to Target your Neighbour? Analysis in Light of Recent Case Law |journal=Journal of International Economic Law |date=2012 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=181 |doi=10.1093/jiel/jgs003 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jiel/jgs003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bid rigging]] is a special type of cartel.

== Overview ==
{{Quote|text=People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. |author=Adam Smith |source=''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776}}

A survey of hundreds of published economic studies and legal decisions of antitrust authorities found that the median price increase achieved by cartels in the last 200 years is about 23 percent.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Connor. Cartel Overcharges, pp. 249-387 of The Law and Economics of Class Actions, in Vol. 29 of Research in Law and Economics, edited by James Langenfeld (March 2014). Bingley, UK: Emerald House Publishing Ltd. June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Private international cartels (those with participants from two or more nations) had an average price increase of 28 percent, whereas domestic cartels averaged 18 percent. Less than 10 percent of all cartels in the sample failed to raise market prices.

In general, cartel agreements are [[economics|economically]] unstable in that there is an [[incentive]] for members to cheat by selling at below the agreed price or selling more than the production quotas set by the cartel (see also [[game theory]]). This has caused many cartels that attempt to set product [[price]]s to be unsuccessful in the [[long term]]. Empirical studies of 20th century cartels have determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from 5 to 8 years. However, once a cartel is broken, the incentives to form the cartel return and the cartel may be re-formed. Publicly-known cartels that do not follow this [[Business cycle|cycle]] include, by some accounts, the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC).

[[Price fixing]] is often practiced internationally. When the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multilateral [[treaty]] or protected by national sovereignty, no antitrust actions may be initiated. Examples of such price fixing include oil whose price is partly controlled by the supply by OPEC countries. Also international airline tickets have prices fixed by agreement with the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]], a practice for which there is a specific exception in antitrust law. 

Prior to World War II (except in the United States), members of cartels could sign contracts that were enforceable in courts of law. There were even instances where cartels are encouraged by states. For example, during the period before 1945, cartels were tolerated in Europe and were promoted as a business practice in German-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Competition Policy in the European Union|last=Cini|first=Michelle|last2=McGowan|first2=Lee|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=0-230-00675-2|location=New York|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the norm due to the accepted benefits, which even the U.S. Supreme court has noted. In the case, ''the'' ''U.S. v. National Lead Co. et al.'', it cited the testimony of individuals, who cited that a cartel, in its protean form, is "a combination of producers for the purpose of regulating production and, frequently, prices, and an association by agreement of companies or sections of companies having common interests so as to prevent extreme or unfair competition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategies to Achieve a Binding International Agreement on Regulating Cartels: Overcoming Doha Standstill|last=Lee|first=John|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=978-981-10-2755-0|location=Berlin|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, however, price fixing by private entities is illegal under the antitrust laws of more than 140 countries. Examples of prosecuted international cartels are [[lysine]], [[citric acid]], [[graphite]] [[electrode]]s and bulk [[vitamin]]s. This is highlighted in countries with market economy wherein price-fixing and the concept of cartels are considered inimical to free and fair competition, which is considered the backbone of political democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Controlling International Technology Transfer: Issues, Perspectives, and Policy Implications|last=Sagafi-Nejad|first=Tagi|last2=Moxon|first2=Richard|last3=Perlmutter|first3=Howard|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=2017|isbn=0-08-027180-4|location=New York|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current condition makes it increasingly difficult for cartels to maintain sustainable operations. Even if international cartels might be out of reach for the regulatory authorities, they will still have to contend with the fact that their activities in domestic markets will be affected.&lt;ref&gt;Fellman &amp; Shanahan, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:ATF policy.jpg|thumb|The printing equipment company [[American Type Founders|ATF]] explicitly states in its 1923 manual that its goal is to 'discourage unhealthy competition' in the printing industry.]]
[[OPEC]]: As its name suggests, OPEC is organized by [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[state (polity)|states]].  The traditional view holds that it cannot be held to antitrust enforcement in other [[jurisdiction]]s by virtue of the [[doctrine]] of [[state immunity]] under [[public international law]]. It serves as an example of state entanglement in anticompetitive conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martyniszyn |first1=Marek |title=Foreign State’s Entanglement in Anticompetitive Conduct |journal=World Competition |date=2017 |volume=40 |issue=2 |page=299 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3116910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[trade association]]s, especially in [[industry|industries]] dominated by only a few major companies, have been accused of being fronts for cartels or facilitating secret meetings among cartel members.

Although cartels are usually thought of as a group of [[corporation]]s, the free-market economist [https://web.archive.org/web/20100624071027/http://www.cbe.csueastbay.edu/~sbesc/99septcol.html Charles W. Baird] considers [[trade union]]s to be cartels, as they seek to raise the price of labor ([[wage]]s) by preventing [[competition]]. For example, [[negotiated cartelism]] is a labor arrangement in which labor prices are held above the market clearing level through union leverage over employers.

An example of a new international cartel is the one created by the members of the [[Asian Racing Federation]] and documented in the [[Good Neighbour Policy (horse racing)|Good Neighbor Policy]] signed on September 1, 2003.

'''CP — Comboios de Portugal, EPE''' ('''''CP'''''; English: '''''Trains of Portugal''''') is a state-owned company which operates passenger trains in Portugal. Before June 2009, '''CP''' stood for '''Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses''' (English: '''''Portuguese Railways''''') although the company has been using its current designation as a brand name since 2004.

In 2017, CP transported 122 million passengers.&lt;ref name=cprel /&gt;

==History==
On 28 October 1856, the first railway line was inaugurated in Portugal, between [[Lisbon]] and [[Carregado]]: the ''Companhia dos Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses'' was born. The network was gradually expanded both south of the [[Tagus]] and to the north of the country, as well as in the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and [[Porto]] and to Spain. During the second half of the 20th century, much of CP's rolling stock was built in Portugal by [[Sorefame]] - notably carriages with stainless steel bodywork.

Gradually, [[railway electrification|electrification]] was put in place for a little less than half the network. In 1975, the company was nationalized, and its name was shortened to CP, A plan to finally connect all the district capitals by a fully electrified double line was to be implemented from 2010. Part of this plan is based on the Swiss [[Rail 2000]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Werner| last=Stohler| title=Modernização do sistema da exploração ferroviária da Região de Coimbra| url=http://adfer.cp.pt/ferxxi/ed05/pdf/31.pdf| language=Portuguese| accessdate=7 November 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811035111/http://adfer.cp.pt/ferxxi/ed05/pdf/31.pdf| archivedate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vouga line]] is now the only [[Metre gauge|narrow gauge]] line left in operation - it is also slated for closure.

==Infrastructure==
{{main|Rede Ferroviária Nacional}}
The infrastructure of the Portuguese network is managed by ''Infraestruturas de Portugal, EP'', usually abbreviated to IP

Portuguese railway network extent:
* [[Iberian gauge|Broad gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1668mm}}): {{convert|2603|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|1351|km|mi|abbr=on}} electrified at [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV 50 Hz AC]] and {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} at 1.5 kV&amp;nbsp;[[Direct current|DC]].
* [[Narrow gauge railway|Narrow gauge]] ([[metre gauge]]) {{RailGauge|1000mm}}: {{convert|188|km|mi|abbr=on}} not electrified.
* The maximum extent of {{convert|3592|km|mi|abbr=on}} was reached in 1949, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s some lines were shortened and some totally closed.

==Organization==
CP is split into four divisions:
* '''CP Longo Curso''', long-distance mainline services (Alfa Pendular, Intercidades and International trains).
* '''CP Regional''', regional services (Interregional and Regional).
* '''[[CP Lisboa]]''', Lisbon's suburban network.
* '''[[CP Porto]]''', Porto's suburban network.

==Services==
CP offers the following types of trains:
* '''International (IN)''' is the service that connects Portugal and Spain (one reaches France). These are the Sud Express (Lisbon - Irún/ Hendaye), the Lusitânia (Lisbon - Madrid) and the Celta (Porto - Vigo). Both Sud Express and Lusitânia are night trains that run as Trenhotel (Hotel Train).

*'''Alfa Pendular (AP)''' is the fastest service, whose speeds can reach 220&amp;nbsp;km/h. This service runs from [[Lisbon]] to either [[Porto]], [[Braga]] or [[Guimarães]] (passing through [[Coimbra]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] and [[Porto]]) or between [[Porto]] and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]. 
*'''Intercidades (IC)''' is a fast long-distance service whose speeds can reach 200&amp;nbsp;km/h. All '''IC''' services (apart from the Beja Shuttle) run from [[Lisbon]] to either [[Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Guimarães]], [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]], [[Covilhã]] or [[Évora]] (with connection at Casa Branca to [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]]), serving the majority of the Portuguese regions.  Service to southern Portugal runs to cities including Tunes, Faro, and Albufeira.&lt;ref&gt; See the timetable at www.cp.pt &lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Inter-Regional (IR)''' is a medium distance service which stops only at the main stations. Runs mainly on the routes [[Porto]]-[[Viana do Castelo Municipality|Viana do Castelo]]-[[Valença, Portugal|Valença]] (Minho Line), [[Porto]]-[[Régua]]-[[Pocinho]] (Douro Line), [[Lisbon]]-[[Caldas da Rainha]]-[[Leiria]]-[[Coimbra]] (West Line) and [[Lisbon]]-[[Tomar]] (North Line). Services are operated by the same trains as Regional service.
*'''Regional (R)''' is CP's local service, stopping at all stations, out of the Lisbon and Porto suburban areas.
*'''Urbano (U)''' is the CP's suburban service, in the regions of [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]] and in the [[Coimbra]]-[[Figueira da Foz]] Line.

==The network==
CP's flagship service, introduced in 1999, is the [[Alfa Pendular]] which operates between [[Braga]] - [[Porto]] - [[Lisbon]] - [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], at a top speed of 220&amp;nbsp;km/h (138&amp;nbsp;mph) with FIAT/Siemens [[tilting train]]s. As of 2006, CP's network reaches most of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cp.pt/StaticFiles/Imagens/PDF/Passageiros/mapas/mapas_cp_servicos_nacionais.pdf| title=CP route map| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520124649/http://www.cp.pt/StaticFiles/Imagens/PDF/Passageiros/mapas/mapas_cp_servicos_nacionais.pdf| archivedate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CP inaugurated new trains in suburban service in the 1990s.

'''Cwm Silicon''' (literally ''[[Silicon Valley]]'') is an epithet applied to a region of [[South Wales]] in the far west of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] that attracted much interest and [[inward investment]] from the technology sector in the early 2000s.{{fact|date=October 2010}}

The future of the area as an important technological centre is now uncertain following the closure of its key [[LG (Korea)|LG]] factory in August 2003.{{fact|date=October 2010}} The area is next to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and is a centre for high-technology companies, like much of the [[M4 corridor]].

A '''data mart''' is a structure / access pattern specific to ''data warehouse'' environments, used to retrieve client-facing data. The data mart is a subset of the data warehouse and is usually oriented to a specific business line or team. Whereas data warehouses have an enterprise-wide depth, the information in data marts pertains to a single department. In some deployments, each department or business unit is considered the ''owner'' of its data mart including all the ''hardware'', ''software'' and ''data''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110420134556/http://csis.bits-pilani.ac.in/faculty/goel/Data%20Warehousing/Articles/Data%20Marts/dataWarehouse_com%20%20Article_DM%20VS%20DW.htm Data Mart Does Not Equal Data Warehouse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This enables each department to isolate the use, manipulation and development of their data. In other deployments where conformed dimensions are used, this business unit ownership will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer, product, etc.

Organizations build data warehouses and data marts because the information in the database is not organized in a way that makes it readily accessible, requiring queries that are too complicated or resource-consuming.

While [[Operational database|transactional databases]] are designed to be updated, data warehouses or marts are [[File system permissions|read only]]. Data warehouses are designed to access large groups of related records. Data marts improve end-user response time by allowing users to have access to the specific type of data they need to view most often by providing the data in a way that supports the collective view of a group of users.

A data mart is basically a condensed and more focused version of a data warehouse that reflects the regulations and process specifications of each business unit within an organization. Each data mart is dedicated to a specific business function or region. This subset of data may span across many or all of an enterprise’s functional subject areas. It is common for multiple data marts to be used in order to serve the needs of each individual business unit (different data marts can be used to obtain specific information for various enterprise departments, such as accounting, marketing, sales, etc.).

The related term [[spreadmart]] is a pejorative describing the situation that occurs when one or more business analysts develop a system of linked [[spreadsheets]] to perform a business analysis, then grow it to a size and degree of complexity that makes it nearly impossible to maintain.

==Data mart vs data warehouse==
Data warehouse:
* Holds multiple subject areas
* Holds very detailed information
* Works to integrate all data sources
* Does not necessarily use a [[Dimensional modeling|dimensional model]] but feeds dimensional models.

Data mart:
* Often holds only one subject area- for example, Finance, or Sales
* May hold more summarized data (although may hold full detail)
* Concentrates on [[information integration|integrating information]] from a given subject area or set of source systems
* Is built focused on a dimensional model using a star schema.

== Design schemas ==

*[[Star schema]] - fairly popular design choice; enables a [[relational database]] to emulate the analytical functionality of a [[multidimensional database]]
*[[Snowflake schema]]

== Reasons for creating a data mart ==
* Easy access to frequently needed data
* Creates collective view by a group of users
* Improves end-user [[Response time (technology)|response time]]
* Ease of creation
* Lower cost than implementing a full [[data warehouse]]
* Potential users are more clearly defined than in a full data warehouse
* Contains only business essential data and is less cluttered.

== Dependent data mart ==
According to the [[Bill Inmon|Inmon]] school of data warehousing, a '''dependent data mart''' is a logical subset ([[View (database)|view]]) or a physical subset (extract) of a larger [[data warehouse]], isolated for one of the following reasons:

*A need refreshment for a special [[data model]] or [[logical schema|schema]]: e.g., to restructure for [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]]
*Performance: to offload the data mart to a separate [[computer]] for greater efficiency or to eliminate the need to manage that workload on the centralized data warehouse.
*Security: to separate an authorized data subset selectively
*Expediency: to bypass the data governance and authorizations required to incorporate a new application on the Enterprise Data Warehouse
*Proving Ground: to demonstrate the viability and ROI (return on investment) potential of an application prior to migrating it to the Enterprise Data Warehouse
*Politics: a coping strategy for IT (Information Technology) in situations where a user group has more influence than funding or is not a good citizen on the centralized data warehouse.
*Politics: a coping strategy for consumers of data in situations where a data warehouse team is unable to create a usable data warehouse.

According to the Inmon school of data warehousing, tradeoffs inherent with data marts include limited [[scalability]], [[data duplication|duplication of data]], [[data inconsistency]] with other silos of information, and inability to leverage enterprise sources of data.

The alternative school of data warehousing is that of [[Ralph Kimball]]. In his view, a data warehouse is nothing more than the union of all the data marts. This view helps to reduce costs and provides fast development, but can create an inconsistent data warehouse, especially in large organizations. Therefore, Kimball's approach is more suitable for small-to-medium corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Paulraj Ponniah. ''Data Warehousing Fundamentals for IT Professionals.''

'''Diamond-Star Motors''' ('''DSM''') was an [[automobile]]-manufacturing [[joint venture]] between the [[Chrysler Corporation]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi Motors Corporation]] (MMC).&lt;ref name="nyt88"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/05/business/mixing-cultures-on-the-assembly-line.html "Mixing Cultures On the Assembly Line"], John Holusha, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The name came from the parent companies' respective [[logo]]s: three ''diamonds'' (Mitsubishi) and a penta''star'' (Chrysler).&lt;ref name="nyt91"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/15/business/business-people-mitsubishi-executive-joins-chrysler-venture.html " Business People; Mitsubishi Executive Joins Chrysler Venture"], John Holusha, ''The New York Times'', June 15, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond-Star Motors was officially renamed '''Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, Inc.''' ('''MMMA''') in 1995, four years after Mitsubishi took sole control of the plant, and from 2002 to 2016 its official name had been '''Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc.''' ('''MMNA''') '''Manufacturing Division'''.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/history/index.asp History of MMMA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117105954/http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/history/index.asp |date=2007-01-17 }}, MMMA official website&lt;/ref&gt;

In the automotive enthusiast community, ''DSM'', especially used in the singular (e.g. ''a DSM'') generally refers to the original first- and second-generation [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], [[Eagle Talon]], and [[Plymouth Laser]], which all shared the same Diamond-Star Motors [[vehicle platform]].

==Background==
The origins of Diamond-Star Motors can be traced back to 1970 when Chrysler Corporation took a 15 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors, as part of MMC's strategy of expansion through [[Business alliance|alliances]] with foreign partners. The U.S. company began distributing Mitsubishis as [[Chrysler]]-, [[Dodge]]-, and [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]]-branded [[captive import]]s (e.g. [[Dodge Colt]]), a successful venture as the [[compact car]]s met consumer demand for smaller and more [[fuel-efficient]] vehicles in the 1970s, filling a gap at the bottom of the Chrysler group's range.&lt;ref name="fund"&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Mitsubishi-Motors-Corporation-Company-History.html History of Mitsubishi], Funding Universe&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982, Chrysler was importing 110,000 Mitsubishis annually. However, a minor conflict was forming as the Japanese now wanted to sell directly through their own-[[brand]]ed dealerships. A voluntary [[import quota]] system was in place at this time, restricting the number of cars Japanese [[automaker]]s could bring into the U.S. As the Japanese company began to open its own branded dealerships to sell directly, every imported [[Mitsubishi Cordia|Cordia]], [[Mitsubishi Tredia|Tredia]], and [[Mitsubishi Starion|Starion]] sold by Mitsubishi had to be discounted from Chrysler's allocation.&lt;ref name="fund"/&gt;

==Incorporation==

[[Image:04-06 Mitsubishi Galant.jpg|thumb|right|The ninth generation of the [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]] sedan was originally designed and built exclusively for the North American market, and was MMMA's volume seller.]]
In order to circumvent this, the two partners officially incorporated Diamond-Star Motors in October 1985. An incentive package worth [[US dollar|US$]]274&amp;nbsp;million, and an intense and controversial lobbying effort by state and local government authorities, meant that [[Illinois]] won the new auto plant,&lt;ref name="illinois"&gt;{{cite book | last = Chapman | first = Margaret L. | authorlink = |author2=Arun P. Elhance |author3=John D. Wenum  | title = Mitsubishi Motors in Illinois | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | date = 1995 | location = | pages = 129 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OGQ4u2gZKxwC&amp;dq | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-89930-972-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 1986 ground was broken on a {{convert|1900000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} production facility in the town of [[Normal, Illinois|Normal]]. The plant was completed in March 1988, with an annual capacity of 240,000 vehicles.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  In 1989, the workers at the plant formed [[United Auto Workers]] Local 2488, and signed their first contract with the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bntrades.org/news.php?id=20 "Working Class Voice: Labor Unions in McLean County"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917215933/http://bntrades.org/news.php?id=20 |date=2010-09-17 }}, Chapter 20: UAW 2488, Bloomington &amp; Normal Trades &amp; Labor Assembly web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, three models were produced at this facility. The [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]], [[Plymouth Laser]], and [[Eagle Talon]] were smaller [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] sports cars on a new co-designed platform. Models subsequently produced during the next decade included the [[Mitsubishi Mirage]]/[[Eagle Summit]] sedans, the [[Mitsubishi Galant]], the [[Dodge Avenger|Dodge Avenger Coupe]]/[[Chrysler Sebring|Chrysler Sebring Coupe]], and the [[Dodge Stratus|Dodge Stratus Coupe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/vehicles/index.asp About the vehicles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021023044529/http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/vehicles/index.asp |date=2002-10-23 }}, MMMA official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departure of Chrysler==
Initially Diamond-Star Motors was a 50-50 [[joint venture]] between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. However, in 1991 the Japanese company purchased its partner's interest, and thereafter the manufacture of Chrysler vehicles was on a contractual basis. Chrysler sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993, and Diamond-Star Motors was renamed Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA) on July 1, 1995.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Despite the departure, the two companies have maintained various co-operative manufacturing agreements since and considered all vehicle produced until 1995&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allpar.com/history/mitsubishi.html&lt;/ref&gt; as Diamond Star Motors.

Formerly, the plant produced vehicles using the American-developed [[Mitsubishi PS platform]], including the current [[Mitsubishi Endeavor|Endeavor]], [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]], and [[Mitsubishi Eclipse|Eclipse]]. In mid-2012, the plant began producing the [[Mitsubishi RVR]] platform sold in United States as the Outlander Sport. Approximately 1,900 people work in the highly mechanized plant, alongside approximately 1,000 robots. An expansion in 2003 means that it now occupies {{convert|2400000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/facility/index.asp About the facility] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120907145605/http://www.mitsubishimanufacturing.com/about/facility/index.asp |date=2012-09-07 }}, MMMA official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant closure announced==
In July 2015, Mitsubishi announced that it would end production at the plant in Normal. The plant had been operating well below capacity for several years.  In 2014, it produced just over 69,000 vehicles out of a capacity of 240,000 vehicles annually. Production would shift to Japan, with Mitsubishi importing all vehicles sold in North America. Mitsubishi said it would try to sell the plant to preserve jobs, but that the plant would be closed by November if no buyer was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20150727/OEM01/307279955/mitsubishi-throws-in-towel-on-fading-era | title=Mitsubishi throws in towel on fading era | date=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately a buyer was not found in time, and production ended on the 30th of November.  Most of the workers (900 out of 1200) were let go on that date, with the rest staying to build replacement parts until the final closure of the plant in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cinewsnow.com/news/local/Union-workers-say-goodbye-to-27-years-at-Mitsubishi-plant-359076501.html | title=Union workers say goodbye to 27 years at Mitsubishi plant | date=2015-11-30 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202174548/http://www.cinewsnow.com/news/local/Union-workers-say-goodbye-to-27-years-at-Mitsubishi-plant-359076501.html | archivedate=2015-12-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually the plant was sold to Maynards Industries, an auctioning and liquidation firm, with ownership to transfer June 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pekintimes.com/article/20160430/NEWS/160439995 | title=Mitsubishi plant sold | access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thohir received his master's degree in 1993 from [[National University (California)]], United States.&lt;ref name="veda2009" /&gt;

Currently, Thohir's family holding company, TNT Group, has large investments in the Indonesian energy, foods, property and media industries. In 2015, the TNT group had a revenue of $1,1 billion.

==Career==
Upon his return to Indonesia, together with his colleagues, he formed the [[Mahaka Media|Mahaka Group]].&lt;ref name="veda2009" /&gt;

In 2001, the Mahaka Group bought ''[[Republika (Indonesian newspaper)|Republika]]'', the biggest Islamic newspaper in [[Indonesia]]. Because of Thohir's background in communications, he was chosen to lead the paper.&lt;ref name="veda2009" /&gt; He received support from his father, as well as founder of ''[[Kompas]]'' Jakob Oetama and founder of ''[[Jawa Pos]]'' [[Dahlan Iskan]]&lt;ref name="veda2009" /&gt; to run this newspaper. The Mahaka Group spread its potential by investing in the outdoor advertising company Mahaka Advertising due to the growth of the economic and the city size in 2002.&lt;ref name="veda2009" /&gt;

After launching the television station [[Jak TV]], Mahaka introduced the radio stations [[Gen FM|98.7 Gen FM]] and [[Jak FM|101 Jak FM]], and participated in PT Radionet Cipta Karya ([[Prambors|Prambors FM]], [[Delta FM]] and [[FeMale Radio]]), as well as numerous advertising, ticketing, entertainment and digital companies.&lt;ref name="veda2009" /&gt;

Thohir is the founder of Darma Bakti Mahaka Foundation.

In 2011, together with [[Anindya Bakrie]] hw co-owned the television stations [[tvOne (Indonesia)|tvOne]], as well as the internet news site [[Viva News]]. In 2014, he was involved in a turnaround project and became the President Director of [[antv]].&lt;ref name="nonto" /&gt;

In 2018, incumbent president [[Joko Widodo]] picked Thohir as chief of his [[Joko Widodo presidential campaign, 2019|re-election campaign]] for the [[Indonesian presidential election, 2019|2019 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indonesia president picks Asian Games chief to run re-election... |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-politcs/indonesia-president-picks-asian-games-chief-to-run-re-election-campaign-idUSKCN1LN1N9 |accessdate=7 September 2018 |work=Reuters |date=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports team ownership==
After negotiations started after the [[2011 NBA All-Star Game]] with former basketball agent [[Jason Levien]] and managing owner [[Joshua Harris (businessman)|Joshua Harris]], Thohir became part of the consortia that bought the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. The consortia included actor [[Will Smith]], his wife [[Jada Pinkett Smith]],&lt;ref name="thohirbecomes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, in June 2016 Thohir sold part of its stake in Inter Milan to [[Suning Holdings Group]], which was chaired by self-made billionaire [[Zhang Jindong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inter.it/en/news/53171/suning-holdings-group-acquires-majority-stake-of-f-c-internazionale-milano |title=Suning Holdings Group acquires majority stake of F.C.

The European '''Car of the Year''' award is an international award established in 1964, by a collective of [[Magazine|automobile magazine]]s from different countries in Europe. The current organisers of the award are ''[[Auto (magazine)|Auto]]'' (Italy), ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' (United Kingdom), ''[[Autopista (magazine)|Autopista]]'' (Spain), ''[[Autovisie]]'' (Netherlands), ''[[L'Automobile Magazine]]'' (France), ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' (Germany) and ''[[Vi Bilägare]]'' (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizing magazines|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/organization|work=Car of the Year|accessdate=24 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208151612/http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/organization|archivedate=8 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voting [[jury]] consists of motoring [[journalist]]s from publications throughout Europe. Representation from each country is based on the size of the country's car market, and car manufacturing industry. There are no categories or class winners — the stated objective is to find a "single, decisive winner" among all competing cars.

The 2017 ECOTY was announced on March 6, 2017, at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the winner being the [[Peugeot 3008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/news/watch-live-car-year-2017-winner-announced/|title=Peugeot 3008 wins European Car of the Year 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Ed|date=2017-03-06|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-events/geneva/2017/peugeot-3008-wins-car-of-the-year-2017/|title=Peugeot 3008 wins Car of the Year 2017|work=CAR Magazine|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current rules==
Eligible cars are new models released in the twelve months prior to the award. The award is not restricted to European cars, but nominees must be available in at least five European countries, and have expected sales of 5,000 a year.

Nominees are judged on the following criteria: design, comfort, safety, economy, handling, performance, functionality, environmental requirements, driver satisfaction and price. Technical innovation and value for money are also important factors.&lt;ref name="caroftheyear.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/our-spirit|title=What makes a Car of the Year?|accessdate=2010-11-20|work=caroftheyear.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shortlist of seven cars is selected by a simple vote. For the final round of voting, each jury member has 25 points to distribute among the finalists. The points must be distributed to at least five cars, with no more than ten to any one car, and no joint top marks. The voting is open, and each jury member provides published justification for their vote distribution.

Under these rules, the decisiveness of the victory has varied greatly. For example, in 1988, the '''Peugeot 405''' won by 212 points, the biggest gap in the history of the ''European Car of the Year'' competition; such feat was repeated in 2013, as the Mk VII '''Volkswagen Golf''' won by the same points gap. In 2010 the '''Volkswagen Polo''' won by a mere 10 points, received maximum points from twenty-five jurors, and was the top choice of 59.

The [[Renault Clio]] (1991, 2006), [[Volkswagen Golf]] (1992, 2013), and [[Opel Astra|Opel/Vauxhall Astra]] (1985, 2016), are the only cars to have won the award more than once.

In November 2010, the [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electrically-powered vehicle to be awarded ''Car of the Year''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/25/nissan-leaf-gets-european-car-of-the-year-first-ever-for-an-electric-car/|title=Nissan Leaf Gets European Car Of The Year, First Ever For An Electric Car|last=Contributor|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/nissan-leaf-takes-european-car-of-the-year-2150500.html|title=Nissan Leaf takes European Car of the Year|date=2010-12-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
British carmakers produced the first two winners of the award. The [[Rover P6|Rover 2000]] saloon was the inaugural winner in 1964 while the [[BMC ADO17|Austin 1800]] was victorious in 1965. The Rover won over another British contender, the rear-engine [[Hillman Imp]].

The [[Renault 16]] was the world's first production hatchback car {{Disputed inline|Disputed|date=December 2017}} and unsurprisingly won the award for 1966, having been launched at the beginning of 1965. A year later, the award went to the Fiat 124, which won more than twice as many as voted as its nearest competitor, the BMW 1600. Fiat missed out the following year, however, when its 125 was pipped to the award by the revolutionary new NSU Ro80, one of the first production cars to feature a rotary engine.

Peugeot claimed the accolade for the first time with the 1969 award, which was won by its 504 saloon, a large family car which offered a high standard of interior comfort and build quality. The Fiat 128 was the next winner of the award, while a year later the innovative new Citroen GS family saloon won the award.

Fiat became the first manufacturer to win the award for a third time when its 127 supermini won the 1972 title. The next winner of the award was the Audi 80, and the 1974 award went to the Mercedes-Benz 450SE luxury saloon.

Despite financial problems which led to its takeover by Peugeot that year, Citroen won the accolade in 1975 with its flagship CX saloon, which fought off a strong challenge from the highly acclaimed Volkswagen Golf. Then came [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler Europe's]] first winner of the award, the contemporary Simca 1307/1308 (Chrysler Alpine in the United Kingdom). Despite all the strife which troubled [[British Leyland]] throughout the 1970s, the state-owned carmaker achieved recognition for 1977 when its [[Rover SD1|Rover 3500]] executive car won the award - the last time a British marque has been named European Car of the Year.

Sports cars have traditionally accounted for only a tiny percentage of car sales throughout Europe, but the European Car of the Year accolade was won by one for 1978, when the Porsche 928 sealed the award in the face of competition from the BMW 7 Series and Ford Granada.

Just before the sale of its European division to Peugeot, Chrysler achieved a success second in the contest with its Horizon, which won the 1979 award ahead of one of its main rivals, Fiat Ritmo/Strada. Lancia finally achieved recognition a year later when its stylish new Delta hatchback was voted European Car of the Year.

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] finally achieved success in the contest when its MK3 Escort, the first of that model line to feature front-wheel drive or a hatchback, sealed the award for 1981, fighting off competition from British Leyland's crucial Austin Metro supermini and the Fiat Panda. A year later, the accolade was perhaps surprisingly won by the Renault 9, which managed to finish ahead of the more widely well regarded Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier and the MK2 Volkswagen Polo. The 1983 award was won by the Audi 100, which narrowly finished ahead of the slightly smaller and similarly aerodynamic Ford Sierra.

The 1984 award saw two new superminis finish well ahead of the nearest contenders. The Fiat Uno was Fiat's fourth success in the history of the award, finishing slightly ahead of the Peugeot 205. A year later, [[General Motors]] finally achieved recognition when its latest version of the Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra sealed it. Ford achieved a second victory in the 1986 contest with its new Scorpio/Granada flagship Which unsuccessful in the American market. General Motors made it two victories in three years when its own flagship model, the Opel Omega/[[Vauxhall Carlton]], won the award for 1987.

19 years after the 504 gave Peugeot its first European Car of the Year, the French carmaker finally enjoyed its second triumph in the competition when its mid-range 405 saloon won the 1988 award by a wide margin. A year later, Fiat became the first manufacturer to win the award five times when its ground-breaking new Tipo achieved victory.

Citroen's new XM flagship model won the award for 1990, with its French rival Renault scoring success a year later with the new Clio supermini, which signalled the end for the iconic R5. With the award now nearly 30 years old, Volkswagen finally achieved recognition in 1992 when its MK3 Golf won the award, finishing ahead of two of its most important competitors - the Vauxhall/Opel Astra and Citroen ZX.

A non-European brand - with a British-built product - won the award for the first time for 1993, when the Nissan Micra earned top marks ahead of the Fiat Cinquecento (a car which helped the popularity of city cars in Europe to soar over the next few years) and Renault's new flagship, the Safrane.

Ford achieved a third success in the competition with its Mondeo, successor to the Sierra, winning the award for 1994. Fiat increased its number of victories in the contest to six, when its new Punto supermini won the award for 1995, just as its Uno and 127 ancestors had done many years earlier. Fiat made it seven victories a year later when its Bravo/Brava range pipped the stylish Peugeot 406 to the honour.

Renault's innovative compact MPV, the Scenic, won the ECOTY And Japan Import Car of the Year for 1997, while The Fiat subsidiary [[Alfa Romeo]] won the next year's award for the first time with its 156 mid-range sports saloon.

Ford achieved a fourth success in the contest when its boldly-styled Focus won the 1999 award, fighting off competition from the latest Vauxhall/Opel Astra as well as Peugeot's stylish 206 supermini. A year later, a Japanese manufacturer - this time with a Japanese-built product - won the award when the [[Toyota Yaris]] Hatchback and [[Toyota Yaris Verso|Yaris Verso]] Mini MPV earned top marks in Car of the Year Japan and ECOTY ahead of the boldly-styled Fiat Multipla and the practical Vauxhall/Opel Zafira compact MPV.

Alfa Romeo's modern revival continued when its stylish 147 won the award for 2001, with the next winner being the Peugeot 307. It was another French success for 2003, when the second generation Renault Megane was the winner.

Fiat achieved its eighth success in the contest when its all-new Panda won the 2004 award. Toyota made it two victories from six years when its radical Prius hybrid won the 2005 award. The Renault Clio became the first model to win the award twice when the third generation of the popular supermini won it for 2006, having previously won in 1991.

Ford's stylish and practical S-MAX won the 2007 award, fighting off a close challenge from the Vauxhall/Opel Corsa, earlier versions of which had been largely overlooked by the contest's judges.

Fiat made in nine victories in the contest when it won the 2008 award with the 500 model, a retro-styled take on its iconic small car which had first been launched 50 years earlier. The next award went to a more traditional and mainstream offering, when Vauxhall/Opel won the award for only the third time with its Insignia.

Volkswagen's Polo supermini had been around in several forms since its launch in the mid 1970s, but the all-new version launched in 2009 was the first generation of Polo to win this award, and only the second Volkswagen-badged car ever to win it.

Then came two years of success for electric-powered cars, with the British-built Nissan Leaf and United States-built (Opel) Vauxhall Ampera/Chevrolet Volt winning the 2011 and 2012 award respectively.

The Volkswagen Golf (having previously won in 1992) then joined the Renault Clio with the distinction of two wins in the contest when the MK7 version won the 2013 award. One of the Golf's key rivals, the Peugeot 308, was the next winner. In 2015, was awarded the Volkswagen Passat. In 2016, the Opel/Vauxhall Astra, another key rival to the Golf, became the third automobile to win the award twice, having previously won in 1985.

In 2017 Peugeot won with the fifth time with the crossover 3008.

The 2018 winner announced on 5 March is for a Swedish manufacturer for the first time in the history of the competition, with the Volvo XC40 winning.

'''Grievance Redressal System''' is a mechanism to receive and act on complaints and [[grievance]]s reported by customers of a private organization or public citizens accessing a government (G2C) service.

[[Grievance Redressal]] may be handled directly by organizations through their own [[website]]s or through call centers.  A new innovation is smart [[web portal]]s for grievance processing, connecting customers and action-takers directly through ICT media such as [[Short messaging service|SMS]] and [[email]].

'''Hendrik Figee''' ([[Haarlem]], May 28, 1838 &amp;ndash; [[Haarlem]], December 3, 1907) was a Dutch businessman and entrepreneur creditted with growing the Haarlem factory [[Figee]] into an international manufacturer of [[crane (machine)|crane]]s.

He was the son of Hendrik Figee the elder who attended grade school and later became a surveyor. After passing his surveyor's exam, he went to work for his father in his steam engine factory on the Spaarne river. In 1866 he became full partner along with his brother Thomas and the company name changed to Gebroeders Figee (Figee brothers).&lt;ref name=NNBW&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/retroboeken/nnbw/#source=2&amp;page=227 Hendrik Figee] biography in the [[NNBW]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped start the crane manufacturing company Figee &amp; De Kruyff in Amsterdam and the ironworks called the Haarlems IJzergieterij. In 1883 his brother Thomas bought the shipbuilding company Conrad on the other side of the Spaarne river. Werf Conrad had been named after the renowned Dutch engineer [[Frederik Willem Conrad]] (1800-1870). Figee wanted to make dredgers (baggermolens).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beeldbank.noord-hollandsarchief.nl/memorix/404be2c0-fb8f-11df-9e4d-523bc2e286e2 picture of Conrad dredger being let into the water] in 1910 on North Holland Archives&lt;/ref&gt; The dredgers needed cranes on board, and these were supplied by Figee, which became a specialist in building cranes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.havenmuseum.nl/het-museum.collectieobject&amp;cat_id=5&amp;col_id=5 Crane]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in the [[Haven Museum]], Rotterdam&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the board of the [[Maatschappij voor Nijverheid en Handel, Haarlem]] from 1898-1902 and was also a member of the board of the Colonial Museum, formerly located in [[villa Welgelegen]].&lt;ref name=NNBW/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">[[File:Johann Conrad Fischer 1773-1854.jpg|thumb|Johann Conrad Fischer 1854]]

'''Johann Conrad Fischer''' (14 September 1773 - 26 December 1854) was a Swiss [[metallurgist]], inventor, and pioneer in the [[steel industry]]. As an entrepreneur he also held public offices. He was the first president of the City Council of [[Schaffhausen]]. He was the founder of [[Georg Fischer AG]].

==Biography==
Johann Conrad Fischer was born on 14 September 1773 as son of the entrepreneur Johann Conrad Fischer in Schaffhausen.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Knoepfli. ''Vier Generationen Fischer Schaffhausen: Mit Eisen- und Stahlguss zum Erfolg''. Naefels: Verein fuer wirtschaftshistorische Studien, 2001. {{ISBN|3-909059-24-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending the ''Gymnasium'' in Schaffhausen, he learned the trades of coppersmith and [[fire pump]] maker in his father's company. Between 1792 and 1794 he travelled through Germany, Scandinavia and England. After his return to [[Switzerland]] in 1794 he took over the management of the family business in 1797. In 1802 he purchased several former mills in [[Muehlental (SH)]] section of the [[Merishausertal]] on the northern outskirts of Schaffhausen and set up a small [[foundry]] for the production of cast iron bells and fire pump engines. In 1806, as the first on continental Europe, he began to cast steel. Once the [[Continental Blockade]] was lifted in 1814, Fischer undertook a study trip to England and subsequently published his experiences in a travel journal. In particular he was critical of the economic upheavals he observed in the Midlands, the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He continued to travel through England, Austria, Germany and France. In France he was invited by the Ministry of the Interior to set up a business there. He began to experiment with the addition of alloys to cast steel. In 1807 he cast steel with [[manganese]], in 1814 he mixed so-called yellow steel with cooper, in 1819 with silver, and in 1823 with chromium. In 1827 he successfully created a cast iron which could be employed as [[malleable iron]] and obtained a patent in Austria for this invention. His last alloyed cast iron consisted to one-third part of copper, which he named ''Fischer-Metall''. This would be useful much later for railroad axials.

==Family==
In 1797 Johann Conrad Fischer married Catharina von Waldkirch and they had three sons who carried on their father's work:
*[[Georg Fischer (1804-1888)]]
*[[Berthold Fischer (1807-1879)]]
*[[Wilhelm Fischer (1803-1882)]]
Johann Conrad Fischer died in Schaffhausen at the age of 81. His grandson [[Georg Fischer II (1834-1887)]] and great-grandson [[George Fischer III (1864-1925)]] continued to expand the family business until the beginning of the 20th century.

==Fischer as Entrepreneur and Civic Leader==
Fischer was more active as an inventor than as manufacturer and businessman. In 1819 he supported the establishment of a steel factory near [[Montbeliard]] in eastern France. He held license agreements with manufacturing companies in London and Luettich. Due to its favorable legal conditions, he patented nearly all his inventions in Austria. Furthermore he set up three steel foundries in Austria which were managed by his sons: 1827 in Hainfeld, 1833 in Traisen and 1839 in Salzburg.

Johann Conrad Fischer held several public offices in Schaffhausen beginning in 1797. His opinion was often sought by newspapers and journalists in matters related to railroads, coinage, import and export taxation, as well as constitutional matters. He maintained regular correspondence with many friends not only in Switzerland, but also in numerous other European countries. Fischer is regarded as one of the leading public figures of Schaffhausen in the 19th century.

The company specialised in printing annotated [[bible]]s and religious works including Scotland's firsrt religious newspaper, the '''Scottish Guardian'''.

==Life==
[[File:42 BUTE GARDENS, LILYBANK HOUSE.jpg|thumb|300px|Lilybank House in Glasgow]]

He was born near [[Glasgow]] on 27 September 1805 the eldest of eight children of John Blackie (1782-1874) and his wife, Catherine Duncan. He was educated at William Angus's English School on Ingram Street then at the Glasgow High School.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1830 the family moved to [[Glasgow]] where his father was partner in Blackie, Fullarton &amp; Co at 8 East Clyde Street on the north side of the [[River Clyde]]. The family then lived at 18 Monteith Row.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1830.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831 following the death of Fullarton the company renamed as '''Blackie &amp; Son''' but still operated from 8 Clyde Street. In 1837 a sister company was set up by John's younger brother, Walter Graham Blackie (1816-1906), and named '''W. G. Blackie &amp; Co''', which existed cocurrently with but separate from Blackie &amp; Son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Blackie_and_Son|title=Blackie and Son|publisher=Grace's Guide|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 Blackie joined Glasgow town council as a Liberal councillor. He became burgh magistrate in 1859. In 1863 he was elected [[Lord Provost]] and served for three years, succeeding to [[Peter Clouston]]. His main acievement in this role was in the instigation and implementation of Glasgow's City Improvement Act of 1865 which began a programme of slum clearance and rebuilding. A fresh water supply from [[Loch Katrine]] was also agreed and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgowwestaddress.co.uk/100_Glasgow_Men/Blackie_John.htm John Blackie] Retrieved 2 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

John died of [[pleurisy]] on 12 February 1873 at his home Lilybank House in the [[Hillhead]] district.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the death of John Blackie senior in 1874 (outliving his son) the company passed to various of his grandsons and the company was rebranded as '''Blackie &amp; Co Ltd'''.

==Family==
In 1849 he married Agnes Gourlay daughter of William Gourlay, a Glasgow merchant of 8 South Frederick Street.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1849.&lt;/ref&gt;

They had three sons who later rebranded the company as '''Blackie &amp; Co'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8044">'''Kiss up kick down''' (or '''suck up kick down''') is a [[neologism]] used to describe the situation where middle level employees in an organization are polite and [[flattering]] to superiors but [[abusive supervision|abusive to subordinates]].&lt;ref name=Paton1&gt;[http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/sites/default/files/transcripts/Tuesday_21_June_2011_-_transcript.pdf Mid Staffordshire Public Inquiry Transcript - day 103 - 21 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have originated in the US, with the first documented use having occurred in 1993. The concept can be applied to any social interaction where one person believes they have power over another person and believes that another person has power over them.&lt;ref name=Paton2&gt;Calum Paton The Policy of NHS Deficits and NHS Re-form in Health Policy and Politics 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McNamara&gt;JJ Mearsheimer, D Shapley [http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0020x1.pdf MCNAMARA'S WAR]  Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 00963402, Jul/Aug93, Vol.49, Issue 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of use ==
===Robert McNamara===
The ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' described [[Robert McNamara]], an American business executive and the eighth [[United States Secretary of Defense]], as a classic case of the ''kiss up, kick down'' personality in August 1993.&lt;ref name=McNamara/&gt;

===John R. Bolton===
On day 2 of the Senate confirmation hearings, April 12, 2005, for [[John R. Bolton]], a [[George W. Bush|Bush]] nomination for the US representative to the UN, the Senate panel focused on allegations that Bolton pressured intelligence analysts. Former State Department intelligence chief [[Carl Ford|Carl W. Ford Jr.]] characterized Bolton as a "''kiss-up, kick-down'' sort of guy", implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him, while having very little regard for people working under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-04-12-bolton_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Critic says Bolton a 'kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy' | first1=Barbara | last1=Slavin | date=April 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Health Service===
Calum Paton, Professor of Health Policy at [[Keele University]], describes ''kiss up kick down'' as a prevalent feature of the UK [[National Health Service]] culture. He raised this point when giving evidence at the [[Stafford_Hospital_scandal#Public_inquiry|Stafford Hospital scandal public inquiry]]. Credit is centralised and blame devolved. "''Kiss up kick down'' means that your middle level people will ''kiss-up'', they will please their masters, political or otherwise, and they will ''kick down'' to blame somebody else when things go wrong."
&lt;ref name=Paton1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Francis (barrister)|Robert Francis]] (Nov 29, 2011) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwnVE4GPbhs Organisational Culture seminar: opening statement]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For example, NHS Trust bosses are nervous of reporting deficits and seek to under-report until it's too late. They seek to please their political superiors in the short term and shift blame down the line.&lt;ref name=Paton2/&gt;

==Blame in organizations==
Some [[systems theory|systems theorists]] and [[management consultant]]s, such as [[Gerald Weinberg]], see the flow of [[blame]] in an [[organization]] as one of the most important indicators of that organization's robustness and integrity. Blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals, indicates organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Weinberg emphasizes that blame coming from the top generates "fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and [[passive-aggressive]] responses from the bottom", with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety.&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;Gerald M. Weinberg (March 5, 2006) [http://www.ayeconference.com/beyondblaming/ ''Beyond Blaming''], AYE Conference&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kick up kiss down===
''Kick up kiss-down'' has been suggested as a viable more healthy dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Schachter (Jul. 25 2011) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/management/kicking-up-kissing-down/article616182/ Kicking up, kissing down]  The Globe and Mail&lt;/ref&gt; Blame flowing upwards in a hierarchy, Weinberg argues, proves that superiors can take [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their orders to their inferiors, and supply them with the resources required to do their jobs.&lt;ref name=Weinberg/&gt;

==In workplace bullying==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
The workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their [[abusive]] behavior hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against the bully's. They may have a ''kiss up kick down'' personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise.&lt;ref&gt;Petrecca, L. (December 27 2010) Bullying by the boss is common but hard to fix. ''USA Today'' &lt;/ref&gt; Bullies tend to [[ingratiate]] themselves to their bosses while [[intimidating]] subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;(15 Oct 2010) [http://www.aftlocal1904.org/bully_workshop.pdf How to manage a bully boss - Council of NJ State College Locals, AFT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Mary Donohue (2 Oct 2013) [http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mary-donohue/bad-managers_b_4017881.html Fighting Back Against the Tyranny of the Manager] The Huffington Post Csnada&lt;/ref&gt; The bully may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine
the bully's fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered ''kiss up kick down'' tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.&lt;ref&gt; DC Yamada (2008) Workplace bullying and ethical leadership - Journal of Values-Based Leadership, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this ''kiss up kick down'' strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a bully’s mistakes are always concealed or blamed on underlings or circumstances beyond their control
* a bully keeps the target under constant [[Occupational stress|stress]]
* a bully’s power base is fear, not respect
* a bully withholds information from subordinates and keeps the information flow top-down only
* a bully blames [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] and problems on subordinate’s lack of competence, poor attitude, and/or character flaws
* a bully creates an unnatural work environment where people constantly walk on eggshells and are compelled to behave in ways they normally would not.

'''Leonid Mykhaylovych Chernovetskyi''' ({{lang-uk|Леонід Михайлович Черновецький}}; born November 25, 1951 in [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukrainian SSR]]) is a former [[Mayor of Kiev]], the [[capital (city)|capital]] of [[Ukraine]], from 2006 until the summer of 2012.&lt;ref name=accept/&gt;&lt;ref name=nocomeback/&gt; He was a successful businessman, founder and controlling stakeholder of the Pravex Group and [[Pravex Bank]], one of the largest banks in Ukraine. Since the appointment by [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] of [[Oleksandr Popov]] as Head of Kiev City State Administration on 16 November 2010, replacing Chernovetskyi, Chernovetskyi was deprived of any real decision-making role in Kiev.&lt;ref name=limited&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/96079/ Popov: Activity of city council and city head limited], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 1, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2012electionsKyiv"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/city/detail/90367/ Party of Regions leader: 'Pre-term mayoral elections in Kyiv are pointless'], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 18, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QofEngland/&gt; He tendered his resignation on 1 June 2012.&lt;ref name=KyivMayrno/&gt;

After this resignation Chernovetsky and his family moved to the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n town [[Kobuleti]] and he has [[Georgian citizenship]]&lt;ref name=CasbG27717/&gt;&lt;ref name=CasaG27717&gt;[Georgia not to extradite ex-mayor of Kyiv Chernovetsky to Ukraine https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/georgia-not-extradite-ex-mayor-kyiv-chernovetsky-ukraine.html], [[Kyiv Post]] (26 July 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Chernovetskyi quit school when he was 14 and went to work as a [[Machinist|fitter]] at an aviation factory, but soon returned to resume his education, graduating from the Kharkiv public school #4. From 1970 until 1972, Chernovetsky served his military obligations. In 1977, he graduated from the Kharkiv Law School (Харьковский юридический институт) with specialization in [[jurisprudence]]. He worked as the senior detective in the prosecutor's office of [[Kiev Oblast]]. In 1981, he returned to Kharkiv Law School attending [[aspirantura]] and obtained his [[doctorate]] in 1984 with a dissertation about ''Methods of investigation of plunders conducted by officials''. Until 1989 he was a teacher at [[Kiev University]].

== Career ==
Soon after [[perestroika]], he went into private business, becoming one of the earliest big businesspeople in Kiev. He founded the Pravex Group ({{lang-uk|Правекс}}, an abbreviated from  "Law, Economics and Sociology"). Later the banking division of the Pravex Group rose into the [[Pravex Bank]] - one of the largest banks in Ukraine, possessing a dense network of offices in Kiev and other regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pravex.com/rus/main|title = ПРАВЭКС-БАНК — Главная страница|website = www.pravex.com|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Chernovestkyi and his bank founded the "[[Kiev Bank Union]]" banking association. Pravex Bank was sold in 2008 to Banca Intesa São Paulo for 509 million euros. Chernovetskyi has acknowledged giving millions in bribes during his days as a businessman.&lt;ref name="MARIA DANILOVA" /&gt;

In 2012, Leonid Chernovetskiy founded the Chernovetskyi Investment Group, a venture capital group based in Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chernovetsky-investment-group#/entity|title = Chernovetskyi Investment Group {{!}} CrunchBase|website = www.crunchbase.com|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Chernovetskyi Investment Group made an investment of $1 million into Busfor, a Moscow-based online tour company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://chernovetskyiinvestments.com/en/information/77-chernovetskyi-investment-group-investrovala-1-mln-v-mezhdunarodnyj-servis-po-prodazhe-avtobusnyh-biletov-busfor|title = Chernovetskyi Investment Group -|website = chernovetskyiinvestments.com|access-date = 2016-03-02|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194506/http://chernovetskyiinvestments.com/en/information/77-chernovetskyi-investment-group-investrovala-1-mln-v-mezhdunarodnyj-servis-po-prodazhe-avtobusnyh-biletov-busfor|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/fae6fa3bfbc3ea185282445e685053dc|title = Sep 9, 2015: Busfor - Funding RoundConvertible Note {{!}} CrunchBase|website = www.crunchbase.com|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2008 President [[Victor Yushchenko]] granted him the [[Order of Yaroslav the Wise]], though it was harshly opposed by Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] who urged to "stop granting decorations to corruptionists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://palm.newsru.ua/ukraine/22aug2008/orden.html| title=БЮТ рекомендує президентові забрати орден у Черновецького| date=August 22, 2008| publisher=NEWSru.ua| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821004309/http://palm.newsru.ua/ukraine/22aug2008/orden.html| archivedate=August 21, 2009| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernovestkyi is a member of the [[Embassy of God]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] founded by Nigerian immigrant [[Sunday Adelaja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/10885/| title=Tymoshenko attended Embassy of God church, says Kyiv mayor
| date=26 March 2009| newspaper=Interfax-Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a longtime [[philanthropist]] of Kiev, caring for the city's old and poor.

In January 2009 Chernovitskyi bought [[FC Arsenal Kyiv]] for 1 [[Hryvnia]] from Ukrainian businessman [[Vadim Rabinovich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/city/33683 Mayor to buy Arsenal football club], [[Kyiv Post]] (19 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.ua/ukraine/news/56652/page3.html Рабинович: "У Черновецкого внутри большая любовь к спорту"], football.ua (16 January 2009) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 he released a [[compact disc]] with "popular songs of the 1980s" sung by him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/7210/ Disc with 'heartbreaking songs' of the 1980s by Kyiv mayor to be released in a week], [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 he became the man of the year according to Korrespondent magazine.&lt;ref name="chernovetskiy"&gt;[http://chernovetskiy.com.ua/news/leonid-chernoveckiy-%E2%80%93-lichnost-goda-po-versii-zhurnala-korrespondent/] Официальный сайт Черновецкого&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2, 2013 Leonid Chernovetskiy founded Chernovetskyi Investment Group, investment potential of which exceeds 750 million dollars.&lt;ref name="chernovetskyiinvestments"&gt;[http://chernovetskyiinvestments.com/ru/about/who-we-are. Chernovetskyi Investment Group]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently Honorary President of Chernovetskyi Investment Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=26217963&amp;privcapId=223939539&amp;previousCapId=223939539&amp;previousTitle=Chernovetskyi%20Investment%20Group|title=Leonid Mykhailovych Chernovetskyi: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernovetskyi was nicknamed "Cosmos" ({{lang-uk|Космос}}) after he publicly announced that he intends to fly in outer space with his cat. However, that name got stuck with him later due to his non-ordinary administrative and political decisions and announcements that have been viewed as "bizarre".&lt;ref name=Cosmos&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/gallery/album/697/photo/2/ Cartoon], [[Kyiv Post]] (June 4, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; He has sung at rallies and offered to auction off his kisses. That behavior prompted some officials to call for a medical examination into whether he is mentally healthy to govern the city. In response, Chernovetsky posed on March 18, 2009 in tight swimming trunks in front of scores of reporters to try to show he was both physically and mentally fit.&lt;ref name="MARIA DANILOVA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.unian.net/eng/themes/11943/ Photos: Statement of Leonid Chernovetsky for press], [[UNIAN]] (March 18, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernovestkyi was the subject of several personal and political attacks when he took office as mayor of Kiev. Some were critical about his lack of experience and his authoritarianism. Others considered him off-balance or speculated that he has drug or alcohol problems. However, none of these accusations have been proven to date.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/15/world/europe/15kiev.html?ref=global-home|title=Is the Mayor Fit for Office?

Pravex Bank, one of the largest retail banks of Ukraine formerly controlled by Chernovestkyi and his family, was rumoured to submit its new employees to a polygraph test and to use coercive methods to recover impaired loans. However, the Bank came out to be one of the most profitable financial institutions in Ukraine despite strong competition from foreign-owned banks.

In 2003, Chernovestkyi made headlines for his links to the deaths of two pedestrians who had died on separate occasions after being run over at high speed by cars linked to Chernovetsky on the road leading to his mansion in the elite Koncha Zaspa residential neighborhood. Chernovetsky, who is a collector of expensive souped-up automobiles, was behind the wheel in the second incident; his wife was a passenger in the first.

* In 2009 Kharkiv publishing house "Folio", in the series “Famous Ukrainians” published a book about Leonid Chernovetskiy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://korrespondent.net/kyiv/984772-seriya-znamenitye-ukraincy-popolnilas-knigoj-o-chernoveckom Корреспондент. Серия Знаменитые украинцы пополнилась книгой о Черновецком]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017 the ex-mayor of Kiev Leonid Chernovetsky published a new book " The Crazy Story".
Presenting his autobiography Chernovetsky appealed to remembrances  and summed up his life. 
" I have lived an unusual full life! Life complete of victories and disappointments, friendship and betrayal. But the main thing I'm proud of: I  have never asked anyone for anything, I did what I thought was fair, I did not cooperate with any power or bandits, and I have achieved everything that any simple person can only dream about, especially growing up without a father and without  any material support from the side, " - he said. &lt;ref&gt; https://kp.ua/politics/572586-sumasshedshaia-ystoryia-chernovetskoho-v-tsytatakh-esly-ty-dobr-no-bedniak-znachyt-eto-dano-svyshe &lt;/ref&gt;

* On July 1, 2011 Kyiv Shevchenko district court upheld  in full the claim for the protection of honor and dignity of Kyiv Mayor Leonid Chernovetskiy to the publishing house "Economics" and journalist Fеdor Orishuk, the author of the investigation material "The Tithes of the Chernovetskiy Team", published in the newspaper "Delo" (№10) from April 8-14, 2011.
The court considered the information set out  in the article that "every tenth object in Kyiv over the past four years has been sold through "converting centers" to companies controlled by  "the young team" of Chernovetskiy Leonid Mikhailovich," is unreliable.
Commenting on the adopted decision, the plaintiff's counsel stated that the defendants could not provide an evidence base in support of their false, unsubstantiated allegations against Leonid Chernovetskiy and his team. In addition, the lawyer denied the mayor's involvement in the sale of capital objects through the converting centers. &lt;ref&gt;http://ukrreal.info/ua/suspilstvo/137693-sud-udovletvoril-isk-chernoveckogo-k-gazete-delo-iz-za-stati-o-fiktivnoj-privatizacii&lt;/ref&gt;

* On June 1, 2012 Pechersk court of Kyiv obliged Vitali Klitschko, the leader of the same-name faction in the Kyiv City Council, to refute unreliable information from his pre-election article "Vitali Klitschko: I will run for mayor of  Kyiv, And I have nothing to negotiate with Bankova".  In the article published in the newspaper and on the website of the "Mirror of the Week", Klitschko claimed that "the Mayor Chernovetskiy,  who stole $ 70 billion,  travels abroad."
According to Leonid Chernovetskiy, by the decision the court sent a clear signal to politicians that they should be responsible for their words and respect their voters, and not deceive them in the pursuit of the rating. &lt;ref&gt; http://ukrreal.info/ua/suspilstvo/137696-sud-udovletvoril-isk-eks-mera-leonida-chernoveckogo-k-biznesmenu-karlu-volohu&lt;/ref&gt;

* On July 11, 2017 Pechersk district court of Kyiv admitted unreliable and discrediting honor, dignity and business reputation of Leonid Chernovetskiy individual comments of  Karl Volokh in the article "Chernovetskiy will not buy the Georgian parliament for buckwheat" (from August 30, 2016) on the site http://politeka.net and ordered the last one  to pay the plaintiff  one thousand UAH of compensation for moral reparations.
As stated in the court's decision, the speech, in particular, is about the phrases: "... the former head of  Kyiv is the marauder number one in Ukraine" and "Georgia is interested in Chernovetskiy Leonid Mikhailovich as a person who hands out large bribes". &lt;ref&gt;http://ukrreal.info/ua/suspilstvo/137696-sud-udovletvoril-isk-eks-mera-leonida-chernoveckogo-k-biznesmenu-karlu-volohu&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2018, the information portal "Informant" published a misinformation about Leonid Mikhailovich Chernovetskiy: "In 2002, Chernovetskiy from the stage called on сongregation to sell their apartments and pass money to the pastor to finance the election campaigns of the representatives of the sect. During the proceedings it was revealed that Leonid Mikhailovich never appealed to сongregation either or anyone else to "sell apartments" and "fund election campaigns" of anyone. Between the two sides an agreement was concluded on the settlement of the defamation dispute. In pursuance of the agreement, the "Informant" refuted these inaccurate facts, posted relevant refutation and apologized to Leonid Chernovetskiy for distributing  unconfirmed and inappropriate information. &lt;ref&gt;https://informator.news/oproverzhenye-ynformatsyy-v-materyale-posolstvo-bozhe-sektanstvo-aferyi-y-polytycheskye-mahynatsyy-pastora-adeladzhy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Looker Data Sciences''' (doing business as '''Looker''') is an American [[computer software]] company headquartered in [[Santa Cruz, California]].  Looker markets a [[data exploration]] and discovery [[business intelligence]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looker.com/ |title=Looker |publisher=Looker |date= |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company was founded in Santa Cruz, California in January, 2012 by Lloyd Tabb and Ben Porterfield. The product grew out of Tabb's experience building software at companies like [[Netscape]], [[LiveOps]], and Luminate before founding Looker.

Looker makes use of a simple modeling language called LookML that lets data teams define the relationships in their database so business users can explore, save, and download data without needing to know the [[SQL]] query language.
The product was the first commercially available [[business intelligence]] platform built for and aimed at scalable or [[Massively parallel (computing)|massively parallel]] [[relational database management systems]] like [[Amazon Redshift]], Google [[BigQuery]], HP [[Vertica]], [[Netezza]], and [[Teradata]].

On August 13, 2013, Looker announced a Series A round of funding from [[Redpoint Ventures]], First Round Capital, and PivotNorth Capital, raising more than $18M.&lt;ref name="looker_series_a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pando.com/2013/08/13/looker-announces-16m-series-a-and-a-savvy-new-ceo-rise-above-stodgy-old-bi-solutions/ |title=Looker announces a $16M Series A and a savvy new CEO to rise above stodgy old BI solutions |author=Carney, Michael |date=August 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |publisher=PandoDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Series A round, Looker raised $2M in a seed round from [[First Round Capital]] and [[PivotNorth Capital]].&lt;ref name="looker_series_a"/&gt; On March 11, 2015 Looker raised $30M in series B funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/11/looker-raises-30m-to-further-its-analytics-aims/ |title= Looker Raises $30M To Further Its Analytics Aims |author= Ben Kepes |work= Forbes |date= March 11, 2015 |access-date= August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July, 2015, Jen Grant joined as chief marketing officer, and the company estimated it has 140 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Fast-growing data analytics company Looker hires former Box exec Jen Grant |author= Dylan Tweney |date= July 1, 2015 |work= Venture Beat |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 2016 Looker raised $48M in series C funding from [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers|Kleiner Perkins Claufield &amp; Byers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title =  Looker Series C Funding from Kleiner Perkins |work= Press release |publisher= Looker Data Sciences|url = http://www.looker.com/news/press/looker-secures-48-million-series-c-funding-from-kleiner-perkins |date= January 14, 2016  |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the company estimated 450 customers, including [[Jet.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Data analytics startup Looker raises $48 million, led by Kleiner Perkins |work= Venture Beat |author= Jordan Novet |date= January 14, 2016  |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30th, 2017 Looker raised $81.5M in series D funding led by Capital G. On June 21st, 2016 Looker celebrated the release of "Winning With Data," a book coauthored by Looker CEO, Frank Bien and Redpoint Partner, Tomasz Tunguz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.santacruztechbeat.com/2016/08/19/audio-tomasz-tunguz-frank-bien-discuss-winning-data-book/|title=Audio: Tomasz Tunguz &amp; Frank Bien discuss Winning with Data book|last=Isenberg|first=Sara|date=2016-08-20|website=Santa Cruz Tech Beat|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hatnote|This article is about the credit card processing software. '''MCVE''' is also an acronym for [https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve "Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example".] This is an example in debugging computer software, that makes it easier to illustrate a problem.}}

'''MCVE''' is a [[credit card]] processing [[computer software]] library and interface running under the [[Red Hat]] [[operating system]], replacing Red Hat's [[CCVS]]. It can be used from [[PHP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.php.net/mcve PHP Manual Entry on MCVE]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, [[Main Street Softworks]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainstreetsoftworks.com/ Main Street Softworks]&lt;/ref&gt; signed a contract with Red Hat to migrate the existing CCVS clientele to use MCVE. On July 2, 2003, Main Street Softworks renamed MCVE to [[Monetra]]. The following day a new version of MCVE was released carrying the new name, Monetra. Since then, they have released several new versions of Monetra and are currently in version 7.

'''Money''' is a [[personal finance]] management tool for [[macOS|Mac OS X]] by Jumsoft. The latest major release, version 3.0, was released in 2008. Money is designed for [[accounting]] and [[budget]]ing as well as for creating [[inventory]] lists and [[invoice]]s, and is primarily marketed to [[small business]] and home users. The application is also used for [[investment management]], as it offers a Portfolio feature displaying [[share (finance)|share]] information, security quote history, [[stock market index|market indices]], and the market value of a user’s share [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]. Money does not support the traditional [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry accounting]] and is based on separate cash, bank, investment, and other accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jumsoft.com/money/ Money official site], visited June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version of Money was released in 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/21766&amp;vid=125536&amp;mode=info Money 1.0 release notes on Version Tracker]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, visited June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and contained very basic tools for entering [[financial transaction]]s and performing analysis. It was designed for [[Mac OS X 10.2]] and [[Mac OS X v10.3|10.3]], and was mainly intended for the [[United States|U.S.]] market. In 2006, Money 2 [[beta version|Beta]] was launched, featuring a substantially expanded range of functions. The new version introduced budgeting, visual reports, scheduled transactions and transfers among accounts, as well as multiple [[currency|currencies]]. Less than a month after the beta version appeared, Jumsoft released a stable version 2.0. Version 3.0 was launched in 2008 and added budget and investment portfolio monitoring, inventories, and invoices to the list of features.

'''Murat Öztürk''' (1953 in Konya – 19 May 2013 in Adana) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] professional [[aerobatics]] [[pilot (aircraft)|pilot]] and former [[camera operator]].

==Early life==
Murat Öztürk was born 1953 in [[Konya]]. He worked as a news camera operator at the state-run television channel of [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] (TRT). His professional life changed in 1985 when he was sent to Samandıra Airfield, Istanbul for a news footage on [[ultralight aviation]]. Afterwards, he took to flying ultralight aircraft, and acquired both pilot and instructor licenses.&lt;ref name="h"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/23320701.asp |newspaper=Hürriyet |title=Adana'da gösteri uçağı düştü |authors=Karaçalı Fatih &amp; Çilem Anıtkan |date=2013-05-19 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviator==
With a friend, Öztürk purchased an agricultural plot on the bank of [[Lake Büyükçekmece]] to convert it into an earthen sports airfield for his flight exercises. He soon left his post as a cameraman, and, with the financial support of a businessman, built an asphalt-covered airfield with hangars that became known as [[Istanbul Hezarfen Airfield]] serving [[general aviation]].&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

He co-founded the aviation company "Top Air", one of Turkey's first private flight training schools, which educated hundreds of professional and amateur pilots. Not long ago, he completely took over Top Air. His daughter Pelin Öztürk acquired her pilot license in 2011, and is working as a pilot-instructor in her father's flight school.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

Combining his photography experience with flying, Murat Öztürk became Turkey's first ever [[aerial photography|aerial photogtapher]], and was awarded for his aerial imagery.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

==Aerobatic pilot==
In 2010, he became interested in [[aerobatics]]. In 2012, Öztürk crashed with his [[Pitts Special]] [[aerobatic]] [[biplane]] at Hezarfen Airfield. After recovering from his injuries, he returned to flying.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

Since February 2013, Öztürk used to display aerobatics with his two-seat [[Pitts Special#Variants|Pitts Special S-2B]], registration TC-AYT, which he had purchased shortly before.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt; After signing a sponsorship deal with an [[energy drink]] company in 2013, he performed his first aerobatic show above [[Maiden's Tower]] at [[Bosphorus]] on 28 April 2013.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2013/04/29/kiz-kulesinde-muhtesem-gosteri |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Kız Kulesi'nde muhteşem gösteri |author=Er, Mesut |date=2013-04-29 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then took part at an air show of the [[Turkish Stars]] and Solo Türk held on 12 May 2013 at Hezarfen Airfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.f5haber.com/star/hezarfen-den-solo-turk-ve-turk-yildizlari-gecti-haberi-3903214/ |newspaper=F5 Haber |title=Hezarfen'den Solo Türk ve Türk Yıldızları geçti |date=2013-05-12 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To join an air show at the 2nd International Air Games Festival ({{lang-tr|Uluslararası Hava Oyunları Festivali}}) in [[Adana]], he took off from Istanbul Hezarfen Airfield on 15 May 2013. After a refueling stop at Eskişehir İnönü Airfield he flew to Ankara, where he visited the [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (Turkey)|Directorate General of Civil Aviation]]. Öztürk arrived in Adana on 16 May, flying via [[Cappadocia]] in [[Nevşehir Province]]. In Adana, he performed a number of aerobatic shows over the city on 18 and 19 May in conjunction with the celebrations of the [[Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day]].&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

==Death==
He died on 19 May 2013, when his plane crashed into the ground and caught fire while performing a diving manoeuvre during the air show in Adana.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt; His body was taken to Istanbul, where he was buried at the [[Eyüp Cemetery]]. He is survived by his wife Nilgün and daughter Pelin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2013/05/21/murat-ozturk-son-yolculuguna-ugurlandi |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Murat Öztürk son yolculuğuna uğurlandı |date=2013-05-21 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year''' are a set of automotive awards announced at a news conference each January at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]].  The jury consists of no more than 60 automotive journalists from the USA and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NACTOY|url=http://northamericancaroftheyear.org/nactoy/|work=North American Car of the Year (official website)|accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a Board of Directors was created and the award became a 501 6(c) corporation. The new Board consists of: Mark Phelan, President; Matt DeLorenzo, Vice President; and [[Lauren Fix]], Secretary / Treasurer.

'''Orion Bus Industries Orion-Ikarus 286''' or commonly known as the '''Orion III''' was a [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungarian]]-built and Canada-assembled articulated bus, sold by [[Orion Bus Industries]] to the Canada market and similar to [[Crown-Ikarus 286]] in the United States.

==Production==
Shell and partial built shells were sent from [[Ikarus (Hungarian company)|Ikarus Body and Coach Works]] in [[Hungary]] and finally assembly (doors, windows and seats) at Orion Bus's plant in [[Mississauga, Ontario]] from 1985 to 1989.

==Operators==
Four transit agencies used the 286, but only 3 had them on full roster:

* [[Toronto Transit Commission]] of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] operated 90 buses from late 1987 to 2003 (retirement began in 1997-1998); some sold to [[OC Transpo]]
* [[OC Transpo]] of [[Ottawa, Ontario]] operated 189 buses from 1985 to 2003; acquired some TTC buses in the late 1990s as well as from St. Catherines (for parts)
* [[St. Catharines Transit]] Ex Orion III Demo operated one bus from the 1980s to the early 1990s and later sold to [[OC Transpo]] as a Parts bus.

[[Transit Windsor]] operated a demo vehicle only (June 1985) for tunnel service along the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]].

Herlin|his father]] as president in 1964, and started planning a new elevator factory in [[Hyvinkää]] to replace the "cramped and inefficient" Helsinki plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kone.com/en/company/history/|title=History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he died in 2003, and it was discovered that he had rewritten his will in 1999, leaving most of the elevator and escalator maker [[Kone]] to his son [[Antti Herlin]]. [[Ilkka Herlin]] and his siblings Ilona and Niklas were unhappy about not being informed, and the dispute finally ended in 2005. The Kone company was split, with Antti receiving a majority stake in its core elevator business. Ilkka and his siblings received a majority of [[Cargotec]] and a minority stake in the new Kone company. All four siblings became billionaires.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Billionaires: Ilkka Herlin|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/ilkka-herlin/|website=Forbes|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">In the [[utilities]] industry, the '''Prudent Investment Rule''' refers to a series of state standards which determine the fiscal soundness of a utility in the course of rate recovery for recoverable capital costs to be determined by that state’s [[Public Utilities Commission|Public Service Commission]] (PSC). The determination is established through a series of filings from the utility to the PSC and hearings conducted by the PSC. This occurs during a prudency hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zacher|first=Glenn|title=Prudency review required before deferred revenue can be recovered|url=http://www.stikeman.com/cps/rde/xchg/se-en/hs.xsl/14102.htm|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PSC follows these standards to determine if the capital costs were a "prudent investment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Risk: Prudency Reviews and Nuclear Projects|url=http://www.fortnightly.com/fortnightly/2006/02/managing-risk-prudence-reviews-and-nuclear-projects|publisher=Fortnightly|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the prudency of the investment, the PSC applies the prudent investment test or standard, determining if the costs were reasonable at the time they were incurred, and given the circumstances and what was known or knowable at the time, are to be included in the firm's rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|title=Electric Power: Traditional Monopoly Franchise Regulation and Rate Making|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly used as an oversight tool by the government to ensure that money invested into a project is being spent as it was intended so the utility may recoup some costs in construction through a recovery in rates, hence the title prudent investment rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions FAQs|url=http://www.psc.sc.gov/Documents/Consumer%20Information/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20PDF%20For%20Website.pdf|publisher=Public Service Commission of South Carolina|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulators can consider cases of hidden imprudence, but are required to consider what was known or knowable at the time the decision was made by the PSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|title=Electric Power: Traditional Monopoly Franchise Regulation and Rate Making|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                
The term Prudent Investment Rule, and the associated standards, have been established through a series of legal precedents.  The first case to set precedent was the [[United States Supreme Court]] case of [[Munn v. Illinois]] in 1877, which allowed states to have a say in rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munn v. Illinois|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/94/113|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the nature of recoverable capital costs was defined, a second question remained as to the rate at which that capital could be recovered.  This issue was reasonably addressed in 1935 in Bluefield Water Works &amp; Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, when the court said that a public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bluefield Waterworks Improvement Company v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bluefield_Waterworks_Improvement_Company_v._Public_Service_Commission_of_West_Virginia|publisher=WikiSource|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of Rate of Return Regulation with Prudent Investment Rule==
[[Rate-of-return regulation|Rate-of-return Regulation]] is a system for setting the prices charged by government-regulated monopolies, such as utility companies. There are several advantages to using [[rate-of-return regulation]]. The first is that it is sustainable if there is no competition because prices can be adjusted to the company’s changing conditions. It can also provide comfort to investors because [[rate-of-return regulation]] constrains the regulator’s discretion in setting prices. This lowers investor risk, which lowers the cost of capital. Company profits can be kept within acceptable levels from the perspectives of both investors and customers. Unless the regulator chronically underestimates the cost of capital (and courts do not reverse the regulator in this regard), investors can be confident they have a fair opportunity to receive the profits they expect and thus are willing to make investments. Customers can observe that the regulator is limiting company profits to the cost of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rate of Return: Regulation|year=1996|publisher=Mark A. Jamison Public Utility Research Center, University of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disallowance==
According to [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], there are five categories that plants under construction may fall into that keep them from being included in the rate base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prudence Issues Affecting the U.S. Electric Utility Industry|url=http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1987/3445602684959.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Imprudence: When a utility fails to show that it made prudent decisions in [[Public utilities commission|Public Service Commission]] hearings, then the facility being reviewed is [[disallow]]ed from the rate base.
# [[Excess Capacity]]: Regardless of prudence, a plant recently constructed may not be included in the rate base if it is ruled to have a generating capacity that is in excess of what is needed by the ratepayers. Each jurisdiction will calculate excess capacity differently. This is not a permanent disallowance and if the need of the customer or ratepayer grows then the plant can again be included in the rate base. 
# Cost Caps: In rare cases the [[Public Utilities Commission]] will set a cap on construction costs for a new facility. If the plant is completed at a higher cost, then this excess cost may not be allowed in the rate base.
# Economic Value: The actual economic value of the recently constructed plant may be found to be less than the construction costs. A plant under construction should be regularly evaluated to ensure that continued construction is in the best interest of the ratepayer.
# Other: This category includes any other reason that a facility may be disallowed from the rate base. This includes canceled construction. If a plant is canceled then it is not “used and useful” and may be completely disallowed from the rate base or allowed to recover prudent costs with no return recovery on the balance or allowed to recover prudent costs with a recovery of the debt return from the unrecovered balance.

'''Sir John Traill Cargill, 1st Baronet''', [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]], [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (10 January 1867 – 24 January 1954) was a Scottish oil magnate.

Cargill was born in [[Glasgow]], the second son of [[David Sime Cargill]], founder of the [[Burmah Oil Company]], and his first wife Margaret (née Traill), who died when he was five.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] from 1878 to 1883, and in 1890 went to [[Burma]] to work in the [[Rangoon]] office of his father's company, returning to Glasgow three years later. In 1904, he succeeded his father as chairman of the company, remaining in the post until 1943. He was also chairman of [[Scottish Oils Ltd]] from 1922 to 1943. He largely served as figurehead of these companies, leaving the real running of them to their [[managing director]]s.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;Biography, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a director of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] and the [[Assam Oil Company]].&lt;ref name="ww"&gt;Biography, ''[[Who Was Who]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cargill was created a [[baronet]], of [[Glasgow]], in the [[1920 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |page=2 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31830 |date=10 March 1920 |page=3432}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Glasgow and a member of the court of the [[University of Glasgow]], which awarded him an honorary [[Doctorate of Laws]] (LLD) in 1929.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

In 1895, he married Mary Hope Walker Grierson, sister of [[James Moncrieff Grierson|Lieutenant-General Sir James Moncrieff Grierson]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; They had a daughter, Allison Hope Cargill (born 13 August 1896), but no sons, and the baronetcy became extinct upon Cargill's death. His wife died in 1929 and in 1943 he retired to a nursing home in [[Edinburgh]], where he died. He was buried in [[Hillfoot Cemetery]] in Glasgow. He left large benefactions to the University of Glasgow and the [[University of Rangoon]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10202">{{About||the full right and power of a governing body over itself|Sovereignty|the head of state in a monarchy|Monarch|other uses}}
The word '''Sovereign''' is borrowed from [[Old French]] ''soverain'', which is ultimately derived from the [[Latin]] word ''superānus'', meaning "above". It is a title which can be given to people in various categories.

The roles of a sovereign vary from [[Monarch]] or [[Head of state]] to head of municipal government or head of a chivalric order. As a result, the word sovereign has more recently also come to mean independence or autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sovereign|title=Definition of sovereign in English:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Head of State==
The word ''Sovereign'' is frequently used synonymously with [[Monarch]]. There are [[Royal and noble ranks#Sovereign|numerous titles]] in a monarchical rule which can belong to the sovereign. The sovereign is the autonomous head of the state. Examples of the various titles in modern sovereign leaders are:

{|class="wikitable" 
|-
| Emperor|| [[Akihito]], Emperor of Japan|| Sultan || [[Hassanal Bolkiah]], Sultan of Brunei
|-
| King || [[Philippe of Belgium]]|| Pope || [[Pope Francis]], sovereign of the Vatican City State
|-
| Grand Duke || [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]||||
|-
| Prince|| [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]]|| Co-Prince|| [[Joan Enric Vives Sicília]], [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince of Andorra]]
|}

==Chivalric Orders==
The term ''Sovereign'' is generally used in place of "Grand Master" for the supreme head of various orders [[Europe]]an nations. In the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], the Grand Master is styled "Sovereign", e.g. Sovereign Grand Master, due to its status as an internationally independent sovereign entity. Examples of the Sovereign of a chivalric order are: 
* [[Philip the Good]], founder of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]
* [[Karl von Habsburg]], current Sovereign of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]
* [[Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia]], current Sovereign of the [[Order of Louise]]
* [[Caroline of Baden]], Sovereign of the [[Order of Saint Elizabeth]]
* [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza]], Sovereign of the [[Order of Saint Isabel]]

==Municipal Government==
As chief officer of municipal government, ''the Sovereign'' had duties and responsibilities deriving from the charter which established the local town borough or council. This was commonly used throughout [[Ireland]]. This usage was less common in the [[United Kingdom]] and occasionally meant a [[Marcher Lord]].

===Characteristics===
The candidate for this position was elected by the freemen and burgesses of the town, borough and city councils and had to be a [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]] himself. And in later years he also had to be approved by the patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extracts from the Old Corporation Books of New Ross|jstor=25507115|publisher=The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland|date= 31 March 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="First report"&gt;{{cite book|title=FIRST REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED TO INQUIRE INTO THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS IN IRELAND|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9VbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA917|year=1835|pages=917–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of responsibility ranged from enacting by-laws about tolls up to the death penalty. Some charters established the sovereign as the local [[magistrate]] or [[Justice of the peace]]. The office generally had no salary though some patrons provided a stipend to the Sovereign in their borough.&lt;ref name="First report"/&gt; In some localities the sovereign was appointed directly by the patron of the borough which allowed him to influence the election of the local MP. Once the parliamentary franchise was lost with the [[Acts of Union 1800]], the role became largely ceremonial or forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland: Adapted to the New Poor-law, Franchise, Municipal and Ecclesiastical Arrangements, and Compiled with a Special Reference to the Lines of Railroad and Canal Communication, as Existing in 1814-45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9rblf03SdkYC&amp;pg=PA299|year=1846|publisher=A. Fullarton and Company|pages=299–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britain1840"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain|title=The Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA650|year=1840|publisher=Her Majesty's Printers|pages=650–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the chief officer of a city council has become known as a [[Mayor]]. In some municipal boroughs the titles Borough Master or [[Burgomaster]], [[Bailiff]], [[Portreeve]], [[wikt:warden|Warden]] and [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] were used interchangeably with mayor and sovereign.&lt;ref name="Britain1840"/&gt;

===History===
Ireland had established self-governing municipal boroughs which gave a city-state status to the locality in existence since the Norman conquest. These were most typically in the denser populated provinces of [[Munster]] and [[Leinster]]. The provision of the borough and the corporation was established through a charter, the granting of which was known as incorporation. Freemen and burgesses were the usual governing members of the council and elected their chief officer, the Sovereign. In earlier incarnations the council also managed the law court known as the "hundred court" and dealt with local administrative and legal business. Boroughs also elected the local MP. Positions on the council were predominantly from among the wealthy and related families in the area.&lt;ref name="borough"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/volume-21/irish-municipal-boroughs/|title=Irish Municipal boroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the Sovereign in [[Kilkenny]] dates from 1231. The ''Liber Primus Kilkenniensis'' is a contemporaneously written account of the proceedings of Kilkenny municipality beginning in 1230 and running to 1538.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25513427|title = Notes on the Liber Primus Kilkenniensis|journal = The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 21–38|last1 = McNeill|first1 = Charles|year = 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to identify the names of Kilkenny's sovereigns and currently there is a list of the names of 244 sovereigns from 1282 to 1608. At that point a new charter was established for the town and in 1609 the first Mayor of the City of Kilkenny is elected.&lt;ref name="Kilkenny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kilkennycity.ie/eng/Your_Council/The_Sovereigns_and_Mayors_of_Kilkenny_1282-2003/|title=The sovereigns and Mayors of Kilkenny}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weakening power===
Early Irish borough had a city-state status however with the unification of Ireland under the crown in 1603 they were transformed into more ordinary municipal towns on the English model. Part of this was to reduce the autonomy of the Irish borough and partly to establish the new rules by which the planted towns of Ireland were to operate. Since the MPs to the Irish parliament were elected by the borough council, and to prevent a Catholic majority there, additional boroughs were created in areas with a strong Protestant base. A direct result of this was the Protestant majority of 232 to 100 in the 1613 House of Commons. The new charters placed the government of the borough with the Sovereign and twelve chief burgesses, who are to elect all the rest and stipulated that all had to conform to the established church by taking the Oath of Supremacy.&lt;ref name="gerrymander"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/the-greatest-gerrymander-in-irish-history-james-is-40-boroughs-of-1612-13/|title=New Boroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Lewis|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland: Comprising the Several Counties, Cities, Boroughs, Corporate, Market, and Post Towns, Parishes, and Villages, with Historical and Statistical Descriptions ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oh_xz5nqbyQC&amp;pg=PA461|year=1995|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=978-0-8063-1063-3|pages=461–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MerewetherStephens1835"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Alworth Merewether|author2=Archibald John Stephens|title=The history of the Boroughs and municipal Corporations of the United Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae89AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1620|year=1835|publisher=Stevens, Yard|pages=1620–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir John Davies]], [[Attorney General for Ireland]] wrote "the newly erected boroughs . . . will be perpetual seminaries of Protestant burgesses".&lt;ref name="gerrymander"/&gt;

Historically the number of boroughs varied considerably. There were 117 boroughs in Ireland from 1685 to 1800. Prior to the passing of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], there were sixty-eight borough corporations in Ireland.&lt;ref name="gerrymander"/&gt; As each of the changes and new charters were brought in and with the loss of the parliamentary franchise, sovereigns became less powerful and more ceremonial.

===Legacy===
There is a sailing race held in [[Kinsale]] which references back to the chief officer of the town council. When looking to name a new trophy the local yacht club discovered that the ‘Sovereign of Kinsale’ used to put up a trophy for a sailing race in the late 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/ireland/irish-examiner-supplement/20170610|title= Sovereign's cup 2017|newspaper=Irish Examiner Supplement|date= 10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that the race and trophy today is known as The Sovereign's cup.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sovereignscup.com/sovereigns-cup-kinsale/Event-Info&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsale had been given its charter to set up a borough led by a Sovereign around 1319.&lt;ref name="Lewis1995"/&gt;

'''''Steve Jobs''''' is a 2015 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama (film and television)|drama]] film directed by [[Danny Boyle]] and written by [[Aaron Sorkin]]. Adapted from the [[Steve Jobs (book)|2011 book of the same name]] by [[Walter Isaacson]] as well as interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film is structured into three acts which cover 14 years (1984–1998) in the life of [[microcomputer revolution|personal computing]] [[innovator]] and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]], with each act taking place immediately prior to the launch of a key product – the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh]], the [[NeXT Computer]] and the [[iMac G3|iMac]]. Jobs is portrayed by [[Michael Fassbender]], with [[Kate Winslet]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], and [[Jeff Daniels]] in supporting roles.

Development on the project began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Sorkin wrote the screenplay and filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor [[Elliot Graham]] noting that he was working on existing footage while the film was still shooting. [[Daniel Pemberton]] served as the film's composer, with a focus dedicated to dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.

''Steve Jobs'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival|2015 Telluride Film Festival]] on September 5, 2015, and began a [[limited release]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015, to critical acclaim. Individuals close to Jobs such as [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[John Sculley]] would praise the film's performances, but the film also received criticisms for its inaccuracy in some of its scenes. Winslet won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]] at the [[73rd Golden Globes]], while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively, at the [[88th Academy Awards]].

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. --&gt;In 1984, the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh 128K]]'s voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at [[De Anza College|Flint Center]]. [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] demands engineer [[Andy Hertzfeld]] fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype [[Macintosh 512K]] computer.

Jobs rants to marketing executive [[Joanna Hoffman]] about a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] – he denies he is the father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her [[MacPaint]] art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] asks Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.

By 1988, following the apparent failure of the Macintosh, Jobs has founded a new company, [[NeXT]]. Before the [[NeXT Computer]] launch at the [[War Memorial Opera House]], he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa, but his relationship with Brennan is still strained – he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor, who directs "musicians" like Wozniak.

Apple CEO [[John Sculley]] demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.

By 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the [[iMac G3|iMac]] at [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall|Davies Symphony Hall]]. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition – Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.

Sculley arrives in secret and the two make amends. Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs' life as an adopted child, and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up. At the behest of Hoffman, Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father, admitting that he is "poorly made". Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the iMac.

In regards to how he aimed to depict Jobs, Fassbender stated he aimed to depict Jobs as a "somebody who was passionate about his vision" as opposed to a cruel person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/12/michael-fassbender-steve-jobs-interview/73601092/ |first=Bryan |last=Alexander |title=Michael Fassbender portrays 'poorly made' Steve Jobs |date=October 12, 2015 |work=USA TODAY |accessdate=August 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111020933/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/12/michael-fassbender-steve-jobs-interview/73601092/ |archive-date=January 11, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kate Winslet]] as [[Joanna Hoffman]]:
:Apple and [[NeXT]] marketing executive and Jobs' confidant in the film.&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt; When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she "heard about it through a crew member who I happened to be working with [in Australia on ''[[The Dressmaker (2015 film)|The Dressmaker]]''], I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [Hoffman]. Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [producer] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part."&lt;ref name="Labrecque" /&gt; Winslet spent considerable time with [[Joanna Hoffman]] to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues."&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |title=How Kate Winslet Won a Role in Steve Jobs and Managed All That Sorkin Dialogue |accessdate=August 26, 2016 |last=Kachka |first=Boris |date=August 26, 2015 |work=Vulture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618180609/http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |archive-date=June 18, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs.&lt;ref name="dbprem" /&gt; {{paragraph break}} On the nature of the relationship between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she "just wanted to please [Hoffman] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake."&lt;ref name=hoffman/&gt; Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman "did genuinely love [Jobs]. And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly."&lt;ref name="dbprem"/&gt;
* [[Seth Rogen]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]:
:Co-founder of Apple and creator of the [[Apple II]].&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt; Rogen admitted to not being familiar with Wozniak, let alone knowing he was co-founder of Apple. He met with Wozniak to prepare for the film, specifically picking up his tendency to move his hands around while speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.gq.com/story/steve-jobs-seth-rogen-qa |first=Lauren |last=Larson |title=Seth Rogen on Steve Jobs and Why He Has Mixed Feelings About Biopics |date=October 16, 2015 |work=GQ |accessdate=March 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsteve-jobs-seth-rogen-qa&amp;date=2017-03-29 |archive-date=March 29, 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCwozint"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31463351 |title=Woz on watches, addiction and being played by Seth Rogen |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |last=Lobel |first=Mark |date=February 15, 2015 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-31463351&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to Wozniak's relationship with Jobs, Rogen stated that "his feelings towards Jobs were very complex and interesting. Part of it was taking it at face value and part was reading between the lines."&lt;ref name="dbprem" /&gt; Wozniak stated that he felt honored to be portrayed by Rogen in the film.&lt;ref name="anyway" /&gt;

To distinguish each of the three product launches depicted in the movie, Danny Boyle and cinematographer [[Alwin H. Küchler|Alwin Küchler]] implemented three different film formats: [[16mm film|16mm]] for 1984, [[35 mm film|35mm]] for 1988, and [[Digital cinematography|digital]] for 1998. They also wanted each of the film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, Küchler explains that the filming at [[De Anza College|Flint Center, De Anza college]] for the first act combined the graininess of 16&amp;nbsp;mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look – much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an [[Arri Alexa]] at the [[Davies Symphony Hall]], incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the [[iMac]] and subsequent [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hardware. Küchler describes his experience filming ''Steve Jobs'' as "brilliant and challenging at the same time", and that the goal was to "make sure that the visuals kept up with the words", in reference to the production's collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin.&lt;ref name="boylewired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/steve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview/ |title=Why Danny Boyle Filmed Steve Jobs in Three Different Formats |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fsteve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuchlerthalo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thalo.com/articles/view/1143/steve_jobs_dp_alwin_h_kchler_shoots_in_three_acts |title=Steve Jobs DP Alwin H.

Costume designer [[Suttirat Anne Larlarb]] says the real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper at any of the launches: "The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it. As we got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design."&lt;ref name="filmdoctor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmdoctor.co.uk/2015/12/01/steve-jobs-costume-designer-suttirat-larlarb-in-conversation|title=''Steve Jobs'' costume designer in conversation|website=filmdoctor.co.uk|date=December 1, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffilmdoctor.co.uk%2F2015%2F12%2F01%2Fsteve-jobs-costume-designer-suttirat-larlarb-in-conversation&amp;date=2016-09-03|archive-date=September 3, 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire "felt like I had arrived at [Steve Jobs'] vision, that the person had arrived." Fassbender later added that he and [[Danny Boyle]] decided on this look during filming, and wanted to "give the audience kind of a payoff."&lt;ref name="fassbenderhuman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/05/how-michael-fassbender-made-steve-jobs-human.html |title=How Michael Fassbender Made Steve Jobs Human |first=Kevin |last=Fallon |work=[[Daily Beast]] |date=January 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Farticles%2F2016%2F01%2F05%2Fhow-michael-fassbender-made-steve-jobs-human.html&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fassbenderpayoff"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/awards/michael-fassbender-portraying-steve-jobs-1201701595/ |title=Michael Fassbender on Finding the Essence of ''Steve Jobs''|first=Jenelle |last=Riley |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2016%2Ffilm%2Fawards%2Fmichael-fassbender-portraying-steve-jobs-1201701595%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the one-week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts (shot in chronological order), Graham would work on the existing footage and receive ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the [[Shot (filmmaking)#Film editing|shot frequency]] and providing enough "visual interventions" to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as "a series of fight sequences". Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle would then choose from during [[post-production]].&lt;ref name="boylecrave"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/912765-interview-danny-boyle-politics-steve-jobs |title=Interview Danny Boyle on the Politics of ''Steve Jobs''|last=Bibbiani |first=William |work=[[CraveOnline]] |date=October 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.craveonline.com%2Fculture%2F912765-interview-danny-boyle-politics-steve-jobs&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=2016-09-02 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grahamguild"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.editorsguild.com/FromTheGuild.cfm?FromTheGuildid=535 |title=From the Guild: Getting to the Core of Apple |last=Feld |first=Rob |publisher=[[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] |date=November 4, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.editorsguild.com%2FFromTheGuild.cfm%3FFromTheGuildid%3D535&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=2016-09-02 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/video/steve-jobs-editing-aaron-sorkin/ |title=Steve Jobs Editor on the Rush of Working With Aaron Sorkin Dialogue |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2Fvideo%2Fsteve-jobs-editing-aaron-sorkin%2F&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=2016-09-02 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham also said: "Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away.

[[Daniel Pemberton]] composed the music for the film. Much like the film's visual approach, the score is divided into three distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. "You have the first act which is analog," Pemberton explains, "you have the second act which is orchestral, and you have the third act which is digital." For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 – the time the first act takes place – such as the [[Roland SH-1000]] and [[Yamaha CS-80]]. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the [[War Memorial Opera House|San Francisco Opera House]]. Finally, the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac product launch, and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section.&lt;ref name="pembertonpop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/a-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-/ |title=Breaking Down the 'Steve Jobs' Score with Composer Daniel Pemberton |first=Cory |last=Woodroof |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popmatters.com%2Ffeature%2Fa-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-%2F+&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pembertonvariety"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/movie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653/ |title=Movie Maestros Mix Organic and Synthetic Sounds |first=Joe |last=Burlingame |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 3, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2015%2Ffilm%2Fnews%2Fmovie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pembertonclash"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/daniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs |title=Daniel Pemberton: Scoring Steve Jobs |first=Paul |last=Weedon |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clashmusic.com%2Ffeatures%2Fdaniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadlinepemberton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/12/steve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583/ |title='Steve Jobs' Composer Daniel Pemberton Blended Nostalgia And Futurism |first=Anthony |last=D'Alessandro |work=[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]] |date=December 5, 2015 |accessdate=December 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2015%2F12%2Fsteve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack also features songs by [[The Libertines]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Maccabees (band)|The Maccabees]]. The Maccabees' "Grew Up At Midnight", the song that played during the film's concluding scene, was reportedly chosen by [[Danny Boyle]] himself, who is a fan of the band.

[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said Boyle's "electric" direction "temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study" and praised Fassbender in the role, who "doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [yet] he fully delivers the essentials of how we have come to perceive the man."&lt;ref name=hrrev&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/steve-jobs/review/820561 |title='Steve Jobs': Telluride Review |accessdate=September 6, 2015 |date=September 6, 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fmovie%2Fsteve-jobs%2Freview%2F820561&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=2016-09-03 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' extolled the film as "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie."&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news |title=Telluride Film Review: ''Steve Jobs''|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/steve-jobs-review-michael-fassbender-telluride-film-festival-1201586996/ |last=Chang |first=Justin |date=September 6, 2015 |accessdate=September 6, 2015 |work=Variety |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2015%2Ffilm%2Ffestivals%2Fsteve-jobs-review-michael-fassbender-telluride-film-festival-1201586996%2F&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sasha Stone]], writing for ''[[TheWrap]]'', stated that Fassbender gives "a stunning knockout" performance as Jobs in a film that is "a kind of talk opera", which to some might seem to be "Sorkin overkill but the same could be said for the best of them: [[David Mamet]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Paddy Chayefsky]] and even [[William Shakespeare]].

He also noted that Boyle "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece."&lt;ref name=iw&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/telluride-review-danny-boyles-steve-jobs-is-like-its-subject-flawed-but-fascinating-20150906|title=Telluride Review: Danny Boyle's ''Steve Jobs'' is Like Its Subject — Flawed But Fascinating|accessdate=September 6, 2015|date=September 6, 2015|work=[[IndieWire]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiewire.com%2Farticle%2Ftelluride-review-danny-boyles-steve-jobs-is-like-its-subject-flawed-but-fascinating-20150906&amp;date=2016-09-04|archive-date=2016-09-04|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Lee of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, writing that "despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is, it's disappointingly difficult to truly care about what's taking place." He blames Sorkin's "dominating" script, arguing that "the dialogue stifles" and that "the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own." He also feels that while it is "Boyle's best film for years," his direction "plays second fiddle" to a script that verges on a kind of "Apple-sponsored hero iWorship."&lt;ref name=guarrev&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Benjamin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/06/steve-jobs-movie-review-michael-fassbender-telluride |title=Steve Jobs review: Fassbender excels but iWorship required if you're to care |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |date=September 6, 2015 |work=The Guardian |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2015%2Fsep%2F06%2Fsteve-jobs-movie-review-michael-fassbender-telluride&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Nocera]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who knew Jobs well, took issue with "how little the film has to do with the flesh and blood Steve Jobs." Characterizing the movie as pure "fiction", he went on to say, "In ways both large and small, Sorkin − as well as Michael Fassbender, the actor who plays Jobs − has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense."&lt;ref name=Nocera&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nocera|first1=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nocera|title=Aaron Sorkin's ''Steve Jobs'' Con|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/opinion/aaron-sorkins-steve-jobs-con.html|accessdate=October 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=October 13, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2015%2F10%2F13%2Fopinion%2Faaron-sorkins-steve-jobs-con.html&amp;date=2016-09-04|archive-date=2016-09-04|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical accuracy ===
[[Danny Boyle]], the film's director, speaking on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, "[it] was what [[Shakespeare]] used to do. He would take some of the facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made some of the most beautiful things in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/danny-boyle-steve-jobs-interview/2/ |title=Interview: Director Danny Boyle Talks About The Making Of ''Steve Jobs''|last=Sciretta |first=Peter |work=[[/Film]] |date=October 15, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slashfilm.com%2Fdanny-boyle-steve-jobs-interview%2F2%2F&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie."&lt;ref name="wozniaksfchron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Woz-talks-Steve-Jobs-geek-culture-and-6824747.php |title='Woz' talks Steve Jobs, geek culture and Silicon Valley Comic Con |first=Benny |last=Evangelista |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 10, 2016 |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfchronicle.com%2Fbusiness%2Farticle%2FWoz-talks-Steve-Jobs-geek-culture-and-6824747.php&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Catmull]], president of [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], felt that Jobs would "be appalled" at his depiction in the film, arguing that he was a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture. In an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Catmull commented, "When [Jobs] left Apple, he then entered into what really is the classic [[hero's journey]]: He's wandering in the wilderness, he's working with NeXT, it's not working. He's working with Pixar, we're failing. In that process, Steve learned some major lessons, and he changed. He became an empathetic person, [...] that aspect of the change of Steve was missed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-pixars-ed-catmull-good-840292 |title=Disney-Pixar's Ed Catmull on 'Good Dinosaur,' Female Directors and Why Steve Jobs Would Be "Appalled" by 'Steve Jobs' |date=November 20, 2015 |last=Belloni |first=Matthew |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=November 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fdisney-pixars-ed-catmull-good-840292&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Bloomberg West]]'' interview with [[Emily Chang (journalist)|Emily Chang]] on August 26, 2015, [[Andrea Cunningham|Andy Cunningham]] called it "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character study of a really complex man. Aaron [Sorkin] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it."

Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person."&lt;ref name=mossberg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9578921/steve-jobs-movie-review-walt-mossberg |title=Mossberg: The Steve Jobs I knew isn't in this movie |accessdate=October 22, 2015 |last=Mossberg |first=Walt |date=October 21, 2015 |work=[[The Verge]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F10%2F21%2F9578921%2Fsteve-jobs-movie-review-walt-mossberg&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=2016-09-04 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Functions of the Executive''''' is a book by [[Chester I.

==Background==

Barnard attended [[Harvard University]] between 1906 and 1909 where he majored in economics; however, he did not obtain a degree.&lt;ref name= Wolf1974&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Wolf | first1 = William B. | title = The Basic Barnard: an Introduction to Chester I.

In 1936, Barnard gave a lecture at [[Princeton University]] entitled "Mind in Everyday Affairs."&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|19,92}} In the lecture, Barnard described the differences between "logical" and "non-logical" (i.e., "intuitional") mental processes.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|302}} He encouraged the use of non-logical processes "for many conditions and purposes."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|321}}

Barnard had many contacts with Harvard officials, for example in relation to fundraising activities.&lt;ref name=WrenGreenwood1998&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Wren | first1 = Daniel A. | last2 = Greenwood | first2 = Ronald G. | title = Management Innovators: the People and Ideas That Have Shaped Modern Business | year = 1998 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 0195117050 | chapter = Chapter 8: Organizers | pages=155–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}} He and [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]] were friends, and Henderson was a friend of [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], who had been president of Harvard and founder of the [[Lowell Institute]].&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|16–18}} Henderson suggested that Lowell invite Barnard to lecture at the Institute, and having read "Mind in Everyday Affairs" and another lecture by Barnard, Lowell did so.&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|18–21}} Barnard gave eight extemporaneous talks at the Lowell Institute in 1937 on the topic of "functions of the executive," and on the invitation of [[Dumas Malone]] (the director of [[Harvard University Press]] who met Barnard through [[Arthur W. Page]]), he revised the material from the talks to create the book.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|vii}}&lt;ref name=Wolf1973/&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

Barnard's philosophy and thought processes in writing the book were characterized by [[humanism]], [[empiricism]], [[speculative philosophy]] (the interpretation of experience in a coherent framework), and analysis of the dichotomy of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|46–59}} As cited in the book, his intellectual influences included [[Arthur F. Bentley]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], Lawrence Joseph Henderson, [[Talcott Parsons]], [[W. H. R. Rivers]], [[Frederic Bartlett]], [[Elton Mayo]], [[Fritz Roethlisberger]], [[Mary Parker Follett]], [[James Harbord]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and [[John R. Commons]].&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|47,51,68,90,121,122,164,195,202}} His approach diverged from the "mechanistic conceptions" of Frederick Winslow Taylor and [[Henri Fayol]].&lt;ref name=Gabor2000/&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Summary==

===Introduction to the Thirtieth Anniversary Edition===
In the 1968 edition, the Introduction by [[Kenneth R. Andrews]] evaluates the book and summarizes its place in the management literature. Andrews concludes that it is "the most thought-provoking book on organization and management ever written by a practicing executive."&lt;ref name=Barnard1968/&gt;{{rp|xxi}} He contrasts ''Functions of the Executive'' with the "classical" approaches to organizations found in books such as ''Principles of Management'' by [[Harold Koontz]] and [[Cyril J. O'Donnell]].&lt;ref name=Barnard1968/&gt;{{rp|xiv,xxii}}

===Preface===
Barnard gives an overview of his arguments in his Preface:&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|xi-xii}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Formally this work is divided into four parts, but in a sense it consists of two short treatises. One is an exposition of a theory of cooperation and organization and constitutes the first half of the book. The second is a study of the functions and of the methods of operation of executives in formal organizations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Part I===
Part I is "Preliminary Considerations Concerning Cooperative Systems."

In '''Chapter I''', "Introduction" (pages 3–7), Barnard notes that "formal organization is that kind of cooperation among men that is conscious, deliberate, purposeful," and that "successful cooperation in or by formal organizations is the abnormal, not the normal, condition."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;ref name=Keon1986&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keon|first1=Thomas L.|title=The Functions of the Executive by Chester I. Barnard |journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=11|issue=2|year=1986|pages=456–459|doi=10.2307/258476}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|457}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = Joseph T. | title = Economic Foundations of Strategy | year = 2005 | publisher = SAGE | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | isbn = 1-4129-0543-5 | chapter = Chapter 1: Behavioral Theory of the Firm | pages = 1–53 | url = http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/5029_Mahoney_Chapter_1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  An individual may belong to many formal organizations, some of which may be short-lived.

'''Chapter II''', "The Individual and Organization" (pages 8–15), states that individuals can be characterized in many ways (e.g., physical, social, psychological), but that for the purposes of discussion the book is concerned with the functional relationships among individuals in organizations. Barnard distinguishes between "effective" and "efficient" actions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When a specific desired end is attained we shall say that the action is "effective." When the unsought consequences of the action are more important than the attainment of the desired end and are dissatisfactory, effective action, we shall say, is "inefficient." When the unsought consequences are unimportant or trivial, the action is "efficient."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref name= Callender2009&gt;{{cite book | last = Callender | first = Guy | title = Efficiency and Management | publisher = Routledge | location = London and New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780415431804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The remaining chapters in Part I elaborate on the relationships among people in a "cooperative system":
* '''Chapter III''': "Physical and Biological Limitations in Cooperative Systems" (pages 22–37)
* '''Chapter IV''': "Psychological and Social Factors in Systems of Cooperation" (pages 38–45)
* '''Chapter V''': "The Principles of Cooperative Action" (pages 46–61)

===Part II===
The book's second part concerns "The Theory and Structure of Formal Organizations."

Pages 65–81 contain '''Chapter VI''', "The Definition of Formal Organization." In the chapter, Barnard defines "formal organization" twice as "a system of consciously coordinated activities or forces of two or more persons."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|73,81}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Copeland |first1= M. T. |title= The Job of an Executive |journal= Harvard Business Review |volume=18|date=Winter 1940|pages=159–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149}}  The chapter outlines how Barnard developed the definition and explains that the concept of organization is abstract.  It specifies that a formal organization is part of a "cooperative system," a "complex of physical, biological, personal, and social components which are in a specific systematic relationship by reason of the cooperation of two or more persons for at least one definite end."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|65}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|149}}

'''Chapter VII''', "The Theory of Formal Organization" on pages 82–95, sets forth the three elements necessary for organizations: "(1) communication; (2) willingness to serve; and (3) common purpose."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|82}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Scott |first1= William G. |last2= Mitchell |first2= Terence R. |date= Spring 1987|title= The Universal Barnard: His Macro Theories of Organization|journal= Public Administration Quarterly|volume=11 |issue=1 |pages= 34–58|jstor=40861334}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}} Barnard suggests both: (1) that an organization that cannot accomplish its purpose cannot survive, and (2) that an organization that accomplishes its purpose has no reason for existence. Therefore, organizations are constantly adopting new purposes.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|91}}

'''Chapter VIII''', "The Structure of Complex Formal Organizations" (pages 96–113), concerns the relationship of "superior" to "subordinate" organizations, the growth of organizations, and the relationship of small working "unit organizations" to "executive organizations" within complex formal organizations.

In '''Chapter IX''', "Informal Organizations and Their Relation to Formal Organizations" (pages 114-123), Barnard states that formal organizations coexist with informal organizations (groups of people who interact with each other outside a formal organizational structure).&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|151}}  Benefits of informal organizations include the promotion of communication, cohesiveness, and self-respect.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|122}}

===Part III===
Part III is titled "The Elements of Formal Organizations" and begins with '''Chapter X''' (pages 127-138) about "The Bases and Kinds of Specializations."

"The Economy of Incentives" is '''Chapter XI''' (pages 139-160). According to Barnard, "in all sorts of organizations the affording of adequate incentives becomes the most definitely emphasized task in their existence"&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|139}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|151}}  Specific inducements range from "material inducements" to "ideal benefactions" (e.g., "[[pride of workmanship]]"), while "general incentives" include "personal comfort in social relations."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|142–149}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005/&gt;{{rp|4}} Barnard's conclusions on incentives were drawn "almost entirely from observations… not from any reading."&lt;ref name=Wolf1973/&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

'''Chapter XII''', "The Theory of Authority" (pages 161-184) is notable for its summary of the conditions for authoritative communications, its explanation of "zone of indifference," and its distinction between "authority of position" and "authority of leadership."
*Concerning authoritative communications, Barnard wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A person can and will accept a communication as authoritative only when four conditions simultaneously obtain: (a) he can and does understand the communication; (b) ''at the time of his decision'' he believes that it is not inconsistent with the purpose of the organization; (c) ''at the time of his decision'', he believes it to be compatible with his personal interest as a whole; and (d) he is able mentally and physically to comply with it.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|165}}&lt;ref name=WrenGreenwood1998/&gt;{{rp|167–168}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*Barnard discusses the concept of "zone of indifference," which is "perhaps the most well-known idea in the book," as follows:&lt;ref name=Mahoney2005/&gt;{{rp|5}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;...there exists a "zone of indifference" in each individual within which orders are acceptable without conscious questioning of their authority… The zone of indifference will be wider or narrower depending upon the degree to which the inducements exceed the burdens and sacrifices which determine the individual's adhesion to the organization. It follows that the range of orders that will be accepted will be very limited among those who are barely induced to contribute to the system.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|167–169}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*"Authority of position" is explained as occurring when people "impute authority to communications from superior positions… to a considerable extent independent of the personal ability of the incumbent of the position." In contrast, people with superior ability have "authority of leadership." When a person has both types of authority, the subordinate will "accept[] orders far outside the zone of indifference."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|173–174}}&lt;ref name=WrenGreenwood1998/&gt;{{rp|168}}

In '''Chapter XIII''', "The Environment of Decision" (pages 185-199), Barnard contemplates how personal decision-making and organizational decision-making differ.  He states "The fine art of executive decision consists in not deciding questions that are not now pertinent, in not deciding prematurely, in not making decision that cannot be made effective, and in not making decisions that others should make."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|194}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|152}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahoney|first1=Joseph T.|title=The Relevance of Chester I. Barnard's Teachings to Contemporary Management Education: Communicating the Aesthetics of Management|journal=International Journal Organization Theory and Behavior|volume=5|issue=1-2|year=2002|pages=159–172|doi=10.1081/OTB-120004243|url= http://business.illinois.edu/josephm/publications/barnard%202002.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}

Part III concludes with '''Chapter XIV''', "The Theory of Opportunism" (pages 200-211).

===Part IV===
"The Functions of Organizations in Cooperative Systems" constitutes the final part of the book.  It begins with '''Chapter XV''' ("The Executive Functions," pages 215-234) and '''Chapter XVI''' ("The Executive Process," pages 235-257).

'''Chapter XVII''' on "The Nature of Executive Responsibility" (pages 258-284) discusses [[morality]]. Barnard observes that "cooperation, not leadership, is the creative process; but leadership is the indispensable fulminator of its forces."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|259}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2002/&gt;{{rp|166}} In turn, morality is critical to leadership: "organizations endure… in proportion to the breadth of the morality by which they are governed."&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|282}}&lt;ref name= Gabor2000/&gt;{{rp|82}}

The "Conclusion" ('''Chapter XVIII''', pages 285-296) highlights 16 major observations of the book and contemplates the relationship of science and art in management:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that the expansion of cooperation and the development of the individual are mutually dependent realities, and that a due proportion or balance between them is a necessary condition of human welfare. Because it is subjective with respect both to a society as a whole and to the individual, what this proportion is I believe science cannot say. It is a question for philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938/&gt;{{rp|296}}&lt;ref name=Mahoney2002/&gt;{{rp|169}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Appendix===
The Appendix (pages 301-322) contains the text of Barnard's 1936 "Mind in Everyday Affairs" lecture.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of the book include:
* It is "deadly… [with] little meaning today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=John A. |title=A Classic Business Bookshelf|journal=BusinessWeek|date=March 5, 1990|url= http://www.businessweek.com/1989-94/pre94/b31481.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Its prose has been characterized as "difficult to read," "heavy," "turbid," and "atrocious."&lt;ref name=Wolf1974/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name=Hoopes2003/&gt;{{rp|174–175}}&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|150}} Even the Introduction to the Thirtieth Anniversary Edition notes the "ponderousness of Barnard's style."&lt;ref name=Barnard1968/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}
* The definition of "efficiency" in Chapter II is confusing.&lt;ref name= Callender2009/&gt;{{rp|13,194}}
* The definition of "formal organization" in Chapter VI has been subject to considerable scrutiny. Although [[Hal G. Rainey]] acknowledged that the definition did distinguish Barnard from the "classical theorists" of management, he characterized it as "completely inadequate."&lt;ref name=Rainey1991/&gt;{{rp|276}} [[Lyndall Urwick]] stated that "boy kisses girl" could qualify as an organization under Barnard's definition.&lt;ref name=WrenGreenwood1998/&gt;{{rp|166}}
* Statements such as "Personal aversions based upon racial, national, color, and class differences often seem distinctly pernicious; but on the whole they are, in the immediate sense, I believe, based upon a sound feeling of organization necessities" (page 147) have been assessed as "unenlightened" by today's standards.&lt;ref name=DunphyHoopes2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunphy|first1=Steven M.|last2=Hoopes|first2=James|title=Chester Barnard: Member of the "Élite"?|journal=Management Decision|volume=40|issue=10|year=2002|pages=1024–1028|doi=10.1108/00251740210452881}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Barnard's ideas about authority in Chapter XII have been summarized as a "bottom-up power" theory that fails to acknowledge the reality that it is "sometimes the job of corporate leaders to use power to control, repress, and arrest the actions of their subordinates."&lt;ref name=Hoopes2003/&gt;{{rp|xxiv,175–177,273–277}}
* A passage on page 319 ("…It is consequently necessary to say things in a form which is not correct from the standpoint of the speaker or writer…") has been interpreted as "advocating lying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frederick | first = William Crittenden | title = Values, Nature, and Culture in the American Corporation | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 0195357159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130–131}}
* Barnard did not write in any detail about the relationship between an organization and the customers of that organization.&lt;ref name=Keon1986/&gt;{{rp|458}}
* The book does not consider how an executive of a corporation interacts with the board of directors or stockholders.&lt;ref name=Keon1986/&gt;{{rp|458}}
* There is no significant mention of the education of staff (i.e., the executive's role as a teacher).&lt;ref name=Copeland1940/&gt;{{rp|156–157}}

==Legacy==

[[File:The Functions of the Executive - Cover of 30th Anniversary Edition 1968.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of 30th Anniversary Edition (1968)]]''The Functions of the Executive'' was to be the only book that Barnard ever wrote; however, he also wrote articles for journals, and collections of such articles have been published in books (e.g., the 1948 book ''Organization and Management'').&lt;ref name=Wolf1973/&gt;{{rp|vii}} By 2010, the book had received over 8,000 citations in [[Google Scholar]].&lt;ref name=GaborMahoney2010&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.business.uiuc.edu/Working_Papers/papers/10-0102.pdf |title= Chester Barnard and the Systems Approach to Nurturing Organizations | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], [[UIUC College of Business|College of Business]] | series= Working Paper 10-0102 |author1=Gabor, Andrea |author2=Joseph T.

Simon]] (1947).&lt;ref name=MitchellScott1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mitchell |first1= Terence R. |last2= Scott |first2= William G. |date= Fall 1988|title= The Barnard-Simon Contribution: a Vanished Legacy|journal= Public Administration Quarterly|volume=12 |issue=3 |pages= 348–368|jstor=40861427}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 interview, Simon was quoted as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Golembiewski |first1= Robert T. |year=1988 |title= Nobel Laureate Simon 'Looks Back': a Low-Frequency Mode |journal= Public Administration Quarterly |volume= 12|issue=3 |pages=275–300 |jstor= 40861423 |url=http://octopus.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00069/fld05320/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course I built squarely on Barnard, and have always felt deeply indebted to him; science is a cumulative endeavor. My general debt is expressed in the acknowledgements [p. xivii of the Second Edition]: "To Mr. Charles [sic] I. Barnard I owe a special debt: first, for his own book ''The Functions of the Executive''.…" In the book itself there are fourteen references to Barnard…. the notions of the contribution-inducement equilibrium, authority, and zone of acceptance were all derived from Barnard…. What I would now regard as the principal novelties in {{sic|''Administative''}} ''Behavior'' are the development of the concept of organizational identification…, the description of the decision process in terms of the processing of decision premises, and the bounded rationality notions…. Most of the rest is highly "Barnardian," and certainly even those "novel" ideas are in no way inconsistent with Barnard's view of organizations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''The Human Group'' by [[George C. Homans]] (1950).
* ''The Human Side of Enterprise'' by [[Douglas McGregor]] (1960).
* ''New Patterns of Management'' by [[Rensis Likert]] (1961).
* ''[[Behavioral theory of the firm|A Behavioral Theory of the Firm]]'' by [[Richard Cyert]] and [[James G. March]] (1963).
* ''Markets and Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications'' by [[Oliver E. Williamson]] (1975).
Barnard's book also anticipated ''[[In Search of Excellence]]'' by [[Tom Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman, Jr.]], the concept of [[management by objectives]] that [[Peter Drucker]] popularized, the [[two-factor theory]] of [[Frederick Herzberg]], and [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]].&lt;ref name=Gabor2000/&gt;{{rp|79–80}}

Examples of papers that have examined Barnard's "zones of indifference" concept include:

* A 2000 psychological study that compared leaders' and followers' ratings of the followers' willingness to perform assignments from the leaders. Leaders rated the assignments as "less enjoyable, undesirable, more above the call of duty, and more likely to be resisted" than the followers reported.&lt;ref name=Barbuto2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbuto|first1=John E.|title=Comparing Leaders' Ratings to Targets' Self-Reported Resistance to Task Assignments: an Extension of Chester Barnard's Zones of Indifference|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=86|issue=2|year=2000|pages=611–621|doi=10.2466/PR0.86.2.611-621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] held a series of seminars to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the book's publication; eight of the lectures became essays in a 1995 book edited by Oliver E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1621">'''Warren Brown''' (1929 – 25 December 2014) was a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] sailor and businessman. He took part in the [[Bermuda Race|Newport-Bermuda Race]] 20 times in 11 different boats, including four of his own. He was also a co-founder of the Island Press, which produced the now defunct ''[[Bermuda Sun]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The world: Through Warren Brown’s eyes|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20140619/ISLAND/140619731|publisher=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]|date=19 June 2014|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sailing pioneer Warren Brown dies|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20141226/NEWS/141229874|publisher=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]|date=26 December 2014|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Brown, at three months old, was among those who survived a shipwreck on 18 December 1929, when the [[RMS Fort Victoria|RMS ''Fort Victoria'']] was rammed by the [[USAHS Algonquin|SS ''Algonquin'']] while anchored in dense fog.&lt;ref name="Death" /&gt; All aboard the ''Fort Victoria'' were rescued before she sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Keith | last =Eastlake | year =1998 | month = | title =Sea Disasters, the truth behind the tragedies | pages =20 | publisher =Greenwich Editions | location =London N7 |isbn=0-86288-149-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''We the People''', launched September 22, 2011,&lt;ref name="White House Blog"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/22/petition-white-house-we-people White House blog press release regarding the new "We the People" petitioning platform]&lt;/ref&gt; was a section of the [[whitehouse.gov]] website (under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]) for [[Right to petition|petitioning]] the administration's policy experts. Petitions that met a certain threshold of signatures were typically reviewed by Administration officials who prepared and issued official responses, however, this was not always the case.&lt;ref name="White House Blog" /&gt;  Criminal justice proceedings in the United States and other processes of the federal government are not subject to White House website petitions.  We the People, rather, served as a public relations device for the Obama administration to provide a venue for citizens to express themselves.  On August 23, 2012, the White House Director of Digital Strategy [[Macon Phillips]] released the source code for the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Macon|title=We the Coders: Open-Sourcing We the People, the White House's Online Petitions System|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/08/23/open-sourcing-we-the-people|work=The White House Blog|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[source code]] is available on [[GitHub]], and lists both public domain status as [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|a work of the U.S. federal government]] and licensing under the [[GPL v2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We the People GitHub repository|url=https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petitions/blob/7.x-1.x/README.md#license|publisher=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 2017, the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] announced its intention to shut down the website and replace it with a "new platform would save taxpayers more than $1m a year." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House to 'temporarily' shut petition website|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42409634|website=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of May 2018, the site is operating as it was before it shut down.

==Overview==
Users who wish to create a petition are required to register a free whitehouse.gov account. To sign a petition, users only need to provide their name and their email address, and they will receive an email with a link that they must click to confirm their signature. It is not necessary to have a whitehouse.gov account to sign a petition.

===Thresholds===
Under the Obama administration's rules, a petition had to reach 150 signatures ([[Dunbar's Number]]) within 30 days to be searchable on WhiteHouse.gov, according to [[Tom Cochran (technologist)|Tom Cochran]], former director of digital technology.&lt;ref name="cochranrecode"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Cochran|authorlink=Tom Cochran (technologist)|url=https://www.recode.net/2016/12/1/13765002/president-obama-digital-trump-administration-open-source|title=Farewell to Obama, our first digital president|publisher=Recode|date=December 1, 2016|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had to reach 100,000 signatures within 30 days to receive an official response.&lt;ref name="TOS"&gt;[https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/how-why/terms-participation ''We the People'' terms of participation page], whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The original threshold was set at 5,000 signatures on September 1, 2011,&lt;ref name="whblog2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon|last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/01/we-people-announcing-white-house-petitions-how-they-work|title=We the People: Announcing White House Petitions &amp; How They Work|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was raised to 25,000 on October 3, 2011,&lt;ref name="whblog20111003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon |last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/03/good-problem-have-raising-signature-threshold-white-house-petitions|title=A good problem to have: Raising the signature threshold for White House petitions|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised again to 100,000 as of January 15, 2013.&lt;ref name="whblog3"&gt;{{cite web|first=Macon|last=Phillips|authorlink=Macon Phillips|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/01/15/why-we-re-raising-signature-threshold-we-people|title=Why We're Raising the Signature Threshold for We the People|publisher=whitehouse.gov|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House typically would not comment when a petition concerned an ongoing investigation.&lt;ref name=20130310WPeilperin&gt;Eilperin, Juliet (June 10, 2013). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/10/white-house-petition-to-pardon-edward-snowden-gathers-steam/ "White House petition to pardon Edward Snowden gathers steam"], ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's unclear whether Trump's advisors will make a tradition of publicly responding to petitions from the American people," Dell Cameron wrote for the Daily Dot on the day that Trump was inaugurated,&lt;ref name="dailydot"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dell|last=Cameron|url=http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/white-house-petitions-president-trump|title=Trump's team removes all old, pending 'We the People' petitions|publisher=Daily Dot|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the Trump administration that same day "archived" (that is, deactivated) all petitions in progress on the 'We the People' site. New petitions were created, but only two petitions—both created on Inauguration Day—soared above the 100,000-signature threshold within the Trump administration's first week, while other petitions created subsequently seemed not to count signatures at all.&lt;ref name="disruptivedissertation"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tucker|last=Lieberman|url=http://disruptivedissertation.blogspot.com/2017/01/under-trump-administration-we-people.html|title=Under Trump administration, 'We the People' White House petition website is mysteriously broken|publisher=Disruptive Dissertation|date=January 28, 2017|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was later fixed to count signatures but the Trump administration did not respond to any of the petitions until March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15022050/donald-trump-white-house-petition-we-the-people-update Will Donald Trump keep the White House petition site alive?] The Verge, March 22, 2017&lt;br/&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17143536/white-house-we-the-people-online-petition-answers-back&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable petitions==

===Death Star===
In November 2012, a petition was created urging the government to create a [[Death Star]] as an economic stimulus and job creation measure gained more than 25,000 signatures, enough to qualify for an official response. The official (tongue-in-cheek) response released in January 2013&lt;ref name="Wired-20130111"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shawcross |first=Paul |title=This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking For |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/white-house-death-star/ |date=January 11, 2013 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the cost of building a real Death Star has been estimated at $852 quadrillion and at current rates of steel production, would not be ready for more than 833,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/white-house-rejects-death-star-petition-doomsday-devices-us-could-build-instead-1014682|title=White House Rejects Death Star Petition: Doomsday Devices US Could Build Instead|date=January 15, 2013|work=International Business Times|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response also noted that "the Administration does not support blowing up planets" and questions funding a weapon "with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship" as reasons for denying the petition.&lt;ref name="Wired-20130111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deathstar"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's a trap!

===Newtown shooting===
Following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|spree shooting in Newtown, Connecticut]] on December 14, 2012, a petition for new gun-control measures achieved 100,000 signatures within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=20130310WPeilperin /&gt;

===Cell phone unlocking bill===
In February 2013, a petition started by [[OpenSignal]] co-founder and digital rights activist [[Sina Khanifar]] reached the 100,000-signature threshold required for a response from the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/15/heres-how-cell-phone-unlocking-became-legal|title=Here's How Cell Phone Unlocking Became Legal|work=The White House|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, the Obama administration issued a response urging the FCC and Congress to take and legalize [[cell phone unlocking]]. A year later, Congress passed the [[Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act]], the first piece of legislation driven by an online petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/01/answering-publics-call|title=Answering the Public's Call|work=The White House|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law by President Obama on August 1, 2014.

===Prosecute 47 senators under the Logan Act===
In March 2015, as the United States and the [[P5+1]] group were negotiating with [[Iran]] on an [[Comprehensive agreement on Iranian nuclear program|agreement to restrain Iran's nuclear program]], 47 Republican [[United States Senate|Senators]] sent an open letter to the leaders of Iran strongly suggesting that a future president or Congress could nullify any such agreement. This action was widely construed as deliberate interference with the negotiations, and possibly a violation of the [[Logan Act]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/13/republican-senators-wrote-iran-guilty-crime-maybe "Were 47 Republican senators who wrote to Iran guilty of a crime?"], Ben Jacobs, ''[[The Guardian]],'' March 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In response, several similar petitions were posted on March 9, 2015. One petition, entitled ''"File charges against the 47 U.S. Senators in violation of the Logan Act in attempting to undermine a nuclear agreement"'', passed the 100,000-signature threshold within one day. The petition had reached the number 1 spot, garnering more than 320,000 signatures by April 8, 2015, more than three times the number of signatures required to qualify for a response from the White House. For a variety of reasons, however, pundits, news analysts and legal scholars are largely skeptical that the petition will receive a favorable response leading to the requested prosecutions.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News Cover"&gt;ABC News.com, [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/iran-letter-165000-sign-petition-prosecute-gop-senators/story?id=29564985 / "Iran Letter: 165,000+ Sign Petition to Prosecute GOP Senators for Treason"], Katelyn Marmon, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg.com, [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-12/can-231-445-people-who-want-tom-cotton-tried-for-treason-be-wrong-yes-/"Can 231,445 People Who Want Tom Cotton Tried for Treason Be Wrong?"], David Weigel, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;Huffington Post, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/monica-bauer/the-logan-act-and-the-treason-meme-click-bait-for-liberals_b_6849040.html/ "The Logan Act and the Treason Meme: Click Bait for Liberals"], Monica Bauer, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR Debate"&gt;NPR.com, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/03/11/392323244/why-the-gop-iran-letter-is-spurring-debate-over-an-18th-century-law/ "Why The GOP Iran Letter Is Spurring Debate Over An 18th Century Law"], Miles Parks, Retrieved March 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump taxes===
"Within hours"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/obama-white-house-website/index.html |title=What happened to Obama's White House website? |author=Tal Kopan| date=January 20, 2017| access-date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] on January 20, 2017, two petitions had been started on the site. One, for the release of his taxes, "with all information needed to verify emoluments clause compliance" reached the 100,000 signature threshold within twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316382-petition-demanding-trumps-tax-returns-gets-record-number-of|title=Petition for Trump's tax returns gets record number of signatures|last=Greenwood|first=Max|date=26 January 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|access-date=27 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, for the President to divest himself of his assets or put them in a blind trust, had some seventy-seven thousand. On January 22, Presidential aide [[Kellyanne Conway]] declared that the tax returns will not be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns.html?_r=0|title=Trump Won't Release His Tax Returns, a Top Aide Says|date=January 22, 2017|publisher=New York Times|last1=Davis|first1=Julie Hershfeld|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, the petitions had over 385,000 and 119,000 signatures, respectively, with the former being a record number of signatures for any petition on the site. By the February 17 deadline to reach 100,000 signatures, it had exceeded one million signatures, making it the first petition on the site to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manning|first1=Allee|last2=Kelly|first2=Kaitlyn|title=One Million People Demand Trump's Tax Return, Smashing Petition Record|url=http://www.vocativ.com/403165/we-the-people-petition-white-house-trump-taxes/|accessdate=February 17, 2017|work=Vocativ|date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Antifa (United States)|American Antifa]]===
In August 2017, a petition requesting that "AntiFa" be classified by the Pentagon as a terrorist organization was launched. The petition had over 100,000 signatures within three days. The final count before White House responded was 368,423. The originator of the "AntiFa" petition, who goes by the pseudonym "Microchip", remarked to ''[[Politico]]'' that getting conservatives to share and discuss the petition was the entire point, rather than prompting any concrete action by the government.&lt;ref name="Spurious We the People petition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/24/antifa-white-house-petition-trump-troll-241990|title=White House 'antifa' petition written by pro-Trump troll|last=Musgrave|first=Shawn|date=August 24, 2017|work=Politico|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House responded to the petition, stating "Although Federal law provides a mechanism to designate and sanction ''foreign'' terrorist organizations and foreign state sponsors of terrorism, there is currently no analogous mechanism for formally designating ''domestic'' terrorist organizations. Nonetheless, law enforcement has many tools at its disposal to address violent individuals and groups." (emphasis added)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17143536/white-house-we-the-people-online-petition-answers-back&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Concerns about the efficacy of We the People have been raised since before the first White House responses were published.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;Forbes.com, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/09/23/what-the-people-want-abolishment-of-the-tsa-and-marijuana-legalization/ "What The People Want: Abolishment of the TSA and Marijuana Legalization"], Kashmir Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2013, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' website published an article about 30 petitions that had been left unanswered for an average of 240 days despite each having met the signature goals. The article refers to the website www.whpetitions.info for taking "its own tally and highlights petitions that have received enough signatures but have not received responses."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;WashingtonPost.com, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/13/here-are-the-30-questions-the-white-house-doesnt-want-to-answer/ "Here are the 30 questions the White House doesn’t seem to want to answer"], Andrea Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 16 October 2016, 323 White House petitions have met their signature thresholds.  The White House has responded to 321 of them (99%) with an average response time of 117 days.  Average waiting time so far for two unanswered petitions: 23 days, according to whpetitions.info.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whpetitions.info/ whpetitions.info]&lt;/ref&gt;  The total number of petitions created and percent that have reached an actionable level beyond a response are unable to be determined at this time.

Criticism has been directed{{by whom|date=February 2015}} at the choice of administration official to answer the petitions regarding the legalization of marijuana. [[Gil Kerlikowske]], the Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], was chosen to craft the administration's response.&lt;ref name="WH-Response1"&gt;whitehouse.gov, [https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/what-we-have-say-about-legalizing-marijuana We The People petition response, What We Have to Say About Legalizing Marijuana], Gil Kerlikowske&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism stems from the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, which states that the Director must oppose all attempts to legalize the use of illicit drugs in any form.&lt;ref name="ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 1998"&gt;Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998, [http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/reauthorization-act Title VII Sec. 704(b)(12)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redbook.gao.gov1"&gt;redbook.gao.gov, [http://redbook.gao.gov/17/fl0083064.php Application of Anti-Lobbying Laws to the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Open Letter to State Level Prosecutors], B-301022, March 10, 2004, Anthony H. Gamboa&lt;/ref&gt;

Other discussions of We the People have focused on its technical glitches,&lt;ref name="Huffington Post1"&gt;''The Huffington Post'', [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jh-snider/we-the-people-petition-website_b_1062883.html/ The Case of the Missing White House Petition], October 31, 2011, J.H.

During the first weeks of the presidency of Donald Trump, ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reported that many popular petitions did not appear to be receiving any signatures. Additionally, certain URLs to the petitions led to error pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hooton|first1=Christopher|title=White House petition to save arts funding not registering signatures|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/president-donald-trump-arts-funding-nea-neh-cpb-prs-npr-petition-white-house-a7541631.html|accessdate=January 30, 2017|work=The Independent|date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=PenzeyMoog|first1=Caitlin|title=White House petitions are basically turned off|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/white-house-petitions-are-basically-turned-249143|accessdate=January 30, 2017|work=The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2950">'''Yukihiro Kayama''' (加山幸浩)&lt;br /&gt;
Born in Tokyo, 1939

Yukihiro Kayama is a prominent Japanese technologist, entrepreneur and venture capitalist. For 36 years he worked for Mitsubishi Corporation where he rose to become division head for technology. During his time there he was responsible for returning more than 200 billion yen (more than two billion US dollars) from a seed capital of less than 10M USD. This was mainly with early-stage/charter investments in companies such as [[Piri]],&lt;ref&gt;Piri were bought by SDLI who in turn were later bought by JDSU. SDLI acquires PIRI: {{cite web|url=http://www.convergedigest.com/daily/v7/v7n092.htm#SDL%20to%20Acquire%20Photonic%20Integration%20Research%20for%20$1.%20Billion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223013606/http://www.convergedigest.com/Daily/v7/v7n092.htm |archivedate=February 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JDSU acquires SDLI:

Kayama was also an early adopter of Sun’s Java programming language and was instrumental in getting it into the Mitsubishi Motors division.

Upon retiring from Mitsubishi at the age of 59, he founded his own company EC-One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec-one.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212045335/http://www.ec-one.com/ |archivedate=December 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first purely Java systems integrator in Japan. EC-One listed on the JASDAQ in 2002. He retired from EC-One in 2005 and founded his own incubator/venture capital firm Fit-One Holdings.

He serves on the boards of GuardTime, MonstarLab, and Data Applications, and is advisor to China Seed Ventures (CSV).

One of the most respected observers of technology not only globally but especially for Japan, [[Joi Ito]], believes that Kayama’s ability to support  [[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]] before anyone else sees them makes him a man to watch. "Mr. Kayama is a unique guy with a deep understanding of technology. I think he is one of the few senior technology-focused people who is very successful and has multiple, multimillion-dollar home runs under his belt. I look forward to working on something with him soon." &lt;ref&gt;http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2000/09/&lt;/ref&gt; Ito is one of the founding shareholders of Guardtime and eventually got his wish when Kayama joined [[Guardtime]] as Chairman in 2009.

He has a master's degree in Engineering from [[Nihon University]] and is married with two children.

She was then admitted to the [[University of Cape Town]] in 1999, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Business Science]] in 2002.

==Career== 
From 2005 until 2008, Mhango was an economist at [[Standard Bank of South Africa]]. In June 2008, she became the head of economic research for Africa at Standard Bank, serving in that capacity until November 2010. Since November 2010, she has been the economist for sub-Saharan Africa at Renaissance Capital.&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

In June 2016, following the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]]'s decision to allow the niara to freely float against other currencies, Mhango said that floating the naira freely would “release a pressure valve for the economy”, which would in turn “see the economy beginning to thaw and green shoots emerge possibly as soon as a year from now”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/20/nigerias-naira-plunges-30pc-after-central-bank-gives-up-on-dolla/ | title=Nigeria’s naira plunges 30 percent after central bank gives up on dollar peg |
accessdate=12 November 2016 | date=20 June 2016 | last=Spence |
first=Peter |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mhango, with others had correctly predicted such a devaluation in the naira, following the flotation of the [[Kazakhstan]] currency in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-21/africa-is-running-out-of-options-as-china-to-kazakhstan-devalue |

last=Paul Wallace |first=and Rene Vollgraaff | date=21 August 2015 |  publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]] |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2016, Mhango and other economists at Renaissance Capital said that the Kenya Shilling was about 20 percent overvalued and that this was hurting [[Kenya]]'s exports to other countries in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Strong-shilling-hurting-Kenya-exports-in-region/539552-3403804-obiwqmz/ | title=Strong shilling hurting Kenya’s exports in region | accessdate=12 November 2016 |last=Mwaniki|location=Nairobi |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |first=Charles| date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
