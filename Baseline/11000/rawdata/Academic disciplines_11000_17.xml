[[Image:Excerpt from CDC 2003 Table 1.pdf|thumb|right|2003 US mortality ([[life table|life]]) table, Table 1, Page 1]]'''Actuarial science''' is the discipline that applies [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[statistics|statistical]] methods to [[Risk assessment|assess risk]] in [[insurance]], [[finance]] and other industries and professions. [[Actuary|Actuaries]] are professionals who are qualified in this field through intense education and experience. In many countries, actuaries must demonstrate their competence by passing a series of rigorous professional examinations.

Actuarial science includes a number of interrelated subjects, including [[mathematics]], [[probability theory]], [[statistics]], [[finance]], [[economics]], and [[computer science]]. Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. The science has gone through revolutionary changes since the 1980s due to the proliferation of high speed computers and the union of [[stochastic]] actuarial models with modern financial theory {{harv|Frees|1990}}.

Many universities have undergraduate and graduate degree programs in actuarial science. In 2010, a study published by job search website CareerCast ranked actuary as the #1 job in the United States {{harv|Needleman|2010}}. The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress. A similar study by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' in 2006 included actuaries among the 25 Best Professions that it expects will be in great demand in the future {{harv|Nemko|2006}}.

==Life insurance, pensions and healthcare==
Actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, [[life insurance]], and annuities. These long term coverages required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This led to the development of an important actuarial concept, referred to as the [[present value]] of a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern [[financial economics]].

* In traditional life insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of [[mortality rate|mortality]], the production of [[life table]]s, and the application of [[interest|compound interest]] to produce life insurance, annuities and endowment policies. Contemporary life insurance programs have been extended to include credit and mortgage insurance, [[key person insurance]] for small businesses, [[long term care insurance]] and [[Medical savings account|health savings accounts]] {{harv|Hsiao|2001}}.
* In health insurance, including insurance provided directly by employers, and social insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability, morbidity, mortality, fertility and other contingencies. The effects of consumer choice and the geographical distribution of the utilization of medical services and procedures, and the utilization of drugs and therapies, is also of great importance. These factors underlay the development of the Resource-Base Relative Value Scale ([[RBRVS]]) at Harvard in a multi-disciplined study {{harv|Hsiao|2004}}. Actuarial science also aids in the design of benefit structures, reimbursement standards, and the effects of proposed government standards on the cost of healthcare {{harv|CHBRP|2004}}.
* In the pension industry, actuarial methods are used to measure the costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign of pension plans. The strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates, the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements, [[collective bargaining]]; the employer's old, new and foreign competitors; the changing demographics of the workforce; changes in the internal revenue code; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses; and equally importantly, both the short and long term financial and economic trends. It is common with mergers and acquisitions that several pension plans have to be combined or at least administered on an equitable basis. When benefit changes occur, old and new benefit plans have to be blended, satisfying new social demands and various government discrimination test calculations, and providing employees and retirees with understandable choices and transition paths. Benefit plans liabilities have to be properly valued, reflecting both earned benefits for past service, and the benefits for future service. Finally, funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country, such as the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] in the United States.
* In social welfare programs, the [[Office of the Chief Actuary]] (OCACT), [[Social Security Administration]] plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to SSA-administered retirement, survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs. It evaluates operations of the [[Social Security (United States)|Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund]] and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, conducts studies of program financing, performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues involving mortality, morbidity, utilization, retirement, disability, survivorship, marriage, unemployment, poverty, old age, families with children, etc., and projects future workloads. In addition, the Office is charged with conducting cost analyses relating to the [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) program, a general-revenue financed, means-tested program for low-income aged, blind and disabled people. The Office provides technical and consultative services to the Commissioner, to the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds, and its staff appears before Congressional Committees to provide expert testimony on the actuarial aspects of Social Security issues.

==Applied to other forms of insurance==
Actuarial science is also applied to [[Property insurance|property]], [[Casualty insurance|casualty]], [[Liability insurance|liability]], and [[general insurance]]. In these forms of insurance, coverage is generally provided on a renewable period, (such as a yearly). Coverage can be cancelled at the end of the period by either party.

[[Property insurance|Property]] and [[casualty insurance]] companies tend to specialize because of the complexity and diversity of risks.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} One division is to organize around personal and commercial lines of insurance. Personal lines of insurance are for individuals and include fire, auto, homeowners, theft and umbrella coverages. Commercial lines address the insurance needs of businesses and include property, business continuation, product liability, fleet/commercial vehicle, workers compensation, fidelity &amp; surety, and [[Directors and officers liability insurance|D&amp;O]] insurance. The insurance industry also provides coverage for exposures such as catastrophe, weather-related risks, earthquakes, patent infringement and other forms of corporate espionage, terrorism, and "one-of-a-kind" (e.g., satellite launch). Actuarial science provides data collection, measurement, estimating, forecasting, and valuation tools to provide financial and underwriting data for management to assess marketing opportunities and the nature of the risks. Actuarial science often helps to assess the overall risk from catastrophic events in relation to its underwriting capacity or surplus.

In the [[reinsurance]] fields, actuarial science can be used to design and price reinsurance and retrocession arrangements, and to establish reserve funds for known claims and future claims and catastrophes.

==Development==

===Pre-formalization===
Elementary [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] agreements and pensions arose in antiquity {{harv|Thucydides}}. Early in the [[Roman Empire|Roman empire]], associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to [[Burial society|burial insurance]] and [[Friendly society|friendly societies]]. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of [[Columbarium|columbāria]], or burial vaults, owned by the fund—the precursor to [[Mutual insurance|mutual insurance companies]] {{harv|Johnston|1932|loc=§475–§476}}. Other early examples of mutual [[surety]] and assurance pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forebears, and to Celtic society {{harv|Loan|1992}}. However, many of these earlier forms of surety and aid would often fail due to lack of understanding and knowledge {{harv|Faculty and Institute of Actuaries|2004}}.

===Initial development===
The 17th century was a period of advances in mathematics in Germany, France and England. At the same time there was a rapidly growing desire and need to place the valuation of personal risk on a more scientific basis. Independently of each other, [[compound interest]] was studied and [[probability theory]] emerged as a well-understood mathematical discipline. Another important advance came in 1662 from a London [[draper]] named [[John Graunt]], who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group, or [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]], of people of the same age, despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual. This study became the basis for the original [[life table]]. One could now set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy how much each person in the group should contribute to a common fund assumed to earn a fixed rate of interest. The first person to demonstrate publicly how this could be done was [[Edmond Halley]] (of [[Halley's comet]] fame). Halley constructed his own life table, and showed how it could be used to calculate the [[Insurance|premium]] amount someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life annuity {{harv|Halley|1693}}.

===Early actuaries===
[[James Dodson (mathematician)|James Dodson]]'s pioneering work on the long term insurance contracts under which the same premium is charged each year led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship (now commonly known as [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Equitable Life]]) in London in 1762 {{harv|Lewin|2007|p=38}}. Many other life insurance companies and pension funds were created over the following 200 years. Equitable Life was the first to use the word "actuary" for its chief executive officer in 1762 {{harv|Ogborn|1956|p=235}}. Previously, "actuary" meant an official who recorded the decisions, or "acts", of ecclesiastical courts {{harv|Faculty and Institute of Actuaries|2004}}. Other companies that did not use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=166}}.

===Technological advances===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, calculations were performed without computers. The calculations of life insurance premiums and reserving requirements are rather complex, and actuaries developed techniques to make the calculations as easy as possible, for example "commutation functions" (essentially precalculated columns of summations over time of discounted values of survival and death probabilities) {{harv|Slud|2006}}. Actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by promoting competency and ethical standards {{harv|Hickman|2004|p=4}}. However, calculations remained cumbersome, and actuarial shortcuts were commonplace. Non-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life insurance colleagues during the 20th century. The 1920 revision for the New-York based National Council on Workmen's Compensation Insurance rates took over two months of around-the-clock work by day and night teams of actuaries {{harv|Michelbacher|1920|pp=224, 230}}. In the 1930s and 1940s, the mathematical foundations for [[stochastic]] processes were developed {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=168}}. Actuaries could now begin to estimate losses using models of random events, instead of the [[deterministic]] methods they had used in the past. The introduction and development of the computer further revolutionized the actuarial profession. From pencil-and-paper to punchcards to current high-speed devices, the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has rapidly improved, while still being heavily dependent on the assumptions input into the models, and actuaries needed to adjust to this new world {{harv|MacGinnitie|1980|pp=50–51}}.

===Actuarial science related to modern financial economics===
Traditional actuarial science and modern [[financial economics]] in the US have different practices, which is caused by 1) different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies and 2) different regulations.

Regulations are from the [[Armstrong investigation of 1905]], the [[Glass–Steagall Act of 1932]], the adoption of the [[Mandatory Security Valuation Reserve]] by the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]], which cushioned market fluctuations, and the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]], (FASB) in the US and Canada, which regulates pensions valuations and funding.

====History====
Historically, much of the foundation of actuarial theory predated modern financial theory. In the early twentieth century, actuaries were developing many techniques that can be found in modern financial theory, but for various historical reasons, these developments did not achieve much recognition {{harv|Whelan|2002}}.

As a result, actuarial science developed along a different path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, as opposed to the [[arbitrage-free]] [[Rational pricing#Risk neutral valuation|risk-neutral valuation]] concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the [[asset allocation]] mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]] assumption). This concept is inconsistent with [[financial economics]].

The potential of modern financial economics theory to complement existing actuarial science was recognized by actuaries in the mid-twentieth century {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|pp=169–171}}. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models {{harv|D’Arcy|1989}}. Ideas from financial economics became increasingly influential in actuarial thinking, and actuarial science has started to embrace more sophisticated mathematical modelling of finance {{harv|Economist|2006}}. Today, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, is cognizant of the need to reflect the combined approach of tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory {{harv|Feldblum|2001|pp=8–9}}. However, assumption-dependent concepts are still widely used (such as the setting of the discount rate assumption as mentioned earlier), particularly in North America.

Product design adds another dimension to the debate. Financial economists argue that pension benefits are bond-like and should not be funded with equity investments without reflecting the risks of not achieving expected returns. But some pension products do reflect the risks of unexpected returns. In some cases, the pension beneficiary assumes the risk, or the employer assumes the risk. The current debate now seems to be focusing on four principles:
# financial models should be free of arbitrage
# assets and liabilities with identical cash flows should have the same price. This is at odds with [[FASB]]
# the value of an asset is independent of its financing
# the final issue deals with how pension assets should be invested

Essentially, financial economics state that pension assets should not be invested in equities for a variety of theoretical and practical reasons {{harv|Moriarty|2006}}.

===Actuaries in criminal justice===
There is an increasing trend to recognize that actuarial skills can be applied to a range of applications outside the traditional fields of insurance, pensions, etc. One notable example is the use in some US states of actuarial models to set criminal sentencing guidelines. These models attempt to predict the chance of re-offending according to rating factors which include the type of crime, age, educational background and ethnicity of the offender {{harv|Silver|Chow-Martin|2002}}. However, these models have been open to criticism as providing justification for discrimination against specific ethnic groups by law enforcement personnel.  Whether this is statistically correct or a self-fulfilling correlation remains under debate {{harv|Harcourt|2003}}.

Another example is the use of actuarial models to assess the risk of sex offense recidivism. Actuarial models and associated tables, such as the MnSOST-R, Static-99, and SORAG, have been used since the late 1990s to determine the likelihood that a sex offender will re-offend and thus whether he or she should be institutionalized or set free {{harv|Nieto|Jung|2006|pp=28–33}}.

 |quote=&lt;small&gt;Early in the Empire, associations were formed for the purpose of meeting the funeral expenses of their members, whether the remains were to be buried or cremated, or for the purpose of building columbāria, or for both....If the members had provided places for the disposal of their bodies after death, they now provided for the necessary funeral expenses by paying into the common fund weekly a small fixed sum, easily within the reach of the poorest of them. When a member died, a stated sum was drawn from the treasury for his funeral....If the purpose of the society was the building of a columbārium, the cost was first determined and the sum total divided into what we should call shares (sortēs virīlēs), each member taking as many as he could afford and paying their value into the treasury.&lt;/small&gt;

In [[computing]], an '''aperture''' is a portion of [[physical address]] space (i.e. [[Computer_data_storage#Primary_storage|physical memory]]) that is associated with a particular [[peripheral device]] or a [[computer memory|memory]] unit. Apertures may reach external devices such as [[read-only memory|ROM]] or [[random access memory|RAM]] chips, or internal memory on the [[central processing unit|CPU]] itself.

Typically, a memory device attached to a computer accepts addresses starting at zero, and so a system with more than one such device would have ambiguous addressing. To resolve this, the memory logic will contain several aperture [[multiplexer|selectors]], each containing a range selector and an interface to one of the memory devices. The set of selector address ranges of the apertures are disjoint. When the CPU presents a physical address within the range recognized by an aperture, the aperture unit routes the request (with the address remapped to a zero base) to the attached device. Thus, apertures form a layer of [[address space|address translation]] below the level of the usual virtual-to-physical mapping.

'''Bats''' are the only mammal capable of '''true flight'''. Bats use flight for capturing prey, breeding, avoiding predators, and long-distance migration. Bat wing morphology is often highly specialized to the needs of the species.

==Evolution==
[[Charles Darwin]] foresaw an issue with his theory of evolution by natural selection in the evolution of [[complex traits]] such as eyes or "the structure and habits of a bat."&lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;Darwin, C. (1968). On the origin of species by means of natural selection. 1859. London: Murray Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the oldest [[Onychonycteris|bat fossils]] are very similar in wing morphology to the bats of today, despite living and dying 52.5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Sears 2006"&gt;Sears, K. E., Behringer, R. R., Rasweiler, J. J., &amp; Niswander, L. A. (2006). Development of bat flight: morphologic and molecular evolution of bat wing digits. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103(17), 6581-6586.&lt;/ref&gt; The common ancestor of all bats is hypothesized to have been an [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]] of the [[northern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Teeling 2005"&gt;Teeling, E. C., Springer, M. S., Madsen, O., Bates, P., O'brien, S. J., &amp; Murphy, W. J. (2005). A molecular phylogeny for bats illuminates biogeography and the fossil record. Science, 307(5709), 580-584.&lt;/ref&gt; This ancestor is predicted to have lived 64 million years ago at the border of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|Cretaceous and Paleogene]], based on molecular and paleontological data.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2008"&gt;Cooper, K. L., &amp; Tabin, C. J. (2008). Understanding of bat wing evolution takes flight. Genes &amp; development, 22(2), 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a gap in the fossil record, and no transitional fossils exist from this quadrupedal ancestor to the appearance of the modern bat. It is unclear how long the transition from quadrupedalism to powered flight took. After evolving powered flight, bats underwent massive [[adaptive radiation]], becoming the second-most speciose [[mammal classification|mammal order]], after [[rodent]]s.&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;Nowak, R. M. (1994). Walker's bats of the world. JHU Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have shown that, rather than having evolved from gliders, the ancestors of bats were flutterers.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Matt |title=Ancient bats got in a flap over food |journal=Nature|year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations for flight==
To make powered flight possible, bats had to evolve several features. Bat flight necessitated the increase of membrane surface area between the digits of the forelimbs, between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, and between the hindlimbs.&lt;ref name="Cooper 2008"/&gt; Bats also had to evolve a thinner cortical bone to reduce torsional stresses produced by propulsive downstroke movements.&lt;ref name="Swartz 1992"&gt;Swartz, S. M., Bennett, M. B., &amp; Carrier, D. R. (1992). Wing bone stresses in free flying bats and the evolution of skeletal design for flight. Nature, 359(6397), 726.&lt;/ref&gt; Bats had to reroute innervation to their wing muscles to allow for control of powered flight.&lt;ref name="Thewissen 1991"&gt;Thewissen, J. G. M., &amp; Babcock, S. K. (1991). Distinctive cranial and cervical innervation of wing muscles: new evidence for bat monophyly. Science, 251(4996), 934-937.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength and mass of forelimb musculature also had to be increased to allow powerful upstrokes and downstrokes.&lt;ref name="Thewissen 1992"&gt;Thewissen, J. G. M., &amp; Babcock, S. K. (1992). The origin of flight in bats. BioScience, 42(5), 340-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wing shape==

=== Wing chord ===
The [[Chord (aeronautics)|chord]] length of a bat wing is the distance from the [[leading edge]] to the [[trailing edge]] measured parallel to the direction of flight. The mean chord length &lt;math&gt;\bar{c}&lt;/math&gt; is a standardized measure which captures a representative chord length over a whole flap cycle. Given wing area ''S'', and wingspan ''b'', the mean chord can be calculated by,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/468014494|title=Bird flight performance : a practical calculation manual|last=J.|first=Pennycuick, Colin|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198577214|oclc=468014494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Von Busse|first=R.|last2=Hedenstrom|first2=A.|last3=Winter|first3=Y.|last4=Johansson|first4=L. C.|date=2012-10-11|title=Kinematics and wing shape across flight speed in the bat, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/bio.20122964|journal=Biology Open|volume=1|issue=12|pages=1226–1238|doi=10.1242/bio.20122964|issn=2046-6390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{c} = \frac{S}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

===Aspect ratio===
[[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)|Aspect ratio]] has been calculated with different definitions. The two methods outlined here give different, non-comparable values. The first method of calculation uses the wingspan ''b'', and the wing area ''S,'' and is given by,&lt;ref name="Farney 1969"&gt;Farney, J., &amp; Fleharty, E. D. (1969). Aspect ratio, loading, wing span, and membrane areas of bats. Journal of Mammalogy, 50(2), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedenström|first=A.|last2=Johansson|first2=L. C.|last3=Wolf|first3=M.|last4=Busse|first4=R. von|last5=Winter|first5=Y.|last6=Spedding|first6=G. R.|date=2007-05-11|title=Bat Flight Generates Complex Aerodynamic Tracks|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5826/894|journal=Science|language=en|volume=316|issue=5826|pages=894–897|doi=10.1126/science.1142281|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17495171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-10-01|title=Recent progress in flapping wing aerodynamics and aeroelasticity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376042110000023|journal=Progress in Aerospace Sciences|language=en|volume=46|issue=7|pages=284–327|doi=10.1016/j.paerosci.2010.01.001|issn=0376-0421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\text{AR} \equiv \frac{b^2}{S} = \frac{b}{\bar{c}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this definition, typical values of aspect ratio fall between 5 and 11 depending on the wing morphology of a given species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Faster flight speed is significantly correlated with higher aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Findley 1972"&gt;Findley, J. S., Studier, E. H., &amp; Wilson, D. E. (1972). Morphologic properties of bat wings. Journal of Mammalogy, 53(3), 429-444.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher aspect ratios decrease the energetic costs of flight, which is beneficial to migratory species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;

Another way to calculate the wing aspect ratio is by taking the length of the wrist to the tip of the third finger, adding the length of the forearm, and then dividing that total by the distance from the wrist to the fifth finger.&lt;ref name="Freeman 1981"&gt;Freeman, P. W. (1981). A multivariate study of the family Molossidae (Mammalia, Chiroptera): morphology, ecology, evolution. Mammalogy papers: University of Nebraska State Museum, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wing loading===
[[Wing loading]] is the weight of the bat divided by the wing area and is reported in the units, &lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Given a bat of mass ''m'', the wing loading ''Q'' is,

&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{m g}{S}&lt;/math&gt;

For bats, wing loading values typically range from 4 to 35 N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the bat species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Mass loading differs only by a constant ''[[Gravity of Earth|g]]'', and is reported as &lt;math&gt;\frac{kg}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;as opposed to &lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a meta analysis covering 257 species of bats, higher relative wing loading values were observed in bats which fly at higher velocities, while lower wing loading values were correlated with improved flight maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt; Additionally, bats with lower wing loading were seen to have better mass-carrying ability, and were able carry larger prey while flying.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987" /&gt;

===Wingtips===
Bats with larger wingtips have slower flight speeds.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Wings with rounded tips have lower aspect ratios, and are associated with slower, more maneuverable flight.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

Bats that consume insects by hawking (aerial pursuit and capture) must be able to travel at fast speeds, and must employ a high level of maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"&gt;Norberg and Rayner (1987). Ecological morphology and flight in bats (Mammalia; Chiroptera): wing adaptations, flight performance, foraging strategy and echolocation. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences 316.1179 (1987): 335–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphological adaptations that favor this style of flight include high wing loading, long and pointed wingtips, and wings with high aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The bat family [[Molossidae]] is considered highly specialized at hawking, with unusually high aspect ratios and wing loading.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; These traits make them capable of incredibly-fast speeds. [[Mexican free-tailed bat]]s are thought to be the fastest animal on earth, capable of horizontal flight speeds over a level surface up to 160&amp;nbsp;km/hr (99&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name="McCracken 2016"&gt;McCracken, G. F., Safi, K., Kunz, T. H., Dechmann, D. K., Swartz, S. M., &amp; Wikelski, M. (2016). Airplane tracking documents the fastest flight speeds recorded for bats. Royal Society Open Science, 3(11), 160398.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gleaning===
Bats that glean insects capture stationary prey on a solid substrate. This foraging method requires bats to hover above the substrate and listen for insect noises.&lt;ref name="Schmidt 2000"&gt;Schmidt, S., Hanke, S., &amp; Pillat, J. (2000). The role of echolocation in the hunting of terrestrial prey–new evidence for an underestimated strategy in the gleaning bat, Megaderma lyra. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 186(10), 975-988.&lt;/ref&gt; Short, rounded wingtips in gleaning bats may be advantageous to allow maneuverability of flight in cluttered airspace.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Pointed wingtips may be detrimental to a bat's ability to glean insects.&lt;ref name="Stoffberg 2004"&gt;Stoffberg, S., &amp; Jacobs, D. S. (2004). The influence of wing morphology and echolocation on the gleaning ability of the insectivorous bat ''Myotis tricolor''. Canadian journal of zoology, 82(12), 1854-1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trawling===
Bats with this foraging style pluck insects off the surface of a body of water. [[Piscivore]]s employ the same flight style to catch fish just below the water's surface.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Trawling bats travel at slower speeds, which means that they require low wing loading.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Frugivory===
[[Frugivore]]s have below-average aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Fruit-eating bats have variable wing-loading, which corresponds to vertical stratification of rain forests.&lt;ref name="Hodgkison 2004"&gt;Hodgkison, R., Balding, S. T., Zubaid, A., &amp; Kunz, T. H. (2004). Habitat structure, wing morphology, and the vertical stratification of Malaysian fruit bats (Megachiroptera: Pteropodidae). Journal of Tropical Ecology, 20(06), 667-673.&lt;/ref&gt; Fruit-eating bats that travel below the canopy have higher wing-loading; bats that travel above the canopy have intermediate wing-loading; bats that travel in the understory have low wing-loading.&lt;ref name="Hodgkison 2004"/&gt; This pattern of decreasing wing-loading as airspace becomes more cluttered is consistent with data that suggest that lower wing-loading is associated with greater maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Nectarivory===
[[Nectarivore]]s, like gleaners, will frequently employ hovering during foraging. Hovering nectarivores are more likely to have rounded wingtips, which aids in maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores that land on the flower before feeding have worse maneuverability.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores in general have lower aspect ratios, which makes them more suited to flight in a cluttered environment.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Nectarivores that migrate to seasonal food resources, such as the genus ''[[Leptonycteris]]'', have lower wing-loading than nectarivorous species with small home ranges.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Carnivory===
Bats that consume non-insect animal prey are benefited by low wing-loading, which allows them to lift and carry larger prey items.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; This increased capacity for lift even allows them to take flight from the ground while carrying a prey item that is half of their body weight.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

===Sanguinivory===
The three species of [[Hematophagy|sanguinivorous]] bats belong to the subfamily [[Vampire bat|Desmodontinae]]. These bats are characterized by relatively high wing-loading and short or average wingspans.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The high wing-loading allows them faster flight speeds, which is advantageous when they have to commute long distances from their roosts to find prey.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[common vampire bat]] has an average aspect ratio and very short, slightly rounded wingtips.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[hairy-legged vampire bat]] has the lowest aspect ratio of the three species; it also has relatively long and rounded wingtips.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; Hairy-legged vampire bats are more adapted to maneuverable flights than the other two species.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt; The [[white-winged vampire bat]] has the highest aspect ratio of the three species, which means it is most adapted to long flights.&lt;ref name="Norberg 1987"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2815">The '''Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1207686 | pmid=8978022 | volume=144 | title=Dobzhansky, Bateson, and the genetics of speciation | journal=Genetics | pages=1331–5 | last1 = Orr | first1 = HA}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Dobzhansky-Muller Model''', is a model of the [[evolution]] of genetic incompatibility, important in understanding the evolution of [[reproductive isolation]] during [[speciation]] and the role of [[natural selection]] in bringing it about. The theory was first described by [[William Bateson]] in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=William|title=Heredity and variation in modern lights|journal=Darwin and Modern Science|year=1909|pages=85–101|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511693953.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; then independently described by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobzhansky |first=Theodosius |title=Studies on Hybrid Sterility. I. Spermatogenesis in pure and hybrid ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' |journal=Zeitschrift für Zellforschung und mikroskopische Anatomie |year=1934 |volume=21 |pages=169–221 |url=http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=k8473n7380186x54&amp;size=largest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327043844/http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=k8473n7380186x54&amp;size=largest |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= |doi=10.1007/bf00374056}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later elaborated in different forms by [[Hermann Joseph Muller|Herman Muller]],  [[H. Allen Orr]] and [[Sergey Gavrilets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Gavrilets |first=S. |title=Fitness Landscapes and the Origin of Species |year=2004 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=978-0691119830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model states that genetic incompatibility is most likely evolved by alternative fixation of two or more loci instead of just one, so that when hybridization occurs, it is the first time for some of the alleles to co-occur in the same individual. For example, imagine two populations that only recently separated geographically. Both sides are starting with the same genotype ''AABB''. One population can then evolve to ''aaBB'', through the transition state ''AaBB'', while the other evolves to ''AAbb'', through the transition state ''AABb''. During these processes, ''a'' allele will co-occur with ''A'' and ''B'' alleles, and ''b'' will co-occur with ''A'' and ''B'' alleles, without fitness consequences. When hybridization occurs, it is the first time ''a'' and ''b'' alleles co-occur, and they are the alleles that are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution|author=[[Douglas J.

'''Chalk River Laboratories''' ({{lang-fr|Laboratoires de Chalk River}}; also known as '''CRL''', '''Chalk River Labs''' and formerly '''Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories''') is a Canadian [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] research facility in [[Deep River, Ontario|Deep River]], [[Renfrew County]], [[Ontario]], near [[Chalk River]], about {{cvt|180|km}} north-west of [[Ottawa]].

CRL is a site of major research and development to support and advance nuclear technology, in particular [[CANDU reactor]] technology. CRL has expertise in physics, metallurgy, chemistry, biology, and engineering and unique research facilities. For example, [[Bertram Brockhouse]], a professor at [[McMaster University]], received the 1994 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics for his pioneering work in [[neutron spectroscopy]] while at CRL from 1950-1962.  Sir [[John Cockcroft]] was an early director of CRL and also a [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]]. CRL produces a large share of the world's supply of [[Nuclear medicine|medical radioisotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chalk River makes 1st isotopes in 15 months|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html|publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=August 18, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606061302/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned by the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories subsidiary of [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] and operated under contract by the Canadian National Energy Alliance, a private-sector consortium led by [[SNC-Lavalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marowits|first1=Ross|title=SNC-Lavalin consortium chosen to run Chalk River nuclear lab|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-consortium-chosen-to-run-chalk-river-nuclear-lab|accessdate=February 9, 2017|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=June 26, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415135343/http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-consortium-chosen-to-run-chalk-river-nuclear-lab|archivedate=April 15, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:NRX_Pile_Building_and_ZEEP_Building-_Cooling_Tanks_1945.jpg|thumb|right|NRX and Zeep buildings, Chalk River Laboratories, 1945]] The facility arose out of a 1942 collaboration between British and Canadian nuclear researchers which saw a [[Montreal Laboratory|Montreal research laboratory]] established under the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC).  By 1944 the Chalk River Laboratories were opened and in September, 1945 the facility saw the first nuclear reactor outside of the United States become operational (see [[Lew Kowarski]]).  In 1946, NRC closed the Montreal laboratory and focused its resources on Chalk River.

In 1952, [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) was created by the government to promote peaceful use of nuclear energy.  AECL also took over operation of Chalk River from the NRC.  Throughout the 1950s-2000s various nuclear research reactors have been operated by AECL for production of nuclear material for medical and scientific applications.  The Laboratories produce about one-third of the world's [[Nuclear medicine|medical isotopes]], and about half of the North American supply. Despite the declaration of peaceful use, from 1955 to 1976, Chalk River facilities supplied about 250&amp;nbsp;kg of [[plutonium]], in the form of spent reactor fuel, to the U.S. Department of Energy to be used in the production of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;letter from Dept. of Energy official, March 4, 1996, published at {{cite web |url=http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628205542/http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The bomb dropped on [[Nagasaki]], Japan, used about 6.4&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium.)

Canada's first [[nuclear power plant]], a partnership between AECL and [[Ontario Hydro|Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]], went online in 1962 near the site of Chalk River Laboratories. This reactor, [[Nuclear Power Demonstration]] (NPD), was a demonstration of the [[CANDU reactor]] design, one of the world's safest and most successful nuclear reactors.

The Deep River [[neutron monitor]] operated once in Chalk river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081714/http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1952 NRX incident===
Chalk River was also the site of two nuclear accidents in the 1950s. The first incident occurred in 1952, when there was a [[Criticality accident|power excursion]] and partial loss of coolant in the [[NRX]] reactor, which resulted in significant damage to the core. The control rods could not be lowered into the core because of mechanical problems and human errors. Three rods did not reach their destination and were taken out again by accident. The fuel rods were overheated, resulting in a meltdown. The reactor and the reactor building were seriously damaged by hydrogen explosions. The seal of the reactor vessel was blown up four feet. In the cellar of the building, some 4,500 tons of radioactive water was found. This water was dumped in ditches around 1600 meters from the border of the [[Ottawa River]]. During this accident some 10,000 [[curies]] or 370 TBq of radioactive material was released.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Nuclear Society'' (1989) [http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/nrx.html The NRX Incident by Peter Jedicke]&lt;/ref&gt; Future [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Jimmy Carter]], then a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] officer, was part of the cleanup crew.&lt;ref name="paulson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|title=Reactor Accidents: The Human Fallout|author=|date=|website=www.ccnr.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923232909/http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|archivedate=23 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|title=Jimmy Carter timeline|author=|date=|website=pbs.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329152940/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|archivedate=29 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the reactor was in use again.&lt;ref name="CNF1952"&gt;{{en icon}} ''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRX reactor in 1952?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958 NRU incident===
The second accident, in 1958, involved a fuel rupture and fire in the [[National Research Universal reactor]] (NRU) reactor building. Some fuel rods were overheated. With a robotic crane, one of the rods with metallic [[uranium]] was pulled out of the reactor vessel. When the arm of the crane moved away from the vessel, the uranium caught fire and the rod broke. The largest part of the rod fell down into the containment vessel, still burning. The whole building was contaminated. The valves of the ventilation system were opened, and a large area outside the building was contaminated. The fire was extinguished by scientists and maintenance men in protective clothing running along the hole in the containment vessel with buckets of wet sand, throwing the sand down at the moment they passed the smoking entrance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both accidents required a major cleanup effort involving many civilian and military personnel.  Follow-up health monitoring of these workers has not revealed any adverse impacts from the two accidents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }} What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|title=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section D: Safety and Liability|author=|date=|website=www.nuclearfaq.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006022038/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Anti-nuclear movement in Canada#Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility|Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility]], an [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] watchdog group, notes that some cleanup workers who were part of the military contingent assigned to the NRU reactor building unsuccessfully applied for a military disability pension due to health damages.&lt;ref name="paulson"/&gt;

Chalk River Laboratories remain an AECL facility to this day and are used as both a research (in partnership with the NRC) and production facility (on behalf of AECL) in support of other Canadian electrical utilities.

=== 2007 shutdown ===
On November 18, 2007, the NRU, which makes medical radioisotopes, was shut down for routine maintenance. This shutdown was extended when AECL, in consultation with the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC), decided to connect seismically-qualified emergency power supplies (EPS) to two of the reactor's cooling pumps (in addition to the AC and DC backup power systems already in place), which had been required as part of its August 2006 operating licence issued by the CNSC.  This resulted in a worldwide shortage of radioisotopes for medical treatments because Chalk River makes the majority of the world's supply of medical radioisotopes, including two-thirds of the world's [[technetium-99m]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402220916/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2007, the [[House of Commons of Canada]], acting on independent expert advice, passed emergency legislation authorizing the restarting of the NRU reactor and its operation for 120 days (counter to the decision of the CNSC), which was passed by the Senate and received [[Royal Assent]] on December 12. Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] criticized the CNSC for this shutdown which "jeopardized the health and safety of tens of thousands of Canadians", insisting that there was no risk, contrary to the testimony of then CNSC President &amp; CEO Linda Keen. She would later be fired for ignoring a decision by Parliament to restart the reactor, reflecting its policy that the safety of citizens requiring essential [[nuclear medicine]] should be taken into account in assessing the overall safety concerns of the reactor's operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403090931/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last=Ljunggren |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |title=Canadian parliament orders isotope reactor restart |journal=Reuters |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603180453/http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |archivedate=2009-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sunday, May 5, 2013 3:49 PM EDT Facebook Twitter RSS |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |title=Much more at stake than medical isotopes &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002154837/http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |title=Chalk River plant to begin making radioisotopes in a week - Canada - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926071822/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Citizen |first=Ottawa |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |title=Harper government fires Linda Keen over isotope crisis |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110071829/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NRU reactor was restarted on December 16, 2007.

===2008 radioactive leakage===
On December 5, 2008, [[heavy water]] containing tritium leaked from the NRU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |title=Current Issues - CNSC Report to Minister of Natural Resources regarding recent events at National Research Universal (NRU) Reactor |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055045/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |archivedate=2013-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaked water was contained within the facility, and the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC) was notified immediately, as required.

In its formal report to the CNSC, filed on December 9, 2008 (when the volume of leakage was determined to meet the requirement for such a report) [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]] mentioned that 47 litres of heavy water were released from the reactor, about 10% of which evaporated and the rest contained, but affirmed that the spill was not serious and did not present a threat to public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |title=Agency says it was told of nuke leak within hours &amp;#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604012750/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount that evaporated to the atmosphere is considered to be minor, accounting for less than a thousandth of the regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615020303/http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The public was informed of the shutdown at the reactor, but not the details of the leakage since it was not deemed to pose a risk to the public or environment.  The leak stopped before the source could be identified, and the reactor was restarted on December 11, 2008 with the approval of the CNSC, after a strategy for dealing with the leak (should it reappear) was put in place.

In an unrelated incident, the same reactor had been leaking 7,001 litres of light water per day from a crack in a weld of the reactor's reflector system.  This water has been systematically collected, purified in an on-site Waste Treatment Centre, and eventually released to the Ottawa River in accordance with CNSC, Health Canada, and Ministry of the Environment regulations.  Although the leakage is not a concern to the CNSC from a health, safety or environmental perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |title=News Releases |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229170842/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; AECL has plans for a repair to reduce the current leakage rate for operational reasons.

===2009 NRU reactor shutdown===
{{Main|National Research Universal reactor#2009 Shutdown|l1=National Research Universal reactor&amp;nbsp;— 2009 Shutdown}}
In mid-May 2009 the heavy water leak at the base of the NRU reactor vessel, first detected in 2008 (see above), returned at a greater rate and prompted another temporary shutdown that lasted until August 2010.  The lengthy shutdown was necessary to first completely defuel the entire reactor, then ascertain the full extent of the corrosion to the vessel, and finally to effect the repairs&amp;nbsp;— all with remote and restricted access from a minimum distance of 8 metres due to the residual radioactive fields in the reactor vessel. The 2009 shutdown occurred at a time when only one of the other four worldwide regular medical isotope sourcing reactors was producing, resulting in a worldwide shortage. {{citation-needed|date=December 2016}}

==NRU shutdown in March 2018==
The NRU reactor licence expired in 2016, however the licence was extended to March 31 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|title=Canada's NRU reactor in Chalk River is being turned off for good  - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409162437/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|archivedate=9 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;2018.

'''Community-supported agriculture''' ('''CSA model''') is a system that connects the producer and consumers within the [[Food systems|food system]] more closely by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms. It is an alternative socioeconomic model of [[agriculture]] and food distribution that allows the producer and consumer to share the risks of farming.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galt|first=Ryan E.|date=2013-10-01|title=The Moral Economy Is a Double-edged Sword: Explaining Farmers’ Earnings and Self-exploitation in Community-Supported Agriculture|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecge.12015/abstract|journal=Economic Geography|language=en|volume=89|issue=4|pages=341–365|doi=10.1111/ecge.12015|issn=1944-8287}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is a subcategory of [[civic agriculture]] that has an overarching goal of strengthening a sense of [[community]] through local markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Obach|first=Brian K.|last2=Tobin|first2=Kathleen|date=2014-06-01|title=Civic agriculture and community engagement|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-013-9477-z|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=307–322|doi=10.1007/s10460-013-9477-z|issn=0889-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In return for subscribing to a harvest, subscribers receive either a weekly or bi-weekly box of produce or other farm goods. This includes in-season fruits and vegetables and can expand to dried goods, eggs, milk, meat, etc. Typically, farmers try to cultivate a relationship with subscribers by sending weekly letters of what is happening on the farm, inviting them for harvest, or holding an open-farm event. Some CSAs provide for contributions of labor in lieu of a portion of subscription costs.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/csa/csadef.shtml | title=Defining Community Supported Agriculture | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture | date=September 1993 | accessdate=28 February 2015 | author=DeMuth, Suzanne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CSA is mostly used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but a variety of similar production and economic sub-systems are in use worldwide.

==History==

The term "community-supported agriculture" was coined in the northeastern United States in the 1980s, influenced by European [[biodynamic agriculture]] ideas formulated by [[Rudolf Steiner]].&lt;ref name="McFadden"&gt;[http://www.newfarm.org/features/0104/csa-history/part1.shtml "History of Community Supported Agriculture, Part 1"] (2005), Rodale Institute, accessed 05-15-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Two European farmers, Jan Vander Tuin from Switzerland and Trauger Groh from Germany, brought European biodynamic farming ideas to the United States in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt; Vander Tuin had co-founded a community-supported agricultural project named Topinambur located near Zurich, Switzerland. Coinage of the term "community-supported agriculture" stems from Vander Tuin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/PDF/csa.pdf |title=Community Supported Agriculture |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This influence led to the separate and simultaneous creation of two CSAs in 1986. The CSA Garden at Great Barrington was created in Massachusetts by [[Jan Vander Tuin]], Susan Witt, and [[Robyn Van En]].  The Temple-Wilton Community Farm was created in New Hampshire by Anthony Graham, Trauger Groh, and Lincoln Geiger.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;
[[File:Mustard Seed Farms Oregon CSA.jpg|alt=Field of lettuce and other vegetables at Mustard Seed Farms, an organic CSA in Oregon|thumb|Mustard Seed Farms, an organic CSA farm in Oregon]]

The CSA Garden at Great Barrington remained together until 1990 when many members left to form the Mahaiwe Harvest CSA. One of the original founders, Robyn Van En, became incredibly influential in the CSA movement in America and founded [[CSA North America]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt; The Temple-Wilton Community Garden was more successful and still operates as a CSA today. It became an important member of the Wilton community and it receives funding from state, federal, and local sources.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;

A parallel model called [[Teikei]] existed in Japan as early as the mid 1960s. Similarly, Dr. [[Booker T. Whatley]], a professor of agriculture in Alabama, advocated for Clientele Membership Clubs as early as the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/csas-rooted-in-black-history-zbcz1502.aspx | publisher = motherearthnews.com | title = CSAs Rooted in Black History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, community supported farms have been organized throughout North America — mainly in New England, the Northwest, the Pacific coast, the Upper-Midwest and [[Canada]]. [[North America]] now has at least 13,000 CSA farms of which 12,549 are in the US according to the US Department of Agriculture in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Full_Report/Volume_1,_Chapter_2_US_State_Level/st99_2_044_044.pdf |title=USDA 2007 Agricultural Census Table 44 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of CSAs seems to be correlated with the increase in awareness of the [[environmental movement in the United States]]. Some examples of larger and well established CSAs in the US are [[Angelic Organics]], Golden Earthworm Organic Farm &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honeybrookorganicfarm.com/index.html Honeybrook Organic Farm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523190211/http://honeybrookorganicfarm.com/index.html |date=2010-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phillies Bridge Farm]], and Roxbury Farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roxburyfarm.com/ Roxbury farm.com] Roxbury Farm&lt;/ref&gt;  CSAs have even become popular in urban environments as proven by the [[New York City Coalition Against Hunger (NYCCAH)|New York City Coalition Against Hunger]]'s own CSA program that maintains locations in all five boroughs of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyccah.org/our-work/direct-food-access/farm-fresh/farm-fresh-project Farm-fresh project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503222324/http://www.nyccah.org/our-work/direct-food-access/farm-fresh/farm-fresh-project |date=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest subscription CSA with over 13,000 families is Farm Fresh To You in [[Capay Valley]], California.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Anderson (22 August 2010). [http://bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2010/08/23/story3.html Capay farm, distributor buys West Sac warehouse.] ''Sacramento Business Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; The Québec CSA network (17 years old in 2012) is one of the larger in the world. It is a unique system where a non-profit organization reach the customers for the farmers and provide these farmers with technical support. More than one hundred farms are part of this network.  Some CSAs are used by farmers, such as [[Sugar Mountain Farm]] in Vermont, to finance improvements and new infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.uvm.edu/newfarmer/business/finance-guide/Farm-Case-Studies.pdf |chapter=Chapter 8: The “Multi-Year CSA” Financing Model Farm Case Study: Sugar Mountain Farm, West Topsham, Vt.  |title=The Guide to Financing the Community Supported Farm-Ways for Farms to Acquire Capital from Communities |publisher=University of Vermont Extension-UVM Center for Sustainable Agriculture |accessdate=2015-05-05 |year=2012 |pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the international CSA network Urgenci has been coordinating dissemination and exchange programmes that have resulted in the creation of dozens of small-scale CSA in Central and Eastern Europe.

== Socio-economic model ==
CSAs create direct connections between producers and consumers through [[alternative markets]] and the members and farmers share the risk of farming.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt;  The goals of the first CSA model in the US were to have the producer and consumer to come into the market as equals and make an exchange with fair prices and fair wages.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt;

The consumer pays for things such as transparency, environmental stewardship, producer relationships, etc. The farmers engaged in CSAs do so to fulfill goals other than income and are not compensated fairly in these exchanges.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt; This kind of market holds ‘economic rents’ where the consumer surplus comes from the consumers’ willingness to pay for something further than the product as well as for the products inputs themselves.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt; Although these markets still exist within a larger capitalist economy, they are able to exist because of the ‘economic rents’ that are collected.

==CSA system==
CSAs generally focus on the production of high quality foods for a local community, often using [[Organic farming|organic]] or [[biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic farming]] methods, and a shared risk membership–marketing structure. This kind of farming operates with a much greater degree of involvement of consumers and other stakeholders than usual — resulting in a stronger consumer-producer relationship.&lt;ref name="csa21"&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on Twenty-First Century Systems Agriculture, Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, Division on Earth and Life Sciences |title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309148962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&amp;lpg=PT227&amp;dq=CSA%20consumer%20farmer%20relationship&amp;pg=PT227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core design includes developing a cohesive consumer group that is willing to fund a whole season's budget in order to get quality foods. The system has many variations on how the farm budget is supported by the consumers and how the producers then deliver the foods. CSA theory purports that the more a farm embraces whole-farm, whole-budget support, the more it can focus on quality and reduce the risk of food waste.

===Structure===
Community-supported agriculture farms in the United States today share three common characteristics: an emphasis on community and/or local produce, share or subscriptions sold prior to season, and weekly deliveries to members/subscribers. Though CSA operation varies from farm to farm and has evolved over time, these three characteristics have remained constant.&lt;ref name="2009survey"&gt;[http://api.ning.com/files/3FyohVhrK-m5eIn2G2jfkF2vpDUXaYlfQtSpRUvy4u2WE1tMaovZ673Tnfo*fd8T3ysBa9ncJb4Z81pTNEIQUaoTvYJIe6Qs/NESAWGCSA2001.pdf 2009 Survey of Community Supported Agriculture Producers], University of Kentucky, accessed 05-15-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The functioning of a CSA also relies on four practical arrangements: for farmers to know the needs of a community, for consumers to have the opportunity to express to farmers what their needs and financial limitations are, for commitments between farmers and consumers to be consciously established, and for farmers needs to be recognized.&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;[http://www.thecenterforsocialresearch.org/sites/default/files/assests/csr/about/csa.pdf "Community Supported Agriculture"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, The Center for Social Research. Accessed 05-15-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From this base, four main types of CSAs have been developed:

* Farmer managed: A farmer sets up and maintains a CSA, recruits subscribers, and controls management of the CSA.
* Shareholder/subscriber: Local residents set up a CSA and hire a farmer to grow crops, and shareholders/subscribers control most management.
* Farmer cooperative: Multiple farmers develop a CSA program.
* Farmer-shareholder cooperative: Farmers and local residents set up and cooperatively manage a CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA"&gt;[http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/CDP-TN20.PDF "Community Supported Agriculture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823234251/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/CDP-TN20.PDF |date=2012-08-23 }}, Technotes: Office of Community Development, US Department of Agriculture, accessed 05-15-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most original CSAs, a core group of members existed.  This core group of members helped to make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions.  CSAs with a core group of members are most profitable and successful.  However, in 1999, 72 percent of CSAs did not have a core group of members.  CSAs with a core group of members operate more successfully as a farmer-shareholder cooperative and CSAs without a group of core members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs.&lt;ref name="survey1999"&gt;[http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/csaacross.pdf] "CSA Across the Nation" Center for Integrated Agricultural Services.

===Ideology===

Community-supported agriculture in America was influenced by the ideas of [[Rudolf Steiner]], an Austrian philosopher. He developed the concepts of [[anthroposophy]] and [[biodynamic agriculture]]. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm used his ideas to develop three main goals of CSAs:

* New forms of property ownership: the idea that land should be held in common by a community through a legal trust, which leases the land to farmers
* New forms of cooperation: the idea that a network of human relationships should replace the traditional system of employers and employees
* New forms of economy: that the economy should not be based on increasing profit, but should be based on the actual needs of the people and land involved in an enterprise&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;

As CSAs have increased in both number and size since they were first developed, they have also changed ideologically.  While original CSAs and some more current CSAs are still philosophically oriented, most CSAs today are commercially oriented and community-supported agriculture is predominantly seen as a beneficial marketing strategy.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt; This has led to three ideologically based types of CSAs.  The first type is instrumental, the CSA is considered a market in the traditional sense, instead of an alternative form of economy and relationship. The second type is functional; there is a relationship of solidarity between the farmer and the subscribers, but this extends mostly to social functions, not managerial or administrative functions. This is the most common type of CSA.  The final type is collaborative; this is the closest to the original aims of CSAs where the relationship between the farmer and the subscribers is seen as a partnership.&lt;ref name="Devon"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10460-008-9154-9.pdf "Devon Acres CSA: local struggles in a global food system"] (2008), retrieved 04-11-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution and marketing methods===

Shares of a CSA originally and predominantly consist of produce. In more recent years, shares have diversified and include non-produce products including eggs, meat, flowers, honey, dairy and soaps.&lt;ref name="2009survey" /&gt;  Share prices vary from CSA to CSA.  Shares are sold as full shares, which feed 2 to 5 people, and half shares, which feed 1 to 3 people.  Prices range from $200 to $500 per season.  Full shares are sold at a median of $400 and half shares are sold at a median of $250.&lt;ref name="2001summary"&gt;[http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/csa_survey_01.pdf]"Community Supported Agriculture Entering the 21st Century". Accessed 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Share prices are mostly determined by overhead costs of production, but are also determined by share prices of other CSAs, variable costs of production, market forces, and income level of the community.&lt;ref name="2009survey" /&gt; Many CSAs have payment plans and low-income options.

Shares are distributed in several different ways.  Shares are most often distributed weekly. Most CSAs allow share pick up at the farm.  Shares are also distributed through regional dropoff, direct home or office dropoff, farmers' markets, and community center/church dropoff.&lt;ref name="2009survey" /&gt; For example, the new "Farmie Markets" of upstate New York&lt;ref name="farmies"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hudsonvalley.farmiemarket.com/ | title=Farmie Markets of Upstate NY | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131110210351/http://hudsonvalley.farmiemarket.com/ | archivedate=2013-11-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; take orders online and have a number of farmers who send that week's orders to a central point in a limited region, for distribution by the organizers.

CSAs market their farms and shares in different ways.  CSAs employ different channels of marketing to diversify their sales efforts and increase subscriptions.  CSAs use local farmers' markets, restaurants, on-farm retail, wholesale to natural food stores, and wholesale to local groceries in addition to their CSAs to market shares. One problem that CSAs encounter is over-production, so CSAs often sell their produce and products in ways other than shares. Often, CSA farms also sell their products at local farmers' markets. Excess products are sometimes given to foods banks.&lt;ref name="2009survey" /&gt;

=== Challenges for farmers ===
Many CSA farmers can capitalize on a closer relationship between customers and their food, since some customers will pay more if they know where it is coming from, who is involved, and have special access to it; for more information, see [[economic rent]].&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt; However, some farmers participating in community-supported agriculture do not experience the economic benefits that they are perceived to obtain by participating in an alternative community-based arrangement. Galt's 2013 study of CSA farmers found that many farmers exploited themselves, charging lower fees and prices for their goods than would provide them with financial security.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt; This study suggested that farmers may charge less than they need to earn fair wages due to undervaluing their expenses and to offset the high costs of CSA products and make it more affordable for customers; see [[moral economy]].&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt;

'''Dip pen nanolithography''' ('''DPN''') is a [[scanning probe lithography]] technique where an [[atomic force microscope|atomic force microscope (AFM)]] tip is used to create patterns directly on a range of substances with a variety of inks.&lt;ref name="GingerZhang2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ginger|first1=David S.|last2=Zhang|first2=Hua|last3=Mirkin|first3=Chad A.|title=The Evolution of Dip-Pen Nanolithography|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=43|issue=1|year=2004|pages=30–45|issn=1433-7851|doi=10.1002/anie.200300608}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of this technique is exemplified by the use of alkane thiolates to imprint onto a gold surface.&lt;ref name="Piner1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piner|first1=R. D.|title="Dip-Pen" Nanolithography|journal=Science|volume=283|issue=5402|year=1999|pages=661–663|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.283.5402.661|pmid=9924019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique allows surface patterning on scales of under 100&amp;nbsp;[[Nano-|nano]]meters.  DPN is the [[nanotechnology]] analog of the [[dip pen]] (also called the [[quill pen]]), where the tip of an atomic force microscope [[cantilever]] acts as a "pen," which is coated with a chemical compound or mixture acting as an "ink," and put in contact with a substrate, the "paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DPN - Northwestern - Intro|url=http://sites.weinberg.northwestern.edu/mirkin-group/dip-pen-nanolithography/|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612032559/http://sites.weinberg.northwestern.edu/mirkin-group/dip-pen-nanolithography/|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DPN enables direct deposition of nanoscale materials onto a substrate in a flexible manner.  Recent advances have demonstrated massively parallel patterning using two-dimensional arrays of 55,000 tips.  Applications of this technology currently range through [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and the [[life sciences]], and include such work as ultra high density biological nanoarrays, and additive [[photomask]] repair.&lt;ref&gt;Solvent-mediated repair and patterning of surfaces by AFM:  Elhadj, Chernov, De Yoreo, Nanotechnology, 19, (2008) 105304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The uncontrollable transfer of a molecular 'ink' from a coated AFM tip to a substrate was first reported by Jaschke and Butt in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaschke | first1 = M. | last2 = Butt | first2 = H.-J. | year = 1995 | title = Deposition of Organic Material by the Tip of a Scanning Force Microscope | url = | journal = Langmuir | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1061–1064 | doi=10.1021/la00004a004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they erroneously concluded that alkanethiols could not be transferred to gold substrates to form stable nanostructures. A research group at [[Northwestern University]] led by [[Chad Mirkin]] independently studied the process and determined that under the appropriate conditions, molecules could be transferred to a wide variety of surfaces to create stable chemically-adsorbed monolayers in a high resolution lithographic process they termed "DPN".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Piner | first1 = R.

It is important to note that "liquid inks" are governed by a very different deposition mechanism when compared to "molecular inks".

==Deposition materials==

=== Molecular inks ===
Molecular inks are typically composed of small molecules that are coated onto a DPN tip and are delivered to the surface through a water meniscus.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  In order to coat the tips, one can either vapor coat the tip or dip the tips into a dilute solution containing the molecular ink.  If one dip-coats the tips, the solvent must be removed prior to deposition.  The deposition rate of a molecular ink is dependent on the diffusion rate of the molecule, which is different for each molecule.  The size of the feature is controlled by the tip/surface dwell-time (ranging from milliseconds to seconds) and the size of the water meniscus, which is determined by the humidity conditions (assuming the tip's radius of curvature is much smaller than the meniscus).  
*Water meniscus mediated (exceptions do exist)
*Nanoscale feature resolution (50&amp;nbsp;nm to 2000&amp;nbsp;nm)
*No multiplexed depositions
*Each molecular ink is limited to its corresponding substrate

==== Examples ====
*Alkane thiols written to gold
*Silanes (solid phase) written to glass or silicon

===Liquid inks===
[[File:DPN liquid deposition.png|thumb|right|Liquid ink deposition mechanism]]
Liquid inks can be any material that is liquid at deposition conditions.  The liquid deposition properties are determined by the interactions between the liquid and the tip, the liquid and the surface, and the viscosity of the liquid itself.  These interactions limit the minimum feature size of the liquid ink to about 1 micrometre, depending on the contact angle of the liquid.  Higher viscosities offer greater control over feature size and are desirable.  Unlike molecular inks, it is possible to perform multiplexed depositions using a carrier liquid.  For example, using a viscous buffer, it is possible to directly deposit multiple proteins simultaneously.
*1-10 micrometre feature resolution
*Multiplexed depositions
*Less restrictive ink/surface requirements
*Direct deposition of high viscosity materials

== Applications ==
In order to define a good DPN application, it is important to understand what DPN can do that other techniques can't.  Direct-write techniques, like contact printing, can pattern multiple biological materials but it cannot create features with subcellular resolution.  Many high-resolution lithography methods can pattern at sub-micrometre resolution, but these require high-cost equipment that were not designed for biomolecule deposition and cell culture.  Microcontact printing can print biomolecules at ambient conditions, but it cannot pattern multiple materials with nanoscale registry.

===Industrial applications===
The following are some examples of how DPN is being applied to potential products. 
[[File:Cantilever biosensor.png|thumb|right|Cantilever biosensor functionalized with 4 different proteins]]
# Biosensor Functionalization - Directly place multiple capture domains on a single [[biosensor]] device
# Nanoscale Sensor Fabrication - Small, high-value sensors that can detect multiple targets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 =  | last2 = Shi | first2 =  | year = 2008 | title = Preparation of gas sensors via DPN | url = | journal = Sensors and Actuators B | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 379–383 | doi=10.1016/j.snb.2007.11.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Nanoscale Protein Chips - High-density protein arrays with increased sensitivity

===Direct write===

DPN is a direct write technique so it can be used for top-down and bottom-up lithography applications.  In top-down work, the tips are used to deliver an etch resist to a surface, which is followed by a [[Etching (microfabrication)|standard etching process]].&lt;ref&gt;High-throughput DPN-based fabrication of Si nanostructures:  Zhang, Amro, Disawal, Elghanian, Shile, Fragala Small, 2007, 3, No. 1, 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;  In bottom-up applications, the material of interest is delivered directly to the surface via the tips.

===Unique advantages===
* Directed Placement - Directly print various materials onto existing nano and microstructures with nanoscale registry
* Direct Write - Maskless creation of arbitrary patterns with feature resolutions from as small as 50&amp;nbsp;nm and as large as 10 micrometres&lt;ref&gt;[[Maskless lithography]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biocompatible - Subcellular to nanoscale resolution at ambient deposition conditions
* Scalable - Force independent, allowing for parallel depositions&lt;ref&gt;Nature Chemistry Vol 1, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal dip pen lithography==
A heated probe tip version of Dip Pen Lithography has also been demonstrated, thermal Dip Pen Lithography (tDPL), to deposit [[nanoparticles]].&lt;ref name=Woo&gt;Woo, Dai, King &amp; Sheehan "Maskless Nanoscale Writing of Nanoparticle-Polymer Composites and Nanoparticle Assemblies using Thermal Nanoprobes" NanoLetters (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Semiconductor, magnetic, metallic, or optically active nanoparticles can be written to a substrate via this method. The particles are suspended in a PMMA or equivalent polymer matrix, and heated by the probe tip until they begin to flow. The probe tip acts as a nano-pen, and can pattern nanoparticles into a programmed structure. Depending on the size of the nanoparticles, resolutions of 78-400&amp;nbsp;nm were attained. An O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plasma etch can be used to remove the PMMA matrix, and in the case of Iron Oxide nanoparticles, further reduce the resolution of lines to 10&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=Woo/&gt; Advantages unique to tDPL are that it is a maskless additive process that can achieve very narrow resolutions, it can also easily write many types of nanoparticles without requiring special solution preparation techniques. However there are limitations to this method. The nanoparticles must be smaller than the [[radius of gyration]] of the polymer, in the case of PMMA this is about 6&amp;nbsp;nm. Additionally, as nanoparticles increase in size viscosity increases, slowing the process. For a pure polymer deposition speeds of 200&amp;nbsp;μm/s are achievable. Adding nanoparticles reduces speeds to 2&amp;nbsp;μm/s, but is still faster than regular Dip Pen Lithography.&lt;ref name=Woo/&gt;

==Beam pen lithography==
A two dimensional array of ([[Polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]]) deformable transparent pyramid shaped tips are coated with an opaque layer of metal. The metal is then removed from the very tip of the pyramid, leaving an aperture for light to pass through. The array is then scanned across a surface and light is directed to the base of each pyramid via a micromirror array, which funnels the light toward the tip. Depending on the distance between the tips and the surface, light interacts with the surface in a near-field or far-field fashion, allowing sub-diffraction scale features (100 nm features with 400 nm light) or larger features to be fabricated.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2010.161|title=Beam pen lithography|doi=10.1038/nnano.2010.161|bibcode=2010NatNa...5..637H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Common misconceptions==

===Direct comparisons to other techniques===
[[File:Sarfus.SoftLitho.Streptavidin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Streptavidin]] (4 nm thickness) deposited using microcontact printing]]
The criticism most often directed at DPN is the patterning speed.  The reason for this has more to do with how it is compared to other techniques rather than any inherent weaknesses.  For example, the [[soft lithography]] method, [[microcontact printing]] (μCP), is the current standard for low cost, bench-top micro and nanoscale patterning, so it is easy to understand why DPN is compared directly to microcontact printing.  The problem is that the comparisons are usually based upon applications that are strongly suited to μCP, instead of comparing them to some neutral application.  μCP has the ability to pattern one material over a large area in a single stamping step, just as [[photolithography]] can pattern over a large area in a single exposure.  Of course DPN is slow when it is compared to the strength of another technique.  DPN is a maskless direct write technique that can be used to create multiple patterns of varying size, shape, and feature resolution, all on a single substrate.  No one would try to apply microcontact printing to such a project because then it would never be worth the time and money required to fabricate each master stamp for each new pattern.  Even if they did, microcontact printing would not be capable of aligning multiple materials from multiple stamps with nanoscale registry.&lt;ref&gt;Mei, Y., Cannizzaro, C., Park, H., Xu, Q., Bogatyrev, S., Yi, K., Goldman, N., Langer, R. and Anderson, D., Cell-compatible, multicomponent protein arrays with subcellular feature resolution, Small, 4:  1600-1604, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The best way to understand this misconception is to think about the different ways to apply photolithography and e-beam lithography.  No one would try to use e-beam to solve a photolithography problem and then claim e-beam to be "too slow".  Directly compared to photolithography's large area patterning capabilities, e-beam lithography '''is''' slow and yet, e-beam instruments can be found in every lab and nanofab in the world.  The reason for this is because e-beam has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by photolithography, just as DPN has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by microcontact printing.

===Connection to atomic force microscopy===
DPN evolved directly from AFM so it is not a surprise that people often assume that any commercial AFM can perform DPN experiments.  In fact, DPN does not require an AFM, and an AFM does not necessarily have real DPN capabilities.  There is an excellent analogy with [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) and electron beam (E-beam) lithography.  E-beam evolved directly from SEM technology and both use a focused electron beam, but no one would ever suggest that one could perform modern [[E-beam lithography]] experiments on a SEM that lacks the proper lithography hardware and software requirements.

It is also important to consider one of the unique characteristics of DPN, namely its force independence. With virtually all ink/substrate combinations, the same feature size will be patterned no matter how hard the tip is pressing down against the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions exist when printing to soft materials – {{cite journal|last1=Maedler|first1=C.|last2=Chada|first2=S.|last3=Cui|first3=X.|last4=Taylor|first4=M.|last5=Yan|first5=M.|last6=La Rosa|first6=A.|title=Creation of nanopatterns by local protonation of P4VP via dip pen nanolithography|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=104|issue=1|year=2008|pages=014311|issn=0021-8979|doi=10.1063/1.2953090|bibcode = 2008JAP...104a4311M |url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=phy_fac}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as robust SiN tips are used, there is no need for complicated feedback electronics, no need for lasers, no need for quad photo-diodes, and no need for an AFM.

In the [[biology|biological]] context of [[organism]]s' [[regulation of gene expression|production]] of [[gene products]], '''downregulation''' is the process by which a [[cell (biology)|cell]] decreases the quantity of a cellular component, such as [[RNA]] or [[protein]], in response to an external stimulus. The complementary process that involves increases of such components is called '''upregulation.'''

An example of downregulation is the cellular decrease in the number of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] to a molecule, such as a [[hormone]] or [[neurotransmitter]], which reduces the cell's sensitivity to the molecule. This is an example of a locally acting ([[negative feedback]]) mechanism.

An example of upregulation is the response of [[liver]] cells exposed to such [[xenobiotic]] molecules as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]. In this situation, the cells increase their production of [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome P450 enzymes]], which in turn increases their degradation of these molecules.

Downregulation or upregulation of an RNA or protein may also arise by an [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] alteration.  An epigenetic alteration can be permanent or semi-permanent in a [[somatic cell]] lineage. Such an epigenetic alteration can cause expression of the RNA or protein to no longer respond to an external stimulus.  This occurs, for instance, during [[Behavioral epigenetics#Drug addiction|drug addiction]] or [[Cancer epigenetics|progression to cancer]].

== Downregulation and upregulation of receptors==
All living cells have the ability to receive and process signals that originate outside of their membranes, which they do by means of proteins called [[receptor (biology)|receptors]], usually found on a cell's surface imbedded in the plasma membrane. When such signals bind to a receptor, they effectively direct the cell to do something, such as dividing, dying, or allowing substances to be created, or to enter or exit the cell. A cell's ability to respond to a chemical message depends on the presence of receptors tuned to that message. The more receptors a cell has that are tuned to the message, the more the cell will respond to it.

Receptors are created, or expressed, by the DNA of the cell, and they can be increased, or upregulated, when the signal is weak, or decreased, or downregulated, when it is strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explain To Me: Receptor Upregulation/Downregulation|url=http://meandmymastcells.com/explain-to-me-receptor-upregulationdownregulation/|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downregulation of receptors happens when receptors have been chronically exposed to an excessive amount of a ligand, either from [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] mediators or from [[exogeny|exogenous]] drugs. This results in [[ligand]]-induced desensitization or internalization of that receptor. It is usually exhibited by various hormone receptors. Upregulation of receptors, on the other hand, results in super-sensitized cells especially after repeated exposure to an antagonistic drug or prolonged absence of the ligand.

Some [[receptor agonist]]s may cause downregulation of their respective receptors, while most [[receptor antagonist]]s temporarily upregulate their respective receptors. The disequilibrium caused by these changes often causes [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] when the long-term use of a [[drug]] is discontinued. However, the use of certain receptor antagonists may also damage receptors faster than they upregulate (internalization of receptors due to antagonism).

Upregulation and downregulation can also happen as a response to [[toxin]]s or [[hormone]]s. An example of upregulation in [[pregnancy]] is hormones that cause cells in the [[uterus]] to become more sensitive to [[oxytocin]].

== Example: Insulin receptor downregulation ==
Elevated levels of the hormone [[insulin]] in the blood trigger downregulation of the associated receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Mechanism of Ligand-induced Down-Regulation of Insulin Receptor Level in the Liver Cel|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; When insulin binds to its receptors on the surface of a cell, the hormone receptor complex undergoes [[endocytosis]] and is subsequently attacked by intracellular [[lysosomal]] [[enzymes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zaliauskiene |first=Lolita |last2=Kang |first2=Sunghyun |last3=Brouillette |first3=Christie G.|last4=Lebowitz|first4=Jacob |last5=Arani|first5=Ramin B.|last6=Collawn |first6=James F. |date=2016 |title=Down-Regulation of Cell Surface Receptors Is Modulated by Polar Residues within the Transmembrane Domain|journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2643–2655 |issn=1059-1524 |pmc=14946 |pmid=10930460|doi=10.1091/mbc.11.8.2643}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internalization of the insulin molecules provides a pathway for degradation of the hormone as well as for regulation of the number of sites that are available for binding on the cell surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpentier|first=J.-L.|title=Insulin receptor internalization: molecular mechanisms and physiopathological implications|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00400835|journal=Diabetologia|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=S117–S124|doi=10.1007/BF00400835|issn=0012-186X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At high plasma concentrations, the number of surface receptors for insulin is gradually reduced by the accelerated rate of receptor internalization and degradation brought about by increased hormonal binding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR8KAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=At+high+plasma+concentrations,+the+number+of+surface+receptors+for+insulin+is+gradually+reduced+by+the+accelerated+rate+of+receptor+internalization+and+degradation+brought+about+by+increased+hormonal+binding&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VnogHI3SFq&amp;sig=xoQF0g-csu_89HbFEpQd3PFDQb8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdm4Lu_ajQAhXH1IMKHSSTCXMQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=At%20high%20plasma%20concentrations,%20the%20number%20of%20surface%20receptors%20for%20insulin%20is%20gradually%20reduced%20by%20the%20accelerated%20rate%20of%20receptor%20internalization%20and%20degradation%20brought%20about%20by%20increased%20hormonal%20binding&amp;f=false|title=Animal Physiology: From Genes to Organisms|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|last2=Klandorf|first2=Hillar|last3=Yancey|first3=Paul|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1133709516|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] of new receptors within the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and their insertion in the plasma membrane do not keep pace with their rate of destruction. Over time, this self-induced loss of target cell receptors for insulin reduces the target cell's sensitivity to the elevated hormone concentration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This process is illustrated by the [[insulin]] receptor sites on [[target cell]]s in a person with type 2 [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fröjdö|first=Sara|last2=Vidal|first2=Hubert|last3=Pirola|first3=Luciano|date=2009-02-01|title=Alterations of insulin signaling in type 2 diabetes: A review of the current evidence from humans|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443908002081|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease|volume=1792|issue=2|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2008.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the elevated levels of blood [[glucose]] in an overweight individual, the [[beta cell|&amp;beta;-cells]] ([[islets of Langerhans]]) in the [[pancreas]] must release more insulin than normal to meet the demand and return the blood to [[homeostatic]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilcox|first=Gisela|date=2016-11-20|title=Insulin and Insulin Resistance|journal=Clinical Biochemist Reviews|volume=26|issue=2|pages=19–39|issn=0159-8090|pmc=1204764|pmid=16278749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The near-constant increase in blood insulin levels results from an effort to match the increase in blood glucose, which will cause receptor sites on the liver cells to downregulate and decrease the number of receptors for insulin, increasing the subject’s resistance by decreasing sensitivity to this hormone.{{cn|date=December 2016}} There is also a hepatic decrease in sensitivity to [[insulin]]. This can be seen in the continuing [[gluconeogenesis]] in the liver even when blood glucose levels are elevated. This is the more common process of [[insulin resistance]], which leads to adult-onset diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.diabetes.org/diabetesspectrum/00v13n3/pg132.htm|title=Protein Controversies in Diabetes|website=journal.diabetes.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example can be seen in [[diabetes insipidus]], in which the kidneys become insensitive to [[arginine vasopressin]].

==Downregulation and upregulation in drug addiction==

Family-based, adoption, and twin studies have indicated that there is a strong ( 50%) heritable component to vulnerability to substance abuse addiction.&lt;ref name="pmid29478612"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker DM, Nestler EJ |title=Neuroepigenetics and addiction |journal=Handb Clin Neurol |volume=148 |issue= |pages=747–765 |date=2018 |pmid=29478612 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-64076-5.00048-X |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially among genetically vulnerable individuals, repeated exposure to a drug of abuse in adolescence or adulthood causes addiction by inducing stable downregulation or upregulation in expression of specific genes and [[microRNA]]s through [[epigenetics|epigenetic alterations]].&lt;ref name=Nestler2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nestler EJ |title=Epigenetic mechanisms of drug addiction |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=76 Pt B |issue= |pages=259–68 |date=January 2014 |pmid=23643695 |pmc=3766384 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.04.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such downregulation or upregulation has been shown to occur in the brain’s reward regions, such as the [[nucleus accumbens]].&lt;ref name=Nestler2014 /&gt;  (See, for example, [[Epigenetics of cocaine addiction]].)

==Downregulation and upregulation in cancer==

DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid18403632"&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Kastan MB |title=DNA damage responses: mechanisms and roles in human disease: 2007 G.H.A.

Unrepaired DNA damage can increase [[mutation]]al errors during [[DNA replication]] due to error-prone [[DNA repair#Translesion sythesis|translesion synthesis]]. DNA damage can also increase [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations due to errors during DNA repair.&lt;ref name="pmid18704159"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Hagan HM, Mohammad HP, Baylin SB | title = Double strand breaks can initiate gene silencing and SIRT1-dependent onset of DNA methylation in an exogenous promoter CpG island | journal = PLoS Genet. | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = e1000155 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18704159 | pmc = 2491723 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155 | editor1-last = Lee | editor1-first = Jeannie T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17616978"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuozzo C, Porcellini A, Angrisano T, Morano A, Lee B, Di Pardo A, Messina S, Iuliano R, Fusco A, Santillo MR, Muller MT, Chiariotti L, Gottesman ME, Avvedimento EV | title = DNA damage, homology-directed repair, and DNA methylation | journal = PLoS Genet. | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e110 |date=July 2007 | pmid = 17616978 | pmc = 1913100 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to [[cancer]] (see [[Neoplasm#Malignant neoplasms|malignant neoplasms]]).

As described in [[Regulation of transcription in cancer]], epigenetic downregulation of the DNA repair gene ''[[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]]'' occurs in 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40%-90% of colorectal cancers and 50% of brain cancers.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2015&gt;Carol Bernstein and Harris Bernstein (2015). Epigenetic Reduction of DNA Repair in Progression to Cancer, Advances in DNA Repair, Prof. Clark Chen (Ed.), {{ISBN|978-953-51-2209-8}}, InTech,  Available from: http://www.intechopen.com/books/advances-in-dna-repair/epigenetic-reduction-of-dna-repair-in-progression-to-cancer&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, epigenetic downregulation of ''[[LIG4]]'' occurs in 82% of colorectal cancers and epigenetic downregulation of ''[[NEIL1]]'' occurs in 62% of [[head and neck cancer]]s and in 42% of [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small-cell lung cancer]]s.

Epigenetic upregulation of the DNA repair genes ''[[PARP1]]'' and ''[[FEN1]]'' occurs in numerous cancers (see [[Regulation of transcription in cancer]]).  ''PARP1'' and ''FEN1'' are essential genes in the error-prone and mutagenic DNA repair pathway [[microhomology-mediated end joining]].  If this pathway is upregulated, the excess mutations it causes can lead to cancer.  [[PARP1]] is over-expressed in tyrosine kinase-activated leukemias, in neuroblastoma, in testicular and other germ cell tumors, and in Ewing's sarcoma.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2015 /&gt;  [[FEN1]] is upregulated in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreas, and lung.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2015 /&gt;

In many cases, when the droplets are very small, fog bows appear white, and are therefore sometimes called ''white rainbows''. This lack of color is the feature of a fog bow that distinguishes it from a [[Glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]], which has multiple pale-colored rings caused by diffraction. When droplets forming it are almost all of the same size, the fog bow can have multiple inner rings, or supernumeraries, which are more strongly colored than the main bow.  According to [[NASA]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fogbow's lack of colors is caused by the smaller water drops&amp;nbsp;... so small that the [[wavelength]] of light becomes important. Diffraction smears out colors that would be created by larger rainbow water drops&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap061115.html APOD: 2006 November 15 - A Fog Bow Over California&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A fog bow seen in clouds, typically from an aircraft looking downwards, is called a ''cloud bow''. Mariners sometimes call fog bows ''sea-dogs''.

==Direction==
A fog bow is seen in the same direction as a rainbow, thus the sun would be behind the head of the observer and the direction of view would be into a bank of fog (which may not be noticeable in directions away from the bow itself). Its outer radius is slightly less than that of a rainbow.

When a fog bow appears at night it is called a ''lunar fog bow''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/fogmoon.htm Lunar Fogbow]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]], '''foreplay''' is a set of [[emotionally intimate|emotionally]] and [[physical intimacy|physically intimate]] acts between two or more people meant to create [[sexual arousal]] and [[sexual desire|desire]] for [[sexual activity]]. Foreplay results in physiological and mental responses in both parties in anticipation of the expected sexual activity. Either or any of the [[sexual partner]]s may indicate sexual interest and initiate foreplay, and the initiator may not be the active partner during the sexual activity. Foreplay stimulates both partners' sexuality, lowers [[Sexual inhibition|inhibition]]s and increases emotional intimacy between partners, and implies a certain level of confidence and trust between the partners. In [[animal sexual behavior]], the loose equivalent is sometimes termed 'precoital activity'.

Sexual desire is an aspect of a [[Human sexuality|person's sexuality]], which varies from one person to another. A person who desires sexual activity with another person can attempt to provoke sexual arousal in the person. Depending on the type and intensity of the relationship between the two people, the stimuli may involve indicating to the person in some subtle and romantic way that he or she has that desire or by provoking other [[erotic stimuli]]. There are many potential stimuli, both [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical]] and [[Stimulus (psychology)|mental]], which can cause a person to become sexually aroused, and which stimuli are invoked will depend on circumstances at a particular time.

On the other hand, there are other things which act as turn-offs, depending on the person's preferences. The response to an indication of sexual interest may be inhibited by issues of [[sexual morality]].

==Initiating==
[[File:Nipping the Nape.png|thumb|Foreplay by [[kissing]] on female's back]]

Foreplay can begin with one person indicating in some manner to another person a desire to engage in sexual activity with that other person. Any act that creates and enhances [[sexual desire]], interest, [[sexual stimulation|stimulation]] or arousal in a sexual partner may constitute foreplay. An indication of sexual desire can be through physical intimacy, such as [[kissing]], [[Physical intimacy|touching]], [[Hug|embracing]] or nibbling the partner. Mental engagement can also create sexual interest, such as [[flirting]], talking, whispering or [[teasing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/foreplay foreplay] cambridge.org&lt;/ref&gt; It may, for example, be a non-physical gesture that indicates sexual availability. Sexual interest can be indicated and created by [[nudity]], such as by one partner [[striptease|stripping]], or by wearing sexually suggestive clothing, or by creating a romantic, intimate, or overtly sexual atmosphere. The manual or oral touching of an [[erogenous zone]] may indicate sexual interest, as does an intimate kiss on the [[mouth]], [[breast]]s, [[stomach]], [[buttocks]], back and inner [[thigh]]s or other areas of the body. A passionate or [[French kiss]] commonly indicates sexual interest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreplaytricks.com/deep-kissing.php Foreplay Tricks To Improve Your Sexual Relations: Deep kissing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220060836/http://www.foreplaytricks.com/deep-kissing.php |date=2010-02-20 }} Retrieved on 2010-02-18&lt;/ref&gt; as does any removal of a partner's clothing.

Verbally, foreplay may include compliments, subtle comments with [[double entendre]], and intimate conversations. Non-verbally, foreplay can include provocative clothing, suggestive postures and motions, [[personal grooming|preening]] gestures, winking, licking or biting one's lips, standing inside a partner's [[personal space]], and holding a gaze longer than would be expected from only a casual interest.

Foreplay commences when the other partner indicates reciprocal sexual interest. Depending on the context, the non-objection to a partner's advances may indicate that the sexual interest is reciprocated, as may a response to a kiss or hug. The non-objection to the touching of an erogenous zone, or the taking off of an item of clothing may indicate reciprocated sexual interest. Also, the other partner may indicate reciprocal interest by engaging in intimate behaviour of their own.

There are situations which act as turn-offs or which can affect the romantic or erotic moment that may have been created. Turn-offs can range from things like bad breath, body odor, excessive noise or a reference to an ex-partner. A person's [[sexual inhibition]] can also impact on creation or maintenance of sexual interest. Some people feel uncomfortable with acts such as [[French kiss]]ing, or the possibility of someone (e.g. children) intruding, or nudity, besides other situations.

==Games==
[[Sexual role-playing]] or sex games can create sexual interest.&lt;ref name="FGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreplaygames.net |title=Fore Play Games |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games can be played in a variety of situations, and have been enhanced by technology. This type of extended foreplay can involve SMS messaging, phone calls, [[online chat]], or other forms of distance communication, which are intended to stimulate fantasizing about the forthcoming encounter. This tantalization builds up sexual tension.

A card or board game can be played for foreplay. The objective of the game is for the partners to indulge their fantasies. The loser can, for example, be required to [[strip games|remove clothing]] or give the winner a sensual [[foot massage]] or any other thing that the winner wants to try. A sensuous atmosphere can also be enhanced by candles, drinks, sensual food or suggestive clothing. Even a suggestion of the use of [[sex toys]] or the playing of games involving [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], [[sexual bondage]], [[blindfolding]] or [[sploshing]] is an indication of sexual interest.

Some couples create sexual interest by watching [[erotic]] and [[pornography|pornographic]] videos. [[Role play]]ing may involve the partners wearing [[costumes]], to create and maintain a [[sexual fantasy]]. For variety, the partners can make up a (sexual) story together. One of them starts with a sentence and then the other continues until the story becomes sexually explicit, and it provides an opportunity for the partners to express their sexual fantasies. 'Strangers for a day' is a role playing game which consists of the couple playing roles of the first meeting between them. In a public meeting place, the partners pretend to be strangers meeting for the first time. The objective is for them to [[flirt]] and [[seduce]] the other, without doing or saying anything that they normally would not do or say at a first meeting.

==Tantric==
Tantric foreplay is the first step in the lovemaking session, according to the [[tantra]] principles. [[Tantric sex]] is against rushing things for the purpose of reaching an [[orgasm]], so tantric foreplay is a way to prepare the body and the mind for the union between the two bodies. The tantric rules say that foreplay must be focused on the preparation before sexual intercourse. Tantric foreplay may include sensual baths between the two partners in a relaxing atmosphere. [[Fragrance oil]] and candles may also be used to set up the mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Van Lysebeth |first = Andre |title = Tantra: the cult of the feminine |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-81-208-1759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric foreplay is only about giving each other time to connect [[Spirituality|spiritually]] and bind. Staring at each other while in a cross-legged position and touching the other's hand palms is a usual foreplay tactic used by tantra practitioners.
Tantric foreplay may also include [[Tantra massage]]s. The massage that is applied, according to the tantric philosophy, is not for reaching orgasms but for giving each other pleasure and connecting at a spiritual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalforeplay.com/pag24.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123012018/http://mentalforeplay.com/pag24.php|archivedate=2011-11-23|title=Tantra foreplay techniques|author=Mental Foreplay online portal|date=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Foreplay is important from at least two considerations, one of which is purely physiological.&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femaleforeplay.com |title=Female Foreplay Before Intercourse |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, foreplay implies a certain level of confidence and trust between the partners and creates intimacy.

Psychologically, foreplay lowers [[Sexual inhibition|inhibitions]] and increases [[emotional intimacy]] between partners. Physically, it stimulates the process that produces [[sexual arousal]].

Foreplay has important physical and psychological effects on women. The biggest issue related to the ability of achieving orgasms is thought to be solved with the right foreplay techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreplayforwomen.net/mental.html Mental foreplay for women] Retrieved on 2010-02-24&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the subject of the effectiveness of foreplay continues to be a point of discussion. An example of this is a European survey of 2,300 women in Prague which showed that foreplay is not the key in a satisfactory sexual act. Instead "the duration of intercourse – 16.2 minutes on average – is the clincher".&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3405928/Foreplay-is-overrated-researchers-claim.html "Foreplay is overrated, researchers claim"] 2010-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Foreplay can vary dramatically based on age, religion, and cultural norms. In spite of the clichéd modern folklore that women demand more foreplay and require more time to become physically aroused, recent scientific research refutes that myth. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada used the method of [[thermography|thermal imaging]] to record baseline [[temperature]] change in the genital area as the definition of the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal and concluded that, on average, women and men spend almost the same time for sexual arousal — around 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060930094145.htm Thermal Imaging Shatters Arousal Gender Gap Myth; Study Shows Women Become Aroused As Quickly As Men]&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, does not take into account the amount of time necessary to become mentally aroused. There are hypotheses that relates foreplay as a factor which would increase fertility rates although more research is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Segura-Sampedro JJ. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987716300226 Foreplay, a selected strategy that might be able to increase fertility rates.] Medical Hypotheses (2016). {{doi|10.1016/j.mehy.2016.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There are many historical references to foreplay, with many artistic depictions. The [[History of India|Ancient Indian]] work ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' mentions different types of embracing, kissing, and marking with nails and teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessbuildersbanquet.com/software/kamasutra.pdf translation], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama205.htm biting types], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama204.htm using nails]&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions [[BDSM]] activities such as slapping and moaning as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama207.htm slapping] Kama Sutra&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Hordeum murinum in Voorhis Ecological Reserve,Cal Poly Pomona.jpg|thumb|right|''Hordeum murinum'', a common source of foxtails in many areas]]

A '''foxtail''' is a [[spikelet]] or cluster of a [[grass]], that serves to [[seed dispersal|disperse its seeds]] as a unit.  Thus, the foxtail is a type of [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspore]] or plant dispersal unit.  Some grasses that produce a foxtail are themselves called "foxtail", also "[[spear grass (disambiguation)|spear grass]]".  They can become a health hazard for [[dog]]s and other domestic animals, and a nuisance for people.

==Sources==
The name "foxtail" is applied to a number of grasses that have bushy [[Spike (botany)|spikes]] of spikelets that resemble the tail of a [[fox]]. Not all of these are hazardous; most of the hazardous ones are in the genus ''[[Hordeum]]'', and are also called "wild barley".

Grasses known as foxtails include:
* ''[[Alopecurus]]'' (foxtail grasses - the scientific name literally means "fox tail")
* ''[[Bromus madritensis]]'' (foxtail brome)
* ''[[Hordeum jubatum]]'' (foxtail barley)
* ''[[Setaria]]'' (foxtail millets)

Other grasses also produce hazardous spikelets. The spikelets are sometimes called foxtails, even though the grasses are not.

==Structure==

All foxtails have a hardened tip, sometimes called a "callus", and [[retrorse barb]]s, pointing away from the tip of the callus. Wild barleys have clusters of three spikelets, and the callus is the portion of the [[rachis]] to which they attach. In other grasses, such as [[Stipa|needlegrass]] and [[Bromus|brome]] grasses, the foxtail consists of a single spikelet, with the callus being the hardened lemma tip. Retrorse barbs can be found on the callus, the [[lemma (botany)|lemma]]s, and the [[awn (botany)|awn]]s.

The spikelets or spikelet clusters of foxtails are adapted for animal dispersal: The foxtails disarticulate easily, the barbs cause the foxtail to cling to fur, and movement of the animal causes the foxtail to burrow into the fur, since the barbs permit it to move only in the direction of the callus. In wild [[mammal]]s that inhabit the native ranges of foxtail grasses, the fur is ordinarily short enough that the foxtails will eventually become dislodged, dispersing the seed.

==Hazard==

Foxtails can become a health hazard for [[dog]]s and other domestic animals, and a nuisance for people.
In dogs and other domestic animals the foxtails can become irreversibly lodged. Foxtails can also enter the [[nostril]]s and [[ear canal]]s of many mammals. In all these cases, the foxtail can physically enter the body through muscular movements or, in the case of nostrils, air flow, can cause the foxtails to continue to burrow through [[soft tissue]]s and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], causing [[infection]] and physical disruption, which in some cases can result in death. In humans, foxtails can work through clothing, particularly fabric shoes and socks, causing discomfort to people while walking.

Foxtails are a problem beginning when the grass [[inflorescence]]s begin to disarticulate, and ending when the spikelets or spikelet clusters are mechanically abraded or incorporated into the [[soil]], [[Sod|turf]], or [[leaf litter]]. In some habitats, this can be a matter of weeks, but in others it may require months, especially if different species flower and fruit at different times during the season. 

Foxtails that have progressed no further than surface [[lesion]]s may be  removed and the lesion treated with [[antiseptic]] and [[bandage]]d if necessary. Once a foxtail has passed beneath the skin, dogs are often treated with systemic [[antibiotic]]s, and the foxtail either allowed to [[Cyst|encyst]] and degrade, or in the case of actual or imminent organ damage, removed surgically. However, surgical removal can be problematic, since foxtails cannot easily be imaged by [[x-ray]] or [[ultrasound]].  Foxtails embedded in the nostrils can migrate into the nasal [[turbinate]]s, causing intense distress, and in rare cases into the brain. Foxtails in the ear canal can puncture the eardrum and enter the middle [[ear]], causing hearing loss.

Combing of fur removes foxtails along with [[bur]]rs and other detritus, but potentially the most dangerous foxtails are found in areas easily missed: the [[axilla]]e, between the toes, and in nostrils and ear canals. Occasionally they can even lodge in the [[conjunctiva]] under the eyelid.

Many wild barley species are [[weed]]s in disturbed habitats, and their growth is encouraged by foot traffic of humans and domestic animals. Control methods consist of restricting traffic to established paths, and eradication of wild barley by mechanical removal or [[herbicide]].  Some other foxtail-producing grasses, especially needlegrasses, are dominant species in stable [[grassland]] habitats. Control attempts in these cases can actually be counterproductive, creating disturbed habitats where wild barleys may thrive.

==History==
The charity was formed in 1957 by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], a writer, former [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and a [[high church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]],&lt;ref&gt;Anglesey (2004) '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51524 Thomas, Ivor Bulmer (1905–1993)]', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Retrieved on 7&amp;nbsp;August 2010. {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became its first chairman; its executive committee included prominent politicians and architects.  Initially the charity campaigned and obtained grants for the repair and restoration of churches within its remit.  The 1968 Pastoral Measure established the Redundant Churches Fund (now called the [[Churches Conservation Trust]]), which it was thought would obviate the need for the Friends. However, the [[Church Commissioners]] turned down a number of buildings that the executive committee considered worthy of preservation, including [[Old St Matthew's Church, Lightcliffe]], and [[St Peter's Church, Wickham Bishops]]. The charity therefore decided in 1972 to change its constitution, allowing it to acquire threatened buildings either by [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] or by [[Leasehold estate|lease]].  The tower of the church at Lightcliffe was the first property to be vested with the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/about-us/early-history-of-the-friends/ |title=Early History of the Friends |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The charity raises money from a number of sources.  Since 1999, it has been recognised in Wales as the equivalent of the Churches Conservation Trust (which only covers churches in England), and as a consequence receives full funding for taking [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches into its care.  Of this, 70% comes from the State via [[Cadw]], and 30% from the [[Church in Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/special-role-in-wales/ |title=The Friends in Wales |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In England, grants are sometimes obtained from bodies such as [[English Heritage]], as in the case of [[St Mary's Church, Mundon]],&lt;ref name=mundon&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/mundon/ |title=Mundon St Mary |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise funds are raised by donations and local money-raising campaigns.  Some of the churches have been supported by the formation of local groups of Friends, such as Caldecote Church Friends,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.caldecotechurchfriends.org.uk/ |title=Caldecote Church Friends |accessdate=25 July 2010 |publisher=Caldecote Church Friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Friends of St Andrew's, Wood Walton.&lt;ref name=fww&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.woodwalton.org.uk/ |title=St Andrew's Church, Wood Walton |accessdate=25 July 2010 |publisher=The Friends of St Andrew's, Wood Walton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public can make donations, become a member of the charity, or leave a legacy in their wills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/join-us/ |title=Join Us |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition the charity administers two trusts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/about-us/church-trust-funds/ |title=Church Trust Funds |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which, the Cottam Will Trust, was established by [[S. E. Cottam|Rev&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Cottam]] for "the advancement of religion of objects of beauty to be placed in ancient [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches either in England or Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/funding-for-art/ |title=Funding For Art In Churches |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the churches owned by the charity are [[listed building]]s, and most are former [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, either from the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church in Wales]], although three were private chapels, one, the [[Strict and Particular Baptist Chapel, Waddesdon]], was a [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]] chapel,&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; and another, [[St Mary of the Angels Church, Brownshill]], was a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church.&lt;ref name=ffc/&gt; In the financial year ending 31&amp;nbsp;March 2010, the income of the charity was £475,367, and its expenditure was £509,034.&lt;ref name=charity/&gt;  The charity works closely with the [[Ancient Monuments Society]].&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;  {{As of|2016}} its patronage is vacant, following the death of the [[George Paget, 7th Marquess of Anglesey|Marquess of Anglesey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/CMSMS/index.php?page=executive-committee |title=Officers and Executive Committee |accessdate=16 July 2013 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517011452/http://www.friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/CMSMS/index.php?page=executive-committee |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013.

The '''Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz flux equation''' (or GHK flux equation or GHK current density equation) describes the ionic [[flux]] across a [[cell membrane]] as a function of the [[membrane potential|transmembrane potential]] and the concentrations of the ion inside and outside of the cell.  Since both the voltage and the concentration gradients influence the movement of ions, this process is a simplified version of ''electrodiffusion''. Electrodiffusion is most accurately defined by the [[Nernst–Planck equation]] and the GHK flux equation is a solution to the Nernst–Planck equation with the assumptions listed below

==Origin==
The American [[David E. Goldman]] of [[Columbia University]], and the English Nobel laureates [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Bernard Katz]] derived this equation.

==Assumptions==
Several assumptions are made in deriving the GHK flux equation (Hille 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;445) :
*The membrane is a homogeneous substance
*The electrical field is constant so that the transmembrane potential varies linearly across the membrane
*The ions access the membrane instantaneously from the intra- and extracellular solutions
*The permeant ions do not interact
*The movement of ions is affected by both concentration and voltage differences

==Equation==
The GHK flux equation for an ion S (Hille 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;445):

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{S} = P_{S}z_{S}^2\frac{V_{m}F^{2}}{RT}\frac{[\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\mbox{S}]_{o}\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)}{1 - \exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)} &lt;/math&gt;

where
*''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the current density (flux) across the membrane carried by ion S, measured in [[ampere]]s per square meter (A·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) 
*''P''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the permeability of the membrane for ion S measured in m·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
*''z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the valence of ion S 
*''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the transmembrane potential in [[volt]]s
*''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]], equal to 96,485 C·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or J·V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
*''R'' is the [[gas constant]], equal to 8.314 J·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
*''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]], measured in [[kelvin]]s (= degrees Celsius + 273.15)
*[S]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the intracellular concentration of ion S, measured in mol·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; or mmol·l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
*[S]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the extracellular concentration of ion S, measured in mol·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

== Implicit definition of reversal potential ==

The [[reversal potential]] is shown to be contained in the GHK flux equation (Flax 2008). The proof is replicated from the reference (Flax 2008) here.

We wish to show that when the flux is zero, the transmembrane potential is not zero. Formally it is written &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Phi_{S}\rightarrow0} V_{m}\ne0&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to writing &lt;math&gt;\lim_{V_{m}\rightarrow0} \Phi_{S}\ne0&lt;/math&gt;, which states that when the transmembrane potential is zero, the flux is not zero.

However, due to the form of the GHK flux equation when &lt;math&gt;V_{m}=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{S}=\frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a problem as the value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt; is [[indeterminate form|indeterminate]].

We turn to [[l'Hôpital's rule]] to find the solution for the limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{V_{m}\rightarrow0} \Phi_{S} = P_{S}\frac{z_{S}^2F^{2}}{RT}\frac{[V_{m}([\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\mbox{S}]_{o}\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT))]'}{[1 - \exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)]'} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[f]'&lt;/math&gt; represents the differential of f and the result is :
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{V_{m}\rightarrow0} \Phi_{S} = P_{S}z_{S}F([\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\mbox{S}]_{o})&lt;/math&gt;

It is evident from the previous equation that when &lt;math&gt;V_{m}=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{S}\ne0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;([\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\mbox{S}]_{o})\ne0&lt;/math&gt; and thus 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Phi_{S}\rightarrow0}V_{m}\ne0&lt;/math&gt;

which is the definition of the reversal potential.

By setting &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{S}=0&lt;/math&gt; we can also obtain the reversal potential :

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{S}=0=P_{S}\frac{z_{S}^2F^{2}}{RT}\frac{V_{m}([\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\mbox{S}]_{o}\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT))}{1 - \exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)}&lt;/math&gt;
which reduces to :
:&lt;math&gt;[\mbox{S}]_{i} - [\mbox{S}]_{o}\exp(-z_{S}V_{m}F/RT)=0&lt;/math&gt;
and produces the [[Nernst equation]] :
:&lt;math&gt;V_{m}=-\frac{RT}{z_{S}F}\ln\left (\frac{[\mbox{S}]_{i}}{[\mbox{S}]_{o}}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

==Rectification==
Since one of the assumptions of the GHK flux equation is that the ions move independently of each other, the total flow of ions across the membrane is simply equal to the sum of two oppositely directed fluxes.  Each flux approaches an [[asymptote|asymptotic value]] as the membrane potential diverges from zero.  These asymptotes are 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{S|i\to o} = P_{S}z_{S}^2 \frac{V_{m}F^{2}}{RT}[\mbox{S}]_{i}\ \mbox{for}\ V_{m} \gg \; 0&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{S|o\to i} = P_{S}z_{S}^2 \frac{V_{m}F^{2}}{RT}[\mbox{S}]_{o}\ \mbox{for}\ V_{m} \ll \; 0&lt;/math&gt;

where subscripts 'i' and 'o' denote the intra- and extracellular compartments, respectively.  Keeping all terms except ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; constant, the equation yields a straight line when plotting ''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; against ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is evident that the ratio between the two asymptotes is merely the ratio between the two concentrations of S, [S]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and [S]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus, if the two concentrations are identical, the slope will be identical (and constant) throughout the voltage range (corresponding to [[Ohm's law]] scaled by the surface area).  As the ratio between the two concentrations increases, so does the difference between the two slopes, meaning that the current is larger in one direction than the other, given an equal [[Force|driving force]] of opposite signs.  This is contrary to the result obtained if using Ohm's law scaled by the surface area, and the effect is called [[rectifier|rectification]].

The GHK flux equation is mostly used by [[electrophysiology|electrophysiologists]] when the ratio between [S]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and [S]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is large and/or when one or both of the concentrations change considerably during an [[action potential]].  The most common example is probably intracellular [[calcium]], [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, which during a [[cardiac action potential]] cycle can change 100-fold or more, and the ratio between [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; can reach 20,000 or more.

'''NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field''' is a [[NASA]] center, located within the cities of [[Brook Park, Ohio|Brook Park]] and [[Cleveland]] between [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and the Rocky River Reservation of [[Cleveland Metroparks]], with a subsidiary facility in [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. Its director is Janet L. Kavandi. Glenn Research Center is one of ten major NASA field centers, whose primary mission is to develop science and technology for use in aeronautics and space. {{As of|May 2012}}, it employed about 1,650 civil servants and 1,850 support contractors located on or near its site.

In 2010, the formerly on-site NASA Visitors Center moved to the [[Great Lakes Science Center]] in the [[North Coast Harbor]] area of [[downtown Cleveland]].

==History==
The installation was established in 1942 as part of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) and was later incorporated into the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] as a laboratory for aircraft engine research.

It was first named the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory after funding was approved in June 1940. It was renamed the Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory in 1947, the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (LFPL) in 1948 (after [[George W. Lewis]], the head of NACA from 1919 to 1947), and the NASA Lewis Research Center in 1958.

On March 1, 1999, the center was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. [[John Glenn]] was an American fighter pilot, astronaut, and politician.

As early as 1951, researchers at the LFPL were studying the combustion processes in [[liquid rocket]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?Ntt=tn-2349&amp;Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall | title=NACA TN-2349, Fluctuations in a spray formed by two impinging jets | publisher=[[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|6400|acre|ha|sing=on}} Plum Brook Field Station near [[Sandusky, Ohio]] is also part of Glenn ({{coord|41|20|59.4|N|82|39|01.8|W|region:US-OH_type:landmark|display=inline}}). It is located about {{convert|50|mi}} from the main campus. It specializes in very large scale tests that would be hazardous on the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/facility.html | title=NASA Glenn Test Facilities | publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226144534/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/facility.html | archivedate=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the station consisted of five major facilities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-ig-scrutinizes-seldom-used-plum-brook-test-facilities/ | title=NASA IG Scrutinizes Seldom-used Plum Brook Test Facilities | author=Dan Leone | publisher=Spacenews, Inc. | website=spacenews.com | date=April 24, 2015 | accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility: not fully functional
* Combined Effects Chamber: never used and unusable
* Cryogenic Components Laboratory: slated for demolition
* Hypersonic Test Facility
* Space Power Facility

The [[Plum Brook Reactor]] was decontaminated and decommissioned under a 2008 cost-plus-fee contract valued at more than $33.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_C08030_Plum_Brook.html | title=NASA Awards Reactor Decontamination and Decommission Contract | publisher=[[NASA]] | date=May 29, 2008 | accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility====
{{anchor|Spacecraft Propulsion Facility}}
{{main|Space Power Facility}}

The B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility is the world's only facility capable of testing full-scale, upper-stage launch vehicles and rocket engines under simulated high-altitude conditions. The Space Power Facility houses the world's largest space environment vacuum chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/plumbrook.html | title=Plum Brook Station | publisher=NASA | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511160415/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/plumbrook.html | archivedate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Icing tunnel ===
An icing tunnel is capable of simulating atmospheric icing condition to test the effect of ice accretion on aircraft wings and body as well as to test anti-icing systems for aircraft.

=== Zero Gravity Research Facility ===
{{main|Zero Gravity Research Facility}}
The Zero Gravity Research Facility is a vertical [[vacuum chamber]] used for [[microgravity]] experiments. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985. The facility uses vertical drop tests in a vacuum chamber to investigate the behavior of components, systems, liquids, gases, and combustion in such circumstances.

The facility consists of a concrete-lined shaft, {{convert|28|ft|m}} in diameter, that extends {{convert|510|ft|m}} below ground level. An aluminum vacuum chamber, {{convert|20|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|470|ft|m}} high, is contained within the concrete shaft. The pressure in this vacuum chamber is reduced to 13.3 newtons per square meter (1.3{{e|-4}}atm) before use.

After the closing of the [[Japan Microgravity Centre]] (JAMIC), the NASA Zero-G facility is the largest microgravity facility in the world.

Another, smaller drop tower remains in use. That tower has a free fall time of 2.2 seconds, and the [[Dropping In Microgravity Environment]] (DIME) program is conducted there.

===Education===

The Glenn Research Center is home to the Lewis' Educational and Research Collaborative Internship Program (LERCIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/education/LERCIP_GRC.html | title=USA.gov | publisher=NASA | date=September 29, 2013 | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides internships for high school and college students and high school teachers. The high school program is an eight-week internship for sophomores and juniors with interests in science, technology, engineering, math, or professional administration. The college level consists of a 10-week internship and is open to college students at all levels. Only residents of the Cleveland area are eligible for high school LERCIP, but college LERCIP is open to students nationwide. Interns work closely with their NASA mentors and are involved in the daily activities of the Center. They are expected to be available to work 40 hours a week for the duration of the internship. The LERCIP Teacher program is a 10-week internship for educators in STEM fields.

The [[Dropping In Microgravity Environment]] is an annual contest held yearly by the center. Teams of high school students write proposals for experiments to be performed in the Drop Tower. The winners travel to the Center, perform their experiments, and submit a research report to NASA.

==Future of Glenn==
After 2004, NASA had been shifting its focus towards space exploration as mandated by the [[Vision for Space Exploration]]. Because of this, it was perceived by some that regional NASA centers like Glenn, which focus on research and technology, were becoming more and more marginalized in terms of resources and relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cleveland.com/politics/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/opinion/1145090523129980.xml&amp;coll=2|title=Northeast Ohio|publisher=[[Cleveland.com]]|date=|accessdate=2013-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212626/http://www.cleveland.com/politics/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fopinion%2F1145090523129980.xml&amp;coll=2|archivedate=2013-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on May 13, 2006, it was announced that NASA Glenn Research Center had secured management of the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]]'s service module, which promised to generate billions of dollars and hundreds of jobs for the center.  This work secured the center's future in the near term, and signalled a shift in priority for the center from aeronautical research to space exploration, aligning itself closer with NASA's new mission.

Another change of direction created uncertainty in 2010, however, when [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] declared the end of the Vision for Space Exploration and sought to chart a new course{{clarify|date=November 2010}} for human space flight and NASA.  However, the 2015 budget for NASA made substantial increases to projects in which the Research Center participates, such as aeronautics research, planetary science and space technology, and some of that funding was expected to flow down to the Center.&lt;ref name=CCB2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Soder |first1=Chuck |title=Beefed-up budget is big development for NASA Glenn |url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20150111/SUB1/301119979/beefed-up-budget-is-big-development-for-nasa-glenn |accessdate=August 12, 2016 |agency=Crain's Cleveland Business |date=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA Glenn Visitor Center==
[[File:Skylab 3 Apollo Command Module.JPG|thumb|The Apollo Command Module of the [[Skylab 3]] mission being moved to the Great Lakes Science Center]]

The NASA Glenn Visitor Center features six galleries with interactive exhibits about NASA, space exploration, John Glenn and other astronauts, satellites and the solar system.  The center also features an auditorium for lectures, movies and special programs, and a gift shop.  Admission is free. Adult visitors must be U.S. citizens and present photo identification.

The NASA Glenn Research Center also offers public tours of its research facilities on the first Saturday of each month. Reservations must be made in advance.

The Visitor Center closed in September 2009 with many displays shifted to the [[Great Lakes Science Center]], and new ones created there.  This move was done to reduce the public relations budget and to provide easier access to the general public, especially the under-served community.  It was hoped that putting the displays at the much more visited science center will bring the NASA Glenn facility more public exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/cuyahoga/1247733104222090.xml&amp;coll=2|title=Cleveland Plain Dealer &amp;#124; Cleveland, Ohio Newspaper|publisher=cleveland.com|date=|accessdate=2013-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616174255/http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fcuyahoga%2F1247733104222090.xml&amp;coll=2|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, this proved true: compared to the 60,000 visitors per year at its former site, the Glenn Visitor Center enjoyed 330,000 visitors in the first year at the Great Lakes Science Center.  The new display area at the science center is referred to as the Glenn Visitor Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/07/nasa_glenn.html |title=NASA Glenn visitors center offers its exhibits to Great Lakes Science Center |publisher=cleveland.com |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16785">'''Green development''' is a real estate development concept that carefully considers social and environmental impacts of development. It is defined by three sub-categories: environmental responsiveness, resource efficiency, and community and cultural sensitivity. Environmental responsiveness respects the intrinsic value of nature, and minimizes damage to an ecosystem. Resource efficiency refers to the use of fewer resources to conserve energy and the environment. Community and cultural sensitivity recognizes the unique cultural values that each community hosts and carefully considers them in real estate development, unlike more discernable signs of sustainability, like [[solar energy]], (solar panels are more visibly "green" than the use of local materials). Green development manifests itself in various forms, however it is generally based on solution multipliers: features of a project that provide additional benefits, which ultimately reduce the projects' environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="RMI"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rocky Mountain Institute |title=Green Development: Integrating Ecology and Real Estate |date=1998 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |isbn=9780471188780}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-8}}

== History ==
Green development emerged as a result of the environmental movement in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kline |first1=Benjamin |title=First Along the River: A Brief History of the U.S. Environmental Movement |date=2011 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the real estate industry, use of the term commenced in 1987 with a report from the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], entitled "Our Common Future". The report includes 16 principles of environmental management, designed to foster green development. It also discusses the traditional model of macroeconomic growth, and its disregard for environmental consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future |date=1987 |publisher=WCED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this initial movement, the real estate industry experienced a back-and-forth relationship with "green" methodologies; environmental issues often came second behind purely economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=Jonathan |last2=Goodwin |first2=Neva |title=Reconciling Growth and the Environment |journal=Global Development and Environment Institute, Tufts University |date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incessant environmental concern and legislation affecting the real estate sector began to emerge, i.e. Green development.&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt; However, a common concern of green development is that it may increase project costs and completion times. Hence there has been an ongoing argument of whether green strategies can be [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] as well as economically stimulating.&lt;ref name="Zotter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zotter Jr. |first1=Frank |title=Legal Aspects of Real Estate |date=2016 |publisher=Ashley Crown Systems Inc. |location=Laguna Hills, CA |page=137 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|137}} National environmental attention has since worked its way down to real estate developers, and become an increasing priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CBRE Surpasses 300 Leed-Certified Buildings |url=http://www.cbre.com/about/media-center/300-leed-certified-buildings |publisher=CBRE Group, Inc. |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers today must work within the parameters of legislation that now considers the environmental implications of development.&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|134}}

== Legislation ==
In response to increasing public concern regarding environmental issues, governments have enacted legislation that regulates various aspects of the real estate industry, as well as other sectors of the economy. In the United States such legislation includes the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]], and the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA; also known as "Superfund."). NEPA, enacted in 1970, changed how federal agencies made decisions because it required them to propose environmental analysis before starting a project. The Clean Air Act (1970) requires the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to set national standards for clean air and pollution control regulations. The Clean Water Act (1972) was designed to minimize pollution in natural bodies of water, and also to ensure water quality that protects [[drinking water]] sources and supports recreational activities such as fishing or swimming. The Coastal Zone Management Act (1972) manages the nation's coastal resources such as Great Lakes and estuaries. CERCLA is commonly referred to as "Superfund" because it comprises two trust funds that provide help to improve areas that have been polluted by hazardous waste. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 allows the government to lien a property that is being cleaned up. Additionally, the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA) is California's most comprehensive piece of legislation regarding the environment.  This act applies to all decisions made by cities and counties in California, and includes the mandate of an [[Environmental impact statement|Environmental Impact Report]] (EIR), to both public and private projects. Subsequently, any new real estate development is subject to a detailed environmental analysis before starting a project.&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|133–135}}

California's Senate Bill (SB) 375 (2008) is another piece of legislation that promotes green development. It aims to achieve California's climate goals via more efficient land use and development patterns. More specifically, [[Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008|SB 375]] seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through close coordination between land-use and transportation. One way this is achieved is through demand-side measures. This strategy would decrease [[Traffic calming|driving]] demand, and therefore reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and ultimately reduce GHG emissions. For example, a demand-side policy component may include placing public transit stops near development, in order to maximize walkability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barbour |first1=Elisa |last2=Deakin |first2=Elizabeth |title=Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection: Evaluating California's Senate Bill 375 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, California state law requires minimum energy conservation levels for all new and/or existing development projects. The seller of a home is required to include information regarding energy conservation retrofitting and thermal insulation in the sales contract.&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|133}}

== In practice ==
=== Broad development patterns ===
Senate Bill 375 demonstrates an urban planning strategy called [[Smart growth|growth management]]. It is defined by a close coordination between land-use controls and capital investment and heavily motivated by environmental issues. It is defined by "the regulation of the amount, timing, location, and character of development."&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levy |first1=John |title=Contemporary Urban Planning |date=2011 |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Growth Management, Smart Growth, and Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name may suggest, growth management may not imply limiting any growth. "Growth control" carries the connotation of managing or limiting growth, and "no growth" would indicate stopping growth all together. Moreover, Growth Management requires the cooperation of all three of these connotations.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

Urban Growth Boundaries (UBG's), are popular growth management strategies. They are designed to encourage growth within a given boundary and discourage it outside the boundary. The goal of the UGB is to promote dense development, in order to decrease urban sprawl.  This growth management technique ultimately seeks to revitalize central cities, and create vibrant, walk-able spaces for community development.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

These clustered development patterns are solution multipliers. Reducing demand for infrastructure can save money and resources. These multipliers can increase walkability, which fosters social interaction and community togetherness.&lt;ref name="RMI"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Intelligent building ===
In the US, commercial and residential buildings are the highest consumers of electricity and [[HVAC]] systems comprise a large portion of this usage. In fact, the US Department of Energy projects that 70% of the electricity used in the US is from buildings. [[Building automation|Intelligent building]] methods such as occupancy detection systems, wireless sensor networks, and HVAC control systems aim to more efficient energy usage. A team of researchers at the University of San Diego, project that their smart building automation systems will save 10–15% in building energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Agarwal |first1=Yuvraj |last2=Balaji |first2=Bharathan |last3=Gupta |first3=Rajesh |last4=Lyles |first4=Jacob |last5=Wei |first5=Michael |last6=Weng |first6=Thomas |title=Occupancy-Driven Energy Management for Smart Building Automation |url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1880000/1878433/p1-agarwal.pdf?ip=128.32.10.164&amp;id=1878433&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=CA367851C7E3CE77%2E3158474DDFAA3F10%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=692426707&amp;CFTOKEN=70191412&amp;__acm__=1478802161_2b8c437d09c8f14813b66c266db3d0ed |publisher=BuildSys |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==
=== The Holly Street Village Apartments ===
The city of [[Pasadena, California]] has recently adopted a general plan based on seven guiding principles: community needs and quality of life, preservation of Pasadena's historic character, economic vitality, a healthy family community, lack of need for automobiles, promoted as a cultural, scientific, corporate, entertainment and educational center for the region, and community participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City of Pasadena Comprehensive General Plan |url=http://ww2.cityofpasadena.net/planning/deptorg/commplng/GenPlan/pdf/LandUseElement_110804.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project included environmental concern and social considerations in the process of construction. The Holly Street Village Apartments in Pasadena address several of the principles outlined in Pasadena's general plan. It incorporates mixed-use development with ground-floor retail center including a deli, a convenience store and an art gallery. Also, the Holly Street Village Apartments is located near a light rail station. The goal of these strategies is to reduce the demand for automobiles, and making it easier for people to use public transportation.&lt;ref name="RMI"/&gt;{{rp|80}}

=== Inn of the Anasazi ===
Zimmer Associates International, a real estate development firm, completed the Inn of the Anasazi in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in 1991. Robert Zimmer (co-founder) and his partners, Steve Conger and Michael Fuller, set a goal to construct a building that would, "showcase energy- and resource-saving technologies, strengthen local community, offer first class elegance, and financially reward its participants."&lt;ref name="RMI"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The interior design of the hotel pays respect to the ancient Anasazi Indians, including locally crafted furniture, hand-made rugs, and Native American, Hispanic and cowboy wall art. The use of adobe on the exterior of the hotel includes the historic pueblo style. Also, Zimmer and his partners repurposed a steel-framed building that had previously been used in the 1960s as a juvenile detention center, instead of starting the project from the beginning. Other "green" characteristics of this Santa Fe hotel are skylights, energy-efficient lighting, and water-saving fixtures. Also, the Inn of the Anasazi stimulates the regional economy by purchasing locally grown organic food from Hispanic farmers. Lastly the Inn encourage that the staff participate in local nonprofit organizations and events that sponsor diverse local cultures. The Inn of the Anasazi integrates "social and environmental goals with financial considerations…"&lt;ref name="RMI"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

=== Taipei 101 ===
[[Taipei 101]], stylized as TAIPEI 101, is a {{convert|1667|ft|m}} tall skyscraper located in [[Taipei, Taiwan]] which has received [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] as the highest score in history. In this project, "TAIPEI" is an acronym for "technology," "art," "innovation," "people," "environment," and "identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TAIPEI 101 Receives LEED v4 Certification from U.S. Green Building Council as All-Time Top Scorer |url=http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/en/news-detail.aspx?cid=598|website=Taipei 101 |publisher=Taipei Financial Center Corp. |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hubert Keiber, CEO of Siemens Building Automation in Taipei, stresses energy efficiency on the grounds that energy is the single largest expense for commercial buildings. Since 2011, the Taipei 101 has become the world's most environmentally responsible skyscraper, reducing water use, energy use, and carbon emissions all by 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keiber |first1=Hubert |title=Taipei 101: Responsibility in Counteracting Global Warming |url=https://www.downloads.siemens.com/download-center/Download.aspx?pos=download&amp;fct=getasset&amp;id1=A6V10343478 |publisher=Siemens AG |location=Taipei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boulder, Colorado ===
Growth management/limitation (discussed previously) manifests itself in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. The city of Boulder very tightly restricts housing development by limiting housing permits to 400 per year, which is 1 percent of the city's total housing stock. Additionally, the city has purchased land outside of the city limits, designated for permanent, green open space. This 400-unit cap seriously hinders population growth in the city.

This shortage of housing has several repercussions. First, it increases housing prices. Also, because Boulder restricts housing development more than it does commercial development, the number of available workers in Boulder grows faster than the housing stock.  This results in many workers who commute from beyond the city limits.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

== Controversy ==
A common critique of green development is that it negatively affects the way real estate developers do business, as it can increase cost and create delay.&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|137}} For example, becoming LEED-certified can contribute to additional costs. This includes additional building design and construction fees, interior design and construction fees, building operations and maintenance fees, neighborhood development fees, home and campus fees, and volume program fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LEED Certification Fees |url=http://www.usgbc.org/cert-guide/fees |publisher=US Green Building Council |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, green development has been critiqued on a residential level. High-performance homes have proven to save energy in the long run, but they rapidly increase up-front capital costs, via tankless water heaters, radiant barriers and reflective insulation systems, and high efficiency air conditioning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Widder |first1=SH |last2=Kora |first2=AR |last3=Baechler |first3=MC |last4=Fonorow |first4=KD |last5=Jenkins |first5=DW |last6=Stoer |first6=DJ |title=Transitioning to High-Performance Homes: Successes and Lessons Learned From Seven Builders |publisher=US Department of Energy |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, developers are often unable to develop on certain portions of land due to conservation [[easement]]s. These easements are purchased by governments or non-governmental organizations, in order to "preserve land in its natural, scenic, agricultural, historical, forested, or open-space condition."&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|132}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9589">{{short description|The identification of present hazards as the first step in a process to assess risk }}
{{technical|date=March 2013}}
Note: Parts of this article are written from the perspective of aircraft safety analysis techniques and definitions; these may not represent current best practice and the article needs to be updated to represent a more generic description of hazard analysis and discussion of more modern standards and techniques.

A '''hazard analysis''' is used as the first step in a process used to assess [[risk]]. The result of a hazard analysis is the identification of different type of hazards. A [[hazard]] is a potential condition and exists or not (probability is 1 or 0). It may in single existence or in combination with other hazards (sometimes called events) and conditions become an actual Functional Failure or Accident (Mishap). The way this exactly happens in one particular sequence is called a scenario. This scenario has a probability (between 1 and 0) of occurrence. Often a system has many potential failure scenarios. It also is assigned a classification, based on the worst case severity of the end condition. Risk is the combination of probability and severity. Preliminary risk levels can be provided in the hazard analysis. The validation, more precise prediction (verification) and acceptance of risk is determined in the [[Risk assessment]] (analysis). The main goal of both is to provide the best selection of means of controlling or eliminating the risk. The term is used in several engineering specialties, including [[avionics]], [[process engineering|chemical process safety]], [[safety engineering]], [[reliability engineering]] and [[food safety]].[http://www.unisdr.org/eng/library/lib-terminology-eng%20home.htm]

==Hazards and risk==
A hazard is defined as a "Condition, event, or circumstance that could lead to or contribute to an unplanned or undesirable event."  Seldom does a single hazard cause an accident or a functional failure. More often an accident or operational failure occurs as the result of a sequence of causes. A hazard analysis will consider system state, for example operating environment, as well as failures or malfunctions.

While in some cases, safety or reliability risk can be eliminated, in most cases a certain degree of risk must be accepted. In order to quantify expected costs before the fact, the potential consequences and the probability of occurrence must be considered. Assessment of risk is made by combining the severity of consequence with the likelihood of occurrence in a matrix. Risks that fall into the "unacceptable" category (e.g., high severity and high probability) must be mitigated by some means to reduce the level of safety risk.

IEEE STD-1228-1994 Software Safety Plans prescribes industry best practices for conducting software safety hazard analyses to help ensure safety requirements and attributes are defined and specified for inclusion in software that commands, controls or monitors critical functions. When software is involved in a system, the development and design assurance of that software is often governed by [[DO-178B]]. The severity of consequence identified by the hazard analysis establishes the criticality level of the software. Software criticality levels range from A to E, corresponding to the severity of Catastrophic to No Safety Effect. Higher levels of rigor are required for level A and B software and corresponding functional tasks and work products is the system safety domain are used as objective evidence of meeting safety criteria and requirements.

Recently a leading edge commercial standard was promulgated based on decades of proven system safety processes in DoD and NASA. ANSI/GEIA-STD-0010-2009 (Standard Best Practices for System Safety Program Development and Execution) is a demilitarized commercial best practice that uses proven holistic, comprehensive and tailored approaches for hazard prevention, elimination and control. It is centered around the hazard analysis and functional based safety process.

{| class=wikitable
! Severity !! Definition
|-
| Catastrophic
| Results in multiple fatalities and/or loss of the system
|-
| Hazardous
| Reduces the capability of the system or the operator ability to cope with adverse conditions to the extent that there would be:
* Large reduction in safety margin or functional capability
* Crew physical distress/excessive workload such that operators cannot be relied upon to perform required tasks accurately or completely
* Serious or fatal injury to small number of occupants of aircraft (except operators)
* Fatal injury to ground personnel and/or general public
|-
| Major
| Reduces the capability of the system or the operators to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be:
* Significant reduction in safety margin or functional capability 
* Significant increase in operator workload
* Conditions impairing operator efficiency or creating significant discomfort
* Physical distress to occupants of aircraft (except operator) including injuries
* Major occupational illness and/or major environmental damage, and/or major property damage
|-
|Minor
| Does not significantly reduce system safety. Actions required by operators are well within their capabilities. Include:
* Slight reduction in safety margin or functional capabilities
* Slight increase in workload such as routine flight plan changes
* Some physical discomfort to occupants or aircraft (except operators)
* Minor occupational illness and/or minor environmental damage, and/or minor property damage
|-
| No Safety Effect
| Has no effect on safety
|}

==Likelihood of occurrence==
{| class=wikitable
! Likelihood !! Definition
|-
| Probable
| 
* Qualitative: Anticipated to occur one or more times during the entire system/operational life of an item.
* Quantitative: Probability of occurrence per operational hour is greater than &lt;math&gt;1 \times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Remote
| 
* Qualitative: Unlikely to occur to each item during its total life. May occur several times in the life of an entire system or fleet.
* Quantitative: Probability of occurrence per operational hour is less than &lt;math&gt;1 \times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;, but greater than &lt;math&gt;1 \times 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Extremely Remote
| 
* Qualitative: Not anticipated to occur to each item during its total life. May occur a few times in the life of an entire system or fleet.
* Quantitative: Probability of occurrence per operational hour is less than &lt;math&gt;1 \times 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; but greater than &lt;math&gt;1 \times 10^{-9}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Extremely Improbable
| 
* Qualitative: So unlikely that it is not anticipated to occur during the entire operational life of an entire system or fleet.
* Quantitative: Probability of occurrence per operational hour is less than &lt;math&gt;1 \times 10^{-9}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Hostmaster Pattern''' was manufactured by [[New Martinsville Glass Company]] (which later became [[Viking Glass]] Company) during the 1930s. Though the line was extensive, New Martinsville Hostmaster Pattern is one of the lesser known patterns of [[Elegant Glass]].&lt;ref name="NMG"&gt;Measell, James, Everett R. Miller, Everett R. Miller, and Addie R. Miller. New Martinsville Glass, 1900–1944. Marietta, Ohio: Antique Publications, 1994.

==Quality==
Many of the pieces in this pattern are made from a 3 or 4 part mold. All pieces have been fire-polished after being pressed. The surface of the pieces are smooth and glossy. They have few air bubbles and when held up to the light, there are not many ripples or irregularities. The bases of the tumblers and plates have been hand ground down allowing them to lay flat. The creamer, sugars, tea cup, decanter, and ice bucket do not have a ground base.&lt;ref&gt;"Depression Glass, Elegant Glass and Depression Glass Manufacturers | Just Glass Online."

{{Emotion}}

'''Humiliation''' is the abasement of [[pride]], which creates mortification or leads to a state of being [[Humility|humbled]] or reduced to lowliness or [[submission]]. It is an emotion felt by a person whose [[social status]], either by force or willingly, has just decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Neel.  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201408/the-psychology-humiliation "The Psychology of Humiliation."] ''Psychology Today''.  27 August 2014.  10 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be brought about through  [[intimidation]], physical or mental [[mistreatment]] or trickery, or by [[embarrassment]] if a person is revealed to have committed a socially or legally unacceptable act. Whereas [[humility]] can be sought alone as a means to de-emphasize the ego, humiliation must involve other person(s), though not necessarily directly or willingly. 

Humiliation is currently an active research topic, and is now seen as an important – and complex – core dynamic in human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], having implications at intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional and international levels.&lt;ref name=Lindner&gt;Lindner, Evelin, Making Enemies: Humiliation and International Conflict. London, England: Praeger Security International, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
A person who suffers from severe humiliation could experience [[Major depressive disorder|major depressions]], suicidal states, and severe anxiety states such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of status, like losing a job or being labeled as a liar or discredited unfairly, could cause people inability to behave normally in their communities. Humiliated individuals could be provoked and crave for revenge, and some people could feel worthless, hopeless and helpless, creating suicidal thoughts if justice is not met. It also can lead to new insights, activism and a new kinship with marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Torres |first=Walter J. |last2=Bergner |first2=Raymond M. |date=June 2010 |title=Humiliation: Its Nature and Consequences |url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/2/195.full |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]] |publisher=AAPL |volume=38 |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feelings of humiliation can produce 'humiliated fury'&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helen B. 1971, ''Shame and Grief in Neurosis.'' New York: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which, when turned inward can result in [[apathy]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and when turned outward can give rise to [[paranoia]], sadistic behaviour and fantasies of revenge. Klein explains, "When it is outwardly directed, humiliated fury unfortunately creates additional victims, often including innocent bystanders ... . When it is inwardly directed, the resulting self-hate renders victims incapable of meeting their own needs, let alone having energy available to love and care for others." He goes on to say, "In either case, those who are consumed by humiliated fury are absorbed in themselves or their cause, wrapped in wounded pride..."&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt; 

A study by researchers at the University of Michigan revealed that “the same regions of the brain that become active in response to painful sensory experiences are activated during intense experiences of social rejection.” In other words, humiliation and isolation are experienced as intensely as physical pain.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;[http://www.onbeing.org/blog/the-violence-of-humiliation/6753 Martin, Courtney E. "The Violence of Humiliation", ''On Being'', September 10, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishments and interrogation tactics==
[[File:Garotte - Excerpt from Pedro Berruguete - Saint Dominic Presiding over an Auto-da-fe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Non-trinitarian]] [[Cathars]] being burnt at the stake in an ''[[auto-de-fé]]'' (c. 1495, with [[garrote]] and [[phallus]]), presided over by [[Saint Dominic]], oil on panel by [[Pedro Berruguete]].]]

Humiliating of one person  by another (the humiliator) is often used as a way of asserting power over them, and is a common form of [[oppression]] or [[abuse]] used in a [[Police abuse|police]], military, or [[Prisoner abuse|prison]] context during legal interrogations or illegal [[torture]] sessions. Many now-obsolete public [[punishment]]s were deliberately designed to be humiliating, e.g. [[tarring and feathering]] lawbreakers, [[pillory]], "[[mark of shame]]" ([[social stigma|stigma]]) as a means of "making an example" of a person and presenting a deterrent to others. Some practices, such as tarring and feathering, became tools of unofficial mob justice. In folk customs such as the English [[Skimmington|skimmington rides]] and [[rough music]] (and their continental equivalents, such as the French [[Charivari]]), dramatic public demonstrations of moral disapproval were enacted to humiliate [[Norm (social)|transgressors]] and drive them out of the community.&lt;ref name="Thompson1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = E.

Some U.S. states have experimented with humiliating or [[shaming]] lawbreakers by publishing their names and indicating their offense (e.g., with soliciting prostitutes or drinking and driving). In 2010, there was public outcry about reports showing police in [[Dongguan]] and [[Guangdong]] in China leading a parade of arrested prostitutes for the purpose of humiliating them. The national [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] reprimanded the local police and affirmed that such punishments are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20100727/100816.shtml|title=Prostitute humiliation dents police image|first=Ning|last=Zhang|date=2010-07-27|accessdate=2012-01-19|publisher=[[China Network Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A wider human perspective==
[[Image:The Humiliation of Emperor Valerian by Shapur, King of Persia, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''The Humiliation of [[Valerian (emperor)|Emperor Valerian]] by [[Shapur I|Shapur]], King of Persia'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].]]

Donald Klein described humiliation as "a powerful factor in human affairs that has, for a variety of reasons, been overlooked by students of individual and collective behavior. It is a pervasive and all too destructive influence in the behavior of individuals, groups, organizations, and nations."&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Klein, Donald C. (Ed.), ''The Humiliation Dynamic: Viewing the Task of Prevention From a New Perspective'', Special Issue, Journal of Primary Prevention, Part I, 12, No. 2, 1991. New York, NY: Kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is a subjective emotion, humiliation has a universal aspect which applies to all human beings: "it is the feeling of being put down, made to feel less than one feels oneself to be."&lt;ref name=Lindner /&gt;

A [[society]] that suffers from humiliation is an unstable one.  The [[cognitive dissonance]] between the way in which the society is perceived and the way in which it sees itself can be so great that violence can result on a massive scale against people belonging to an [[out group]].  According to [[Jonathan Sacks]], "By turning the question 'What did we do wrong?' into 'Who did this to us?', [hate against an out group] restores some measure of self-respect and provides a course of action.  In psychiatry, the clinical terms for this process are splitting and projection; it allows people to define themselves as victims."&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Jonathan.  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-return-of-anti-semitism-1422638910 "The Return of Anti-Semitism."] ''The Wall Street Journal''.  30 January 2015.  19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
At the late of 1970s, Egypt was motivated to build eight [[nuclear power plant]]s and to develop experience at the back end of a [[nuclear fuel cycle]] and was concluded several contracts with an unnamed foreign company to build the Hydrometallurgy Pilot Plant (HPP).&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

HPP was originally designed as a [[nuclear reprocessing]] facility,&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;&lt;ref name=ffi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gabrielsen|first1=Andreas|title=Drivers of nuclear weapons proliferation in Egypt and Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/13-02307.pdf|website=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]]|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1982, the second laboratory became operational.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;

== Overview ==
The HPP consists of three laboratories, the first laboratory consists of three hot cells (modules 1-3)&lt;ref name=nti /&gt; with the first module, is [[radiation protection|shielded]] [[alpha particle]] cell dedicated for mechanical shearing of research reactor fuel, it was unfinished due to the inability to secure the necessary export licence for the shearing equipment from the foreign vendor. The second module, is dissolver and [[mixer-settler]]s for first stage fission product separation. The third module, was designed for [[radioactive waste#Vitrification|waste vitrification]] with no equipment had been installed.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

The second laboratory contains two modules, module 4, whish is a [[Lead shielding|lead shielded]] [[glove box]] for second stage fission product separation using mixer settlers, while module 5, is an unshielded glove box for the separation of plutonium from uranium.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

The third laboratory consists of two connected glove box lines suitable for plutonium chemistry but which contain no equipment.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

HPP possess a minor plutonium processing capacity and unable to reprocess and extract [[weapons-grade#Weapons-grade plutonium|weapons-grade plutonium]] from the spent fuel of the research reactors due to the inability to complete the facility,&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blanc|first1=Alexis|last2=Roberts|first2=Brad|title=Nuclear Proliferation: A Historical Overview|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA482642|publisher=[[Institute for Defense Analyses]]|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Egypt decided to use one cell of the HPP within the framework of a project for the management of unused and orphan radioactive sealed sources,&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt; which provides Egypt with the research capabilities on the back-end of nuclear fuel cycle.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;

== Undeclared nuclear materials and activities ==
{{main|Nuclear program of Egypt#Undeclared nuclear activity}}
In early 2001, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) detected particles of [[actinides]] and [[nuclear fission product|fission products]] near the HPP facility, which shed light on the existence of the HPP.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=mef /&gt;

In November 2004 and January 2005, Egypt declared that, in 1987, it had carried out [[acceptance test]]s in the HPP using unirradiated [[uranyl nitrate]] in chemical reagents purchased from the local market while the uranyl nitrate had been mixed with a solution obtained from the dissolution of domestically produced scrap [[UO2]] pellets (with 1.9&amp;nbsp;kg of uranium compounds). Egypt rationalized that it did not inform the IAEA about the facility, materials nor their use in the tests as the HPP never completed and it was designed for bench scale radiochemistry experiments, while Egypt should declared the HPP to the Agency as early as possible prior to the introduction of nuclear material into the facility, according to the [[IAEA safeguards|Safeguards Agreement]] which came into forece in 1982.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt; Therefore, Between 2004 and 2006, Egypt had submitted design information for the HPP and had provide inventory change reports (ICRs) with respect to the acceptance tests.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;

In 2009, The IAEA's Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR) for 2008, concludes that earlier issues of undeclared nuclear activities and material reported to the [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors]] in February 2005 are no longer outstanding.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4257">'''Integration Driven Development (IDD)''' is an [[Incremental and iterative development|incremental]] approach to systems development where the contents of the increments are determined by the integration plan, rather than the opposite. The increments can be seen as defined system capability changes - "Deltas" (Taxén et al., 2011).
The advantages compared to other incremental development models ( such as [[Rational Unified Process|RUP]] and [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]]) still apply, such as short design cycles, early testing and managing late requirement changes, however IDD adds ''pull'' to the concept and also has the advantage of optimizing the contents of each increment to allow early integration and testing.
== Pull from integration and testing ==
Pull, in this context, means that information is requested from the user when needed (or is planned to be integrated and tested), as opposed to delivered when it happens to be ready. Development planning has to adjust to the optimal order of integration. 
System implementation is driven by what is going to be integrated and tested. System design, in turn is driven by the planned implementation and requirements by the planned system design steps. By doing so, artifacts will be delivered just-in-time, thus enabling fast feedback.

[[File:Integrationd Driven Development - Pull.png|none|600px]]

== Advantages and Limitations ==
IDD is not used instead of other incremental models, but rather as an enhancement that will make those models more efficient. 
One obstacle when using IDD is to create the integration plan – the definition of what to develop and integrate at a given time. One way that has proven successful is to use [[System anatomy|System Anatomies]] for original planning  and [[Project anatomy|Integration Anatomies]] for re-planning and follow-up.
Since all planning will require time and resources IDD may be considered unnecessary for development with low complexity of the system and organization (i.e., small teams developing small systems).

'''Jean-Baptiste Chavannes''' (born 1947 in Haiti), educated as an [[agronomist]].

==Biography==
Chavannes founded the Peasant Movement of Papay (MPP) in 1973 to teach Haitian principles of [[sustainable agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/04/22/nijhuis-jean-baptiste/ Jean Baptiste Chavanne]&lt;/ref&gt; The MPP has become one of the most effective [[peasant movement]]s of Haiti's history, succeeding in terms of economic development, environmental protection and the survival of each.

Chavannes continues his work despite the [[politics of Haiti|political climate in Haiti]], which remains unstable. He has been exposed to several assassination attempts during periods of political destabilization in Haiti.&lt;ref name=goldman-jean-baptiste/&gt; Death threats have forced into exile between 1993 and 1994. He received the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in 2005 for his work on [[forest protection]].&lt;ref name=goldman-jean-baptiste&gt;{{cite web

(eds.). (2010). Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences. Vol. 1-7. CRC Press, Boca Raton, USA. Also available as an electronic source.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Library and Information Sciences is the name used in the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] for class 20 from the 18th edition (1971) to the 22nd edition (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; or as "'''library and information studies'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada Library School University Programs|url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Universities/Programs/Library_School.html|website=www.canadian-universities.net|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a merging of [[library science]] and [[information science]]. The joint term is associated with schools of library and information science (abbreviated to "SLIS"). In the last part of the 1960s, [[library school|schools of librarianship]], which generally developed from professional training programs (not academic disciplines) to university institutions during the second half of the 20th century, began to add the term "information science" to their names. The first school to do this was at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, T. J. (1977). Pittsburgh. University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Library and Information Sciences. IN: Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science (Vol. 22). Ed. by A. Kent, H. Lancour &amp; J.E.Daily. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc. (pp. 280–291)&lt;/ref&gt; More schools followed during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1990s almost all library schools in the USA had added information science to their names.
Weaver Press:
Although there are exceptions, similar developments have taken place in other parts of the world. In Denmark, for example, the 'Royal School of Librarianship' changed its English name to [[The Royal School of Library and Information Science]] in 1997. Exceptions include Tromsø, Norway, where the term [[documentation science]] is the preferred name of the field, France, where information science and communication studies form one [[interdiscipline]],&lt;ref&gt;Mucchielli, A., (2000), La nouvelle communication : épistémologie des sciences de l’informationcommunication. Paris, Armand Colin, 2000. Collection U. Sciences de la communication&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden, where the fields of [[Archival science]], [[Library science]] and [[Museology]] have been integrated as Archival, Library and Museum studies.

In spite of various trends to merge the two fields, some consider the two original disciplines, [[library science]] and [[information science]], to be separate.&lt;ref name="Saracevic"&gt;Saracevic, Tefko (1992). Information science: origin, evolution and relations. In: ''Conceptions of library and information science. Historical, empirical and theoretical perspectives''. Edited by Pertti Vakkari &amp; Blaise Cronin. London: Taylor Graham (pp. 5-27).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miksa, Francis L. (1992). Library and information science: two paradigms. In: ''Conceptions of library and information science. Historical, empirical and theoretical perspectives''. Edited by Pertti Vakkari &amp; Blaise Cronin. London: Taylor Graham  (pp. 229-252).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tendency today is to use the terms as [[synonym]]s or to drop the term "library" and to speak about ''information departments'' or ''[[I-school]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Educating a new generation of library and information science professionals: A
United States perspective|url=https://digitalcommons.du.edu/lis_facpub|journal=Digital Commons @ DU|volume=82|issue=2|pages=189-206|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been attempts to revive the concept of [[documentation]] and to speak of [[Library, information and documentation]] studies (or science).&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. B. (Ed.) (2004). Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International Colloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library, Information, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID). Lanham, MD:&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations between library science, information science and LIS==
Tefko Saracevic (1992, p.&amp;nbsp;13)&lt;ref name="Saracevic"/&gt; argued that library science and information science are separate fields:

{{quote|The common ground between library science and information science, which is a strong one, is in the sharing of their social role and in their general concern with the problems of effective utilization of graphic records. But there are also very significant differences in several critical respects, among them in: (1) selection of problems addressed and in the way they were defined; (2) theoretical questions asked and frameworks established;(3) the nature and degree of experimentation and empirical development and the resulting practical knowledge/competencies derived; (4) tools and approaches used; and (5) the nature and strength of interdisciplinary relations established and the dependence of the progress and evolution of interdisciplinary approaches. All of these differences warrant the conclusion that librarianship and information science are two different fields in a strong interdisciplinary relation, rather than one and the same field, or one being a special case of the other.}}

Another indication of the different uses of the two terms are the indexing in UMI's [[Dissertations Abstracts]]. In ''Dissertations Abstracts Online'' on November 2011 were 4888 dissertations indexed with the descriptor LIBRARY SCIENCE and 9053 with the descriptor INFORMATION SCIENCE. For the year 2009 the numbers were 104 LIBRARY SCIENCE and 514 INFORMATION SCIENCE. 891 dissertations were indexed with both terms (36 in 2009).

It should be considered that information science grew out of [[documentation science]] and therefore has a tradition for considering scientific and scholarly communication, [[bibliographic database]]s, subject knowledge and terminology etc. Library science, on the other hand has mostly concentrated on libraries and their internal processes and best practices. It is also relevant to consider that information science used to be done by scientists, while librarianship has been split between public libraries and scholarly research libraries. [[Library school]]s have mainly educated librarians for public libraries and not shown much interest in scientific communication and documentation. When information scientists from 1964 entered library schools, they brought with them competencies in relation to information retrieval in subject databases, including concepts such as recall and precision, boolean search techniques, query formulation and related issues. Subject bibliographic databases and citation indexes provided a major step forward in information dissemination - and also in the curriculum at library schools.

Julian Warner (2010)&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;Warner, Julian (2010). ''Human information retrieval.''Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the information and computer science tradition in [[information retrieval]] may broadly be characterized as '''query transformation''', with the query articulated verbally by the user in advance of searching and then transformed by a system into a set of records. From librarianship and indexing, on the other hand, has been an implicit stress on '''selection power''' enabling the user to make relevant selections.

==Difficulties defining LIS==
"The question, 'What is library and information science?' does not elicit responses of the same internal conceptual coherence as similar inquiries as to the nature of other fields, e.g., 'What is chemistry?', 'What is economics?', 'What is medicine?' Each of those fields, though broad in scope, has clear ties to basic concerns of their field. [...] Neither LIS theory nor practice is perceived to be monolithic nor unified by a common literature or set of professional skills. Occasionally, LIS scholars (many of whom do not self-identify as members of an interreading LIS community, or prefer names other than LIS), attempt, but are unable, to find core concepts in common. Some believe that computing and internetworking concepts and skills underlie virtually every important aspect of LIS, indeed see LIS as a sub-field of computer science! [Footnote III.1] Others claim that LIS is principally a social science accompanied by practical skills such as ethnography and interviewing. Historically, traditions of public service, bibliography, documentalism, and information science have viewed their mission, their philosophical toolsets, and their domain of research differently. Still others deny the existence of a greater metropolitan LIS, viewing LIS instead as a loosely organized collection of specialized interests often unified by nothing more than their shared (and fought-over) use of the descriptor information. Indeed, claims occasionally arise to the effect that the field even has no theory of its own." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;652-653).

The Swedish researcher Emin Tengström (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Tengström, E. (1993). Biblioteks- och informationsvetenskapen - ett fler- eller tvär-vetenskapligt område? Svensk Biblioteksforskning,(1), 9-20.&lt;/ref&gt; described [[cross-disciplinary]] research as a process, not a state or structure. He differentiates three levels of ambition regarding cross-disciplinary research:
* The "[[Pluridisciplinary]]" or "[[multidisciplinarity]]" level
* The genuine cross-disciplinary level: "[[interdisciplinarity]]"
* The discipline-forming level "[[transdisciplinarity]]"

What is described here is a view of social fields as dynamic and changing. Library and information science is viewed as a field that started as a multidisciplinary field based on literature, psychology, sociology, management, computer science etc., which is developing towards an [[academic discipline]] in its own right. However, the following quote seems to indicate that LIS is actually developing in the opposite direction:

Chua &amp; Yang (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Chua, A.  &amp; Yang, C.C. (2008). The shift towards multi-disciplinarity in information science, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59(13), 2156–2170.&lt;/ref&gt; studied papers published in ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' in the period 1988-1997 and found, among other things: "Top authors have grown in diversity from those being affiliated predominantly with library/information-related departments to include those from information systems management, information technology, business, and the humanities. Amid heterogeneous clusters of collaboration among top authors, strongly connected crossdisciplinary
coauthor pairs have become more prevalent. Correspondingly, the distribution of top keywords’ occurrences that leans heavily on core information science has shifted towards other subdisciplines such as information technology and sociobehavioral science."

A more recent study revealed that 31% of the papers published in 31 LIS journals from 2007 through 2012 were by authors in academic departments of library and information science (i.e., those offering degree programs accredited by the [[American Library Association]] or similar professional organizations in other countries).  Faculty in departments of [[computer science]] (10%), [[management]] (10%), [[communication]] (3%), the other social sciences (9%), and the other natural sciences (7%) were also represented.  Nearly one-quarter of the papers in the 31 journals were by practicing librarians, and 6% were by others in non-academic (e.g., corporate) positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=William H.|last2=Wilder|first2=Esther Isabelle|date=2016|title=Disciplinary, national, and departmental contributions to the literature of library and information science, 2007-2012|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23448|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|language=en|volume=67|issue=6|pages=1487–1506|doi=10.1002/asi.23448|issn=2330-1635|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a field with its own body of interrelated concepts, techniques, journals, and professional associations, LIS is clearly a discipline. But by the nature of its subject matter and methods LIS is just as clearly an [[interdiscipline]], drawing on many adjacent fields (see below).

=== A fragmented adhocracy ===
Richard Whitley (1984,&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, R. (1984). The fragmented state of management studies: Reasons and consequences. Journal of management studies, 21(3), 331-348.&lt;/ref&gt; 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, R. (2000). The intellectual and social organization of the sciences.
Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; classified scientific fields according to their intellectual and social organization and described management studies as a ‘fragmented adhocracy’, a field with a low level of coordination around a diffuse set of goals and a non-specialized terminology; but with strong connections to the practice in the business sector. Åström (2006)&lt;ref name="Astrom"&gt;Åström, F. (2006). The social and intellectual development of library and information science. Doctoral theses at the Department of Sociology, Umeå University,. No 48 2006. http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:145144/FULLTEXT01&lt;/ref&gt; applied this conception to the description of LIS.

=== Scattering of the literature ===
Meho &amp; Spurgin (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Meho, Lokman I. &amp; Spurgin, Kristina M. (2005). Ranking the Research Productivity of Library and Information Science Faculty and Schools: An Evaluation of Data Sources and Research Methods. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 56(12), 1314–1331.&lt;/ref&gt; found that in a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 schools of library and information science, only 10 databases provided significant coverage of the LIS literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. Even when the nine most comprehensive databases in LIS was searched and combined, 27.0% (or 710 of 2,635) of the publications remain not found.
{{quote|The study confirms earlier research that LIS literature is highly scattered and is not limited to standard LIS databases. What was not known or verified before, however, is that a significant amount of this literature is indexed in the interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary databases of Inside Conferences and INSPEC. Other interdisciplinary databases, such as America: History and Life, were also found to be very useful and complementary to traditional LIS databases, particularly in the areas of archives and library history. (Meho &amp; Spurgin, 2005, p.1329).}}

==The unique concern of library and information science==
"Concern for people becoming informed is not unique to LIS, and thus is insufficient to differentiate LIS from other fields. LIS are a part of a larger enterprise." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;655).&lt;ref&gt;Konrad, A. (2007). On inquiry: Human concept formation and construction of meaning through library and information science intermediation (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University of California, Berkeley. Retrieved from http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1s76b6hp&lt;/ref&gt;

"The unique concern of LIS is recognized as: Statement of the core concern of LIS:
'''Humans becoming informed (constructing meaning) via intermediation between inquirers and instrumented records'''. No other field has this as its concern. " (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;660)

"Note that the promiscuous term ''information'' does not appear in the above statement circumscribing the field's central concerns: The detrimental effects of the ambiguity this term provokes are discussed above (Part III). Furner [Furner 2004, 427] has shown that discourse in the field is improved where specific terms are utilized in place of the i-word for specific senses of that term." (Konrad, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;661).

Michael Buckland wrote: "Educational programs in library, information and documentation are concerned with what people know, are not limited to technology, and require wide-ranging expertise. They differ fundamentally and importantly from computer science programs and from the information systems programs found in business schools.".&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael K. (2004). Reflections on social and cultural awareness and responsibility in library, information and documentation - Commentary on the SCARLID colloquium. In: Rayward, W. B. (Ed.). ''Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International Colloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library, Information, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID)''. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. (pp. 169-175).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bawden and Robinson argue that while Information Science has overlaps with numerous other disciplines with interest in studying communication, it is unique in that it is concerned with all aspects of the communication chain.&lt;ref name = "Bawden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bawden|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Lyn|title=Introduction to information science|date=2013|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Incorporated|location=Chicago|isbn=9781555708610}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6,8}}  For example Computer Science may be interested in the indexing and retrieval, sociology with user studies, and publishing (business) with dissemination, whereas information science is interested in the study of all of these individual areas and the interactions between them.&lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

The organization of information and information resources is one of the fundamental aspects of LIS. &lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}} and is an example of both LIS's uniqueness and its multidisciplinary origins.  Some of the main tools used by LIS toward this end to provide access to the digital resources of modern times (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) originated in 19th century to assist humanity's effort to make its intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge.  &lt;ref name="Bawden"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}.  The origin for some of these tools were even earlier. For example, in the 17th century, during the [[History_of_libraries#Enlightenment_era_libraries|'golden age of libraries']], publishers and sellers seeking to take advantage of the burgeoning book trade developed descriptive catalogs of their wares for distribution – a practice was adopted and further extrapolated by many libraries of the time to cover areas like philosophy, sciences, linguistics, medicine, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=Library : an illustrated history.|date=2012|publisher=W W Norton|location=New York|isbn=9781616084530}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|120}}  In this way, a business concern of publishers – keeping track of and advertising inventory – was developed into a system for organizing and preserving information by the library.

The development of [[Metadata]] is another area that exemplifies the aim of LIS to be something more than an mishmash of several disciplines – that uniqueness Bawden and Robinson describe.  Pre-Internet classification systems and [[Cataloging|cataloging]] systems were mainly concerned with two objectives: 1. to provide rich bibliographic descriptions and relations between information objects and 2. to facilitate sharing of this bibliographic information across library boundaries.&lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeng|first1=Marcia Lei|last2=Qin|first2=Jian|title=Metadata.|date=2014|publisher=Neal-Schuman|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55570-965-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{rp|14}}  The development of the Internet and the information explosion that followed found many communities needing mechanisms for the description, authentication and management of their information. &lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}  These communities developed taxonomies and controlled vocabularies to describe their knowledge as well as unique information architectures to communicate these classifications and libraries found themselves as liaison or translator between these metadata systems.  &lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15-16}}  Of course the concerns of cataloging in the Internet era have gone beyond simple bibliographic descriptions.  The need for descriptive information about the ownership and copyright of a digital product – a publishing concern – and description for the different formats and accessibility features of a resource – a sociological concern – show the continued development and cross discipline necessity of resource description.&lt;ref name = "Qin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

==LIS theories==
Julian Warner (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;4-5)&lt;ref name="Warner"/&gt; suggests that

{{quote|Two paradigms, the cognitive and the physical, have been distinguished in information retrieval research, but they share the assumption of the value of delivering relevant records (Ellis 1984, 19;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, David (1984). Theory and explanation in information retrieval research. ''Journal of Information Science'', 8, 25-38&lt;/ref&gt; Belkin and Vickery 1985, 114&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, N. J. &amp; Vickery, A. (1985)- ''Interaction in information systems: A review of research from document retrieval to knowledge-based systems.'' London: British Library (Library and Information Research Report 35).&lt;/ref&gt;). For the purpose of discussion here, they can be considered a single heterogeneous paradigm, linked but not united by this common assumption. The value placed on query transformation is dissonant with common practice, where users may prefer to explore an area and may value fully informed exploration. Some dissenting research discussions have been more congruent with practice, advocating explorative capability - the ability to explore and make discriminations between representations of objects - as the fundamental design principle for information retrieval systems.}}

The domain analytic approach (e.g., Hjørland 2010&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2010). The foundation of the concept of relevance. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. 61(2), 217-237.&lt;/ref&gt;) suggests that the relevant criteria for making discriminations in information retrieval are scientific and scholarly criteria. In some fields (e.g. evidence-based medicine)&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2011). Evidence based practice: An analysis based on the philosophy of science. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62(7), 1301-1310.&lt;/ref&gt; the relevant distinctions are very explicit. In other cases they are implicit or unclear. At the basic level, the relevance of bibliographical records are determined by epistemological criteria of what constitutes knowledge.

Among other approaches, [[Evidence Based Library and Information Practice]] should also be mentioned.

==Common subfields==
{{Information science}}
An advertisement for a full Professor in information science at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, spring 2011, provides one view of which subdisciplines are well-established:&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement for a full Professor in information science at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, spring 2011: {{cite web|url=http://www.job-i-staten.dk/SearchResults/position-as-full-professor-in-information-science-lja-3723916.aspx?jobId%3DLJA-3723916%26list%3DSearchResultsJobsIds%26index%3D6%26querydesc%3DSearchJobQueryDescription%26viewedfrom%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425131559/http://www.job-i-staten.dk/SearchResults/position-as-full-professor-in-information-science-lja-3723916.aspx?jobId=LJA-3723916&amp;list=SearchResultsJobsIds&amp;index=6&amp;querydesc=SearchJobQueryDescription&amp;viewedfrom=1 |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The research and teaching/supervision must be within some (and at least one) of these well-established information science areas

* h.	[[Digital literacy]] (cf [[information literacy]])
* i.	[[Bibliometrics]] or [[scientometrics]]
* j.	[[Interaction design]] and [[user experience]]"
* k.   [[Digital library]]

There are other ways to identify subfields within LIS, for example bibliometric mapping and comparative studies of curricula.
Bibliometric maps of LIS have been produced by, among others, Vickery &amp; Vickery (1987, frontispiece),&lt;ref&gt;Vickery, Brian &amp; Vickery, Alina (1987). ''Information science in theory and practice. London: Bowker-Saur.&lt;/ref&gt; White &amp; McCain (1998),&lt;ref&gt;White, H. D., &amp; McCain, K. W. (1998). Visualizing a discipline: An author co-citation analysis of information science, 1972-1995. Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 49(4), 327-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Åström (2002,&lt;ref&gt;Åström, Fredrik (2002) Visualizing Library and Information Science concept spaces through keyword and citation based maps and clusters. In: Bruce, Fidel, Ingwersen &amp; Vakkari (Eds.). Emerging frameworks and methods: Proceedings of the fourth international conference on conceptions of Library and Information Science (CoLIS4), pp 185-197. Greenwood Village: Libraries unlimited.&lt;/ref&gt; 2006) and Hassan-Montero &amp; Herrero-Solana (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Hassan-Montero, Y., Herrero-Soalana, V. (2007). Visualizing Library and Information Science from the practitioner's perspective. 11th International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics
June 25–27, 2007, Madrid (Spain). http://yusef.es/Visualizing_LIS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example of a curriculum study is Kajberg &amp; Lørring, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Kajberg, Leif &amp; Lørring, Leif (eds.). (2005). ''European Curriculum Reflections on Library and Information Science Education.'' Copenhagen: The Royal School of Library and Information Science. http://library.upt.ro/LIS_Bologna.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication are the following data reported (p 234):
"Degree of overlap of the ten curricular themes with subject areas in the current curricula of responding LIS schools
* [[Information seeking]] and [[Information retrieval]] 100%
* [[Library management]] and promotion 96%
* [[Knowledge management]] 86%
* [[Knowledge organization]] 82%
* [[Information literacy]] and learning 76%
* Library and society in a historical perspective ([[Library history]]) 66%
*  The [[Information society]]: Barriers to the [[free access to information]] 64%
* [[Cultural heritage]] and digitisation of the cultural heritage ([[Digital preservation]]) 62%
* The library in the multi-cultural information society: International and intercultural communication 42%
* Mediation of culture in a special European context 26% "

There is often an overlap between these subfields of LIS and other fields of study. Most information retrieval research, for example, belongs to computer science. Knowledge management is considered a subfield of management or organizational studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Knowledge Management|editor1-last=Clegg|editor1-first=Stewart|editor2-last=Bailey|editor2-first=James R.|title=International Encyclopedia of Organizational Studies|date=2008|publisher=Sage Publications Inc.|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=978-1-4129-5390-0|pages=758-762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6923">'''Michael Glykas''' or '''Glycas''' ({{lang-gr|Μιχαὴλ Γλυκᾶς}}) was a 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[historian]], [[theologian]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]] and [[poet]]. He was probably from [[Corfu]] and lived in [[Constantinople]]. He was a critic of [[Manuel I Komnenos]], and was imprisoned and [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] due to his participation in a conspiracy against the emperor. He is also identified by modern scholarship with '''Michael Sikidites''' (Μιχαὴλ Σικιδίτης), who was condemned as a [[heresiarch]] in 1200.

==Life==
[[File:Manuel I Comnenus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Manuscript miniature of [[Manuel I Komnenos]], [[Vatican Library]]]]
Glykas was born sometime in the first third of the 12th century,&lt;ref name=ODB&gt;{{ODB|title=Glykas, Michael|last=Kazhdan|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Kazhdan|pages=855–856}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly {{circa|1130}}.&lt;ref name=LexMA&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Glykas Sikidites, Michael|last=Schreiner|first=Peter|at=col. 1519|encyclopedia=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]]|volume=4|publisher=Artemis &amp; Winkler|location=Munich and Zürich|year=1989|isbn=3-7608-8904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His probable birthplace was [[Corfu]].&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

He served as imperial secretary (''grammatikos'') under Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1143|1180}}), before being involved in a conspiracy against the emperor and being [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]]. The blinding was probably partial or slight, since he continued his literary activity.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; The exact nature of this conspiracy is unknown, but Otto Kresten suggested a connection with the alleged conspiracy that led to the downfall of Manuel's chief minister [[Theodore Styppeiotes]] in 1158/9.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; He remained imprisoned until at least 1164, and his subsequent fate is unknown. Modern scholars commonly support his identity with a certain Michael Sikidites, charged with heresy and magic in {{circa|1200}}.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

According to [[Niketas Choniates]], this Sikidites "was enrolled among the imperial secretaries" of Manuel I, was known of performing magic spells, conjuring serpents and demons. He preached a doctrine according to which the [[sacraments]] of the [[Eucharist]] were mortal and corruptible, as Christ's own body was. Furthermore, Sikidites and his followers considered a [[bodily resurrection]] impossible, and thought that the dead would be resurrected as ghostly spirits only. The doctrine appears to have enjoyed some support in leading circles, notably of the [[Patriarchs of Constantinople]] [[George II Xiphilinos]] and [[John X Kamateros]], but also aroused passionate opposition; in a [[synod]] in 1200, Sikidites was censured and his teachings declared heretical.&lt;ref name=Sikidites&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Alicia |title=Niketas Choniates: A Historiographical Study |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-967071-0 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nePUAAAAQBAJ | pages = 28, 47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His first known work were his ''Verses from Prison'', a poem of 581 lines in [[political verse]], written during his imprisonment. It contains many elements of the vernacular Greek language of his time (an early form of [[Modern Greek]]), in contrast to the highly stylized and archaic [[Attic Greek]] favoured by Byzantine intellectuals.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; In 1164/65, he composed an ''[[encomium]]'' celebrating Emperor Manuel's Hungarian campaign.&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; He also wrote a mathematical treatise on the distinction between [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]],&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; where he severely criticised Manuel I for his fondness for the latter; in the same vein, Glykas strongly rejected the concept of inevitable fate (''ananke'') as a force in history.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; 

His chief work is his [[chronicle]] (βίβλος χρονική, ''biblos chronike'') of events from the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] to the death of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1118.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; His main sources for the chronicle were [[George Monachos]], [[John Skylitzes]] and his continuators, [[John Zonaras]], and [[Constantine Manasses]].&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; Over half the work is dedicated to the narrative of the creation and early Jewish history.&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; As a historical source, it contains no new information,&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; but Glykas displays his opposition to the [[Komnenian dynasty]], and emulates Zonaras in his criticism of Alexios I.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; 

Another notable work, which led [[Hans-Georg Beck]] to describe Glykas as the "most original and vivid [[exegete]] of the 12th century", was the collection of 95 replies on theological questions (Εἰς τὰς ἀπορίας τῆς Θείας Γραφῆς κεφάλαια, ''Chapters on the questions on the Holy Scripture''), written in letter form. Among them is a letter where he criticises Manuel I for his incorrect use of passages from the [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

His surviving work, including his letters, is "overtly didactic", promoting Christian virtues, and making extensive use of [[proverbs]] to this end.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17250">[[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation]] is the maintenance of [[biological diversity]]. Conservation can focus on preserving diversity at [[genetics|genetic]], [[species]], [[community]] or whole [[ecosystem]] levels. This article will examine conservation at the species level, because [[mutualisms]] involve interactions between species. The ultimate goal of conservation at this level is to prevent the [[extinction]] of species. However, species conservation has the broader aim of maintaining the abundance and distribution of all species, not only those threatened with extinction (van Dyke 2008). Determining the value of conserving particular species can be done through the use of evolutionary significant units, which essentially attempt to prioritise the conservation of the species which are rarest, fastest declining, and most distinct genotypically and phenotypically (Moritz 1994, Fraser and Bernatchez 2001).

Mutualisms can be defined as "interspecific interactions in which each of two partner species receives a net benefit" (Bronstein et al. 2004). Here net benefit is defined as, a short-term increase in inclusive fitness (IF). Incorporating the concept of genetic relatedness (through IF) is essential because many mutualisms involve the eusocial insects, where the majority of individuals are not reproductively active. The short-term component is chosen because it is operationally useful, even though the role of long-term adaptation is not considered (de Mazancourt et al. 2005). This definition of mutualism should be suffice for this article, although it neglects discussion of the many subtitles of IF theory applied to mutualisms, and the difficulties of examining short-term compared to long-term benefits, which are discussed in Foster and Wenselneers (2006) and de Mazancourt et al. (2005) respectively. Mutualisms can be broadly divided into two categories. Firstly, obligate mutualism, where two mutualistic partners are completely interdependent for survival and reproduction. Secondly, facultative mutualism, where two mutualistic partners both benefit from the mutualism, but can theoretically survive in each other's absence.

Mutualisms are remarkably common, in fact all organisms are believed to be involved in a mutualism at some point during their lives (Bronstein et al. 2004). This is particularly likely to be true for the definition of mutualism adopted here, where herbivory can paradoxically be mutualistic, for example in a situation where a plant overcompensates by producing more biomass when grazed on. Therefore, any species identified as particularly important to conserve will probably have mutualistic partners. It is beyond the purview of this article to discuss all these mutualisms, so the focus will be on specifically animal-plant mutualisms.

==Mutualism coextinction==
A mutualism coextinction event is where a species goes extinct upon the loss of its mutualist (Koh et al. 2004). Models have attempted to predict when the breakdown of a mutualism leads to coextinction, because in this situation protecting the mutualism will be particularly important for conservation. These models are multi-dimensional, so examine complex networks of interactions, rather than just pairs of interacting species. This means that these models incorporate modelling the breakdown of obligate mutualisms (which lead directly to coextinction), but also the breakdown of facultative mutualisms (which can lead indirectly to coextinction). Koh et al. (2004) use a "nomographic model of affiliate extinctions", which estimates the probability that the extinction of a species leads to the extinction of its mutualist, for a given estimate of the specificity of the mutualism. By applying the model to actual species, Koh et al. (2004) estimate that 200 coextinctions have occurred since records of species extinction began in the past few centuries, and 6300 coextinctions are at risk of occurring in the near future. However, these estimates are not exclusively for mutualism coextinctions (e.g. parasitic coextinctions are incorporated), but mutualism coextinctions make up a significant proportion of the number quoted. Additionally the model predicts that these coextinctions can start extinction cascades, where many other species in the surrounding ecosystem go extinct. Other recent models largely agree with this one, predicting that mutualism coextinction is a very significant cause of species loss, and that it can lead to extinction cascades (Dunn et al. 2009).

Surprisingly, given the model predictions, there are very few recorded examples of global mutualism coextinctions actually occurring (Bronstein et al. 2004, Dunn et al. 2009), and many examples often quoted are unconvincing on examination. For example, a well documented case of animal-plant coextinction and an extinction cascade involves a butterfly (''[[Maculinea arion]]'') to ant (''[[Myrmica sableti]]'') interaction. ''M. arion'' larvae provide honeydew for the ''M. sableti'' workers, which raise the caterpillars in their nest. When the [[Myxoma]] virus was introduced to control rabbit populations in the UK, the subsequent increase in grassland caused a decrease in soil temperatures at ground level. This caused reductions in the ''M. sableti'' populations, which led to the extinction of the M. arion populations (Dunn 2005). However, this is actually a relatively weak example, because it was a local (rather than a global) extinction, and the nature of the interaction is often not viewed as mutualistic, because it has been long known that the ''M. sableti'' caterpillars eat ''M. sableti'' larvae (Elmes and Thomas 1992).

So, why are there very few documented examples of mutualism coextinctions? There are various possible reasons. Perhaps global mutualism coextinctions are genuinely uncommon, and the model predictions are inaccurate. The models may overestimate the specificity of the mutualisms, because species may only associate with alternative species when their 'normal' mutualist is rare or absent. For example, [[oligolectic]] bees visit a small number of flowers for pollen. However, these bees do not generally have strongly specialised anatomy, morphology or physiology. Therefore, in the absence of these usual flowers, many oligolectic bee species are able switch to collecting pollen from flower species they would never normally associate with (Wcislo and Cane 1996). Even some [[fig wasps]], often considered to be in completely obligate relationships, have maintained low population densities when introduced to new areas without their natural mutualist [[fig tree]] species (McKey 1989). The models may also underestimate the robustness of the mutualisms. For example, fig trees and fig wasps are coadapted so that the wasps can find the trees from a long distances away (Bronstein et al. 1994).

Alternatively, there may simply be many global mutualism coextinctions that have occurred which we are not yet aware of. This explanation is not unlikely, because mutualisms have generally been understudied as interactions (Bronstein 1994, Richardson et al. 2000). There is additionally the difficulty of defining when a species becomes globally extinct, compared to just extremely rare or maintained exclusively through captive breeding programs. Of course, these stated explanations are not mutually exclusive. However, more research is required to rectify the model predictions of many mutualism coextinctions, with the lack of empirical evidence for such events. Only then can we discover if conserving mutualisms is likely to prevent many global species extinction.

==Mutualism "codeclines"==
Even if global mutualism coextinctions are genuinely rare, conserving mutualisms may still be important for conservation. As mentioned previously, conservation is not just about preventing extinctions, but also about preventing species decline. Unlike with coextinctions, there are numerous recorded examples of where the decline or extinction of a species has led to the decline of its mutualist ("codeclines"). A documented example of a pollination mutualism breakdown leading to population declines is the [[Indian rubber tree]] (''Ficus elastica'') to its pollinator wasp (''[[Pleistodontes clavigar]]'') interaction. [[Habitat fragmentation]] has led to the ''F. elastica'' declining to very low population levels. However, F. Elastic can propagate clonally, so has remained extant. Meanwhile, ''P. clavigar'' is virtually extinct globally, because the mutualist relationship is probably obligate for P. clavigar (Mawsdley et al. 1998). An example of a seed dispersal mutualism breakdown causing population declines comes from two endemic species on Menorca Island. A frugivorous lizard (''[[Podarcis lilfordi]]'') is a seed disperser of a shrub (''[[Daphne rodriguezii]]''). When ''P. lilfordi'' became extinct on Menorca, due to the introduction of carnivorous mammals, ''D. rodriguezii'' numbers declined significantly to endangered levels. This ''D. rodriguezii'' decline could be attributed to the local extinction of ''P. lilfordi'', due the lack of seedling recruitment on Menorca compared to other nearby islands, where ''P. lilfordi'' remained extant and ''D. rodriguezii'' populations larger (Traveset and Riera 2005).

However, in some cases it has been shown that declines of one partner in a mutualism do not lead to significant declines in the other. For example, a Hawaiian vine (''Freycinetia arborea'') was pollinated in the nineteenth century by four species of birds. These bird species are all now either locally endangered or extinct. Despite this, ''F. arborea'' continues to survive in reasonable abundance, but is now mainly pollinated by the recently introduced [[white-eye]] (''Zosterops japonica'') (Cox and Elmqvist 2000). In this case, conservation of the mutualism was not required to maintain the ''F. arborea'' population. There are probably no published estimates of how frequently declines of one species do not result in declines of that species' mutualist, due to a 'replacement' mutualist. However, judging by the few examples in the literature where this replacement has been reported to have happened, it seems to be a relatively rare occurrence.

==Alien species in mutualisms==
The Hawaiian vine example also illustrates that alien species can be involved in animal-plant mutualisms. In fact, alien species are often dependent on mutualisms to establish themselves in new habitats (particularly on islands), and especially those alien species requiring animal mediated pollination (Richardson et al. 2000). These alien species will, by definition, be beneficial to the short-term inclusive fitness of the species they form a mutualism with. However, the alien species will negatively impact other species in the ecosystem. For example, through competition for resources (including competition for mutualist partners) (Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2009). In fact, these negative impacts could theoretically cascade through the ecosystem, and lead to the alien species having an indirect long-term negative impact on its mutualist. This means that mutualisms involving alien species is important in conservation. However, the action taken by a conservation organization could be either to conserve or disrupt the mutualism.

In some situations, a conservation organization will want to conserve the mutualistic relationship. For example, many of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] have lost the vast majority of their native seed dispersers, and introduced bird species now act as very major seed dispersers of native species. In fact, these exotic species appear to actually facilitate the re-growth of native forests in some areas (Foster and Robinson 2007). In these situations, conserving the native mutualism may become less important than conserving the new one. Alien species involved in mutualisms may actually be desirable for conservationists to protect in a more general way. Alien species are particularly likely to generate highly generalised and asymmetric mutualisms, which help stabilise communities, making them less vulnerable to decline and extinctions (Aizen et al. 2008).

In other situations, conservation will be facilitated by disrupting mutualisms involving alien species. For example alien bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) have displaced many native pollinators, and pollinated some unwanted weed species, across the globe (Hingston et al. 2002). These mutualisms could lead to a decline in both animal and plant species of particular value to conservation. The empirical evidence would suggest that in the majority of cases a conservation organisation should try and disrupt the mutualisms involving the alien species (Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2009).

'''Myrmecology''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɜːr|m|ᵻ|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; from Greek: [[wikt:μύρμηξ|μύρμηξ]], ''myrmex'', "ant" and  λόγος, ''logos'', "study") is a branch of [[entomology]] focusing on the [[science|scientific]] study of [[ant]]s. Some early myrmecologists considered ant society as the ideal form of society and sought to find solutions to human problems by studying them {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}. Ants continue to be a model of choice for the study of questions on the evolution of [[social system]]s because of their complex and varied forms of [[eusocial]]ity (social organization). Their diversity and prominence in ecosystems also has made them important components in the study of [[biodiversity]] and conservation. Recently, ant colonies are also studied and modeled for their relevance in [[machine learning]], [[complex network|complex interactive network]]s, stochasticity of encounter and [[interaction network]]s, [[parallel computing]], and other computing fields.&lt;ref name="Ant Encounters Interaction Networks"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-0691138794|url= https://www.amazon.com/Ant-Encounters-Interaction-Networks-Behavior/dp/0691138796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408841741&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ant+encounters+Gordon |title=Ant Encounters Interaction Networks and Colony Behavior |author=Deborah Gordon |location=New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2010 |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word myrmecology was coined by [[William Morton Wheeler]] (1865–1937), although human interest in the life of ants goes back further, with numerous ancient folk references. The earliest scientific thinking based on observation of ant life was that of [[Auguste Forel]] (1848–1931), a Swiss psychologist who initially was interested in ideas of instinct, learning, and society. In 1874 he wrote a book on the ants of Switzerland, ''Les fourmis de la Suisse'', and he named his home ''La Fourmilière'' (the ant colony). Forel's early studies included attempts to mix species of ants in a colony. He noted [[Polydomy#Organizational terminology|polydomy and monodomy]] in ants and compared them with the structure of nations.&lt;ref name=sleigh&gt;Sleigh, Charlotte (2007) Six legs better : a cultural history of myrmecology. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-8445-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheeler looked at ants in a new light, in terms of their social organization, and in 1910 he delivered a lecture at Woods Hole on “The Ant-Colony as an Organism,” which pioneered the idea of superorganisms. Wheeler considered [[trophallaxis]] or the sharing of food within the colony as the core of ant society. This was studied using a dye in the food and observing how it spread in the colony.&lt;ref name=sleigh/&gt;

Some, such as [[Horace Donisthorpe]], worked on the systematics of ants. This tradition continued in many parts of the world until advances in other aspects of [[biology]] were made. The advent of genetics, ideas in [[ethology]] and its evolution led to new thought. This line of enquiry was pioneered by [[E. O. Wilson]], who founded the field termed as [[sociobiology]].&lt;ref name=sleigh/&gt;

Ants often are studied by [[engineers]] for [[biomimicry]] and by [[network engineer]]s for more efficient networking. It is not known clearly how ants manage to avoid congestions and how they optimize their movements to move in most efficient ways without a central authority that would send out orders. There already have been many applications in structure design and networking that have been developed from studying ants, but the efficiency of human-created systems is still not close to the efficiency of ant colonies.

== Myrmecologists in Fiction ==
The fictional black and white 1954 Warner Bros. movie ''Them!'' describes the visiting expert Dr. Harold Medford (played by Edmund Gwenn) from the Department of Agriculture in Washington DC as a myrmecologist.

The '''National Solar Observatory ''' ('''NSO''') is a [[United States]] public [[research institute]] to advance the knowledge of the [[solar physics|physics]] of the [[Sun]].
NSO studies the Sun both as an [[astronomical object]] and as the dominant external influence on [[Earth]].
NSO is headquartered in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and operated facilities at two locations, at [[Sacramento Peak]] near [[Sunspot, New Mexico|Sunspot]] in [[New Mexico]], and at [[Kitt Peak]] in [[Arizona]] until the end of [[Fiscal_year#United_States|fiscal year]] 2017.
The institute is constructing the 4-meter [[Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope]] in the [[Haleakala Observatory]] on the island of [[Maui]].

NSO provides its observations to the scientific community. It operates facilities, develops advanced instrumentation both in-house and through partnerships, conducts solar research, and carries out educational and public outreach.

== Visiting the observatories ==
The National Solar Observatory HQ is located on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder. It also has some staff on [[Sacramento Peak]], where visitors are welcome during the daytime. The observatory lies in [[New Mexico]] at the southern end of [[New Mexico State Road 6563|NM Scenic Byway 6563]], about 18 miles (by car) south of [[Cloudcroft, New Mexico|Cloudcroft]] (on NM 82), and 40 miles southeast (by car) from [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]] (on NM 70 and 54), in the village of [[Sunspot, New Mexico|Sunspot]] inside of the [[Lincoln National Forest]]. Sunspot is an unincorporated community in the Sacramento Mountains in Otero County.The nearby nighttime observatory,  [[Apache Point Observatory]], is not open to the public.

== Telescopes operated by the observatory ==
=== Sacramento Peak ===
* See [[Sunspot Solar Observatory]] for the telescopes located there
* See [[Apache Point Observatory]] for the telescopes located there

=== Kitt Peak ===
* [[McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope]]
* [[Kitt Peak Solis Telescope]]

=== Global ===
* [[Global Oscillation Network Group]]

== History==
The Sacramento Peak facilities are located in [[Sunspot, New Mexico]]. The site's name was chosen by the late [[James C. Sadler]], (1920–2005), an internationally noted [[meteorologist]] and professor at The [[University of Hawaii]], formerly with the [[United States Air Force]] on assignment during the early inception of the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=The Sacramento Peak Observatory |work=Solar Physics |issue=182 |pages=1-19 |year=1998 |first=J. B.|last=Zirker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017]], NSO enlisted the cooperation of various groups in the Citizen CATE (Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse)  experiment to set up more than 60 identical telescopes along the eclipse path, to produce 90 continuous minutes of images, 10 seconds apart, of the Sun's inner [[corona]]. This was to provide a clearer understanding of solar plumes and other transient phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-solar-eclipse-usa-projects/citizen-scientists-will-take-to-the-field-for-u-s-eclipse-idUSKCN1AX100|title=Citizen scientists will take to the field for U.S. eclipse|last=Klotz|first=Irene|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PennPraxis''' is the "clinical" arm of the School of Design at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and is a [[501(c)|501c(3)]] non-profit subsidiary of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.  The group offers community collaborative design opportunities for Penn faculty and students to test ideas and theories in practical "real world" applications while offering architectural and planning services to individuals and groups who are either in need or are otherwise unable to procure these services from traditional sources.  In its first 10 years it earned $16m in fees.&lt;ref name=an/&gt;

Requirements for project proposals are that the projects not meet the University's guidelines for "sponsored research projects"; they must also provide educational benefits and/or serve the interests of the (Philadelphia) community.  PennPraxis has been working on ideas for [[urban planning]] for the city of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania according to a 'civic vision' it has for the city, including the [[Delaware River]] waterfront, and the western banks of the [[Schuylkill River]], where Penn's campus faces.  The group is led by executive director and Penn faculty member Harris Steinberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.design.upenn.edu/people/steinberg-faia_harris-m Harris Steinberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009064720/http://www.design.upenn.edu/people/steinberg-faia_harris-m |date=2012-10-09 }} - Penn faculty profile&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the group's funding comes from the [[William Penn Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Troy |last=Graham |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The other icon: William Penn Foundation sold off its company stock in '97 |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/24443689.html |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |publisher= |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2008-08-07 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williampennfoundation.org/search_site3576/search_site_show.htm?org_id=6906&amp;request_id=2010723 William Penn Foundation]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - 2008 grant listing for PennPraxis&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania Humanities Council's office is located at 325 Chestnut Street #715, Philadelphia, PA  19106. The current Executive Director is Laurie Zierer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2017/winter/in-focus/executive-function-laurie-zierer | title=Executive Function with Laurie Zierer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest state councils were organized in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=78#en_0_1 | title=State Humanities Council Revenues}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Pennsylvania’s council founded as a start-up grant at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1973 the Public Committee for the Humanities in Pennsylvania officially incorporated as a nonprofit at [[Bucknell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/the-pennsylvania-humanities-council-applauds-the-confirmation-of-dr-william-d-bro-adams-as-the-10th-chairman-of-the-national-endowment-for-the-humanities-2014-07-11 | title=The Pennsylvania Humanities Council Applauds the Confirmation of Dr. William D. Bro Adams as the 10th Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the name Pennsylvania Humanities Council (PHC) was established and the organization settled in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pahumanities.org/about-us/a-brief-history | title=A Brief History of PHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, PHC’s activity consisted almost exclusively of making grants to nonprofit organizations with funds provided by the NEH. During the 1980s and early 1990s, they incorporated staff-directed special projects and packaged programs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1994, PHC focused on expanding access to the humanities in Pennsylvania beyond groups traditionally interested in cultural events.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They began to support local groups, working to build the programming capacity of small historical societies, museums, art centers, libraries, senior centers, and community groups.

== Current activities ==
Since 2013, Pennsylvania Humanities Council has shifted its focus to civic engagement, education and humanities advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pahumanities.org/initiatives | title=PHC Initiatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5926">[[File:Effet de la rue officinale.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Effect of the [[common rue]] on skin in hot weather.]]

'''Phototoxicity''', also called '''photoirritation''', is a chemically induced skin irritation, requiring light, that does not involve the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=Dorland&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Anderson, D.M. |editor2=Keith, J. |editor3=Novac, P. |editor4=Elliott, M.A. |year=1994|title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary|edition=28th|publisher=W. B. Saunders Company|isbn=0721655777|translator= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[photosensitivity]].&lt;ref name=Dorland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phototoxicity and photoallergy|author=JH Epstein|year=1999|volume=18|issue=4|pages=274–284|journal=Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery|pmid=10604793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skin response resembles an exaggerated sunburn. The involved chemical may enter into the skin by topical administration or it may reach the skin via systemic circulation following ingestion or parenteral administration. The chemical needs to be "photoactive," which means that when it absorbs light, the absorbed energy produces molecular changes that cause toxicity. Many synthetic compounds, including drug substances like [[tetracyclines]] or [[fluoroquinolone]]s, are known to cause these effects. Surface contact with some such chemicals causes [[photodermatitis]]; many plants cause [[phytophotodermatitis]]. Light-induced toxicity is a common phenomenon in [[Photosensitivity in humans|humans]]; however, it also occurs in other animals.

==Scientific background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
A phototoxic substance is a chemical compound which becomes toxic when exposed to light.
*Some [[medicines]]: [[tetracycline antibiotics]], [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], [[amiodarone]], [[quinolones]]
*Many cold pressed citrus [[essential oils]] such as [[bergamot orange|bergamot]] oil
*Some plant juices: [[parsley]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], and ''[[Heracleum mantegazzianum]]''
*Others: [[psoralen]]

Phototoxicity is a quantum chemical phenomenon. Phototoxins are molecules with a [[conjugated system]], often an [[Aromaticity|aromatic system]]. They have a low-lying [[excited state]] that can be reached by excitation with visible light photons. This state can undergo [[intersystem crossing]] with neighboring molecules in tissue, converting them to toxic [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]]s. These rapidly attack nearby molecules, killing cells. A typical radical is [[singlet oxygen]], produced from regular [[triplet oxygen]]. Because free radicals are highly reactive, the damage is limited to the body part illuminated.

==Photosafety evaluation==

===Physico-chemical properties===

===''In vitro'' test systems===
3T3 Neutral Red Phototoxicity Test – An in vitro toxicological assessment test used to determine the cytotoxic and photo(cyto)toxicity effect of a test article to murine fibroblasts in the presence or absence of UVA light.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay (3T3 NRU PT) can be utilized to identify the phototoxic effect of a test substance induced by the combination of test substance and light and is based on the comparison of the [[cytotoxic]] effect of a test substance when tested after the exposure and in the absence of exposure to a non-cytotoxic dose of UVA/vis light. Cytotoxicity is expressed as a concentration-dependent reduction of the uptake of the vital dye - [[Neutral Red]].

Substances that are phototoxic in vivo after systemic application and distribution to the skin, as well as compounds that could act as phototoxicants after topical application to the skin can be identified by the test. The reliability and relevance of the 3T3 NRU PT have been evaluated and has been shown to be predictive when compared with acute phototoxicity effects in vivo in animals and humans."

'''Politics of the International Space Station'''  begins with the 1972 milestone in co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space, the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. This cooperative venture resulted in the July 1975 docking of [[Soyuz 19]] with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]] spacecraft. From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's [[Interkosmos]] programme included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in manned and unmanned missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986 the USSR extended this co-operation to a dozen countries in the [[Mir]] programme. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited MIR in the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]]me. In 1998, assembly of the [[International Space Station]] began.&lt;ref name="OnOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |title=On-Orbit Elements |publisher=NASA |author=NASA |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029013438/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the Canadian Space Agency and those from Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the International Space Station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's Canadarm will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Canada+renews+pledge+International+Space+Station+until+2020/6235789/story.html Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020.] The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply are established by the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). This international treaty was signed on 28 January 1998 by the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="PartStates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration—European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610083738/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|archivedate=10 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level.&lt;ref name="RSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these main intergovernmental agreements, Brazil originally joined the programme as a bilateral partner of the United States by a contract with NASA to supply hardware.&lt;ref name="Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Signs International Space Station Agreement With Brazil|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1996_1998/h97-233.html|date=14 October 1997|accessdate=18 January 2009|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to its ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS programme. However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor [[Embraer]] was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the programme in 2007.&lt;ref name="Emerson Kimura 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Brazil O Brasil na Estação Espacial Internacional|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.br/conteudo/made-brazil-o-brasil-na-estacao-espacial-internacional/|publisher=Gizmodo Brazil|accessdate=9 March 2011|author=Emerson Kimura|language=Portuguese|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has a similar contract with NASA to provide comparable services, although Italy also takes part in the programme directly via its membership in ESA.&lt;ref name="Italy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.it/en/flash_en/living/the_international_space_station_iss|title=International Space Station (ISS)|publisher=Italian Space Agency|date=18 January 2009|accessdate=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding the partnership would require unanimous agreement of the existing partners.

The heads of both the South Korean and Indian space agency [[ISRO]] announced at the first plenary session of the 2009 [[International Astronautical Congress]] that their nations wished to join the ISS programme, with talks due to begin in 2010. The heads of agency also expressed support for extending ISS lifetime.&lt;ref name="ISRO and KARI to join ISS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/10/14/333406/south-korea-india-to-begin-iss-partnership-talks-in.html|title=South Korea, India to begin ISS partnership talks in 2010|work=Flight International|accessdate=14 October 2009|date=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; European countries not part of the programme will be allowed access to the station in a three-year trial period, [[ESA]] officials say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/EU_mulls_opening_ISS_to_more_countries_999.html|title=EU mulls opening ISS to more countries|publisher=Space-travel.com|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian part of the station is operated and controlled by the Russian Federation's space agency and provides Russia with the right to nearly one-half of the crew time for the ISS. The allocation of remaining crew time (three to four crew members of the total permanent crew of six) and hardware within the other sections of the station is as follows: ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'': 51% for the ESA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; ''[[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibō]]'': 51% for the JAXA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_japan.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=24 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]'': 97.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_csa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Canadian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crew time, electrical power and rights to purchase supporting services (such as data upload and download and communications) are divided 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSSM"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included in the agreement was training, provision of Soyuz capsules, life support systems, docking systems, and space suits. American observers comment that Shenzhou spacecraft could dock at the ISS if it became politically feasible, whilst Chinese engineers say work would still be required on the rendezvous system. [[Shenzhou 7]] passed within about 50 kilometres of the ISS.&lt;ref name="fpc.state.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|title=Vladimir Syromyatnikov; Designed Docking System for Space Capsules|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/30/AR2006093001038.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/6909/2011/11/14/2941s667032.htm |title=China Ready to Conduct 2nd Space Docking |publisher=English.cri.cn |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
Brazil joined the ISS as a partner of the United States and this included a contract with NASA to supply hardware to the Space Station.&lt;ref name="Brazil"/&gt; In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to NASA ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS programme. However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor [[Embraer]] was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the programme in 2007.&lt;ref name="Emerson Kimura 2009"/&gt; Regardless, the first Brazilian astronaut, [[Marcos Pontes]], was sent to ISS in April 2006 for [[Expedition 13]].&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;[http://www.space.com/2222-brazils-astronaut-fresh-iss-crew-reach-orbit.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was Brazil's first space traveler and he returned to Earth safely.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; Pontes trained on the Space Shuttle and Soyuz, but ended up going up with the Russians, although he did work at the U.S. Johnson Space Center after returning to Earth.

'''''Print, A Quarterly Journal of the Graphic Arts''''' was a limited edition quarterly [[periodical]] begun in 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 Essential Magazines for Graphic Designers|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/14-essential-magazines-for-graphic-designers/|accessdate=22 August 2016|work=Web Designer Depot|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued under different names through the end of 2017 as '''''Print''''', a bimonthly [[United States|American]] magazine about visual culture and design.

In its final format, ''Print'' documented and critiqued commercial, social, and environmental design from every angle: the good (how New York’s public-school libraries are being reinvented through bold graphics), the bad (how Tylenol flubbed its disastrous ad campaign for suspicious hipsters{{clarify|reason=only clear Americans, probably|date=September 2015}}), and the ugly (how Russia relies on Soviet symbolism to promote sausage and real estate).

''Print'' was a general-interest magazine, written by cultural reporters and critics who look at design in its social, political, and historical contexts. From newspapers and book covers to Web-based motion graphics, from corporate branding to indie-rock posters, from exhibitions to cars to monuments, ''Print'' showed its audience of designers, art directors, illustrators, photographers, educators, students, and enthusiasts of popular culture why our world looks the way it looks, and why the way it looks matters. ''Print'' underwent a complete redesign in 2005, and ceased publication in 2017, with a promise to focus the brand on "a robust and thriving online community." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.printmag.com/regional-design-annual/print-magazine-winter-2017-2018-regional-design-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the Journal Initially==
The journal was founded by [[William Edwin Rudge]] to demonstrate “the far reaching importance of the graphic arts” including art prints, commercial printing, wallpaper, etc.  Contents were eclectic covering typography, book making, book printing, fine prints as well as the trade journal aspects of printing candy bar wrappers.&lt;ref&gt;Editor’s forward Vol 1, #1 (Jun 1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the publication included original prints such as the frontispiece for Vol 1, #1 (Jun 1940) a two color woodcut by Hans Alexander Mueller and Vol 1, #3 (December 1940) a black and white wood engraving by [[Paul Landacre]].

By Volume 8 (1953) the focus of the periodical had shifted to a trade journal.

==Name Changes==
* Vol 1, #1 (Jun 1940) ''Print: A Quarterly Journal of the Graphic Arts''
* Vol 3, #2 (Summer 1942) combined with ''The Printing Art. An Illustrated Monthly Magazine of the Art of Printing and of the Allied Arts'' but continued under ''Print: A Quarterly Journal of the Graphic Arts''

===Until===
* Vol 7, #1 (Aug 1951) ''Print'': combining: ''Print, A Quarterly Journal of Graphic Arts'', Vol. VII, Number 1 and ''The Print Collector's Quarterly'', Volume XXX, Number 4.
* Vol 7, #2 (Jan 1952) ''Print, The Magazine of the Graphic Arts'' - until

The '''Regional Science Association International''' ('''RSAI''') is a cluster of scholarly societies whose members engage in [[regional science]].

==Origins==
In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, the economist [[Walter Isard]] worked to draw together a group of academics interested in analyzing regional (i.e., sub-national) development. These academics were drawn from a number of disciplines: economics, geography, city planning, political science and rural sociology. Naming their new approach ''regional science'', they envisioned it as an interdisciplinary effort, one that would require unique theoretical concepts, methodological tools, and data. Because their effort was interdisciplinary, no existing academic organization brought the participants together; they therefore created their own organization, the ''Regional Science Association'', which first met in December 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce 2003: 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1961, the RSA had 960 members, and its first local "section", which organized conferences for regional scientists located in the western United States. The next section to form (in 1963) was in Japan, followed by sections throughout Europe, as well as in India, Argentina, and Brazil. In 1969, the Western section and the Japan section began to cooperate in holding a biennial ''Pacific Rim'' international conference.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce 2003: 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually issues of coordination among the various sections were worked out, resulting in much the present structure by 1990. The ''Regional Science Association International'' (RSAI) now functions as the umbrella organization for three other organizations: the ''Pacific Regional Science Conference Organization'', the ''North American Regional Science Council'', and the ''European Regional Science Association''. Each of these serve as the umbrella organization for a number of other organizations, as seen in the next section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5461">[[Image:Rosenbrock function.svg|thumb|right|300 px|Plot of the Rosenbrock function of two variables. Here &lt;math&gt;a=1, b=100&lt;/math&gt;, and the minimum value of zero is at &lt;math&gt;(1,1)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Rosenbrock function''' is a non-[[convex function]], introduced by [[Howard Harry Rosenbrock|Howard H. Rosenbrock]] in 1960, which is used as a [[Test functions for optimization|performance test problem]] for optimization [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbrock|first=H.H.|title=An automatic method for finding the greatest or least value of a function|journal=The Computer Journal|year=1960|volume=3|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1093/comjnl/3.3.175| issn=0010-4620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''Rosenbrock's valley''' or '''Rosenbrock's banana function'''.

The global minimum is inside a long, narrow, [[parabola|parabolic]] shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial. To converge to the global [[minimum]], however, is difficult.

The function is defined by

&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = (a-x)^2 + b(y-x^2)^2&lt;/math&gt;

It has a global minimum at &lt;math&gt;(x, y)=(a, a^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Usually these parameters are set such that &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = 100&lt;/math&gt;. Only in the trivial case where &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; is the function symmetric and the minimum at the origin.

==Multidimensional generalisations==

Two variants are commonly encountered.  

[[File:Rosenbrock3.gif|thumb|300px|Animation of Rosenbrock's function of three variables. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simionescu|first=P.A.|title=Computer Aided Graphing and Simulation Tools for AutoCAD users|year=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4822-5290-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One is the sum of &lt;math&gt;N/2&lt;/math&gt; uncoupled 2D Rosenbrock problems, and is defined only for even &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;s:
: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N/2} \left[100(x_{2i-1}^2 - x_{2i})^2
+ (x_{2i-1} - 1)^2 \right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. C. W. |last=Dixon |first2=D. J. |last2=Mills |title=Effect of Rounding Errors on the Variable Metric Method |journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications |volume=80 |issue= |year=1994 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=179711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variant has predictably simple solutions.

A second, more involved variant is
: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} [100 (x_{i+1} - x_i^2 )^2 + (1-x_i)^2] \quad \mbox{where} \quad \mathbf{x} = [x_1, \ldots, x_N] \in \mathbb{R}^N.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/tutorial/optimize.html#unconstrained-minimization-of-multivariate-scalar-functions-minimize|title = Generalized Rosenbrock's function|accessdate = 2008-09-16|work = |publisher = |date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

has exactly one minimum for &lt;math&gt;N=3&lt;/math&gt; (at &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;) and exactly two minima for &lt;math&gt;4 \le N \le 7&lt;/math&gt;—the global minimum of all ones and a local minimum near &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) = (-1, 1, \dots, 1)&lt;/math&gt;.  This result is obtained by setting the gradient of the function equal to zero, noticing that the resulting equation is a rational function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  For small &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the polynomials can be determined exactly and [[Sturm's theorem]] can be used to determine the number of real roots, while the roots can be [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#Bounds on the zeroes of a polynomial|bounded]] in the region of &lt;math&gt;|x_i| &lt; 2.4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kok2009"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Schalk |last=Kok |first2=Carl |last2=Sandrock |title=Locating and Characterizing the Stationary Points of the Extended Rosenbrock Function |journal=Evolutionary Computation |volume=17 |issue= 3|pages=437 |year=2009 |doi=10.1162/evco.2009.17.3.437 |pmid=19708775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For larger &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; this method breaks down due to the size of the coefficients involved.

==Stationary points==

Many of the stationary points of the function exhibit a regular pattern when plotted.&lt;ref name="kok2009"/&gt;  This structure can be exploited to locate them.
[[Image:Rosenbrock roots exhibiting hump structures.pdf|thumb|right|300 px|Rosenbrock roots exhibiting hump structures]]

==Optimization examples==
[[File:Rosenbrock.png|thumb|left|200px]]

[[File:Nelder-Mead Rosenbrock.gif|thumb|200px|text-top|left|alt=Rosenbrock function Nelder-Mead|Nelder-Mead method applied to the Rosenbrock function]]

The Rosenbrock function can be efficiently optimized by adapting appropriate coordinate system without using any [[gradient descent|gradient information]] and without building local approximation models (in contrast to many derivate-free optimizers). The following figure illustrates an example of 2-dimensional Rosenbrock function optimization by
[[adaptive coordinate descent]] from starting point &lt;math&gt;x_0=(-3,-4)&lt;/math&gt;. The solution with the function value &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; can be found after 325 function evaluations.

Using the [[Nelder–Mead method]] from starting point &lt;math&gt;x_0=(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; with a regular initial simplex a minimum is found with function value &lt;math&gt;1.36 \cdot 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; after 185 function evaluations. The figure below visualizes the evolution of the algorithm.

'''SABIO-RK''' ('''S'''ystem for the '''A'''nalysis of '''Bio'''chemical Pathways - '''R'''eaction '''K'''inetics) is a web-accessible [[database]] storing information about biochemical [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] and their [[Enzyme kinetics|kinetic]] properties.

SABIO-RK comprises a reaction-oriented representation of quantitative information on reaction dynamics based on a given selected publication.
This comprises all available kinetic parameters together with their corresponding [[rate equation]]s,
as well as kinetic law and parameter types and experimental and environmental conditions under which the kinetic data were determined.
Additionally, SABIO-RK contains information about the underlying biochemical reactions and [[Metabolic pathway|pathways]] including their [[Reagent|reaction participants]],
[[Cell (biology)|cellular]] location and detailed information about the [[enzymes]] catalysing the reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1007/11799511_9|chapter = SABIO-RK: Integration and Curation of Reaction Kinetics Data|title = Data Integration in the Life Sciences|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year = 2006|last1 = Wittig|first1 = Ulrike|last2 = Golebiewski|first2 = Martin|last3 = Kania|first3 = Renate|last4 = Krebs|first4 = Olga|last5 = Mir|first5 = Saqib|last6 = Weidemann|first6 = Andreas|last7 = Anstein|first7 = Stefanie|last8 = Saric|first8 = Jasmin|last9 = Rojas|first9 = Isabel|volume = 4075|pages = 94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17822389 |year=2007 |last1=Rojas |first1=I |last2=Golebiewski |first2=M |last3=Kania |first3=R |last4=Krebs |first4=O |last5=Mir |first5=S |last6=Weidemann |first6=A |last7=Wittig |first7=U |title=Storing and annotating of kinetic data |volume=7 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=S37–44 |journal=In silico biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gkr1046 |title=SABIO-RK--database for biochemical reaction kinetics |year=2011 |last1=Wittig |first1=U. |last2=Kania |first2=R. |last3=Golebiewski |first3=M. |last4=Rey |first4=M. |last5=Shi |first5=L. |last6=Jong |first6=L. |last7=Algaa |first7=E. |last8=Weidemann |first8=A. |last9=Sauer-Danzwith |first9=H. |last10=Mir |first10=S. |last11=Krebs |first11=O. |last12=Bittkowski |first12=M. |last13=Wetsch |first13=E. |last14=Rojas |first14=I. |last15=Muller |first15=W. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=40 |pages=D790–6 |pmid=22102587 |issue=Database issue |pmc=3245076|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller W.

== Content of SABIO-RK Database ==
The data stored in SABIO-RK in a comprehensive manner is extracted manually from literature. This includes reactions, their participants (substrates, products), modifiers ([[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]], activators, [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]]), [[Catalysis|catalyst]] details (e.g. [[Enzyme Commission number|EC enzyme classification]], [[Protein quaternary structure|protein complex composition]], [[wild type]] / [[Mutations|mutant]] information), kinetic parameters together with corresponding rate equation, biological sources ([[organism]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], cellular location), environmental conditions ([[pH]], temperature, buffer) and reference details. Data are adapted, normalized and annotated to controlled vocabularies, [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and external data sources including [[KEGG]], [[Uniprot|UniProt]], [[ChEBI]], [[Pubchem|PubChem]], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]], and [[Pubmed|PubMed]].&lt;br/&gt;
Currently SABIO-RK contains more than 52.000 curated single entries, for example 42% of them are related to the kinetic law type [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis-Menten kinetics]], more than 14% of the entries contain diverse types of inhibitions. Kinetic parameters in SABIO-RK include more than 41.700  velocity constants (V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Turnover number|k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Reaction rate constant|rate constants]]), more than 42.500 K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values (including S_half for [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill equations]]) and about 11.800 [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibition constants]] (Ki, IC50). Kinetic data are available for about 850 organisms, 6.700  different reactions and about 1.480 enzymes catalysing these reactions (as of December 2015).&lt;br/&gt;
Several tools, databases and workflows in [[Systems biology|Systems Biology]] make use of SABIO-RK biochemical reaction data by integration into their framework including

'''SDI Presence LLC''' (commonly referred to as '''SDI''' and formerly named '''SDI Solutions LLC''')  is a [[systems integrator]] that provides technology-based professional services.

==History==
David A. Gupta founded the company as System Development Integration (SDI) in 1996 in [[Chicago]] as a spinout from his father's mechanical engineering company, Environmental Systems Design, Inc.; its business was [[systems integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Stepanek for SDM Magazine. November 1, 2007 [http://www.sdmmag.com/articles/an-engineering-mindset An Engineering Mindset]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Pletz for Crain's Chicago Business. Sept 7, 2013 [http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130907/ISSUE01/309079980/in-digital-era-technology-finally-catches-up-with-sdi In digital era, technology finally catches up with SDI]&lt;/ref&gt;

With Gupta serving as CEO, by 2012 SDI had $40 million in revenue, 130 employees, 3 other US offices, and offices in the Caribbean, and was known for its security systems work in government-run systems, like transportation and housing, and in commercial buildings.  For example, from around 2003 to 2013, SDI earned around $137M from contracts with the city of Chicago for security systems at O'Hare and Midway airports, a paperless permit system in the buildings department, customer service and billing for the water management department, and the city payroll system.&lt;ref name=Trib2013-06&gt;David Kidwell for The Chicago Tribune.  June 19, 2013 [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-emanuel-red-light-donation-20130619-story.html Emanuel got $10,000 in donations linked to red light camera bidder]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 SDI raised money to expand from private equity firms Monument Capital and LLR Partners, which took a controlling interest in SDI and left Gupta holding less than 7.5% of the company.&lt;ref name=Trib2013-06/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martha Entwistle for Security Systems News. June 13, 2012 [http://www.securitysystemsnews.com/article/sdi-secures-investments-llr-partners-monument-capital-group SDI secures investments from LLR Partners, Monument Capital Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SSN2013-05/&gt;  In 2013 it acquired i-sys Corporation which specialized in security, environmental and fire safety solutions,&lt;ref&gt;Martha Entwistle for Security Systems News. June 19, 2013 [http://www.securitysystemsnews.com/article/sdi-55m-business-after-purchase SDI is $55m business after purchase]&lt;/ref&gt; and also bought  X7, a Washington, D.C.-based company that had major government and commercial clients.&lt;ref name=SSN2013-08&gt;Martha Entwistle for Security Systems News. August 28, 2013 [http://www.securitysystemsnews.com/article/sdi-now-70m-business-after-buying-x7 SDI is now $70m business after buying X7]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2013 it had 250 employees and had 10 office in the U.S., one in Puerto Rico and one in Istanbul and projected revenues of $70M.&lt;ref name=SSN2013-08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wailin Wong for The Chicago Tribune. August 28, 2013 [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-28/business/chi-tech-company-sdi-buys-rival-20130827_1_sdi-equity-firm-chicago Chicago technology company SDI buys rival]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, SDI made [[Chicago-style politics|Chicago political]] news due to donations made to [[Rahm Emanuel]] by the wives of Gupta and the company's president, without disclosure of their connection to SDI; SDI was bidding on a contract for Chicago's [[red light camera]] system and for its speed camera system at the time.&lt;ref name=Trib2013-06/&gt;

In the spring of 2014, David Sullivan was hired as CEO to integrate the acquisitions and grow the business to $200M in revenues over the next few years, with Gupta becoming Vice Chairman of the board.&lt;ref name=SSN2013-05&gt;Martha Entwistle for Security Systems News. May 21, 2013  [http://www.securitysystemsnews.com/article/david-sullivan-named-ceo-sdi David Sullivan named CEO of SDI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pletz2014&gt;John Pletz for Crain's Chicago Business. for May 16, 2014 [http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140516/BLOGS11/140519899/new-ceo-tapped-for-tech-services-firm-sdi  New CEO tapped for tech services firm SDI]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 SDI started going into debt, as it was unable to integrate the Washington DC businesses and contracts had been renewed on unfavorable terms; it laid off staff and tried to find ways to get cash to operate, including selling debt to PGV Solutions,&lt;ref name=Bankrupt/&gt; an LLC founded by Gupta that year.&lt;ref name=SDM/&gt;

In March 2016 SDI filed for bankruptcy with about $19M in debts.&lt;ref name=Bankrupt&gt;Matt Chiappardi for Law360. March 14, 2016 [http://www.law360.com/articles/771033/it-security-firm-sdi-solutions-hits-ch-11-seeking-sale IT Security Firm SDI Solutions Hits Ch. 11 Seeking Sale]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 Gupta acquired SDI and merged it with PGV Solutions; the new entity was named SDI Presence.&lt;ref name=SDM&gt;Staff, SDM Magazine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Sheldon Krimsky''' is Professor of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning at [[Tufts University]], and adjunct professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at [[Tufts University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org "Council for Responsible Genetics"], Board of Directors. Accessed June 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fellow of the [[Hastings Center]], an independent [[bioethics]] research institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/About/Default.aspx?id=902 The Hastings Center] Hastings Center Fellows.

Krimsky received his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from [[Brooklyn College]] and [[Purdue University]] respectively, and a masters and doctorate in philosophy at [[Boston University]].

== Work ==

=== ''Science in the Private Interest'' ===
In his 2003 book ''Science in the Private Interest'', Krimsky points out that conflicts of interests are perceived and regulated very differently in public affairs and in science:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The prophylactic measures that are taken to prevent conflict of interest in public affairs are considered irrelevant in science precisely because scientists view themselves as participating in a higher calling than that of public officials—namely, the pursuit of objective knowledge. While senior public officials (elected or appointed) are prohibited from managing their portfolios during their tenure in office, scientists with patents and equity in companies that fund their research are at most simply asked to disclose their interests.{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|130}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Krimsky raises the concern that conflicts of interest may compromise the scientific norm of "disinterestedness", which "requires that scientists apply the methods, perform the analysis, and execute the interpretation of results without considerations of personal gain, ideology, or fidelity to any cause other than the pursuit of truth."{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|77}} He claims that blurred boundaries between public interest science and pursuit of private gain have severely compromised the integrity of university science:&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolving academic universe is no longer as nurturing an environment for public-interest science as it once was. To a large degree, universities have been taken over by money managers and academic entrepreneurs who are looking for financially lucrative research.{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|79}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Krimsky writes that the profit motive has corrupted many scientists in biomedical research. He also proposes that the relationships between corporations, universities, and government agencies have resulted in biased science that puts human health and environment at risk. He has written and commented on [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified foods]], [[water fluoridation]], [[environmental health]], [[global warming]], and other controversial topics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/23/science/a-conversation-with-sheldon-krimsky-uncoupling-campus-and-company.html A Conversation With: Sheldon Krimsky; Uncoupling Campus and Company], by Melody Petersen.

[[Image:Drain runoff in Kharkiv.jpg|thumb|[[Urban runoff]] entering a [[storm drain]]]]

'''Stormwater''', also spelled '''storm water''', is water that originates during [[precipitation]] events and [[Meltwater|snow/ice melt]].  Stormwater can soak into the soil (infiltrate), be held on the surface and evaporate, or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and end up in nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies ([[surface water]]).

In natural landscapes such as forests, the soil absorbs much of the stormwater and plants help hold stormwater close to where it falls. In developed environments, unmanaged stormwater can create two major issues: one related to the volume and timing of runoff water ([[flooding]]) and the other related to potential contaminants that the water is carrying ([[water pollution]]).

Stormwater is also an important resource as the world's human population demand exceeds the availability of readily available water. Techniques of stormwater harvesting with point source [[water management]] and [[water purification|purification]] can potentially make urban environments self-sustaining in terms of water.

==Stormwater pollution==
[[Image:Natural &amp; impervious cover diagrams EPA.jpg|thumb|400px|Relationship between [[impervious surfaces]] and [[surface runoff]]]]
Because [[impervious surfaces]] ([[parking lot]]s, [[road]]s, [[building]]s, [[soil compaction|compacted soil]]) do not allow rain to [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] into the ground, more runoff is generated than in the undeveloped condition. This additional runoff can erode watercourses ([[streams]] and [[rivers]]) as well as cause [[flooding]] after the [[storm sewer|stormwater collection system]] is overwhelmed by the additional flow. Because the water is flushed out of the [[drainage basin|watershed]] during the storm event, little infiltrates the soil, replenishes [[groundwater]], or supplies stream [[baseflow]] in dry weather.&lt;ref&gt;Schueler, Thomas R. [http://www.cwp.org/online-watershed-library/doc_download/308-the-importance-of-imperviousness "The Importance of Imperviousness."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327134341/http://www.cwp.org/online-watershed-library/doc_download/308-the-importance-of-imperviousness |date=2014-03-27 }} Reprinted in ''The Practice of Watershed Protection.'' 2000. Center for Watershed Protection, Ellicott City, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[first flush]] is the initial runoff of a rainstorm. During this phase, polluted water entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more [[concentration|concentrated]] compared to the remainder of the storm. Consequently, these high concentrations of [[urban runoff]] result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to [[surface water]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Metcalf | first = Leonard | author-link = | last2 = Eddy | first2 = Harrison P. | author2-link = | title = American Sewerage Practice: Disposal of Sewage | place = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1916 | volume = III | edition = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ3VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 154 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitt1"&gt;Alex Maestre and Robert Pitt; Center for Watershed Protection (2005).[http://unix.eng.ua.edu/~rpitt/Publications/Stormwater%20Characteristics/NSQD%20EPA.pdf "The National Stormwater Quality Database, Version 1.1: A Compilation and Analysis of NPDES Stormwater Monitoring Information."] Report prepared for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. September 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|216}}

Pollutants entering surface waters during precipitation events is termed '''polluted runoff.'''  Daily human activities result in deposition of pollutants on [[road]]s, [[lawn]]s, [[roof]]s, [[farm]] fields, etc.  When it [[rains]] or there is [[irrigation]], [[water]] runs off and ultimately makes its way to a [[river]], [[lake]], or the [[ocean]].  While there is some [[attenuation]] of these pollutants before entering the receiving waters, the quantity of [[human]] activity results in large enough quantities of pollutants to impair these receiving waters.

==Stormwater runoff as a source of pollution==
[[File:View of urban runoff discharging to coastal waters.jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[Urban runoff]] being discharged to [[coastal]] waters]]
In addition to the pollutants carried in [[surface runoff|stormwater runoff]], urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right.
In natural catchments ([[drainage basin|watersheds]]) surface runoff entering waterways is a relatively rare event, occurring only a few times each year and generally after larger storm events.  Before development occurred most rainfall soaked into the ground and contributed to groundwater recharge or was recycled into the atmosphere by vegetation through [[evapotranspiration]] .

Modern drainage systems which collect runoff from impervious surfaces (e.g., roofs and roads) ensure that water is efficiently conveyed to waterways through pipe networks, meaning that even small storm events result in increased waterway flows.

In addition to delivering higher pollutants from the urban catchment, increased stormwater flow can lead to stream [[erosion]], encourage weed invasion, and alter natural flow regimes. Native species often rely on such flow regimes for spawning, juvenile development, and migration.

In some areas, especially along the U.S. coast, polluted runoff from roads and highways may be the largest source of water pollution. For example, about 75 percent of the toxic chemicals getting to [[Seattle]], Washington's [[Puget Sound]] are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways, rooftops, yards, and other developed land.&lt;ref&gt;Washington State Department of Ecology. [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/Programs/wq/pstoxics/index.html "Control of Toxic Chemicals in Puget Sound, Phase 2: Development of Simple Numerical Models"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302010119/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/pstoxics/index.html |date=2017-03-02 }}, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite efforts to use BMPs to attenuate the hydrologic effects of development, increased peak flows and more flashy runoff will cause physical modifications to the channel shape, bed substrate, and banks of receiving waters, with corresponding effects on aquatic habitat and biota. Loss of forest canopy, increases in paved area, and shallow and(or) muddy detention areas also may cause thermal pollution problems, which can exacerbate chemical stressors on aquatic organisms in receiving waters.”'' &lt;ref name=”USGShighwayrunoff”/&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Urban flooding==
[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|thumb|[[Retention basin]] for management of stormwater]]
Stormwater is a major cause of [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]]. Urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of [[drainage|drainage systems]], such as [[storm sewers]]. Although triggered by single events such as [[flash flooding]] or [[snow melt]], urban flooding is a condition, characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities. In areas susceptible to urban flooding, backwater valves and other infrastructure may be installed to mitigate losses.

Where properties are built with [[basements]], urban flooding is the primary cause of basement and sewer backups. Although the number of casualties from urban flooding is usually limited, the economic, social and environmental consequences can be considerable: in addition to direct damage to property and infrastructure ([[highways]], [[utilities]] and services), chronically wet houses are linked to an increase in respiratory problems and other illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Scientific Findings Resource Bank (IAQ-SFRB), "Health Risks or Dampness or Mold in Houses" {{cite web |url=http://www.iaqscience.lbl.gov/dampness-risks-house.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213929/http://www.iaqscience.lbl.gov/dampness-risks-house.html |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sewer backups are often from the sanitary sewer system, which takes on some storm water as a result of [[Infiltration/Inflow]].

Urban flooding has significant economic implications. In the U.S., industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10 to 25 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home.&lt;ref&gt;The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding. Chicago: Center for Neighborhood Technology, 2013. http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fema.gov/protecting-your-businesses |title=Protecting Your Businesses |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-04-22 |website= |publisher=U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year (as of 2007) in [[England]] and [[Wales]]; 80,000 homes are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, London, UK. "Urban Flooding." Postnote 289, July 2007 http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn289.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[Cook County, Illinois]], identified 177,000 property damage insurance claims made across 96 percent of the county’s ZIP codes over a five-year period from 2007 to 2011. This is the equivalent of one in six properties in the County making a claim. Average payouts per claim were $3,733 across all types of claims, with total claims amounting to $660 million over the five years examined.&lt;ref&gt;The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding. Rep. Chicago: Center for Neighborhood Technology, 2013 http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an urban flooding control project is the Brays Bayou Greenway Framework in [[Houston, Texas]]. [[Brays Bayou]] and its tributaries drain a watershed of approximately 88,000 acres south of downtown Houston. The federally-funded improvement project created a short-term solution by improving the bayou's drainage capacity, and identified a broad set of potential recreation and open space opportunities along the 35 miles of the bayou and tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asla.org/2009awards/196.html |title=Honor Award: Brays Bayou Greenway Framework, Houston, Texas |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2009 |website=2009 Professional Awards |publisher=American Society of Landscape Architects |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stormwater creation of sinkhole collapses==
An example of urban stormwater creating a sinkhole collapse is the February 25, 2002 Dishman Lane collapse in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] where a sinkhole suddenly dropped the road under four traveling vehicles. The nine-month repair of the Dishman Lane collapse cost a million dollars but there remains the potential for future problems.&lt;ref&gt;Kambesis, P., R. Brucker, T. Waltham, F. Bell, and M. Culshaw. "Collapse sinkhole at Dishman Lane, Kentucky." Sinkholes and Subsidence: Karst and Cavernous Rocks in Engineering and Construction. Springer, Berlin (2005): 277-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

In undisturbed areas with natural subsurface ([[karst]]) drainage, soil and rock fragments choke karst openings thereby being a self-limitation to the growth of openings.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, Arthur N.[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arthur_Palmer/publication/240024720_Groundwater_processes_in_karst_terrains/links/56a7eb7108aeded22e371c7e.pdf "Groundwater processes in karst terranes."] Ground water geomorphology (1990): 177-209. &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|189-190, 196}} The undisturbed karst drainage system becomes balanced with the climate so it can drain the water produced by most storms. However, problems occur when the landscape is altered by urban development.&lt;ref name="Veni"&gt;Veni, George. [https://www.americangeosciences.org/sites/default/files/karst.pdf Living with Karst]. American Geological Institute, 2001. &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} In urban areas with natural subsurface ([[karst]]) drainage there are no surface streams for the increased stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs, parking lots, and streets to runoff into. Instead, the stormwater enters the subsurface drainage system by moving down through the ground. When the subsurface water flow becomes great enough to transport soil and rock fragments, the karst openings grow rapidly.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;{{rp|190}} Where karst openings are roofed by supportive ([[Competence_(geology)|competent]]) limestone, there frequently is no surface warning that an opening has grown so large it will suddenly collapse catastrophically.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt;{{rp|198}} Therefore, land use planning for new development needs to avoid karst areas.&lt;ref name="Veni"/&gt;{{rp|37-38}} Ultimately taxpayers end up paying the costs for poor land use decisions.

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical aspects ===

* control of flooding and erosion;
* control of hazardous materials to prevent release of pollutants into the environment (source control);
* planning and construction of stormwater systems so contaminants are removed before they pollute surface waters or groundwater resources;
* acquisition and protection of natural waterways or rehabilitation;
* building [[nature-based solutions]] such as ponds, [[bioswale|swales]], [[constructed wetlands]] or [[green infrastructure]] solutions to work with existing or "hard" drainage structures, such as pipes and concrete channels (constructed wetlands built for stormwater treatment can also serve as habitat for plants, amphibians and fish)

=== Instiutional and policy aspects ===

* development of funding approaches to stormwater programs potentially including stormwater user fees and the creation of a stormwater utility;
* development of long-term asset management programs to repair and replace aging infrastructure;
* revision of current stormwater regulations to address comprehensive stormwater needs;
* enhancement and enforcement of existing ordinances to make sure property owners consider the effects of stormwater before, during and after development of their land;
* education of a community about how its actions affect [[water quality]], and about what it can do to improve water quality.

==Integrated water management==
[[Image:7sigma RainGarden 66.JPG|thumb|[[Rain garden]] designed to treat stormwater from adjacent parking lot]]
Integrated water management (IWM) of stormwater has the potential to address many of the issues affecting the health of waterways and water supply challenges facing the modern urban city.  IWM is often associated with [[green infrastructure]] when considered in the design process.  Professionals in their respective fields, such as [[Urban planner|Urban planners]], [[architects]], [[landscape architects]], [[interior designers]], and [[engineers]], often consider integrated water management as a foundation of the design process.

Department of Environmental Resources |date=January 2000 |title=Low-Impact Development Design Strategies, An Integrated Design Approach |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20004JX4.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-00-003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]], or [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]] (WSUD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsud.melbournewater.com.au/ |title=Water Sensitive Urban Design - Melbourne Water |publisher=Wsud.melbournewater.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Australia]], IWM has the potential to improve runoff quality, reduce the risk and impact of flooding and deliver an additional water resource to augment potable supply.

The development of the modern city often results in increased demands for water supply due to population growth, while at the same time altered runoff predicted by climate change has the potential to increase the volume of stormwater that can contribute to drainage and flooding problems.  IWM offers several techniques including stormwater harvest (to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding), [[Infiltration basin|infiltration]] (to restore the natural recharge of groundwater), biofiltration or [[bioretention]] (e.g., [[rain gardens]]) to store and treat runoff and release it at a controlled rate to reduce impact on streams and wetland treatments (to store and control runoff rates and provide habitat in urban areas).

There are many ways of achieving LID. The most popular is to incorporate land-based solutions to reduce stormwater runoff through the use of retention ponds, [[bioswale]]s, infiltration trenches, sustainable pavements (such as [[permeable paving]]), and others noted above.  LID can also be achieved by utilizing engineered, manufactured products to achieve similar, or potentially better, results as land-based systems (underground storage tanks, stormwater treatment systems, [[biofilter]]s, etc.).  The proper LID solution is one that balances the desired results (controlling runoff and pollution) with the associated costs (loss of usable land for land-based systems versus capital cost of manufactured solution). Green (vegetated) roofs are also another low cost solution.

IWM as a movement can be regarded as being in its infancy and brings together elements of drainage science, ecology and a realization that traditional drainage solutions transfer problems further downstream to the detriment of our environment and precious water resources.

==Regulations==

=== United States ===
{{Main article|United States regulation of point source water pollution}}

====Federal requirements====
[[File:National Map of Regulated MS4s 2009.png|thumb|Map of municipal separate storm sewer systems]]
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is charged with [[regulation|regulating]] stormwater pursuant to the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972 ("Clean Water Act"). {{USPL|92|500}}, October 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the CWA is to restore all "Waters of the United States" to their "fishable" and "swimmable" conditions. Point source discharges, which originate mostly from municipal [[wastewater]] ([[sewage]]) and industrial wastewater discharges, have been regulated since enactment of the CWA in 1972. Pollutant loadings from these sources are tightly controlled through the issuance of National Pollution Discharge Elimination System ([[NPDES]]) permits. However, despite these controls, thousands of water bodies in the U.S. remain classified as "impaired," meaning that they contain pollutants at levels higher than is considered safe by EPA for the intended beneficial uses of the water. Much of this impairment is due to polluted runoff, generally in urbanized watersheds (in other US watersheds, [[agricultural pollution]] is a major source).&lt;ref name="EPA-2004-wq-report"&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=National Water Quality Inventory: Report to Congress; 2004 Reporting Cycle |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-08-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

To address the nationwide problem of stormwater pollution, [[United States Congress|Congress]] broadened the CWA definition of "point source" in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and municipal separate [[storm sewer]] systems ("MS4"). These facilities are required to obtain NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Water Quality Act of 1987, {{USPL|100|4}}, February 4, 1987. Added CWA section 402(p), {{USC|33|1342(p)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, about 855 large municipal systems (serving populations of 100,000 or more), and 6,695 small systems are regulated by the permit system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-municipal-sources#overview |title=Overview |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017-07-21 |website=NPDES / Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Sources |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State and local requirements====
[[File:Silt fence EPA.jpg|thumb|A [[silt fence]], a type of [[sediment control]], installed on a construction site]]
EPA has authorized 47 states to issue NPDES permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2018-08-20 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to implementing the NPDES requirements, many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances, and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals.&lt;ref name="Washington Manual"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2009 |title=Maryland Stormwater Design Manual |url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Water/StormwaterManagementProgram/MarylandStormwaterDesignManual/Pages/programs/waterprograms/sedimentandstormwater/stormwater_design/index.aspx |publisher=Maryland Department of the Environment |location=Baltimore, MD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207105542/http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/Water/StormwaterManagementProgram/MarylandStormwaterDesignManual/Pages/programs/waterprograms/sedimentandstormwater/stormwater_design/index.aspx |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these state and local requirements have expanded coverage beyond the federal requirements. For example, the State of [[Maryland]] requires erosion and sediment controls on construction sites of 5,000 sq ft (460 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or more.&lt;ref&gt;State of Maryland. ''Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR).'' [http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/comarhtml/26/26.17.01.05.htm ''Activities for Which Approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plans are Required.''] Sec. 26.17.01.05.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for state agencies to revise their requirements and impose them upon counties and cities; daily fines ranging as high as $25,000 can be imposed for failure to modify their local stormwater permitting for construction sites, for instance.

====Nonpoint source pollution management====
{{Further information|Agricultural wastewater treatment|Erosion control}}
Agricultural runoff (except for concentrated animal feeding operations, or "[[CAFO]]") is classified as [[nonpoint source pollution]] under the CWA. It is not included in the CWA definition of "point source" and therefore not subject to NPDES permit requirements. The 1987 CWA amendments established a non-regulatory program at EPA for nonpoint source pollution management consisting of research and demonstration projects.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act sec. 319, {{USC|33|1329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Related programs are conducted by the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS) in the U.S. [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].
[[File:Prevent stormwater pollution - EPA.png|thumb|90px|Public education graphic distributed by EPA]]
==Public education campaigns==
Education is a key component of stormwater management. A number of agencies and organizations have launched campaigns to teach the public about stormwater pollution, and how they can contribute to solving it. Thousands of local governments in the U.S. have developed education programs as required by their NPDES stormwater permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-municipal-sources#developing |title=Developing an MS4 Program |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=NPDES/Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Sources |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a local educational program is that of the West Michigan Environmental Action Council (WMEAC), which has coined the term ''Hydrofilth'' to describe stormwater pollution,&lt;ref&gt;West Michigan Environmental Action Council (WMEAC), Grand Rapids, MI. [http://15toriver.tumblr.com/stophydrofilth "Stop Hydrofilth."] Accessed 2013-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of its "15 to the River" campaign. (During a rain storm, it may take only 15 minutes for contaminated runoff in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] to reach the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]].)&lt;ref&gt;WMEAC. [http://www.15totheriver.org "15 to the River"] Accessed 2013-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Its outreach activities include a [[rain barrel]] distribution program and materials for homeowners on installing [[rain garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;WMEAC. [http://raingardens.org "Rain Gardens... beautiful solutions for water pollution."] Accessed 2013-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other public education campaigns highlight the importance of [[green infrastructure]] in slowing down and treating stormwater runoff. [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] Stormwater Management launched the "Love Blue. Live Green." outreach campaign on social media sites to educate the public on green infrastructure and other [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] for stormwater runoff.&lt;ref&gt;DuPage County Stormwater Management. [http://www.dupageco.org/EDP/Stormwater_Management/Water_Quality/1377/ "Education and Outreach."] Accessed 2013-12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles, websites, pictures, videos and other media are disseminated to the public through this campaign.

==History==
Since humans began living in concentrated village or urban settings, stormwater runoff has been an issue.  During the [[Bronze Age]], housing took a more concentrated form, and [[impervious surface]]s emerged as a factor in the design of early [[human settlement]]s. Some of the early incorporation of stormwater engineering is evidenced in [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trimble |first=Stanley W. |authorlink= |title=Encyclopedia of Water Science |url= |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=0-8493-9627-1 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific example of an early stormwater runoff system design is found in the [[archaeological]] recovery at [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Phaistos]] on [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes "Phaistos Fieldnotes."] ''The Modern Antiquarian'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5626">The '''sustainable yield''' of [[natural capital]] is the [[ecological yield]] that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself, i.e. the surplus required to maintain [[ecosystem services]] at the same or increasing level over time.  This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the [[ecosystem]] to maintain itself, e.g. a [[forest]] that has recently suffered a [[blight]] or [[flooding]] or [[fire]] will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest.  While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less.

In fisheries, the basic natural capital, or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because dynamic ecological conditions and other factors  not  related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both the natural capital and its productivity.

==Maximum sustainable yield==
{{see also|Maximum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''maximum sustainable yield''' or '''MSY''' is, theoretically, the largest yield/catch that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Under the assumption of logistic growth, the MSY will be exactly at half the [[carrying capacity]] of a species, as this is the stage at when population growth is highest. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the [[optimum sustainable yield]].

This [[logistic function|logistic]] model of growth is produced by a population introduced to a new habitat or with very poor numbers going through a lag phase of slow growth at first. Once it reaches a foothold population it will go through a rapid growth rate that will start to level off once the species approaches carrying capacity. The idea of maximum sustained yield is to decrease population density to the point of highest growth rate possible. This changes the number of the population, but the new number can be maintained indefinitely, ideally.

In most fisheries, the population has been decreased so significantly from their native populations, that the only way to increase production is to decrease production, and wait for populations to recover. Establishing limits is a perennial difficulty.

MSY is extensively used for fisheries management. Unlike [[Milner Baily Schaefer#Schaefer short-term catch equation|Schaefer's logistic model]], MSY in most modern fisheries models occurs at around 30% of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.

Unfortunately errors in estimating the population dynamics of a species can lead to setting the maximum sustainable yield too high (or too low). An example of this was the New Zealand [[orange roughy]] fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the orange roughy lived a long time and had [[k-selection|bred slowly]] (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted.

==Optimum sustainable yield==
{{see also|Optimum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the [[Level of Effort|level of effort]] (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.

In [[environmental science]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield.

==Annual Sustainable Yield==
Annual Sustainable Yield (ASY) is defined as biomass that can be harvested from a fish population each year without resulting in a decline.  ASY is dynamic and is adjusted based on population levels and performance of previous years fisheries.

'''''The Final Circle of Paradise''''' ({{lang-ru|Хищные вещи века}}, literally ''Predatory Things of the Century'') is a [[science fiction]] novel by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]] (also spelled Strugatski or Strugatskii) set in the first half of the 21st century.  It was first published in the [[USSR]] in 1965 and the first English edition, translated by Leonid Renen, was published by [[DAW books]] in 1976.  The literal English translation of the original Russian title is "Predatory Things of Our Times".

This novel is a sequel of sorts to an earlier Strugatsky novel ''[[Space Apprentice]]'' (1962).  At the end of ''Space Apprentice'', flight engineer Ivan Zhilin gives up space travel for Earth, where "the most important things are" to make the solar system a better place for the young people of the world.  ''The Final Circle of Paradise'' takes place a little less than ten years after ''Space Apprentice'', in a medium-sized seaside resort city somewhere in Europe.  In the intervening time, he has been working for the security service of the World Council, an international governing body similar to but far more powerful than the [[United Nations]].  A few years before, Zhilin fought as part of an international brigade to put down a [[Fascist]] uprising in the same city where this story is set, reminiscent of the Soviet experience during the Second World War.  This was supposedly one of the "final" wars before universal disarmament, where the last of the fascists were finally defeated.  Like other Strugatsky novels, the setting is an internationalized future of advanced technology and world peace.  There is no iron curtain, cold war, or arms race.  Most of the world is permanently at peace, with the rest on the verge of being forcibly demilitarized.

==Plot summary==
Ivan Zhilin, posing as a writer working on a novel, visits a seaside resort city to investigate a series of mysterious deaths.  Zhilin's role as an undercover agent becomes apparent to the reader only gradually and is not brought into the open until the final chapters of the novel.

While being given a tour of the city, a tourism official tells Zhilin that he will get no work done, as he will be distracted by the "twelve circles of paradise" found in the city.  These include the Fishers, which provide thrill seekers with situations of extreme and potentially fatal terror, the Shivers, which electronically induce pleasurable dreams to large crowds of people, and the Society of Patrons of Arts, who procure priceless works of art and ritualistically destroy them.  The culture of this city has become utterly decadent, the product of an age of universal affluence.  Zhilin refers to the present state of the world as "the age of the boob" where the highest priority is placed on orgiastic pleasure and staving off boredom, to the neglect of culture, education and scientific progress.  The authors express the [[Marxist]] perspective in the scene of an argument between Zhilin and a third-world revolutionary:
{{quote|The great revolutionaries would not have accepted your shibboleth: now you are free – enjoy yourselves.  They spoke otherwise: now you are free – work.  After all, they never fought for abundance for the belly, they were interested in abundance for the soul and the mind.|(p. 158)}}

The ultimate expression of the decadence of Earth culture is the mysterious "slug", which is apparently responsible for the deaths that Zhilin is investigating.   At first Zhilin believes it to be some sort of narcotic, distributed by gangsters with secret laboratories and trafficking networks.  Zhilin progressively finds clues that lead him to Peck Xenai, a his former classmate and the last surviving member of his international unit that fought the Fascists some years before.  Peck, however, is physically ravaged by alcoholism and the use of "slug" and does not even recognize Zhilin when he finds him.  Zhilin succeeds in getting a "slug" from Peck, in the form of a small silver electronic component.  What Zhilin finds when he plugs the "slug" into his radio receiver and lies in the bathtub causes him to rethink the entire situation.

"Slug" turns out to be a way of generating an artificial reality significantly more intense than normal reality, to the point where there is virtually no comparison between our reality and that of the "slug".  People become addicted to it and spend increasing amounts of time unconscious in their bathtubs until it kills them by nervous exhaustion or brain hemorrhages.  This is "the final circle of paradise". It also turns out that the "slug" is not the work of gangsters or a secret laboratory, but is a common electronic component being used in a novel way.  If "slug" were to become widely known, Zhilin concludes, nothing would stop it from being used by millions the world over.  Zhilin, himself struggling not to use it a second time, concludes that "slug" represents "the end of progress".  He foresees humanity as a whole entering this illusory reality, which will eventually destroy mankind.

At the end of ''Space Apprentice'', Zhilin began to devote his life to making the solar system a better place for young people struggling to find purpose in the world.  At the end of this story, he leaves his work with the World Council to fight "the last war – the most bloodless and most difficult for its soldiers" (p. 170) – that of making life worth living for the millions caught unprepared in an age of affluence, so that they will never need anything like "slug".  However, even as Zhilin is saying this, at the end of the novel it is left ambiguous whether he thinks he will be able to resist using the "slug" again.

== Predictions ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35902">'''Trophic cascades''' are powerful indirect interactions that can control entire ecosystems, occurring when predators in a [[food web]] suppress the abundance or alter the behavior of their [[prey]], thereby releasing the next lower [[trophic level]] from [[predation]] (or [[herbivory]] if the intermediate trophic level is a herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large [[piscivore|piscivorous]] fish is increased in a [[lake]], the abundance of their prey, smaller fish that eat [[zooplankton]], should decrease. The resulting increase in zooplankton should, in turn, cause the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of its prey, [[phytoplankton]], to decrease.

The trophic cascade is an [[Ecology|ecological concept]] which has stimulated new research in many areas of ecology. For example, it can be important for understanding the knock-on effects of removing [[Apex predator|top predators]] from [[food web]]s, as humans have done in many places through [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].

A '''top-down cascade''' is a trophic cascade where the top consumer/predator controls the primary consumer population. In turn, the primary producer population thrives. The removal of the top predator can alter the food web dynamics. In this case, the primary consumers would overpopulate and exploit the primary producers. Eventually there would not be enough primary producers to sustain the consumer population. Top-down food web stability depends on competition and predation in the higher trophic levels. Invasive species can also alter this cascade by removing or becoming a top predator. This interaction may not always be negative. Studies have shown that certain invasive species have begun to shift cascades; and as a consequence, ecosystem degradation has been repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Novel crab predator causes marine ecosystem regime shift |journal=Scientific Reports |date=2018 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=4956 |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-23282-w |pmid=29651152 |pmc=5897427 |last1=Kotta |first1=J. |last2=Wernberg |first2=T. |last3=Jänes |first3=H. |last4=Kotta |first4=I. |last5=Nurkse |first5=K. |last6=Pärnoja |first6=M. |last7=Orav-Kotta |first7=H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Megrey, Bernard and Werner, Francisco |title=Evaluating the Role of Topdown vs. Bottom-up Ecosystem Regulation from a Modeling Perspective |url=https://pices.int/publications/presentations/PICES_13/PICES_13_S2/Megrey_S2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a '''bottom-up cascade''', the population of primary producers will always control the increase/decrease of the energy in the higher trophic levels. Primary producers are plants, phytoplankton and zooplankton that require photosynthesis. Although light is important, primary producer populations are altered by the amount of nutrients in the system. This food web relies on the availability and limitation of resources. All populations will experience growth if there is initially a large amount of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bottom-up linkages between primary production, zooplankton, and fish in a shallow, hypereutrophic lake |journal=Ecology |date=2018 |volume=99 |issue=9 |pages=2025–2036 |doi=10.1002/ecy.2414 |pmid=29884987 |last1=Matsuzaki |first1=Shin-Ichiro S. |last2=Suzuki |first2=Kenta |last3=Kadoya |first3=Taku |last4=Nakagawa |first4=Megumi |last5=Takamura |first5=Noriko }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trophic and environmental control in the North Sea |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=Feb 2017 |volume=114 |issue=8 |pages=1952–1957 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1621037114|pmid=28167770 |pmc=5338359 |last1=Lynam |first1=Christopher Philip |last2=Llope |first2=Marcos |last3=Möllmann |first3=Christian |last4=Helaouët |first4=Pierre |last5=Bayliss-Brown |first5=Georgia Anne |last6=Stenseth |first6=Nils C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a '''subsidy cascade''', species populations at one trophic level can be supplemented by external food. For example, native animals can forage on resources that don't originate in their same habitat, such a native predators eating livestock. This may increase their local abundances thereby affecting other species in the ecosystem and causing an ecological cascade. For example, Luskin et al (2017) found that native animals living protected primary rainforest in Malaysia found food subsidies in neighboring oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=8 |page=2231|doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsidy allowed native animal populations to increase, which then triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on forest tree community. Specically, crop-raiding wild boar (Sus scofa) built thousands of nests from the forest understory vegatation and this caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over a 24-year study period. Such cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

These trophic interactions shape patterns of biodiversity globally. Humans and climate change have affected these cascades drastically. One example can be seen with sea otters (Enhydra lutris) on the Pacific coast of the United States of America. Over time, human interactions caused a removal of sea otters. One of their main prey, the pacific purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) eventually began to overpopulate. The overpopulation caused increased predation of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). As a result, there was extreme deterioration of the kelp forests along the California coast. This is why it is important for countries to regulate marine and terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Trophic interactions among vertebrate guilds and plants shape global patterns in species diversity |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=2018 |volume=285 |issue=1883 |pages=20180949 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2018.0949 |pmid=30051871 |pmc=6083253 |last1=Zhang |first1=Jian |last2=Qian |first2=Hong |last3=Girardello |first3=Marco |last4=Pellissier |first4=Vincent |last5=Nielsen |first5=Scott E. |last6=Svenning |first6=Jens-Christian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of Kentucky Lecture Notes |url=http://www.uky.edu/Classes/ENT/530/Lecture_Notes/feb11/feb11_files/frame.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and theory ==
[[Aldo Leopold]] is generally credited with first describing the mechanism of a trophic cascade, based on his observations of overgrazing of mountain slopes by deer after human extermination of wolves.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. (1949) [http://www.missionwolf.org/page/thinking-leopold/ "Thinking like a mountain"] in "Sand county almanac"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Hairston]], Frederick E. Smith and [[Lawrence B. Slobodkin]] are generally credited with introducing the concept into scientific discourse, although they did not use the term either. Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin argued that predators reduce the abundance of herbivores, allowing [[plant]]s to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hairston | first1 = NG | last2 = Smith | first2 = FE | last3 = Slobodkin | first3 = LB | year = 1960 | title = Community structure, population control and competition | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 94 | issue = 879| pages = 421–425 | doi=10.1086/282146}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often referred to as the green world hypothesis. The green world hypothesis is credited with bringing attention to the role of top-down forces (e.g. predation) and indirect effects in shaping [[biocoenosis|ecological communities]]. The prevailing view of communities prior to Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin was trophodynamics, which attempted to explain the structure of communities using only bottom-up forces (e.g. resource limitation). Smith may have been inspired by the experiments of a Czech ecologist, [[Jaroslav Hrbáček|Hrbáček]], whom he met on a [[United States State Department]] cultural exchange. Hrbáček had shown that fish in artificial [[pond]]s reduced the abundance of [[zooplankton]], leading to an increase in the abundance of [[phytoplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hrbáček | first1 = J | last2 = Dvořakova | first2 = M | last3 = Kořínek | first3 = V | last4 = Procházkóva | first4 = L | year = 1961 | title = Demonstration of the effect of the fish stock on the species composition of zooplankton and the intensity of metabolism of the whole plankton association | url = | journal = Verh. Internat. Verein. Limnol | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 192–195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin feuded that the ecological communities acted as [[food chains]] with three trophic levels. Subsequent models expanded the argument to food chains with more than or fewer than three trophic levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oksanen | first1 = L | last2 = Fretwell | first2 = SD | last3 = Arruda | first3 = J | last4 = Niemala | first4 = P | year = 1981 | title = Exploitation ecosystems in gradients of primary productivity | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 118 | issue = 2| pages = 240–261 | doi=10.1086/283817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauri Oksanen argued that the top trophic level in a food chain increases the abundance of [[primary productivity|producers]] in food chains with an odd number of trophic levels (such as in Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin's three trophic level model), but decreases the abundance of the producers in food chains with an even number of trophic levels. Additionally, he argued that the number of trophic levels in a food chain increases as the productivity of the [[ecosystem]] increases.

== Criticisms ==
Although the existence of trophic cascades is not controversial, ecologists have long debated how ubiquitous they are. Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin argued that [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] [[ecosystems]], as a rule, behave as a three [[trophic level]] trophic cascade, which provoked immediate controversy. Some of the criticisms, both of Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin's model and of Oksanen's later model, were:
*[[Plant]]s possess numerous [[plant defense against herbivory|defenses]] against herbivory, and these defenses also contribute to reducing the impact of herbivores on plant populations.&lt;ref name="Murdoch 1966"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murdoch | first1 = WM | year = 1966 | title = Community structure, population control, and competition – a critique | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 100 | issue = 912| pages = 219–226 | doi=10.1086/282415}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Herbivore populations may be limited by factors other than food or predation, such as nesting sites or available territory.&lt;ref name="Murdoch 1966"/&gt;
*For trophic cascades to be ubiquitous, communities must generally act as food chains, with discrete trophic levels. Most communities, however, have complex [[food webs]]. In real food webs, consumers often feed at multiple trophic levels ([[omnivory]]), organisms often change their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] as they grow larger, [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]] occurs, and consumers are subsidized by inputs of resources from outside the local community, all of which blur the distinctions between trophic levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polis | first1 = GA | last2 = Strong | first2 = DR | year = 1996 | title = Food web complexity and community dynamics | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 147 | issue = 5| pages = 813–846 | doi=10.1086/285880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonistically, this principle is sometimes called the "trophic trickle".&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, Cristina (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LCyZI6Vbp0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Wolf%27s+Tooth:+Keystone+Predators,+Trophic+Cascades,+and+Biodiversity%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C-7qTrqsFeSUiAf07oWnBw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Wolf%27s%20Tooth%3A%20Keystone%20Predators%2C%20Trophic%20Cascades%2C%20and%20Biodiversity%22&amp;f=false "The Wolf's Tooth: Keystone Predators, Trophic Cascades, and Biodiversity] pp. 15.

== Classic examples ==
[[File:Kelp forest and sardines, San Clemente Island, Channel Islands, California.jpg|thumb|Healthy Pacific kelp forests, like this one at [[San Clemente Island]] of California's [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], have been shown to flourish when sea otters are present. When otters are absent, sea urchin populations can [[Irruptive growth|irrupt]] and severely degrade the kelp forest ecosystem.]]
Although Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin formulated their argument in terms of terrestrial food chains, the earliest empirical demonstrations of trophic cascades came from [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and, especially, [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Some of the most famous examples are:
* In [[North America]]n lakes, [[piscivore|piscivorous]] fish can dramatically reduce populations of zooplanktivorous fish, zooplanktivorous fish can dramatically alter [[freshwater]] [[zooplankton]] communities, and zooplankton grazing can in turn have large impacts on [[phytoplankton]] communities. Removal of piscivorous fish can change lake water from clear to green by allowing phytoplankton to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = SR | last2 = Kitchell | first2 = JF | last3 = Hodgson | first3 = JR | year = 1985 | title = Cascading trophic interactions and lake productivity | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 35 | issue = 10| pages = 634–639 | doi=10.2307/1309989| jstor = 1309989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]], in Northern [[California]], fish ([[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] and [[California roach|roach]]) consume fish larvae and predatory [[insect]]s. These smaller predators prey on [[midge]] larvae, which feed on [[algae]]. Removal of the larger fish increases the abundance of algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Power | first1 = ME | year = 1990 | title = Effects of fish in river food webs | url = | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4982| pages = 811–814 | doi=10.1126/science.250.4982.811| pmid = 17759974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[kelp forest]]s, [[sea otter]]s feed on [[sea urchin]]s. In areas where sea otters have been [[hunting|hunt]]ed to [[local extinction|extinction]], sea urchins increase in abundance and [[kelp]] populations are reduced.&lt;ref name="uwo.academia"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Szpak |first=Paul |last2=Orchard |first2=Trevor J. |last3=Salomon |first3=Anne K. |last4=Gröcke |first4=Darren R. |year=2013 |title=Regional ecological variability and impact of the maritime fur trade on nearshore ecosystems in southern Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada): evidence from stable isotope analysis of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) bone collagen | url=https://www.academia.edu/2568296 |journal=[[Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences (journal)|Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences]] |volume=In Press |issue=X |pages=XX |doi= 10.1007/s12520-013-0122-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Estes | first1 = JA | last2 = Palmisano | first2 = JF | year = 1974 | title = Sea otters: their role in structuring nearshore communities | url = | journal = Science | volume = 185 | issue = 4156| pages = 1058–1060 | doi=10.1126/science.185.4156.1058 | pmid=17738247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A classic example of a terrestrial trophic cascade is the reintroduction of [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] (''Canis lupus'') to [[Yellowstone National Park]], which reduced the number, and changed the behavior, of [[elk]] (''Cervus elaphus''). This in turn released several plant species from grazing pressure and subsequently led to the transformation of riparian ecosystems. This example of a trophic cascade is vividly shown and explained in the viral video "How Wolves Change Rivers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q "How Wolves Change Rivers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terrestrial trophic cascades ==
The fact that the earliest documented trophic cascades all occurred in lakes and [[stream]]s led Donald Strong to speculate that fundamental differences between aquatic and terrestrial [[food web]]s made trophic cascades primarily an aquatic phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strong | first1 = DR | year = 1992 | title = Are trophic cascades all wet? Differentiation and donor-control in speciose ecosystems | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 747–754 | doi=10.2307/1940154| jstor = 1940154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong argued that trophic cascades were restricted to communities with relatively low [[biodiversity|species diversity]], in which a small number of species could have overwhelming influence and the food web could operate as a linear food chain. Additionally, well documented trophic cascades at that point in time all occurred in food chains with algae as the [[primary producer]]. Trophic cascades, Strong argued, may only occur in communities with fast-growing producers which lack [[Plant defense against herbivory|defenses against herbivory]].

Subsequent research has documented trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems, including:
* In the [[California coastal prairie|coastal prairie]] of Northern California, [[yellow bush lupine]]s are fed upon by a particularly destructive herbivore, the root-boring caterpillar of the ghost moth. [[Entomopathogenic nematode]]s kill the caterpillars, and can increase the survival and [[seed]] production of lupines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strong | first1 = DR | last2 = Whipple | first2 = AV | last3 = Child | first3 = AL | last4 = Dennis | first4 = B | year = 1999 | title = Model selection for a subterranean trophic cascade: Root-feeding caterpillars and entomopathogenic nematodes | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 80 | issue = 8| pages = 2750–2761 | doi=10.2307/177255| jstor = 177255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preisser | first1 = EL | year = 2003 | title = Field evidence for a rapidly cascading underground food web | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 84 | issue = 4| pages = 869–874 | doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0869:fefarc]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Costa Rica]]n [[rain forest]], a [[Cleridae|Clerid]] [[beetle]] specializes in eating [[ant]]s. The ant ''Pheidole bicornis'' has a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] association with [[Piper (genus)|''Piper'']] plants: the ant lives on the ''Piper'' and removes [[caterpillar]]s and other [[insect]] herbivores. The Clerid beetle, by reducing the abundance of ants, increases the leaf area removed from ''Piper'' plants by insect herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Letourneau | first1 = DK | last2 = Dyer | first2 = LA | year = 1998 | title = Experimental test in lowland tropical forest shows top-down effects through four trophic levels | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 79 | issue = 5| pages = 1678–1687 | doi=10.2307/176787| jstor = 176787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics pointed out that published terrestrial trophic cascades generally involved smaller subsets of the food web (often only a single plant species). This was quite different from aquatic trophic cascades, in which the biomass of producers as a whole were reduced when predators were removed. Additionally, most terrestrial trophic cascades did not demonstrate reduced plant biomass when predators were removed, but only increased plant damage from herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polis | first1 = GA | last2 = Sears | first2 = ALW | last3 = Huxel | first3 = GR | display-authors = etal   | year = 2000 | title = When is a trophic cascade a trophic cascade? | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 15 | issue = 11| pages = 473–475 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)01971-6 | pmid=11050351}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear if such damage would actually result in reduced plant biomass or abundance. In 2002 a [[meta-analysis]] found trophic cascades to be generally ''weaker'' in terrestrial ecosystems, meaning that changes in predator biomass resulted in smaller changes in plant biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shurin | first1 = JB | last2 = Borer | first2 = ET | last3 = Seabloom | first3 = EW | last4 = Anderson | first4 = K | last5 = Blanchette | first5 = CA | last6 = Broitman | first6 = B | last7 = Cooper | first7 = SD | last8 = Halpern | first8 = BS | year = 2002 | title = A cross-ecosystem comparison of the strength of trophic cascades | url = | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 785–791 | doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00381.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a study published in 2009 demonstrated that multiple species of trees with highly varying [[Autoecology|autecologies]] are in fact heavily impacted by the loss of an apex predator.&lt;ref&gt;Beschta, R.L., and W.J. Ripple.  2009.  Large predators and trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems of the western United States Biological Conservation. 142, 2009: 2401-2414.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, published in 2011, demonstrated that the loss of large terrestrial predators also significantly degrades the integrity of river and stream systems, impacting their [[River morphology|morphology]], [[hydrology]], and associated biological communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beschta | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Ripple | first2 = W.J. | year = 2011 | title = The role of large predators in maintaining riparian plant communities and river morphology | url = | journal = Geomorphology | volume =  157–158| issue = | pages =  88–98| doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.04.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critics' model is challenged by studies accumulating since the reintroduction of [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] (''Canis lupus'') to [[Yellowstone National Park]]. The gray wolf, after being [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in the 1920s and absent for 70 years, was [[Wolf reintroduction|reintroduced]] to the park in 1995 and 1996. Since then a three-tiered trophic cascade has been reestablished involving wolves, [[elk]] (''Cervus elaphus''), and woody [[Browsing (herbivory)|browse]] species such as [[Populus tremuloides|aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides''), [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwoods]] (''Populus'' spp.), and [[willows]] (''Salix'' spp.). Mechanisms likely include actual wolf predation of elk, which reduces their numbers, and the threat of predation, which alters elk behavior and feeding habits, resulting in these plant species being released from intensive browsing pressure. Subsequently, their survival and [[Recruitment (biology)|recruitment]] rates have significantly increased in some places within Yellowstone's northern range. This effect is particularly noted among the range's [[riparian]] plant communities, with upland communities only recently beginning to show similar signs of recovery.&lt;ref name="rippbesch2012"/&gt;

Examples of this phenomenon include:

* A 2-3 fold increase in [[deciduous]] woody vegetation cover, mostly of willow, in the [[Soda Butte Creek]] area between 1995 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Groshong, L.C., 2004.

* Heights of the tallest willows in the Blacktail Creek area increased from less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm to more than 250&amp;nbsp;cm between 1997 and 2003. Additionally, canopy cover over streams increased significantly, from only 5% to a range of 14-73%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beschta | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Ripple | first2 = W.J. | year = 2007 | title = Increased Willow Heights along northern Yellowstone's Blacktail Deer Creek following wolf reintroduction | url = | journal = Western North American Naturalist | volume = 67 | issue = 4| pages = 613–617 | doi=10.3398/1527-0904(2007)67[613:iwhany]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the northern range, tall deciduous woody vegetation cover increased by 170% between 1991 and 2006.&lt;ref name="baril2009"/&gt;
* In the [[Lamar River|Lamar]] and Soda Butte Valleys the number of young cottonwood trees that had been successfully recruited went from 0 to 156 between 2001 and 2010.&lt;ref name="rippbesch2012"/&gt;

Trophic cascades also impact the [[biodiversity]] of ecosystems, and when examined from that perspective wolves appear to be having multiple, positive cascading impacts on the biodiversity of Yellowstone National Park. These impacts include:

[[File:Trophic Cascade 1.svg|right|thumb|200px|This diagram illustrates trophic cascade caused by removal of the top predator. When the top predator is removed the population of deer is able to grow unchecked and this causes over-consumption of the primary producers.]]

* [[Scavenger]]s, such as [[Corvus corax|ravens]] (''Corvus corax''), [[bald eagles]] (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''), and even [[grizzly bears]] (''Ursus arctos horribilis''), are likely subsidized by the carcasses of wolf kills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilmers | first1 = C.C. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2003| title = 2003.

* In the northern range, the relative abundance of six out of seven native songbirds which utilize willow was found to be greater in areas of willow recovery as opposed to those where willows remained suppressed.&lt;ref name="baril2009"&gt;Baril, L.M., 2009.

MS, Montana State University, Bozeman, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[American bison|Bison]] (''Bison bison'') numbers in the northern range have been steadily increasing as elk numbers have declined, presumably due to a decrease in [[interspecific competition]] between the two species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Painter | first1 = L.E. | last2 = Ripple | first2 = W.J. | year = 2012 | title = Effects of bison on willow and cottonwood in northern Yellowstone National Park | url = | journal = Forest Ecology and Management | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 150–158 | doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2011.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Importantly, the number of [[American beaver|beaver]] (''Castor canadensis'') colonies in the park has increased from one in 1996 to twelve in 2009. The recovery is likely due to the increase in willow availability, as they have been feeding almost exclusively on it. As [[keystone species]], the resurgence of beaver is a critical event for the region. The presence of beavers has been shown to positively impact streambank [[erosion]],  [[sediment]] retention, [[water table]]s, nutrient cycling, and both the diversity and abundance of plant and animal life among riparian communities.&lt;ref name="rippbesch2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ripple | first1 = W.J. | last2 = Beschta | first2 = R.L. | year = 2012 | title = Trophic cascades in Yellowstone: The first 15 years after wolf reintroduction | url = | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 205–213 | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2011.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of other examples of trophic cascades involving large terrestrial mammals, including:

* In both [[Zion National Park]] and [[Yosemite National Park]], the increase in human visitation during the first half of the 20th century was found to correspond to the decline of native [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor'') populations in at least part of their range. Soon after, native populations of [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus'') erupted, subjecting resident communities of cottonwoods (''Populus fremontii'') in Zion and [[California black oak]] (''Quercus kelloggii'') in Yosemite to intensified browsing. This halted successful recruitment of these species except in refugia inaccessible to the deer. In Zion the suppression of cottonwoods increased stream erosion and decreased the diversity and abundance of amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and wildflowers. In parts of the park where cougars were still common these negative impacts were not expressed and riparian communities were significantly healthier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ripple | first1 = W.J. | last2 = Beschta | first2 = R.L. | year = 2006 | title = Linking a cougar decline, trophic cascade, and catastrophic regime shift in Zion National Park | url = | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 133 | issue = 4| pages = 397–408 | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2006.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ripple | first1 = W.J. | last2 = Beschta | first2 = R.L. | year = 2008 | title = Trophic cascades involving cougar, mule deer, and black oaks in Yosemite National Park | url = | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 141 | issue = 5| pages = 1249–1256 | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2008.02.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the decline of [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'') and [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus'') populations has led to a rising population of [[olive baboon]] (''Papio anubis''). This case of [[mesopredator release]]  negatively impacted already declining [[ungulate]] populations and is one of the reasons for increased conflict between baboons and humans, as the primates raid crops and spread [[intestinal parasite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Estes | first1 = James A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011| title = 2011.

* In the Australian states of [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]], the presence or absence of [[Australian dingo|dingoes]] (''Canis lupus dingo'') was found to be inversely related to the abundance of invasive [[red fox]]es (''Vulpes vulpes''). In other words, the foxes were most common where the dingoes were least common. Subsequently, populations of an endangered prey species, the [[dusky hopping mouse]] (''Notomys fuscus'') were also less abundant where dingoes were absent due to the foxes, which consume the mice, no longer being held in check by the top predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Letnic | first1 = M. | last2 = Dworjanyn | first2 = S.A. | year = 2011 | title = Does a top predator reduce the predatory impact of an invasive mesopredator on an endangered rodent? | url = | journal = Ecography | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 827–835 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06516.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine trophic cascades==
In addition to the classic examples listed above, more recent examples of trophic cascades in [[marine ecosystem]]s have been identified:
* An example of a cascade in a complex, open-ocean ecosystem occurred in the northwest [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] during the 1980s and 1990s. The removal of [[Atlantic cod]] (''Gadus morhua'') and other ground fishes by sustained [[overfishing]] resulted in increases in the abundance of the prey species for these ground fishes, particularly smaller [[forage fish]]es and invertebrates such as the northern [[Chionoecetes|snow crab]] (''Chionoecetes opilio'') and northern [[shrimp]] (''Pandalus borealis''). The increased abundance of these prey species altered the community of [[zooplankton]] that serve as food for smaller fishes and invertebrates as an indirect effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trophic Cascades in a Formerly Cod-Dominated Ecosystem|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/308/5728/1621|journal = Science|date = 2005|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 15947186|pages = 1621–1623|volume = 308|issue = 5728|doi = 10.1126/science.1113075|language = |first = K. T.|last = Frank|first2 = B.|last2 = Petrie|first3 = J. S.|last3 = Choi|first4 = W. C.|last4 = Leggett}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A similar cascade, also involving the Atlantic cod, occurred in the [[Baltic Sea]] at the end of the 1980s. After a decline in Atlantic cod, the abundance of its main prey, the [[sprat]] (''Sprattus sprattus''), increased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alheit |first1=J |last2=Möllmann |first2=C |last3=Dutz|first3=J |last4=Kornilovs |first4=G |last5=Loewe |first5=P |last6=Mohrholz |first6=V |last7=Wasmund |first7=N |title=Synchronous ecological regime shifts in the central Baltic and the North Sea in the late 1980s |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|date=2005|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1205–1215|doi=10.1016/j.icesjms.2005.04.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Baltic Sea ecosystem shifted from being dominated by cod into being dominated by sprat. The next level of trophic cascade was a decrease in the abundance of ''Pseudocalanus acuspes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mollmann|first1=C.|last2=Muller-Karulis|first2=B.|last3=Kornilovs|first3=G.|last4=St John|first4=M.

* On [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] [[coral reef]]s, several species of angelfishes and [[parrotfish]]es eat species of [[sponge]]s that lack [[chemical defense]]s. Removal of these sponge-eating fish species from reefs by fish-trapping and netting has resulted in a shift in the sponge community toward fast-growing sponge species that lack chemical defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chemical defenses and resource trade-offs structure sponge communities on Caribbean coral reefs|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/11/4151|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2014|issn = 0027-8424|pmid = 24567392|pages = 4151–4156|volume = 111|issue = 11|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1321626111|language = |first = T.-L.|last = Loh|first2 = J.

'''Women's studies''' is an academic field that draws on [[Feminism|feminist]] and interdisciplinary methods in order to place women’s lives and experiences at the center of study, while examining [[Social constructionism|social and cultural constructs]] of [[gender]]; systems of privilege and oppression; and the relationships between power and gender as they intersect with other identities and social locations such as [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Social class|socio-economic class]], and [[Disability studies|disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's voices, feminist visions: classic and contemporary readings|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan M. |last2=Lee|first2=Janet|isbn=978-0078027000|edition=Sixth|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|oclc=862041473|date=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular theories within the field of women's studies include [[feminist theory]], [[standpoint theory]], [[intersectionality]], [[multiculturalism]], [[transnational feminism]], [[social justice]], [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] studies, [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[biopolitics]], [[materialism]]s, and embodiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0190872823|oclc=1002116432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research practices and methodologies associated with women's studies include [[ethnography]], [[autoethnography]], [[focus group]]s, surveys, community-based research, discourse analysis, and reading practices associated with [[critical theory]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist research practice: a primer|last=Hesse-Biber|first=Sharlene Nagy|isbn=9781412994972|edition=Second|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|oclc=838201827|date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field researches and critiques societal norms of [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Social class|class]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and other [[social inequalities]].

== History ==
In 1956 [[Australian]] feminist Madge Dawson took up a lectureship in the Department of Adult Education at [[Sydney University]] and began researching and teaching on the status of women. Dawson's course, "Women in a Changing World," focused on the socio-economic and political status of women in western Europe, becoming one of the first women's studies courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/30/1059480406739.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first accredited women's studies course in the U.S was held in 1969 at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDF5Ic-DL1wC&amp;pg=PA388|title=The Encyclopedia of Stress and Stress-related Diseases|last=Kahn|first=Ada P.|publisher=Facts on File|year=2006|isbn=978-0816059379|edition=2nd|page=388|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of intense organizing of women's [[consciousness raising group]]s, rallies, petition circulating, and operating unofficial or experimental classes and presentations before seven committees and assemblies, the first women's studies program in the United States was established in 1970 at [[San Diego State University|San Diego State College]] (now [[San Diego State University]]).&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite journal|last=Salper|first=Roberta|date=November 2011|title=San Diego State 1970: The Initial Year of the Nation's First Women's Studies Program|url=http://www.feministstudies.org/issues/vol-30-39/37-3.html|journal=[[Feminist Studies]]|volume=37|issue=3|pages=658–682|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/wsweb/|title=SDSU Women's Studies Department|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918042623/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/wsweb/|archivedate=18 September 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with [[Women's liberation movement|National Women's Liberation Movement]], students and community members created the AD HOC Committee for women's studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womensstudies.sdsu.edu/history.htm|title=History :: Department of Women's Studies at San Diego State University|website=womensstudies.sdsu.edu|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;The second women's studies program in the United States was established in 1971 at Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas. It was mostly formed though efforts by women in the English department, administration and community.&lt;ref&gt;Chinyere Okafor citing from The Center for Women's Studies' papers at WSU&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974 SDSU faculty members began a nationwide campaign for the integration of the department.

The first scholarly journal in interdisciplinary women's studies, ''Feminist Studies'', began publishing in 1972.&lt;ref name="FSAboutUs2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministstudies.org/aboutfs/history.html|title=History|publisher=Feminist Studies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Women's Studies Association]] (of the United States) was established in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/content.asp?pl=19&amp;contentid=19|title=NWSA|website=nwsa.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s saw the growth and development of women's studies courses and programs across universities in the U.S., while the field continued to grapple with backlash from both conservative groups and concerns from those within the women's movement about the white, [[Gender essentialism|essentialist]], and [[heterosexual privilege]] of those in the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230605794|edition=1st|location=New York|page=16|oclc=224444238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political aims of the feminist movement that compelled the formation of women's studies found itself at odds with the institutionalized academic feminism of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Studies on the Edge|last=Wiegman|first=Robyn|chapter=Feminism, Institutionalism, and the Idiom of Failure|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8223-4274-8|editor-last=Scott|editor-first=Joan Wallach|location=Durham|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "woman" as a concept continued to be expanded, the exploration of social constructions of gender led to the field's expansion into both gender studies and sexuality studies.

The field of women's studies continued to grow during the 1990s and into the 2000s with the expansion of universities offering majors, minors, and certificates in women's studies, gender studies, and feminist studies. The first Ph.D. program in Women's Studies was established at [[Emory University]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gs.emory.edu/academics/program_pages/gender.html|title=Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there were 16 institutions offering a Ph.D. in Women's Studies in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwsa.org/AF_institution_Directory.asp|title=NWSA|website=nwsa.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisguide.com/|title=Artemis Guide to Women's Studies in the U.S|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, UC Santa Cruz (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/|title=UC Santa Cruz – Feminist Studies|website=feministstudies.ucsc.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Kentucky-Lexington (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gws.as.uky.edu/phd-program-gws|title=PHD Program {{!}} Gender &amp; Women's Studies|website=gws.as.uky.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stony Brook University (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wgss/|title=Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|website=www.stonybrook.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oregon State University (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/school-language-culture-and-society/wgss/phd-women-gender-and-sexuality-studies|title=PhD in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies! {{!}} College of Liberal Arts {{!}} Oregon State University|website=liberalarts.oregonstate.edu|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced a Ph.D. in the field.

==  Theoretical traditions and research methods  ==
[[File:Students of Women and Gender Studies University of Haifa on training in writing in Wikipedia (1).jpg|thumb|300px|Students of Women and Gender Studies [[University of Haifa]]]]
Early women's studies courses and curricula were often driven by the question "where are the women?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Women's Studies – The Early Years: When Sisterhood Was Powerful|last=Rothenberg|first=Paula|title=The Evolution of American Women's Studies|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60579-4|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|location=New York|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, as more women were present in higher education as both students and faculty, questions arose about the male-centric nature of most courses and curricula. Women faculty in traditional departments such as history, English, and philosophy began to offer courses with a focus on women. Drawing from the women's movement's notion that "the personal is political," courses also began to develop around sexual politics, women's roles in society, and the ways in which women's personal lives reflect larger power structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolution of American women's studies: reflections on triumphs, controversies, and change|editor-last=Ginsberg|editor-first=Alice E.|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230605794|edition=1st|location=New York|page=69|oclc=224444238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, scholars of women's studies have taken [[post-modern]] approaches to understanding gender as it intersects with race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, age, and (dis)ability to produce and maintain power structures within society. With this turn, there has been a focus on language, subjectivity, and social hegemony, and how the lives of subjects, however they identify, are constituted. At the core of these theories is the notion that however one identifies, gender, sex, and sexuality are not intrinsic, but are socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwsa.org/Files/Resources/WS_Integrative_Learning_Levine.pdf|title=Questions for A New Century: Women's Studies and Integrative Learning|last=Levin|first=Amy K.|date=2007|website=www.nwsa.org|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major theories employed in women's studies courses include [[feminist theory]], [[intersectionality]], [[standpoint theory]], [[transnational feminism]], and [[social justice]]. Research practices associated with women's studies place women and the experiences of women at the center of inquiry through the use of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. Feminist researchers acknowledge their role in the production of knowledge and make explicit the relationship between the researcher and the research subject.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

=== Feminist theory ===

[[Feminist theory]] refers to the body of writing that works to address gender discrimination and disparities, while acknowledging, describing, and analyzing the experiences and conditions of women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist theory: a reader|last1=Kolmar|first1=Wendy K.|last2=Bartkowski|first2=Frances|year=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=9780073512358|edition=4th|location=New York|page=2|oclc=800352585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists and writers such as [[bell hooks]], [[Simone de Beauvoir|Simone de Beauvoir,]] [[Patricia Hill Collins]], and [[Alice Walker]] added to the field of feminist theory with respect to the ways in which race and gender mutually inform the experiences of women of color with works such as ''[[Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center]]'' (hooks), ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens]]'' (Walker), and ''[[Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment|Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment]]'' (Collins). Alice Walker coined the term [[womanism]] to situate black women's experiences as they struggle for social change and liberation, while simultaneously celebrating the strength of black women, their culture, and their beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Womanist reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|last=Phillips|first=Layli|isbn=9780415954112|location=New York|oclc=64585764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Hill Collin's contributed the concept of the "[[matrix of domination]]" to feminist theory, which reconceptualizes race, class, and gender as interlocking systems of oppression that shape experiences of privilege and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment|first=Patricia Hill|last=Collins|isbn=9780415964722|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=245597448|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersectionality ===

Associated with the third wave of feminism, [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]]'s theory of [[intersectionality]] is an approach to understanding how institutional structures mutually shape an individual's gendered, racial, and social status. Intersectional theory posits that these relationships must be considered in conversation with each other in order to understand hierarchies of power and privilege and they ways in which they manifest in an individual's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carastathis|first=Anna|date=2014-05-01|title=The Concept of Intersectionality in Feminist Theory|journal=Philosophy Compass|language=en|volume=9|issue=5|pages=304–314|doi=10.1111/phc3.12129|issn=1747-9991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standpoint theory ===

[[Standpoint theory]] developed in the 1980s as way of critically examining the production of knowledge and its resulting effects on practices of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The feminist standpoint theory reader: intellectual and political controversies|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|last=Harding|first=Sandra G.|isbn=978-0415945004|location=New York|page=2|oclc=51668081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory operates from the idea that knowledge is socially situated and, as a result, underrepresented groups and minorities have historically been ignored or marginalized when it comes to the production of knowledge. Emerging from Marxist thought, standpoint theory argues for analysis that challenges the authority of political and social "truths".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hekman|first=Susan|date=1997|title=Truth and Method: Feminist Standpoint Theory Revisited|jstor=3175275|journal=Signs|volume=22|issue=2|pages=341–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transnational feminist theory ===

[[Transnational feminism]] is concerned with the flow of social, political, and economic equality of women and men across borders, particularly in response to globalization, neoliberalism, and imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women worldwide: transnational feminist perspectives on women|last=Moghadam|first=Valentine M.|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|editor1-last=Lee|editor1-first=Janet|editor2-last=Shaw|editor2-first=Susan M.|year=|isbn=9780073512297|location=New York, NY|pages=15|chapter=Transnational Feminisms|oclc=436028205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies began incorporating transnational feminist theory into its curricula as a way to disrupt and challenge the ways knowledge is prioritized, transmitted, and circulates in the field and academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking women's and gender studies|last=Parisi|first=Laura|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|editor1-last=Orr|editor1-first=Catherine Margaret|editor2-last=Braithwaite|editor2-first=Ann|editor3-last=Lichtenstein|editor3-first=Diane Marilyn|isbn=9780415808316|location=New York|pages=326|chapter=Transnational|oclc=738351967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social justice ===

Since its inception and connection with the women's movement, activism has been a foundation of women's studies. Increasingly [[social justice]] has become a key component of women's studies courses, programs, and departments. Social justice theory is concerned with the fight for just communities, not on the individual level, but for the whole of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Justice: Theories, Issues, and Movements|last1=Capeheart|last2=Milovanovic|first2=Dragan|first1=Loretta|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813541686|location=Piscataway|page=2|oclc=437192947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies students engage in social justice projects, although some scholars and critics are concerned about requiring students to engage in mandated activism or social justice work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jennifer L. |first2=Susanne |last2=Luhmann |title=Social Justice for (University) Credit? The Women's and Gender Studies Practicum in the Neoliberal University. (Report) |journal=Resources for Feminist Research |volume=34 |issue=3–4 |year=2016 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Pedagogies  ==
In most institutions, women's studies courses employ [[feminist pedagogy]] in a triad model of equal parts research, theory, and praxis. The decentralization of the professor as the source of knowledge is often fundamental to women's studies classroom culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrewsbury|first=Carolyn M.|date=Fall 1987|title=What is feminist pedagogy?|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly, Special Issue: Feminist Pedagogy|volume=15|issue=3–4|pages=6–14|jstor=40003432|ref=harv}}
* ''See also'': {{Cite journal|last=Shrewsbury|first=Carolyn M.|date=Fall 1993|title=What is feminist pedagogy?|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly, Special Issue: Feminist Pedagogy: An Update|volume=21|issue=3–4|pages=8–16|jstor=40022001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are encouraged to take an active role in "claiming" their education, taking responsibility for themselves and the learning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rich |first=Adrienne |chapter=Claiming an Education |title=Open Questions |editor1-first=Chris |editor1-last=Anderson |editor2-first=Lex |editor2-last=Runciman |location=New York |publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's |year=2005 |pages=608–611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's studies programs and courses are designed to explore the [[intersectionality]] of gender, race, sexuality, class and other topics that are involved in identity politics and societal norms through a [[feminist]] lens. Women's studies courses focus on a variety of topics such as media literacy, sexuality, race and ethnicity, history involving women, queer theory, multiculturalism and other courses closely related. Faculty incorporate these components into classes across a variety of topics, including popular culture, women in the economy, reproductive and environmental justice, and women's health across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transforming Scholarship|last1=Berger|first1=Michele Tracy|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|edition=Second|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=35–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's studies programs are involved in social justice work and often design curricula that are embedded with theory and activism outside of the classroom setting. Some women's studies programs offer internships that are community-based allowing students the opportunity to experience how institutional structures of privilege and oppression directly affects women's lives. Women's studies curricula often encourage students to participate in [[service-learning]] activities in addition to discussion and reflection upon course materials. However, [[Daphne Patai]], from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has criticized this aspect of women's studies programs, arguing that they place politics over education, stating that "the strategies of faculty members in these programs have included policing insensitive language, championing research methods deemed congenial to women (such as qualitative over quantitative methods), and conducting classes as if they were therapy sessions."&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~korenman/wmst/fem_overhaul.html|title=Why Not A Feminist Overhaul of Higher Education?|last=Patai|first=Daphne|date=January 23, 1998|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since women's studies students analyze identity markers such as gender, race, class, and sexuality, this often results in dissecting institutionalized structures of power. As a result of these pedagogies, women's studies students leave university with a toolset to make social change and do something about power inequalities in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bubriski |first1=Anne |last2=Semaan |first2=Ingrid |year=2009 |title=Activist Learning vs. Service Learning in a Women's Studies Classroom |journal=Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable women's studies scholars include [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Patricia Hill Collins]], [[bell hooks]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Adrienne Rich]], and [[Barbara Ransby]].

A '''writer''' is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various [[report]]s and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express [[idea]]s well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magill |first1=Frank N.|title=Cyclopedia of World Authors|edition=revised  |volume=vols. I, II, III |year=1974 |publisher=Salem Press |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn= |pages=1–1973}} [A compilation of the bibliographies and short biographies of notable authors up to 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts – such as songwriter – but as a standalone "writer" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an [[oral tradition]].

Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media – for example, graphics or illustration – to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature. Some writers may use [[image]]s (drawing, painting, graphics) or [[multimedia]] to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.&lt;ref&gt;Nobel prize winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as producing their own written works, writers often write on ''how'' they write (that is, the process they use);&lt;ref name=Nicolson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''why'' they write (that is, their motivation);&lt;ref name=Blythe&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|title=Why I write: thoughts on the practice of fiction|year=c. 1998|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0316102296|editor=Will Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Franzen]], for example, criticised [[John Updike]] for being "exquisitely preoccupied with his own literary digestive processes ..." and his "lack of interest in the bigger postwar, postmodern, socio-technological picture" {{cite journal|last=Franzen|first=Jonathan|title=Franzen on Kraus: Footnote 89|journal=The Paris Review|date=6 September 2013|issue=206|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/category/issue-206/|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance), or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are never paid for their work.

The term ''writer'' is often used as a synonym of ''author'', although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.

==Types==
Writers choose from a range of [[literary genre]]s to express their ideas. Most writing can be adapted for use in another medium. For example, a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film. Satire for example, may be written as a poem, an essay, a film, a comic play, or a piece of journalism. The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.

Many writers work across genres. The genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted: novel to film; poem to play; history to musical. Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another. For example, historian [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] began in the genre of [[travel literature]] and also writes as a journalist. Many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two. For example, writers of [[historical romance]]s, such as [[Georgette Heyer]], invent characters and stories set in historical periods. In this genre, the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated. Some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis, sometimes using different names to separate their work. [[Dorothy L. Sayers|Dorothy Sayers]], for example, wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright, essayist, translator, and critic.

He had done for her all that a man could,
And some might say, more than a man should,
Then was ever a flame so recklessly blown out
Or a last goodbye so negligent as this?
‘I will write to you,' she muttered briefly,
Tilting her cheek for a polite kiss;
Then walked away, nor ever turned about.  ...

Long letters written and mailed in her own head –
There are no mails in a city of the dead.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;
}}
Poets make maximum use of the language to achieve an emotional and sensory effect as well as a cognitive one. To create these effects, they use [[rhyme]] and rhythm and they also exploit the properties of words with a range of other techniques such as [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]]. A common theme is love and its vicissitudes. [[Shakespeare]]'s famous love story ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', for example, written in a variety of poetic forms, has been performed in innumerable theatres and made into at least eight cinematic versions.&lt;ref&gt;1936, 1954, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1978, 2013, 2014. [https://www.imdb.com/find?q=Romeo+and+Juliet&amp;s=all IMDb listing.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]] is another poet renowned for his love poetry.

====Novelist====
{{Main|Novelist}}

Novelists write novels – stories that explore universal themes through fiction. They situate invented characters and plots in a narrative designed to be both credible and entertaining.
{{Quotation|''Every novel worthy of the name is like another planet, whether large or small, which has its own laws just as it has its own flora and fauna. Thus, [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]'s technique is certainly the best one with which to paint Faulkner's world, and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s nightmare has produced its own myths that make it communicable. [[Benjamin Constant]], [[Stendhal]], [[Eugène Fromentin]], [[Jacques Rivière]], [[Raymond Radiguet|Radiguet]], all used different techniques, took different liberties, and set themselves different tasks.''&lt;br /&gt;[[François Mauriac]], novelist&lt;ref name="Le Marchand"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Marchand|first=Jean|title=Interviews: François Mauriac, The Art of Fiction No. 2|journal=The Paris Review|date=Summer 1953|issue= 2|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5197/the-art-of-fiction-no-2-franois-mauriac|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Satirist====
{{Main|Satire}}

A satirist uses wit to ridicule the shortcomings of society or individuals, with the intent of exposing stupidity. Usually, the subject of the satire is a contemporary issue such as ineffective political decisions or politicians, although human vices such as [[greed]] are also a common and universal subject. Philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote a satire about optimism called ''[[Candide]]'', which was subsequently turned into an opera, and many well known lyricists wrote for it. There are elements of [[Absurdism]] in ''Candide'', just as there are in the work of contemporary satirist [[Barry Humphries]], who writes comic satire for his character [[Dame Edna Everage]] to perform on stage.

Satirists use various techniques such as [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], and [[hyperbole]] to make their point and they choose from the full range of genres – the satire may be in the form of prose or poetry or dialogue in a film, for example. One of the most famous satirists is [[Jonathan Swift]] who wrote the four-volume work ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and many other satires, including ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' and ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''.

{{Quotation|''It is amazing to me that ... our age is almost wholly illiterate and has hardly produced one writer upon any subject.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Jonathan Swift]], satirist (1704)&lt;ref&gt;The Epistle Dedicatory of ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]''. For text at Wikisource, see [[s:A Tale of a Tub|''A Tale of a Tub'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Short story writer====
{{Main|Short story}}
A short story writer is a writer of short stories, works of fiction that can be read in a single sitting.

===Performative===
====Librettist====
[[File:Wagner Luzern 1868.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Richard Wagner]], who also wrote the libretti for his works]]
{{Main|Libretto}}
Libretti (the plural of libretto) are the texts for musical works such as operas. The Venetian poet and librettist [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], for example, wrote the libretto for some of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s greatest operas. [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Giuseppe Giacosa]] were Italian librettists who wrote for [[Giacomo Puccini]]. Most opera composers collaborate with a librettist but unusually, [[Richard Wagner]] wrote both the music and the libretti for his works himself.
{{Quotation|''Chi son? Sono poeta. Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo.''
("Who am I? I'm a poet. What do I do? I write. And how do I live? I live.")&lt;br /&gt;Rodolpho, in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]''&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of Rodolpho's aria in Act I of ''[[La bohème]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lyricist====
{{Main|Lyricist}}
Usually writing in verses and choruses, a lyricist specializes in writing [[lyrics]], the words that accompany or underscore a song or opera. Lyricists also write the words for songs. In the case of [[Tom Lehrer]], these were satirical. Lyricist [[Noël Coward]], who wrote musicals and songs such as "[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]" and the recited song "[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]", also wrote plays and films and performed on stage and screen as well. Writers of lyrics, such as these two, adapt other writers' work as well as create entirely original pieces.
{{Quotation|''Making lyrics feel natural, sit on music in such a way that you don't feel the effort of the author, so that they shine and bubble and rise and fall, is very, very hard to do.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Sondheim]], lyricist&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipton|first=James|title=Interview: Stephen Sondheim, The Art of the Musical|journal=The Paris Review|date=Spring 1997|issue= 142|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1283/the-art-of-the-musical-stephen-sondheim|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Playwright====
[[File:FF The Tempest title.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' from the 1623 [[First Folio]]]]
{{Main|Playwright}}

A playwright writes plays which may or may not be performed on a stage by actors. A play's narrative is driven by dialogue. Like novelists, playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances. As writers, playwrights must make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole. Since most plays are performed, rather than read privately, the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience's attention over the period of the performance. Plays tell "a story the audience should care about", so writers have to cut anything that worked against that.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/magazine/posts/2015/november/feature-mike-bartlett-kciii?fptd_mode=validation|title=Mike Bartlett on writing King Charles III|last=Bartlett|first=Mike|date=18 November 2015|website=Sydney Theatre Company Magazine|publisher=Sydney Theatre Company|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plays may be written in prose or verse. Shakespeare wrote plays in [[iambic pentameter]] as does [[Mike Bartlett (playwright)|Mike Bartlett]] in his play ''King Charles III'' (2014).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Playwrights also adapt or re-write other works, such as plays written earlier or literary works originally in another genre. Famous playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] or [[Anton Chekhov]] have had their works adapted many times. The plays of early Greek playwrights [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], and [[Aeschylus]] are still performed. Adaptations of a playwright's work may be faithful to the original or creatively interpreted. If the writers' purpose in re-writing the play is to produce a film, they will have to prepare a screenplay. Shakespeare's plays, for example, while still regularly performed in the original form, are often adapted and abridged, especially for the [[filmmaking|cinema]]. An example of a creative modern adaptation of a play that nonetheless used the original writer's words, is [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The amendment of the name to ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' indicates to the audience that the version will be different from the original. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is a play inspired by Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' that takes two of Shakespeare's most minor characters and creates a new play in which they are the protagonists.

{{Quotation|'''''Player''''': ''It's what the actors do best. They have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is dying. They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly or from a great height.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Tom Stoppard]], [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]] (Act Two)&lt;ref name=Stoppard&gt;{{cite book|last=Stopppard|first=Tom|title=Rosencrantz and Guildentern Are Dead|year=1967|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=0-571-08182-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Screenwriter====
{{Main|Screenwriter}}

Screenwriters write a screenplay – or script – that provides the words for media productions such as films, television programs and video games. Screenwriters may start their careers by writing the screenplay [[Spec script|speculatively]]; that is, they write a script with no advance payment, solicitation or contract. On the other hand, they may be employed or commissioned to adapt the work of a playwright or novelist or other writer. Self-employed writers who are paid by contract to write are known as [[freelancer]]s and screenwriters often work under this type of arrangement.

Screenwriters, playwrights and other writers are inspired by the great [[Theme (arts)|themes]] and often use similar and familiar plot devices to explore them. For example, in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' is a "play within a play", which the hero uses to demonstrate the king's guilt. Hamlet gains the co-operation of the actors to set up the play as a thing "wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king".&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2|The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2]]'', (Act II, Sc.2, line 609)&lt;/ref&gt; [[teleplay]] writer [[Joe Menosky]] deploys the same "play within a play" device in an episode of the science fiction [[Television program#Seasons/series|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. The bronze-age playwright/hero enlists the support of a ''Star Trek'' crew member to create a play that will convince the ruler (or "patron" as he is called), of the futility of war.&lt;ref&gt;See Season 6, Episode 22: [[Muse (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Muse", ''(Star Trek: Voyager)'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speechwriter====
{{Main|Speechwriter}}
A speechwriter prepares the text for a [[Public speaking|speech]] to be given before a group or crowd on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose. They are often intended to be persuasive or inspiring, such as the speeches given by skilled orators like [[Cicero]]; charismatic or influential political leaders like [[Nelson Mandela]]; or for use in a court of law or parliament. The writer of the speech may be the person intended to deliver it, or it might be prepared by a person hired for the task on behalf of someone else. Such is the case when speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in both government and private sectors.

===Interpretive and academic===
====Biographer====
{{Main|List of biographers}}
Biographers write an account of another person's life. [[Richard Ellmann]] (1918–1987), for example, was an eminent and award-winning biographer whose work focused on the Irish writers [[James Joyce]], [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]], and [[Oscar Wilde]]. For the Wilde biography, he won the 1989 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]].

====Critic====
{{Main|Critic}}
Critics consider and assess the extent to which a work succeeds in its purpose. The work under consideration may be literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or architectural. In assessing the success of a work, the critic takes account of why it was done – for example, why a text was written, for whom, in what style, and under what circumstances. After making such an assessment, critics write and publish their evaluation, adding the value of their scholarship and thinking to substantiate any opinion. The theory of criticism is an area of study in itself: a good critic understands and is able to incorporate the theory behind the work they are evaluating into their assessment.&lt;ref name=Habib&gt;For example, see {{cite book|last=Habib|first= M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=MA, USA; Oxford, UK; Victoria, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics are already writers in another genre. For example, they might be novelists or essayists. Influential and respected writer/critics include the art critic [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867) and the literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] (born 1965), both of whom have books published containing collections of their criticism. Some critics are poor writers and produce only superficial or unsubstantiated work. Hence, while anyone can be an uninformed critic, the notable characteristics of a good critic are understanding, insight, and an ability to write well.

{{Quotation|''We can claim with at least as much accuracy as a well-known writer claims of his little books, that no newspaper would dare print what we have to say. Are we going to be very cruel and abusive, then? By no means: on the contrary, we are going to be impartial. We have no friends – that is a great thing – and no enemies.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Charles Baudelaire]], introducing his Review of the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1845&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Baudelaire – Art in Paris 1845–1862: Reviews of Salons and other exhibitions|year=1965|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|page=1|editor = Jonathan Mayne (editor and translator)|chapter=The Salon of 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Editor====
{{Main|Editing|Copywriting}}
[[File:Un Cœur simple (manuscrito).jpg|thumb|Flaubert's heavily edited page of his manuscript for [[Three Tales (Flaubert)#"A Simple Heart"|Un Cœur simple]]]]

An editor prepares literary material for publication. The material may be the editor's own original work but more commonly, an editor works with the material of one or more other people. There are different types of editor. [[Copy editing|Copy editors]] format text to a particular style and/or correct errors in grammar and spelling without changing the text substantively. On the other hand, an editor may suggest or undertake significant changes to a text to improve its readability, sense or structure. This latter type of editor can go so far as to excise some parts of the text, add new parts, or restructure the whole. The work of editors of ancient texts or [[manuscript]]s or collections of works results in differing editions. For example, there are many editions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays by notable editors who also contribute original introductions to the resulting publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Beverley Ellison|title=Famous Introductions to Shakespeare's Plays by the Notable Editors of the Eighteenth Century (1906)|date = 2012|publisher=HardPress|isbn=1290807086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors who work on journals and newspapers have varying levels of responsibility for the text – they may write original material, in particular, editorials; select what is to be included from a range of items on offer; format the material; or check its accuracy.

====Encyclopaedist====
[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|Sculpture in Berlin depicting a stack of books on which are inscribed the names of great writers: [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]; [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]; [[Thomas Mann|Mann]]; [[Theodor Fontane|Fontane]]; [[Hermann Hesse|Hesse]]; [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]; [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]; [[Heinrich Böll|Böll]]; [[Karl Marx|Marx]]; [[Brothers Grimm]]; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]; [[Anna Seghers|Seghers]]; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]; [[Martin Luther|Luther]]; [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]; [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]]; [[Günter Grass|Grass]] ]]

{{Main|Encyclopedia}}
Encyclopaedists create organised bodies of knowledge. [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) is renowned for his contributions to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The encyclopaedist [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] (1499–1590) was a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] whose ''Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España'' is a vast encyclopedia of [[Mesoamerica]]n civilisation, commonly referred to as the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'', after the Italian manuscript library which holds the best preserved copy.

====Essayist====
{{Main|List of essayists}}

Essayists write essays, which are original pieces of writing of moderate length in which the author makes a case in support of an opinion. They are usually in [[prose]], but some writers have used poetry to present their argument.

====Historian====
{{See also|List of historians}}
A historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it.&lt;ref name="wordnetprinceton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Historian |title= Historian |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a historian is to employ [[Historiography|historical analysis]] to create coherent narratives that explain "what happened" and "why or how it happened". Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton and Robert B. Townsend, "The Parlous Paths of the Profession" [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2008/0810/0810pro1.cfm ''Perspectives on History'' (Sept. 2008) online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]]'s six volume ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' influenced the development of [[historiography]].

====Lexicographer====
{{Main|Lexicography}}
Writers who create dictionaries are called lexicographers. One of the most famous is [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784), whose ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' was regarded not only as a great personal scholarly achievement but was also dictionary of such pre-eminence, that would have been referred to by such writers as [[Jane Austen]].

====Researcher/Scholar====
{{Main|Research|Scholarly method}}
[[File:Chomsky 4 - On the elite's view of the poor.ogg|thumb|left|One of many interviews with prolific American writer, philosopher, linguist, scientist, historian and critic [[Noam Chomsky]] (2009)]]

Researchers and scholars who write about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society. Scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise the way people think and how they behave. Three of the best known examples of such a revolutionary effect are [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who wrote ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (1543); [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859); and [[Sigmund Freud]], who wrote ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899).

These three highly influential, and initially very controversial, works changed the way people understood their place in the world. Copernicus's [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the cosmos displaced humans from their previously accepted place at the centre of the universe; Darwin's evolutionary theory placed humans firmly within, as opposed to above, the order of nature; and Freud's ideas about the power of the [[unconscious mind]] overcame the belief that humans were consciously in control of all their own actions.&lt;ref name=Weinert&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinert|first=Friedel|title=Copernicus, Darwin and Freud: Revolutions in the History and Philosophy of Science|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Malden, Massachusetts, USA; Oxford UK;|isbn=978-1-4051-8184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Translator====
{{Main|Translation}}
Translators have the task of finding some equivalence in another language to a writer's meaning, intention and style. Translators whose work has had very significant cultural effect include [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar]], who translated ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Arabic]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]], who deciphered [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] with the result that he could publish the first translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] hieroglyphs in 1822. Difficulties with translation are exacerbated when words or phrases incorporate rhymes, rhythms, or [[pun]]s; or when they have connotations in one language that are non-existent in another. For example, the title of ''[[Le Grand Meaulnes]]'' by [[Alain-Fournier]] is supposedly untranslatable because "no English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple [French] word 'grand' which takes on overtones as the story progresses."&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title="Introduction" to the English translation of "Le Grand Meaulnes"|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=9780141441894|page=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators have also become a part of events where political figures who speak different languages meet to look into the relations between countries or solve political conflicts. It is highly critical for the translator to deliver the right information as a drastic impact could be caused if any error occurred. 

{{Quotation|''Even if translation is impossible – we have no choice but to do it: to take the next step and start translating. ... The translator's task is to make us either forget or else enjoy the difference.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Dessaix]], translator, author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dessaix|first=Robert|title="Dandenongs Gothic: On Translation" in (and so forth)|year=1998|publisher=Pan McMillan Australia Ltd|location=Sydney|isbn=0-7329-0943-0|pages=307|authorlink=Robert Dessaix}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reportage===

====Blogger====
{{Main|Blog}}
Writers of blogs, which have appeared on the [[World Wide Web]] since the 1990s, need no authorisation to be published. The contents of these short opinion pieces or "posts" form a commentary on issues of specific interest to readers who can use the same technology to interact with the author, with an immediacy hitherto impossible. The ability to link to other sites means that some blog writers – and their writing – may become suddenly and unpredictably popular. [[Malala Yousafzai]], a young Pakistani education activist, rose to prominence because of her blog for [[BBC]].

A blog writer is using the technology to create a message that is in some ways like a newsletter and in other ways, like a personal letter.  "The greatest difference between a blog and a photocopied school newsletter, or an annual family letter photocopied and mailed to a hundred friends, is the potential audience and the increased potential for direct communication between audience members".&lt;ref name=Rettburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Rettberg|first=Jill Walker|title=Blogging|year=2008|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK; Malden, Massachusetts USA|isbn=978-0-7456-4133-1|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as with other forms of letter, the writer knows some of the readers, but one of the main differences is that "some of the audience will be random" and "that presumably changes the way we [writers] write."&lt;ref name=Rettburg /&gt; It has been argued that blogs owe a debt to Renaissance essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]], whose ''Essais'' ("attempts"), were published in 1580, because Montaigne "wrote as if he were chatting to his readers: just two friends, whiling away an afternoon in conversation".&lt;ref name=Bakewell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=What Bloggers Owe Montaigne|journal=The Paris Review|date=12 November 2010|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/11/12/what-bloggers-owe-montaigne/|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Columnist====
{{Main|Columnist}}
Columnists write regular pieces for newspapers and other periodicals, usually containing a lively and entertaining expression of opinion. Some columnists have had collections of their best work published as a collection in a book, so that readers can re-read what would otherwise be no longer available. Columns are quite short pieces of writing so columnists often write in other genres as well. An example is the columnist [[Elizabeth Farrelly]], who besides being a columnist, is also an architecture critic and author of books.

====Diarist====
{{Main|List of diarists}}
[[File:Anne Frank signature.svg|thumb|Signature of [[Anne Frank]]]]
Writers who record their experiences, thoughts or feelings in a sequential form over a period of time in a diary are known as diarists. Their writings can provide valuable insights into historical periods, specific events or individual personalities. Examples include [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703), an English administrator and Member of Parliament, whose detailed private diary provides eyewitness accounts of events during the 17th century, most notably of the [[Great Fire of London]]. [[Anne Frank]] (1929–1945) was a 13-year-old girl whose diary from 1942 to 1944 records both her experiences as a persecuted Jew in World War II and an adolescent dealing with intra-family relationships.

====Journalist====
{{Main|Journalism}}
Journalists write reports about current events after investigating them and gathering information. Some journalists write reports about predictable or scheduled events such as social or political meetings. Others are [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] who need to undertake considerable research and analysis in order to write an explanation or account of something complex that was hitherto unknown or not understood. Often investigative journalists are reporting criminal or corrupt activity which puts them at risk personally and means that what it is likely that attempts may be made to attack or suppress what they write. An example is [[Bob Woodward]], a journalist who investigated and wrote about [[Watergate scandal|criminal activities by the US President]].
{{Quotation| ''Journalism ... is a public trust, a responsibility, to report the facts with context and completeness, to speak truth to power, to hold the feet of politicians and officials to the fire of exposure, to discomfort the comfortable, to comfort those who suffer.''&lt;br /&gt;Geoffrey Barker, journalist.&lt;ref name="Barker and de Brito"&gt;Barker and de Brito, controversially lamenting the preference for looks over experience in televised journalism. {{cite news|last=Geoffrey Barker|title=Switch off the TV babes for some real news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/switch-off-the-tv-babes-for-some-real-news-20130501-2it0o.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=May 2, 2013}} {{cite news|last=Sam de Brito|title=Reality's bite worse than Barker|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/culture/blogs/all-men-are-liars/realitys-bite-worse-than-barker-20130502-2ivq8.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Memoirist====
{{Main|Memoir}}

Writers of memoirs produce accounts from the memories of their own lives, which are deemed unusual, important, or scandalous enough to be of interest to general readers. Although intended to be factual, readers are alerted to the likelihood of some inaccuracies or bias towards an idiosyncratic perception by the choice of genre. A memoir, for example, is allowed to have a much more selective set of experiences than an autobiography which is expected to be more complete and make a greater attempt at balance. Famous memoirists include [[Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane]], and [[Giacomo Casanova]].

===Utilitarian===

====Ghostwriter====
{{Main|Ghostwriter}}
Ghostwriters write for, or in the style of, someone else so the credit goes to the person on whose behalf the writing is done.

====Letter writer====
[[File:Kusakabe Kimbei - Writing Letter (large).jpg|thumb|''Writing Letter''&lt;br /&gt;(Photograph by [[Kusakabe Kimbei]])]]

{{Main|Letter (message)}}
Writers of letters use a reliable form of transmission of messages between individuals, and surviving sets of letters provide insight into the motivations, cultural contexts, and events in the lives of their writers. [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142), philosopher, logician, and theologian is known not only for the heresy contained in some of his work, and the punishment of having to burn his own book, but also for the letters he wrote to [[Héloïse (abbess)|Héloïse d'Argenteuil]] {{nowrap|(1090?–1164)}}.&lt;ref&gt;For text see [[s:Letters of Abélard and Héloïse|Letters of Abélard and Héloïse]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters (or [[epistle]]s) of [[Paul the Apostle]] were so influential that over the 2000 years of Christian history, Paul became "second only to Jesus in influence and the amount of discussion and interpretation generated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to St. Paul in the Middle Ages|year=2013|publisher=Koninklijke, Brill, NV|location=Leiden The Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-23672-1 |pages=1|editor=Steven R. Cartwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul and the Legacies of Paul|year=1990|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|location=Dallas|editor=William S. Babcock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nla.ms-ms5393-2-s1.jpg|thumb|left|Water damaged unpublished autograph manuscript page of [[William Bligh|Bligh]]'s voyage in the launch of {{HMS|Bounty}}, from the ship to [[Tofua]] and from thence to [[Timor]] April 28 to June 14, 1789, after the ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny]]''. It contains notes used later as the basis for his report and all his subsequent narratives.]]

====Report writer====
{{Main|Report}}

Report writers are people who gather information, organise and document it so that it can be presented to some person or authority in a position to use it as the basis of a decision. Well-written reports influence policies as well as decisions. For example, [[Florence Nightingale]] (1820–1910) wrote reports that were intended to effect administrative reform in matters concerning health in the army. She documented her experience in the [[Crimean War]] and showed her determination to see improvements: "...after six months of incredible industry she had put together and written with her own hand her ''Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army.'' This extraordinary composition, filling more than eight hundred closely printed pages, laying down vast principles of far-reaching reform, discussing the minutest detail of a multitude of controversial subjects, containing an enormous mass of information of the most varied kinds – military, statistical, sanitary, architectural" became for a long time, the "leading authority on the medical administration of armies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=Lytton|title=[[Eminent Victorians]]|year=1918|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=0-14-000649-4|pages=142–3|edition=1981|authorlink=Lytton Strachey|chapter=Florence Nightingale – 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British army : founded chiefly on the experience of the late war|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/notes-on-matters-affecting-the-health-efficiency-and-hospital-administration-of-the-british-army-founded-chiefly-on-the-experience-of-the-late-war/oclc/7660327|work=Adelaide Nutting historical nursing collection, AN 0054.|publisher=London : Harrison and Sons, 1858|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logs and reports of [[Master mariner]] [[William Bligh]] contributed to his being honourably acquitted at the [[court-martial]] inquiring into the loss of {{HMS|Bounty}}.

====Scribe====
[[File:The Letter Writer.jpg|thumb|Scribe in India taking instructions from a client]]
{{Main|Scribe}}

A scribe writes ideas and information on behalf of another, sometimes copying from another document, sometimes from oral instruction on behalf of an illiterate person, sometimes transcribing from another medium such as a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recording]], [[shorthand]], or personal notes.

Being able to write was a rare achievement for over 500 years in Western Europe so monks who copied texts were scribes responsible for saving many texts from classical times. The monasteries, where monks who knew how to read and write lived, provided an environment stable enough for writing. Irish monks, for example, came to Europe in about 600 and "found manuscripts in places like [[Tours]] and [[Toulouse]]" which they copied.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|title=Civilisation|year=1969|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=0-14-016589-4|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monastic writers also illustrated their books with highly skilled art work using gold and rare colours.

====Technical writer====
{{Main|Technical writer}}

A technical writer prepares instructions or manuals, such as [[user guide]]s or [[owner's manual]]s for users of equipment to follow. Technical writers also write various procedures for business, professional or domestic use. Since the purpose of technical writing is practical rather than creative, its most important quality is clarity. The technical writer, unlike the creative writer, is required to adhere to the relevant [[style guide]].

==Process and methods==

===Writing process===
[[File:Carlyle manuscript burning Japan cph.3g10399.tif|thumb|Japanese print depicting [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s horror at his manuscript burning]]
{{main|Writing process}}
There is a range of approaches that writers take to the task of writing. Each writer needs to find their own process and most describe it as more or less a struggle.&lt;ref name=Older&gt;{{cite news|last1=Older|first1=Daniel José|title=Writing Begins With Forgiveness: Why One of the Most Common Pieces of Writing Advice Is Wrong|url=http://sevenscribes.com/writing-begins-with-forgiveness-why-one-of-the-most-common-pieces-of-writing-advice-is-wrong/|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again. Before the invention of [[photocopier]]s and electronic text storage, a writer's work had to be stored on paper, which meant it was very susceptible to fire in particular. (In very early times, writers used [[vellum]] and clay which were more robust materials.) Writers whose work was destroyed before completion include [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the inventor of [[Esperanto]], whose years of work were thrown into the fire by his father because he was afraid that "his son would be thought a spy working code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryson|first=Bill|title=Mother Tongue&amp;nbsp;– The English Language|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-014305-8|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Essayist and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]], lost the only copy of a manuscript for ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' when it was mistakenly thrown into the fire by a maid. He wrote it again from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Charles William, Ed. "Introductory Note" in ''The Harvard Classics'', Vol. XXV, Part 3. New York: P.F. Collier &amp; Son, 1909–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers usually develop a personal schedule. [[Angus Wilson]], for example, wrote for a number of hours every morning.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Angus|title=Interview with Angus Wilson|journal=The Paris Review|year=1957|issue=Autumn-Winter No.17|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4848/the-art-of-fiction-no-20-angus-wilson|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writer's block]] is a relatively common experience among writers, especially professional writers, when for a period of time the writer feels unable to write for reasons other than lack of skill or commitment.

{{Quotation|''Happy are they who don't doubt themselves and whose pens fly across the page''&lt;br /&gt;[[Gustave Flaubert]] writing to [[Louise Colet]]&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Plate caption to an image of a much-corrected page of [[Madame Bovary]] in the Bibliothèque Municipale de Rouen. In {{cite book|last=Brown|first=Frederick|title=Flaubert: a biography|year=2006|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|location=New York|isbn=9780316118781}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Leonid Pasternak - The Passion of creation.jpg|thumb|left|''Throes of Creation'' by [[Leonid Pasternak]] ]]

====Sole====
Most writers write alone – typically they are engaged in a solitary activity that requires them to struggle with both the concepts they are trying to express and the best way to express it. This may mean choosing the best genre or genres as well as choosing the best words. Writers often develop idiosyncratic solutions to the problem of finding the right words to put on a blank page or screen. "Didn't [[W. Somerset Maugham|Somerset Maugham]] also write facing a blank wall? ... [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] couldn't write a line if there was another person anywhere in the same house, or so he said at some point."&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Ted Hughes|Hughes]]|first=Ted|title=Ted Hughes: The Art of Poetry No. 71|journal=The Paris Review|year=1995|volume=Spring|issue= 134|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1669/the-art-of-poetry-no-71-ted-hughes|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborative====
Collaborative writing means that multiple authors write and contribute to a piece of writing. In this approach, it is highly likely the writers will collaborate on editing the piece too. The more usual process is that the editing is done by an independent editor after the writer submits a draft version.

In some cases, such as that between a librettist and composer, a writer will collaborate with another artist on a creative work. One of the best known of these types of collaborations is that between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. Librettist [[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote the words for the [[comic opera]]s created by the partnership.

====Committee====
Occasionally, a writing task is given to a committee of writers. The most famous example is the task of translating the Bible into English, sponsored by King [[James VI and I|James VI]] of England in 1604 and accomplished by six committees, some in [[Cambridge]] and some in [[Oxford]], who were allocated different sections of the text. The resulting [[King James Version|Authorized King James Version]], published in 1611, has been described as an "everlasting miracle" because its writers (that is, its Translators) sought to "hold themselves consciously poised between the claims of accessibility and beauty, plainness and richness, simplicity and majesty, the people and the king", with the result that the language communicates itself "in a way which is quite unaffected, neither literary nor academic, not historical, nor reconstructionist, but transmitting a nearly incredible immediacy from one end of human civilisation to another."&lt;ref name=Nicolson2&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}(p.240, 243)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multimedia====
[[File:William Blake Nurses Song Copy Z 1826.jpg|thumb|[[William Blake]] "[[Nurse's Song]]" from ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'']]
Some writers support the verbal part of their work with images or graphics that are an integral part of the way their ideas are communicated. [[William Blake]] is one of rare poets who created his own paintings and drawings as integral parts of works such as his ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]''. [[Cartoonist]]s are writers whose work depends heavily on hand drawn imagery. Other writers, especially writers for children, incorporate painting or drawing in more or less sophisticated ways. [[Shaun Tan]], for example, is a writer who uses imagery extensively, sometimes combining fact, fiction and illustration, sometimes for a didactic purpose, sometimes on commission.&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Shaun|title=The Oopsatoreum|year=2012|publisher=Powerhouse Publishing|location=Sydney|isbn=9781863171441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's writers [[Beatrix Potter]], [[May Gibbs]], and [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Seuss Geisel]] are as well known for their illustrations as for their texts.

====Crowd sourced====
{{main|Crowdsourcing}}
Some writers contribute very small sections to a piece of writing that cumulates as a result. This method is particularly suited to very large works, such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias. The best known example of the former is the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', under the editorship of lexicographer [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], who was provided with the prolific and helpful contributions of [[William Chester Minor|W.C. Minor]], at the time an inmate of a hospital for the criminally insane.&lt;ref name=Crowthorne&gt;{{cite book|last=Winchester|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Winchester|title=[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne: a tale of murder, madness and the love of words]]|year=1998|publisher=Viking|location=London|isbn=0670878626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the latter – an encyclopaedia that is crowdsourced – is Wikipedia which relies on the contributions of thousands of volunteer writers and editors worldwide, such as [[Simon Pulsifer]].&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Simon Pulsifer: The Duke of Data|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570732,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations===
Writers have many different reasons for writing, among which is usually some combination of self-expression&lt;ref name=Styron&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Matthiessen, George Plimpton|title=William Styron, The Art of Fiction No. 5|url= http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5114/the-art-of-fiction-no-5-william-styron|journal=The Paris Review|year=1954|issue=Spring|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording facts, history or research results. The many [[physician writer]]s, for example, have combined their observation and knowledge of the [[human condition]] with their desire to write and contributed many poems, plays, translations, essays and other texts. Some writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers. For example, [[George Orwell]]'s essay "[[Why I Write]]" (1946) takes this as its subject. As to "what constitutes success or failure to a writer", it has been described as "a complicated business, where the material rubs up against the spiritual, and psychology plays a big part".&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Jane|title=JK Rowling on turning failure into success|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/jk-rowling-on-turning-failure-into-success-20141219-129vm6.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''The moral I draw is that the writer should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of this thoughts; and, indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.''&lt;br /&gt;[[W. Somerset Maugham]] in ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919)&lt;ref name=Maugham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maugham|first1=Somerset|title=The Moon and Sixpence|date=1999|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780099284765|page=8|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Command====
Some writers are the authors of specific military orders whose clarity will determine the outcome of a battle. Among the most controversial and unsuccessful was [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]'s order at the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], which being vague and misinterpreted, led to defeat with many casualties.

====Develop skill/explore ideas====
Some writers use the writing task to develop their own skill (in writing itself or in another area of knowledge) or explore an idea while they are producing a piece of writing. [[Philology|Philologist]] [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], for example, created a new language for his fantasy books.

{{Quotation| ''For me the private act of poetry writing is songwriting, confessional, diary-keeping, speculation, problem-solving, storytelling, therapy, anger management, craftsmanship, relaxation, concentration and spiritual adventure all in one inexpensive package.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Fry]], author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, journalist&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Stephen|title=The Ode Less Travelled – Unlocking the Poet Within|year=2007|publisher=Arrow Books|isbn=978-0-09-950934-9|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Entertain====
Some genres are a particularly appropriate choice for writers whose chief purpose is to entertain. Among them are [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s, many comics and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]]. Writers of children's literature seek to entertain children but are also usually mindful of the educative function of their work as well.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''I think that I shall never see''
''a billboard lovely as a tree;''
''Indeed, unless the billboards fall''
''I'll never see a tree at all.''

====Influence====
[[File:Ninety-Five Theses, Wittenberg.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' (at the All Saints' Church, [[Wittenburg]])]]
Anger has motivated many writers, including [[Martin Luther]], angry at religious corruption, who wrote the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' in 1517, to reform the church, and [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902) who wrote the public letter, ''[[J'accuse…!|J'Accuse]]'' in 1898 to bring public attention to government injustice, as a consequence of which he had to flee to England from his native France. Such writers have affected ideas, opinion or policy significantly.

CYRANO (striking his breast): Ay-a single word of all those here! here!  But writing, 'tis easier done... (He takes up the pen): Go to, I will write it, that love-letter!  Oh!  I have writ it and rewrit it in my own mind so oft that it lies there ready for pen and ink; and if I lay but my soul by my letter-sheet, 'tis naught to do but to copy from it.

Writers may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times, they write for another reason), such as when they are commissioned to create a new work, transcribe an old one, translate another writer's work, or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate. In some cases, writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income. [[Frances Milton Trollope|Frances Trollope]] is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury, at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them. Her book about her experiences in America, called ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' became a great success, "even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life" after which "she continued to write hard, carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast".&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Katherine|title=Victorian Wives|year=1974|publisher=Allison &amp; Busby|location=London, New York|isbn=0-85031-634-0|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her writer son [[Anthony Trollope]] "her books saved the family from ruin".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

{{Quotation| ''I write for two reasons; partly to make money and partly to win the respect of people whom I respect.''&lt;br /&gt;[[E. M.

====Teach====
[[Aristotle]], who was tutor to [[Alexander the Great]], wrote to support his [[education|teaching]]. He wrote two [[treatise]]s for the young prince: "On Monarchy", and "On Colonies"&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;{{cite book|title=The Library of Alexandria|year=2000|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|location=Cairo, Egypt|isbn=977-424-710-8|pages=79–91|author=R.G. Tanner|chapter=Aristotle's Works: The Possible Origins of the Alexandria Collection|editor=Roy MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[dialogue]]s also appear to have been written either "as lecture notes or discussion papers for use in his philosophy school at the Athens [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] between 334 and 323 BC."&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt; They encompass both his 'scientific' writings ([[metaphysics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[meteorology]], and [[astronomy]], as well as [[logic]] and [[argument]]) the 'non-scientific' works (poetry, [[Public speaking|oratory]], ethics, and politics), and "major elements in traditional [[Classical Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] education".&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt;

Writers of [[textbook]]s also use writing to teach and there are numerous instructional guides to writing itself. For example, many people will find it necessary to make a speech "in the service of your company, church, civic club, political party, or other organization" and so, instructional writers have produced texts and guides for speechmaking.&lt;ref name=Dowis&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowis|first=Richard|title=The Lost Art of the Great Speech: How to Write One : How to Deliver It|year=2000|publisher=AMA publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8144-7054-8|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tell a story====
Many writers use their skill to tell the story of their people, community or cultural tradition, especially one with a personal significance. Examples include [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]]; [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]]; [[Doris Lessing]]; [[Toni Morrison]]; [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]; and [[Patrick White]].
Writers such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Herta Müller]], and [[Erich Maria Remarque]] write about the effect of conflict, dispossession and war.

====Woo a lover====
Writers use prose, poetry, and letters as part of courtship rituals.  [[Edmond Rostand]]'s play ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', written in verse, is about both the power of love and the power of the self-doubting writer/hero's writing talent.

==Authorship==
[[File:Autographe de Marianne Alcoforado (Maria Anna Alcoforada), comme écrivain du couvent de Béja.jpg|thumb|Signature of [[Mariana Alcoforado]] (Maria Anna Alcoforada), once thought to be the writer of the [[Epistolary novel|epistolary fiction]], ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]''. ]]

===Pen names===
Writers sometimes use a pseudonym, otherwise known as a pen name or "nom de plume". The reasons they do this include to separate their writing from other work (or other types of writing) for which they are known; to enhance the possibility of publication by reducing prejudice (such as against women writers or writers of a particular ethnicity); to reduce personal risk (such as political risks from individuals, groups or states that disagree with them); or to make their name better suit another language.

Examples of well-known writers who used a pen name include: [[George Eliot]] (1819–1880), whose real name was Mary Anne (or Marian) Evans; [[George Orwell]] (1903–1950), whose real name was Eric Blair; [[George Sand]] (1804–1876), whose real name was Lucile Aurore Dupin; [[Dr. Seuss]] (1904–1991), whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel; Stendhal (1783–1842), whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle and [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910), whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

Apart from the large numbers of works attributable only to "Anonymous", there are a large number of writers who were once known and are now unknown. Efforts are made to find and re-publish these writers' works. One example is the publication of books like ''Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers'' (a 2010 reproduction of a pre-1923 publication) by "Anonymous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers (published pre-1923)|year=2010 |publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=9781142479084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the founding of a Library and Study Centre for the Study of Early English Women's Writing in Chawton, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chawton.org/ Chawton House Library | Home to early English women's writing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional writers===
Some fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a work. Examples of this type of fictional writer include Edward Casaubon, a fictional scholar in George Eliot's ''[[Middlemarch]]'', and Edwin Reardon, a fictional writer in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. Casaubon's efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in Eliot's novel and drive significant parts of the plot. In Gissing's work, Reardon's efforts to produce high quality writing put him in conflict with another character, who takes a more commercial approach. [[Robinson Crusoe]] is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer ([[Daniel Defoe]]) as being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name. [[Bridget Jones]] is a comparable fictional diarist created by writer [[Helen Fielding]]. Both works became famous and popular; their protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations, including film versions. [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name. The ''[[Sibylline Books]]'', a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] by the last king of Rome. Since they were consulted during periods of crisis, it could be said that they are a case of real works created by a fictional writer.

===Writers of sacred texts===
[[File:Ethiopian - John the Evangelist - Walters W850153V - Open Reverse.jpg|thumb| [[John the Evangelist]] Ethiopian c. 1540]]
[[Religious text]]s or scriptures are the texts which various religious traditions consider to be [[sacred]], or of central importance to their religious tradition. Some religions and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movements believe that their sacred texts are [[divinity|divinely]] or [[supernatural]]ly [[revelation|revealed or inspired]], while others have individual authors.

==Controversial writing==
[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] c. 1513 ''Old Man with water studies''. In the [[Royal Librarian (United Kingdom)|Royal Library, Windsor]]. Thought to be a self-portrait, showing Leonardo's writing and drawing.]]
Skilled writers influence ideas and society, so there are many instances where a writer's work or opinion has been unwelcome and controversial. In some cases, they have been persecuted or punished. Aware that their writing will cause controversy or put themselves and others into danger, some writers self-censor; or withhold their work from publication; or hide their manuscripts; or use some other technique to preserve and protect their work. Two of the most famous examples are [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Leonardo "had the habit of conversing with himself in his writings and of putting his thoughts into the clearest and most simple form". He used "left-handed or mirror writing" (a technique described as "so characteristic of him") to protect his scientific research from other readers.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite book|title="Leonardo's Manuscripts" in Leonardo de Vinci|publisher=Reynal and Company, in association with William Morris and Company|location=New York|pages=157|edition=Authoritative work, published in Italy by Istituto Geografico De Agostini, in conjunction with exhibition of Leonardo's work in Milan in 1938 (re-edited English translation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of persecution, social disgrace, and being proved incorrect are regarded as contributing factors to Darwin's delaying the publication of his radical and influential work ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.

One of the results of controversies caused by a writer's work is scandal, which is a negative public reaction that causes damage to reputation and depends on public outrage. It has been said that it is possible to scandalise the public because the public "wants to be shocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue".&lt;ref name="Wilson &amp; Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=Scandal!: An Explosive Exposé of the Affairs, Corruption and Power Struggles of the Rich and Famous|year=2011|publisher=Random House|author2=Damon Wilson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal may be caused by what the writer wrote or by the style in which it was written. In either case, the content or the style is likely to have broken with tradition or expectation. Making such a departure may in fact, be part of the writer's intention or at least, part of the result of introducing innovations into the genre in which they are working. For example, novelist [[D H Lawrence]] challenged ideas of what was acceptable as well as what was expected in form. These may be regarded as literary scandals, just as, in a different way, are the scandals involving writers who mislead the public about their identity, such as [[Norma Khouri]] or [[Helen Darville]] who, in deceiving the public, are considered to have committed fraud.

Writers may also cause the more usual type of scandal – whereby the public is outraged by the opinions, behaviour or life of the individual (an experience not limited to writers). Poet [[Paul Verlaine]] outraged society with his behaviour and treatment of his wife and child as well as his lover. Among the many writers whose writing or life was affected by scandals are [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[H. G. Wells]]. One of the most famously scandalous writers was the [[Marquis de Sade]] who offended the public both by his writings ''and'' by his behaviour.

===Punishment===
[[File:Tyndale-martyrdom.png|thumb|Engraving depicting the death of [[William Tyndale]]]]
The consequence of scandal for a writer may be censorship or discrediting of the work, or social ostracism of its creator. In some instances, punishment, persecution, or prison follow. The [[list of journalists killed in Russia]] is an example. Others include:
* The [[Balibo Five]], a group of Australian television journalists who were killed while attempting to report on Indonesian incursions into [[Portuguese Timor]] in 1975.
* [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (1906–1945), an influential theologian who wrote ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'' and was hanged for his resistance to [[Nazism]].
* [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937), who wrote political theory and criticism and was imprisoned for this by the Italian Fascist regime.
* [[Günter Grass]] (1927–2015), whose poem "[[What Must Be Said]]" led to his being declared ''[[persona non grata]]''  in [[Israel]].
* [[Peter Greste]] (born 1965), a journalist who was imprisoned in Egypt for news reporting which was "damaging to national security."&lt;ref name=bbc-crisis&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25546389 |title=Egypt crisis: Al-Jazeera journalists arrested in Cairo |work=BBC News |date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Primo Levi]] (1919–1987) who, among many Jews imprisoned during World War II, wrote an account of his incarceration called ''[[If This Is a Man]]''.
* [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), who was sentenced to imprisonment for [[heresy]] as a consequence of writing in support of the then controversial theory of [[heliocentrism]], although the sentence was almost immediately commuted to [[house arrest]].
* [[Sima Qian]] (145 or 135 BC – 86 BC) who "successfully defended a vilified master from defamatory charges" and was given "the choice between [[castration]] or execution." He "became a eunuch and had to bury his own book ... in order to protect it from the authorities."&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;{{cite book|last=Battles|first=Matthew|title=Library – An Unquiet History|year=2003|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0-434-00887-7}}p40&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Salman Rushdie]] (born 1947), whose novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' was banned and burned internationally after causing [[The Satanic Verses controversy|such a worldwide storm]] that a [[Fatwa|fatwā]] was issued against him. Though Rushdie survived, numerous others were killed in incidents connected to the novel.
* [[Roberto Saviano]] (born 1979), whose best-selling book ''[[Gomorrah (book)|Gomorrah]]'' provoked the Neapolitan [[Camorra]], annoyed [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and led to him receiving permanent police protection.
* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (1918–2008), who used his experience of imprisonment as the subject of his writing in ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' and ''[[Cancer Ward]]''—the latter, while legally published in the Soviet Union, had to gain the approval of the [[Union of Soviet Writers|USSR Union of Writers]].
* [[William Tyndale]] ({{Circa|1494}} – 1536), who was executed because he translated the Bible into English.
* [[Simon Sheppard (activist)|Simon Sheppard]] (born 1957) who was imprisoned in the UK for expressing controversial opinions on race and the Holocaust.

==Protection and representation==
The organisation [[Reporters Without Borders]] (also known by its French name: Reporters Sans Frontières) was set up to help protect writers and advocate on their behalf.

The professional and industrial interests of writers are represented by various national or regional guilds or unions. Examples include writers guilds in [[Australian Writers' Guild|Australia]] and [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and unions in [[Arab Writers Union|Arabia]], [[Writers Union of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Union of Azerbaijani Writers|Azerbaijan]], [[Writers' Union of Canada|Canada]], [[Estonian Writers' Union|Estonia]], [[Hungarian Writers' Union|Hungary]], [[Irish Writers' Union|Ireland]], [[Moldovan Writers' Union|Moldova]], [[Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas|Philippines]], [[Polish Writers' Union|Poland]], [[Union des écrivaines et des écrivains québécois|Québéc]], [[Writers' Union of Romania|Romania]], [[Union of Russian Writers|Russia]], [[Sudanese Writers Union|Sudan]], and the [[Writer's Union of Ukraine|Ukraine]]. In the United States, there is both a [[Writers Guild of America|writers guild]] and a [[National Writers Union]].

==Awards==
[[File:Tomas Transtromer and Modhir Ahmed.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] Swedish winning poet and translator [[Tomas Tranströmer]] signs a book about his work by [[Modhir Ahmed]] (2007)]]
There are many awards for writers whose writing has been adjudged excellent. Among them are the many [[literary award]]s given by individual countries, such as the [[Prix Goncourt]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]], as well as international awards such as the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Russian writer [[Boris Pasternak]] (1890–1960), under pressure from his government, reluctantly declined the Nobel Prize that he won in 1958.
