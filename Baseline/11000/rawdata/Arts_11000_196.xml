[[File:AC Dom Rathaus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Aachen Town Hall seen from the cathedral]]
'''Aachen Town Hall''' (German: ''Rathaus'') is located opposite to the [[Aachen Cathedral]] and is one of the most striking structures in the ''[[Altstadt]]'' of [[Aachen]], [[Germany]]. It is built in the [[Gothic architecture]].  

==History==
[[File:Aachen Rathaus 1520.jpg|thumb|Drawing by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1520]]
[[File:De merian Westphaliae 100.jpg|thumb|Engraving by [[Matthäus Merian]] in 1647]]
In the first half of the 14th century, Aachen’s citizenry built the [[seat of local government|city hall]] under the leadership of its acting mayor Gerhard Chorus (1285–1367) as a sign of their civic freedom. Yet, they had to promise to establish a space in the new town hall that could host the traditional [[coronation feast]] that was part of the [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronation ceremony]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Up to then, the nearby mid-13th century Grashaus – which is one of the city’s oldest still-standing buildings – had served the community in that function. Construction began in 1330 on top of the foundation walls of the ''[[Aula Regia]]'', part of the derelict [[Palace of Aachen]], built during the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Dating from the time of [[Charlemagne]], the Granus Tower and [[masonry]] from that era were incorporated into the south side of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Niehüsener: ''Bericht des Arbeitskreises für den Wiederaufbau der Rathaustürme.'' Aachen 1977&lt;ǃ--[p. ???]--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was completed in 1349, and while the town hall served as the administrative center of the city, part of the city’s munitions and weaponry was housed in the Granus Tower, which also served as a prison for some time.

===Three Kings relief===
[[File:DreikönigenreliefACR.jpg|thumb|left|Torsos of the ''Three Kings relief'', from the 14th century]]
From 1380, the entrance of the ''Kaisertreppe'' ("Emperor's stairs"), which connected the subterranean levels to the Coronation Hall, was adorned by the [[limestone]] relief of the [[biblical magi|Three Kings]] and a depiction of the [[Adoration of the Magi]]. Four limestone blocks formed the relief, with one serving for each king, and the last depicting [[Madonna (art)|Mary and Jesus]].

In 1798, during the [[French period]], the relief was partially destroyed, and the remaining pieces were left as they were above the entrance to the main guard station.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ernst Günther Grimme: ''Das Rathaus zu Aachen.'' Aachen 1996, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval artwork was then replaced by Gottfried Götting with a replica in 1879. Before [[World War II]], it was transferred to the local museum (''Heimatmuseum'') in Aachen and disappeared in the war.

===Baroque===
[[File:Aachen Marktplatz 1840.jpg|thumb|The baroque city hall and the Aachen market, [[steal engraving]] by [[Henry Winkles]] around 1840]]
During the great Fire of Aachen in 1656, portions of the roof and towers burned. The destroyed elements were then replaced in a [[baroque]] style. From 1727 until 1732 the Chief Architect of Aachen, [[Johann Joseph Couven]], led a fundamental baroque remodeling of the structure, especially of the front façade and entry steps. The [[gothic art|gothic figures]] and [[muntin]] adorning the windows were removed, and even the interior was remodeled in the baroque style. Today, the sitting room and the “White Hall” both still convey this change in style.

Characteristic of the time period, the wood paneling of the White Hall is in the style of Aachen-[[Liège]] baroque master Jacques de Reux, while the wall painting comes from master painter Johann Chrysant Bollenrath. This hall was originally for a panel of jurists who controlled the quality of cloth produced in Aachen, but the space would later serve as the main office for the mayor of Aachen.

At the treaty signing ceremony that ended the [[War of Austrian Succession]] in 1748, the “Peace Hall” was set up but was not used because of a dispute between the envoys. As a compensation for this, the city obtained portraits of the envoys, which can now be found hanging in the various spaces of the City Hall.

===19th century===
Since the end of the [[Imperial City of Aachen|Imperial City]] era and the [[Napoleon]]ic occupation of the area, the structural condition of the City Hall was greatly neglected, so that the building was seen to be falling apart by 1840. After that, and especially under the watchful eye of 19th century Chief Architect Friedrich Joseph Ark, the building was rebuilt little by little in a [[Gothic Revival Architecture|neogothic]] style that tried to capture its original gothic elements. The side of the City Hall that faced the Market was adorned with statues of 50 kings, as well as symbols of art, science, and Christianity.

In the meantime, the Coronation Hall was restored and a new entrance was constructed. In addition, the painter [[Alfred Rethel]] had the task to embellish the room with a large series of frescoes. Begun in 1847 and completed by his student in 1861, the frescoes eventually depicted legends from the life of Charlemagne. After the destruction of similar artwork at the [[Neues Museum]] in [[Berlin]], this painting is one of the most important testimonies to the [[Romanticism|late romantic style]] in Germany.

===City hall fire, 1883===
[[File:Aachen Marktplatz 1900.jpg|thumb|Seventeen years after the fire of 1883]]
Starting from a fire in the Johann Peter Joseph Monheim Drug and Material Warehouse at 26 Antonius Street (''Antoniusstraße''), flames first spread when cinder from the roof landed on the Granus Tower and set it ablaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/content/titleinfo/1499528 |title=Das Rathaus zu Aachen und sein Brand am Petri- und Pauli-Tage 1883: mit 5 Abb / von Johannes Chorus Aachen: Peter Kaatzer, 1883 |publisher=Digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within four hours the roof and both towers of the City Hall were aflame, as were a large number of surrounding houses on the south side of the Market. Within City Hall, the Coronation Hall with its frescoes by [[Alfred Rethel]], as well as the building's first floor, was spared. In the time immediately following the fire, its roof and towers were kept erect through makeshift structures of support.

On 1 November 1884 the city of Aachen initiated a contest among German architects to see who would rebuild City Hall. Of the 13 submitted designs, the first prize went to Aachen architect Georg Frentzen, who in 1891 was commissioned to rebuild the building and its towers. The restoration of the inner rooms was performed under the leadership of Joseph Laurent, and around 1895 sculptures depicting the ''Knight Gerhard Chorus'' and ''Johann von Punt'' (who was leader of the city six times from 1372 to 1385) were reinstalled in the bay windows on the back side of City Hall, and the eight shields depicting the coat of arms of medieval nobility (Margarten, Berensberg, Roide, Hasselholz, Surse, Wilde, Joh Chorus, and Zevel) were remade in the [[spandrel]]s. This was done by Karl Krauß.

The restoration was finally finished in 1902, and the unveiling of the Rathaus took place with the blessing of [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Emperor of Germany, on 19 June 1902.

===20th century===
[[File:Aachen Rathaus Separatistenunruhen.jpg|thumb|Devastation of the interior of the city hall after its storming by separatists on 21 October 1923]]
Aachen’s city hall survived [[World War I]] without sustaining damage, but during civil unrest that arose in the course of a [[secession|separatists’ movement]] whose goal was the creation of an independent [[Rhenish Republic]], City Hall was stormed by a group of separatists who caused serious damage both to its interior and exterior. Parts of the façade, such as adorning statues and both clocks, were broken, as were all window panes on the first floor on the Market side. Additionally, several rooms inside the building were ransacked, and many of the famed frescoes within were heavily damaged by gunfire. The furniture (especially that within the mayoral office and Coronation Hall) were damaged as they were used as projectiles. In the Emperor Hall, an undetonated bomb was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Will Hermann:. ''Stadt in Ketten'', S.  250-269 ,  Aachen 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Aachen City Hall was heavily damaged by bombing raids, especially those occurring on 14 July 1943 and 11 April 1944. On 14 July 1943 the roof of the building and both towers burned, and afterwards the structure retained a distinctive shape due to the heat that twisted the steel skeletons inside the tower caps. The Coronation Hall was again heavily damaged and the north facing wall was moved in places up to 30 centimeters vertically. The imminent threat of collapse was staved off through the use of emergency beams that held the structure in place.  Because of rain penetrating the interior of the building, its frescoes were severely affected, and five of the eight were carefully removed by Franz Stiewi and stored at the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]].

The architect Professor Otto Gruber and the building engineer Professor Richard Stumpf prepared a report in 1945 about the structural integrity of the building. With the help of Professor Josef Pirlet, the dilapidated north façade was reinforced with steel and tension bars, and in 1946, the building’s roof was repaired using makeshift sheets of zinc. After structural analysis was conducted and the foreground was reinforced, the replacement of the north façade had to take place, since almost all of the arches there were broken. The arches on the ground floor were again closed for repairs in 1950, and the reconstruction of the Emperor Hall was largely completed by 1953, with the configuration of the room following in the next few years.

The question of how the tower caps should be rebuilt remained at the heart of a controversial discussion. In 1966 Professor Wilhelm K. Fischer, who had worked extensively in the reconstruction of Aachen, produced a sketch for the towers’ design, as students from [[RWTH Aachen University]] also took part in the debate, submitted 24 designs for consideration. In 1968 eight additional expert designs were submitted to a working group whose task it was to rebuild the towers, and after discussing several modern looks, the group settled on a design by the [[conservation-restoration]] expert Leo Hugot, who stuck tightly to the historical image of the towers. The tower caps were finally finished in 1978.

===Present===
[[File:Aachen city hall Imperial Regalia replicas.jpg|thumb|Replicas of the Imperial Regalia]]
Today, replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] from the Viennese [[Imperial Treasury, Vienna|Imperial Treasury]] reside in the city hall. These replicas were made around 1915 by order of Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] for an exhibition to recall the 31 [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations]] that took place in Aachen between 813 and 1531. Among the replicas are a copy of the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]], the [[Sabre of Charlemagne]], the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Crown]] of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], and the [[Imperial Orb]].

Since 2009, Aachen City Hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour program by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-André-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lefèvre]] are viewable as part of the tour.

As before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there.

Learners of [[Afrikaans]] as an additional language could be enabled to respond to aesthetical, [[emotion]]al, cultural and social values.  Through the use of Afrikaans [[folklore]] [[teacher]]s can focus on developing the learners' ability to behave with cultural and aesthetic sensitivity in different social contexts. Afrikaans examples of folklore are mentioned and discussed briefly to include stories with humour, magic, the transmission of social and [[Culture|cultural]] values and [[tradition]]s, ecological meaning, [[Idiom|idiomatic expressions]], [[praise poems]], [[ogre]] characters and [[stereotype]]s.

By means of a well-known background and/or context of a text, learners of Afrikaans as an [[Second language|additional language]] can become aware of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] range of the target language; they can become acquainted with the depth and content of meaning implied in the text. If a text is understood, the reader becomes personally involved and this, in itself, can lead the reader to interact creatively with the text - from the mechanical aspect of the language system to the analytical aspect - where s/he can participate in the story. The learner can thus discover how the events unfold, s/he can share the characters' emotional experiences and communicate their personal responses. Herein lies the relevance of a good reading text (despite the origin) - because the reader inhabits the text and in the process the language becomes transparent.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Moyo, T. 1997. Are the current high school literature texts of relevance to the culture of ESL learners? ''Journal for Language Teaching'' 31(1):42-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore facilitates [[language learning]] ==
The degree to which learners understand and identify with learning material is enhanced by the use of cultural contexts well known to them.&lt;ref&gt;Zulu, N.S. 1996. Teaching ESL literature: the problems of cultural selection in South Africa. ''Journal for Language Teaching,''  30(1):50-58.&lt;/ref&gt; All people are active participants in a dynamic cultural process.&lt;ref&gt;Lessing, A.C. &amp; De Witt, M.W. 1999. Riglyne vir die samestelling van 'n leesprogram vir T2-leerders. ''Journal for Language Teaching'' 33(1):46-59.&lt;/ref&gt; If folklore is made part of the [[literature]] teaching programme, learning Afrikaans as an additional language can come to play a significant role in the learner's everyday life, instead of remaining little more than an intellectual exercise performed in the isolation of a language class.

Folklore, as Potter&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; describes it, can be seen as a "lively [[fossil]] which refuses to die. It is a precipitate of the scientific and cultural lag of centuries and millennia of human experience ... folklore develops as the traditional, and usually oral, explanation of the origins and early history of man."

The American anthropologist Bascom&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; defines folklore as "a part of culture but not the whole of culture. It includes myths, legends, tales, proverbs, riddles, the texts of ballads and other songs, and other forms of lesser importance, but not folk art, folk dance, folk music, folk costume, folk medicine, folk custom, or folk belief."

Miruka&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; gives a specific account of what a narrative is: "a [[prose]] account of people, events, places, etc. that may be factual or fictional. The accounts are principally handed down from person to person and generation to generation through word of mouth. The term 'tale' and 'folktale' have been used to denote the same concept."

The significance of the above for the teaching programme of Afrikaans as an additional language is that the [[Culture|cultural]] experiences of the learner could be included, enriched and adapted through folklore as an instrument in a literary context.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Experience with Zulu teacher education students&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; showed that African [[folklore|folktales]] (by Minnie Postma, Eugène Marais and folktales from East Africa) as well as the comic strips by T.O. [[T. O. Honiball|Honiball]] captured the attention and interest of the students. They did not have to struggle to understand the background while acquiring new vocabulary. They were immediately able to identify with the characters and could participate in extended readings. While reading these stories and comic strips, their receptive vocabulary increased and this eventually facilitated their progression to a more active and productive form of language (speaking and writing).

== Folklore as part of a core literature ==
One way of bringing about harmony in our multicultural nation, is to assist today's learners to acquire intercultural [[:wikt:sensitivity|sensitivity]]. The teaching of a core literature can contribute to this aim, and my understanding of this concept is that it will represent all the activities and experiences of being human that we share with one another in our South African society. Folklore is an example of such a core literature. It comprises the transmitted verbalisation of events and values that are inherently part of the human race as a species - values that are specific and nonetheless universal, such as integrity, loyalty, honour, freedom, etc.

The [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] character of South African society implies that each community creates its own images of universal values and ideas. When studying a literature text, the educator in the additional language classroom will have to lead the learners to the discovery and study of the relevant values involved. This should be done in such a way, through folklore as a literary instrument, that no-one's integrity or self-esteem is threatened. The educator should always take into account the fact that each learner brings with him/her his/her own version of these values into the classroom.

Harmon&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Leach, M. (ed).  1972. ''Standard dictionary of folklore, mythology and legend.''  Toronto: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; defines folklore as follows: "Folklore is something which the individual has in common with his fellows ... It makes possible - perhaps it might be defined as that which constitutes - his rapport with his particular segment of mankind."

The article should like to plead in favour of an increased awareness of and active use of folklore (in Afrikaans), within an African context (inter alia), in the language curriculum. The term "folklore" has a wide range of meanings and some researchers&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Dundes, A. 1965. ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; interpret the concept loosely and differently, so much so that there is an entire dictionary for this one term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The article will limit itself to oral forms of expression and concentrate on folktales which involve [[humour]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], the transmission of culture, ecological narrations, [[idiomatic expression]]s, [[praise poems]] and [[stereotype]]s when the term "folklore" is used.

== Afrikaans examples of folklore ==
The following important elements of folklore can be identified and analysed in the literature teaching classroom where Afrikaans is being learned.

=== Humour: the comical use of language, events, and [[Trickster|trickery]] ===
The practical implementation of the research done by Bosch&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, B. 1997. Humor in die taalklaskamer. ''Journal for Language Teaching'' 31(2):190-201.&lt;/ref&gt; on different aspects of humour can add to the enjoyment of reading humorous folktales - thus contributing to a sense of fun in learning Afrikaans as an additional language. Experience has shown that the humour expressed and understood by Zulu learners in the additional language classroom consists mostly of imitating [[comedy|comical]] situations, tone of voice, facial expressions and body language. Additional language learners struggle to appreciate humour that involves the implicit subtlety of word games.

Morain&lt;ref&gt;Valdes, J.M. 1986. ''Culture bound - bridging the cultural gap in language teaching.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to "kinesics" which should be part of any learning programme that includes perception. Morain is of the opinion that kinesics can contribute to the understanding of social and intercultural relationships, because those who have "learned" a language without including the nonverbal component are seriously handicapped if they intend to interact with living members of the culture instead of with paper and print.

[[Kinesics]] includes understanding and interpreting body language to provide a creative means of communication across borders and add another dimension to the appreciation and expression of humour in the additional language classroom.

One of the functions of folklore is to entertain the audience. Therefore, humorous events set in motion by [[trickster]]s can contribute to amusement&lt;ref&gt;Bascom, W.R. 1965. Folkore and Anthropology. In: DUNDES, A. ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; and mental stimulation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Miruka, O. 1994. ''Encounter with oral literature.'' Nairobi: East African Educational Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the actions of the "Jakkals en Wolf" characters of Afrikaans folktales which Honiball&lt;ref&gt;Honiball, T.O. 1942. Jakkals en Wolf-reeks. ''Die Jongspan''.&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed in comic strips and cartoons. Lategan&lt;ref&gt;Lategan, F.V. 1985. T.O. Honiball - 'n waardering. ''Lantern'' (January):46-59.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the remarkable way in which Honiball used the Jakkals and Wolf stories that he had heard as a child. His stories followed an old tradition of Middle Dutch literature - that of the satirical ''Van den Vos Reynaerde'' - and Honiball became the Walt Disney of Afrikaans. He used satire to gently ridicule people and to unmask human frailty&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; among the Afrikaans-speaking society of the day, mocking the eccentric habits and customs of a community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dégh, L. 1965. Folk narrative. In: Dundes, A. ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cartoon]]s and comics like these are not regarded by all folklore specialists as belonging to folklore, because they do not explicitly include oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Utley, F.L. 1965. Folk literature: an operational definition. In: Dundes, A. ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since they are based on the "Jakkals en Wolf" intertextual tradition of oral folktales that have been handed down for generations,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Steenberg, E. 1987. ''Fantasie en die kinderboek - 'n kernhandleiding'' . Pretoria: HAUM-Literêr.&lt;/ref&gt; it could be argued that Honiball's ''Adoons-hulle'' (1977) and ''Wolf en Jakkals van Uilekraal'' (1978) can indeed be regarded as part of mass-cultural folklore where city life is portrayed by the mass media. Dorson&lt;ref&gt;Dorson, R.M. 1972. ''African folklore.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; cites Bausinger (1961) who maintains that "we no longer believe that [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] necessarily implies the end of a specific folk culture, but rather we attempt to trace the modifications and mutations undergone by folk culture in the industrialized and urbanized world."

These [[comic strip]]s by Honiball provide interesting teaching possibilities in the additional language classroom, especially because of the elements of humour in the animal tricksters,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Finnegan, R. 1970. ''Oral Literature in Africa''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; comical situations, body language and language usage (e.g. the nicknames of some of the characters). This argument is in line with Jansen,&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, W.H. 1965. The esoteric-exoteric factor in folklore. In: Dundes, A.  ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; who is of the opinion that comics and television series should receive the interest of folklorists and should incite them to pursue further the application and significance of the esoteric-exoteric factor in folklore.

=== Magic ===
An Afrikaans story that could be classified as a [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] tale&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in that it portrays the role of magic and the repetition of the number three, is "Die Wolfkoningin" by I.D. du Plessis.&lt;ref&gt;Du Plessis, I.D. 1970. ''Doederomandro en ander Kaapse Stories.'' Kaapstad: Human &amp; Rousseau.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this story is called a Cape story, since it reflects the culture of people of Malay origin, who are concentrated in the Western Cape (Du Plessis can be regarded as one of South Africa's leading experts on Cape Malay stories). Following Bettelheim, Steenberg&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; would probably regard the story as a fairy tale. It is a story of magic that reflects some aspects of the inner world of human beings. According to Miruka's classification of folktale content, it can be called an [[imagination|imaginary]] tale.

This imaginary tale has a typically Eastern setting, with a rural atmosphere. There are hunters, a wood, rich landowners ("wazirs") and beautiful ladies ("poeteri"). There is a definite movement from an earthly space (the house of a wood cutter) to a magical space (a dance party and a wolf's den), and ultimately a return to an earthly reality (the house of the wazir). The number three reoccurs in different spatial settings and with respect to different objects, and symbolises&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the character's search for freedom, identity and fellowship. The main character's [[incantation]] in order to release the magical power (where she changes from a wolf into a beautiful lady) also centres on this number. In this context, the symbolism of these objects can stretch "the capacity of both expression and comprehension, and becomes the medium through which some of the most universal, elemental - and intangible - concepts of man are conveyed".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The transmission of social and cultural [[Value (ethics)|values]] and [[tradition]]s ===
Some of the best examples of Afrikaans folklore are stories recorded and written by Minnie Postma,&lt;ref&gt;(a) Postma, M. 1964. ''Litsomo''. Johannesburg: Afrikaanse Pers-Boekhandel.

(b) Postma, M. 1986. ''As die maan oor die lug loop (Sotho-verhale).'' Kaapstad: Tafelberg.
&lt;/ref&gt; who grew up with and heard these tales told by Sotho people. Using these stories can give effect to a recommendation made by Robinson,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Robinson, G.L.N. 1995. ''Crosscultural understanding: Processes and approaches for foreign language, English as a second language and bilingual educators''. New York: Pergamon Institute of English.&lt;/ref&gt; namely that the integration of culture in a language programme should be a synthesis between the learner's home culture, the target language's cultural input and the learner as an individual. According to Robinson, intercultural understanding develops from cultural adaptability, that is, 'modifying one's own cultural repertoire'.

An interesting example of an Afrikaans folktale that is situated in an [[Africa]]n context and entails the transmission of cultural values, traditions and views, is Postma's story "In die begin". This story explains how things were between woman and man in the beginning. Miller&lt;ref&gt;Miller, P. 1979. ''Myths and legends of Southern Africa.'' Cape Town: T.V. Bulpin Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; gives a similar account of the same phenomenon in a discussion of a Sotho-Tswana myth called "The First Marriage and the First Bachelor".

Hattingh&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hattingh, M. 1994. Die baie stemme van Minnie Postma se ''Litsomo''. ''Stilet'' 6:39-56.&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the validity of Postma's oral transmission in detail and notes that Postma understands and applies the different characteristics of [[Southern Sotho language|Southern Sotho]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; narratives. Jacottet (1908. in Hatthingh 1994) postulates that this story has its origin in [[San people|San]] culture, because the men in the story use bows and arrows, weapons which were never used by the [[Sotho people|Basotho]]. In both Postma's and Jacottet's representation of this myth, the woman's identity is established in terms of masculine criteria. However, Postma adds a new dimension. Her narration depicts a woman as an intelligent, creative and innovative being, even if she is the servant of the man. The dialogue in the story is typical of the oral narrative in that dramatic development, rather than description, is preferred. The relationship between male and female is exceptionally harmonious, unlike in most other Southern Sotho [[narrative]]s.

=== Ecological stories ===
The folktales of Eugène Marais&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Marais, E.N. 1965. ''Dwaalstories''. Kaapstad: Human &amp; Rousseau.&lt;/ref&gt; are typical examples of African ecological narratives concerning the relationship between things and people. Marais follows the tradition of San stories, more specifically those that are known as wandering stories,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Kannemeyer, J.C. 1978. ''Geskiedenis van die Afrikaanse literatuur I.'' Kaapstad: Academica.&lt;/ref&gt; in that songs and poems are included.

In "Die Vaal Koestertjie" we find well-known themes of threatened [[innocence]] and beauty, and the weaker character's victory over physical strength and mockery. According to Kannemeyer,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; this story - with its use of the apostrophe, paradox, inversion and cumulative and progressive parallelism - follows to a great extent the traditional line of fairy-tale literature. A young Koisan girl, Nampti, has a very special relationship with a little bird, which she calls 'her little grey sister' because they are both pipits.

This character fits in very well with Miruka's general description&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of birds in [[Ecology|ecological]] stories - she seems unfailingly to appear in times of crisis and she acts as a messenger bearing urgent and important messages, more specifically information about the magic formula that can transform and enrich the protagonist. She (the bird) is invincible, being up in the air and out of reach of the antagonists, in this case the other young women. She counsels the protagonist and is her life guardian.

Like other folktales, this story can be used in the language classroom to discuss [[Morality|moral]] voices, choices, and values like patience and tolerance, even fatalistic benevolence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Idiomatic expression]]s ===
Language plays an important role in any culture. Hyde&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Kamwangamalu, N. 1997. English and transformation to multicultural education in the new South Africa. ''Journal for Language Teaching'' 31(3):243-252.&lt;/ref&gt; observes that people are not necessarily prisoners of their language, but that the way a culture sees the world is nevertheless reflected in its language. In the same vein, Trivedi&lt;ref&gt;Trivedi, H.C. 1978. Culture in language learning. ''English Language Teaching Journal'' 32(2):92-97.
&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises the importance of the transmission of values as well as the recognition of [[emotion]]al problems that the learner might experience (like culture shock and feelings of helplessness), language anxiety and fear of failure, in being unable to understand or interpret the cultural message. The (learned) behaviour and values of learners of an additional language will be challenged through exposure to the culture of the target language. Their critical appreciation will be intensified by listening to Afrikaans folklore.

Miruka&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; mentions an important function of folklore, namely that of [[mind|mental]] stimulation. Developmental aspects such as memory training, [[sensory system|sensory]] awareness, analysis and synthesis, as well as affective development can be specifically emphasised in this regard. The development of all mental and other capacities can be enhanced by the use of an Afrikaans folktale full of idiomatic expressions: "Klein Riet-alleen-in-die-roerkuil" by Eugène Marais, which is included in the volume ''Dwaalstories'' (1927).

This story by Marais follows the basic pattern of Western European [[fairy tale]]s and myths&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; in that the San hero (Klein Riet) is given an important task to carry out within a specific time frame. Nolte&lt;ref&gt;Nolte, E. 1999. Terug na die teks of om stroomop te swem. ''Stilet'' 11:9-22.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the whole story might have developed around a range of Afrikaans [[idiomatic expression]]s.  These expressions can be regarded as a reflection of the values of the source culture in the classroom for Afrikaans as an additional language. This study by Nolte can serve an important function in helping to overcome the previously mentioned problems that learners of Afrikaans as an additional language often experience.

Idiomatic expressions and the like are very well received and appreciated by additional language learners from African cultures (as experience with [[Zulu language|Zulu]]-speaking learners has shown,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Kruger, E. 2002. Folklore as a multi-cultural component in the literature curriculum for Afrikaans as additional language. ''Southern African Journal for Folklore Studies,'' 12(2):93-113.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps because they often have so many of these in their [[First language|mother tongue]]. However, because of urbanisation, many idiomatic expressions have been lost in African languages. These learners have a rich instinct for idioms and have often even created new expressions themselves in the additional language context (e.g. 'Matriek is nie matras nie').&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

A folktale full of idiomatic expressions could make African learners feel at ease (emotionally), could stimulate their senses (by making them aware of metaphors in their own environment, analysing, synthesising and trying to verbalise these in their own way in Afrikaans like the abovementioned example) and could develop their memory. It could also provide an opportunity to discuss some of these themes that are addressed in a literary way by the story, for example pride and obedience, which would be in line with what is said by Leach&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; about [[proverb]]s, namely that they are constantly used to influence the behaviour of others and as instruments of self-control.

=== Praise poems ===
A story like "Lied van die reën" by Eugène Marais&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; is an ideal example of an Afrikaans [[praise song]] that could contribute to the integration of cultural aspects of previously marginalised groups in the curriculum to achieve sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Coming from an African culture, Kamwangamalu is of the opinion that almost every element in a language programme is capable of conveying a [[Culture|cultural]] message of some sort'': "''Culture is the socially learned, shared assemblage of practices, perceptions, attitudes, world views, value systems and beliefs that determine the texture of our lives as members of a given community."

According to Mihálik&lt;ref&gt;Mihálik, A. 1988. Die lied van die reën - 'n Afrika-pryslied. ''Tydskrif vir Letterkunde'' 26:84-91.&lt;/ref&gt; this folktale by Marais, although it was considered to be an indigenous fairy tale, is an example of an African praise song that can be compared with Sotho and Zulu praise songs dedicated to nature. Mihálik refers to Finnegan's view&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; that there is a similarity between African and European folklore and that there is supposedly some primordial source for both. The impression is that Marais got these stories from a certain "old Hendrik" (probably Tswana or Sotho) during his visits to the [[Waterberg District Municipality|Waterberge]].

=== [[Ogre]] characters ===
A folktale that calls to mind the European fairy tale ''The Beauty and the Beast'' on the one hand, yet fits Miruka's description&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of a tale involving African ogre characters, is ''Brolloks en Bittergal'' by C.J. Langenhoven.&lt;ref&gt;Langenhoven, C.J. 1977. ''Brolloks en Bittergal.'' Kaapstad: Tafelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1925, and has kept Afrikaans-speaking listeners spellbound from one generation to the next ever since.

The main character, Brolloks, is a grotesque and monsterlike individual, scheming and decidedly untrustworthy. He is like Miruka's description&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of Luo ogres: neither human nor animal but displaying characteristics of both; and the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] ogre: 'a [[man-eater]] as well as an eater of its own kind ... [possessing the] quality of [[grandiosity]] and [[Hedonism (Just Because You Feel Good)|hedonism]]'. Brolloks lives as a human being would. Miruka emphasises that ogres are but masks of humanity; they are no different from those in society 'who specialise in ugly deeds but who can appear very mild and sociable to gain access to the victims'. Brolloks ultimately corresponds to Miruka's interpretation of the ogre who stands "for evil and death. He symbolises the ominous flail of vice looming over humanity and threatening to reduce it to nothingness. He is a replica of those of us who are dehumanised, alienated, immoral and egotistically ready to achieve their goals ... regardless of the repercussions on the larger society".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is clear that this type of Afrikaans folklore text themes of complicated everyday moral issues, like [[Greed and fear|greed]], [[bullying]] and hedonism.

=== Stereotypes ===
Robinson&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; warns that knowledge of differences between cultures can separate rather than unite learners because it may lead to [[Stereotype|stereotyping]]. According to her it is actually the study of similarities that will lead to [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural]] understanding. Bredella &amp; Haack&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Bredella, L. &amp; Haack, D. 1988. ''Perceptions and misperceptions: The United States and Germany.'' Tübingen: Gunter Narr Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; also looks at stereotypes and argues that "a foreign culture challenges our basic assumptions and demands that we reconstruct the original context of a culture in order to understand its symbols in terms of the people who have created them".

Lippmann&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; advises us "not to try and give up stereotypes but to learn to use them in a reflective and self-critical way ... the insight into the selective nature of [[stereotype]]s can make us self-critical and can encourage us to compare other [[point of view (philosophy)|perspectives]] and the motives behind them."

The challenge to the [[Teacher|educator]] concerned with the teaching of Afrikaans as an additional language, is to find and select literature texts carefully so that the stereotypes found in these texts can be analysed, formulated, expressed and communicated. In this way stereotypes can present opportunities in the classroom for an objective investigation into this phenomenon. The study of folklore is imminently suitable to contribute to this developmental aim.

A very good example in support of this argument, is a report by Hattingh&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; where she used the story "Tséane en die perd" (written by Minnie Postma) in a study with her Afrikaans Second Language students. This folktale tells the story of a black woman who does not fit in with the [[customary]] stereotype. Tséane is portrayed as a rebel - in spite of her strict, traditional upbringing she longs for freedom, and to play a role different to the one in which her patriarchal society wishes to cast her. This story was Hattingh's students' first encounter with Afrikaans oral literature as part of the important [[cultural heritage]] of Africa. Hattingh mentions that this story was received extremely favourably by the students. It is obvious from Hattingh's report that the shift in emphasis from literary textual analysis to a focus on everyday issues made it possible for the students to use their own life experience and to progress to [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] and [[:wikt:independent|independent]] thinking.

{{Culture of Albania}}

The '''Albanian art''' ({{IPA-sq|aˈr:ti ʃcipˈta:rɛ}} — {{Lang-sq|Arti Shqiptarë}}) refers to all [[art|artistic expressions]] and [[artwork]]s in [[Albania]] or produced by [[Albanians]]. The country's art is either work of arts produced by its [[Albanian people|people]] and influenced by its [[Culture of Albania|culture]] and [[Traditions of Albania|traditions]]. It has preserved its original elements and traditions despite its long and eventful [[History of Albania|history]] around the time when Albania was populated to [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greek]]s and subsequently conquered by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Eastern Roman Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. 
 
At different times, [[Illyrian art|Illyrian]], [[Ancient Greek art|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman art|Roman art]] developed in Albania and survived in a number of media inclusive of [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[pottery]], and [[mosaic]]. The [[Rock inscriptions of the Grama Bay|rock inscriptions]] in [[Bays of Albania|Grama Bay]] and [[mosaic]] in [[The Beauty of Durrës|Durrës]] can be traced back to the [[4th century BC]] and there are nonetheless ancient remains of extraordinary quality available at [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Byllis]], [[Rozafa Castle|Shkodër]], [[Butrint]] and [[Protected areas of Albania#Archaeological Parks|elsewhere]] across the country.

The centerpiece of medieval Albanian art started with the successor of the [[Roman Empire]], namely the [[Byzantine Empire]] that ruled the great majority of Albania and the [[Balkan Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"&gt;{{cite web|title=Icons from the Orthodox Communities of Albania - COLLECTION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF MEDIEVAL ART, KORCË|url=https://helios-eie.ekt.gr/EIE/bitstream/10442/8555/1/INR_Drakopoulou_06_01.pdf|website=helios-eie.ekt.gr|page=20|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised gradually of [[fresco]]es, [[mural]]s, and [[icon]]s painted with an admirable use of color and [[Gold (color)|gold]]. [[Onufri]], [[David Selenica]], [[Kostandin Shpataraku]] and the [[Zografi Brothers]] are the most eminent representatives of medieval Albanian art. The [[Epitaph of Gllavenica]], an [[epitaph]] written on a [[shroud]], is one of the best artifacts of this genre in the [[Balkans]].

During the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman invasion]] of Albania, many [[Albanians]] migrated out of the area to escape either various socio-political and economic difficulties. Among them, the medieval [[painter]]s [[Marco Basaiti]] and [[Viktor Karpaçi]], [[Sculpture|sculptor]] and [[architect]] [[Andrea Alessi|Andrea Nikollë Aleksi]] and [[art collector]] [[Alessandro Albani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walker Art Gallery|title=Annual Report and Bulletin of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-W0rAAAAIAAJ|quote=Andrea Alessi, architect and sculptor, was a native of Durazzo in Albania and possibly of local rather than Italian origin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinger|first=Franz|title=L'origine albanese del pittore Marco Basaiti (ca. 1470 - ca. 1530),|journal=Atti.

The [[Albanian Renaissance]], in the field of arts, developed for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] in rather different directions especially toward the [[occident]] and was initially dominated by the central figure of [[Kolë Idromeno]]. Painters were searching for meaning, traditions and identity, leading initially to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and later with [[impressionism]].

== History ==

=== Early period ===

[[File:Kamenica07-00.jpg|190px|thumb|right|An Devollian pottery from [[Kamenica Tumulus|Kamenica]].]]

Within the boundaries of Albania there have been several [[prehistoric]] Mediterranean cultures that left a number of pictoral records located in the Kryegjata Valley, [[Goranxi]], [[Maliq]], [[Konispol|Konispol Cave]], [[Urakë|Blaz Cave]], [[Gajtan Cave]], [[Treni Cave]] and numerous other sites throughout Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceka|2013|page=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Templer|2016|page=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Templer|2016|page=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Aleks Trushaj, Ermal Sina|title=The Particularity of Prehistoric Culture in Vlora Region (Albania)|url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/ajis/article/download/3069/3026|website=mcser.org|pages=1-8|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Bronze Age]], a number of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] tribes started to emerge itself on the territory of Albania and established several artistic centers at the same time. [[Terracotta]] was widely used by both cultures most notably for reliefs and other architectural purposes. Quite a number of terracotta figures, among others from the Illyrians, were found near [[Belsh]] but besides that as well throughout Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Illyrian terracotta ﬁgurines of Aphroditeand other ceramic objects using EDXRF spectrometry†|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/xrs.945/epdf?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=www.google.de&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|location=Tirana|page=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Bagnell Bury, Stanley Arthur Cook, Frank Ezra Adcock|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: The Augustan Empire, 43 B.C.-A.D. 69, 2nd ed., 1996 - Band 10 von The Cambridge Ancient History, Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards|publisher=University Press, 1996|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=1OTgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=illyrian+pottery+albania&amp;dq=illyrian+pottery+albania&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxspPF67TZAhWECewKHf-OATo4ChDoAQg-MAM|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bashkia Belsh|url=http://www.qarkuelbasan.gov.al/?crd=0,8,1,0,0,74&amp;ln=1&amp;uni=20101209233420201012092334129193|website=qarkuelbasan.gov.al|accessdate=10 December 2010|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From earliest times [[mosaic]]s have been used to cover floors in principal rooms of buildings, palaces, and tombs, as well as in the formal rooms of private houses. The use of mosaic became widespread in [[Illyria]] and [[Ancient Greek colonies in Illyria|Ancient Greek]] colonies within the Illyrian coast on the [[Adriatic]] and the [[Ionian Sea]]. The earliest examples of mosaic flooring date to the ancient period are housed in [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]],
[[Butrint]], [[Tirana]], [[Lin, Korçë|Lin]], and [[Durrës]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ferid Hudhri|title=2.10.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period is marked by the production of [[sculpture]]s presented as [[symbolic art]]. [[Roman sculpture]] was largely influenced by the sculptures of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and the [[Etruscan civilization]] whereas impressive examples can be mostly found in the cities of [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] and [[Butrint]], which flourished during that period.

=== Medieval period ===

[[File:Epitafi.jpg|160px|thumb|right|The [[Epitaph of Gllavenica]] is often considered the highlight of medieval Albanian art that was commissioned by [[Gjergj Arianiti]] in 1373.]]

When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided in the fourth century, most of [[Illyria]] remained in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] that was conventionally known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine art]], the art of the Eastern Roman Empire from about the 5th century until the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, was predominantly marked by religious expressions and a renewed interest in techniques of the [[Roman Empire]] mixed with the themes of [[Christianity]].

[[Icon]]s and [[fresco]]es emerged as a significant art form with an extensive church building in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=L. Shumka from [[Agricultural University of Tirana]]|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|location=Tirana|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They covered [[Sacred architecture|sacred building]] interior walls, floors and domes increased and expanded in size and importance. The use of [[Gold (color)|gold]] and bright [[color]]s was important indeed each color had its own value and meaning. In addition, colors were never mixed together but were always used pure.

The earliest icons of Albania date from the thirteenth century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"/&gt; No paintings before the thirteenth century, produced by Albanians, have been located to date.&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"/&gt; Nonetheless few older structures in the country house different collections of paintings dating to the Byzantine period.

[[Illuminated manuscript|Manuscript]]s were another significant feature of Albanian medieval art. The handwritten [[Codex Beratinus]] and [[Codex Beratinus II]] are two ancient [[Gospel Book|Gospel]]s from [[Berat]], dating from the sixth and ninth centuries. They represent one of the most valuable treasures of the Albanian cultural heritage that was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2005.
 
By the fifteenth century after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and the invasion of [[Southeastern Europe]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]], art produced by [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] living in the [[Balkans]] was often named [[Post-Byzantine art]]. In that period many valuable monuments and artifacts were made by Albanian painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KONFERENCA E DYTË E STUDIMEVE ALBANOLOGJIKE|url=http://www.albanianorthodox.com/ikonografi/shkolla-e-korces.pdf|website=albanianorthodox.com|location=Tirana|page=2|language=Albanian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voskopojë St.Nikolaos - Innenraum Fresko 4b.jpg|270px|thumb|left|[[Fresco]] of [[Saint Stephen]] by [[David Selenica]].]]

The most famous Albanian painter was [[Onufri]] who worked almost his entire life in Albania and Macedonia.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Onufri was distinguished for its rich use of colors and decorative shades with certain [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] national elements that are more visible with his successors [[David Selenica]], [[Kostandin Shpataraku]] and the [[Zografi Brothers]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; They lavishly painted diverse churches and monasteries throughout Albania and neighboring countries, especially visible in [[Berat]], [[Elbasan]], [[Voskopojë]], and [[Korçë]].

The [[Ottoman period in the history of Albania|Ottoman period]] of Albania during the fifteenth century is traditionally said to have had a negative impact on Albanian art and so the influences of [[Renaissance]] were extinguished. This influence was absorbed and reinterpreted with an extensive construction of [[mosque]]s that opened a new section in Albanian art, that of [[Islamic art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Edmond Manahasa, İlknur Aktug Kolay|title=Observations on the existing Ottoman mosques in Albania|url=http://www.az.itu.edu.tr/azvol12no2web/09-Manahasa-Kolay-1202.pdf|website=az.itu.edu.tr|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of art was usually portrayed by the highest degree of [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s, [[arabesque]]s and [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]] of interlacing geometrical patterns of polygons, circles and interlocked lines and curves.

=== Albanian Renaissance ===
{{See also|Albanian Renaissance}}

[[File:Kole_Idromeno,_Motra_tone.jpg|160px|thumb|''[[Motra Tone]]'' by [[Kolë Idromeno]].]]

In the nineteenth century, a significant era for Albanian art begins. The great liberation acts starting with [[League of Prizren]] in 1878, that led to the [[Declaration of independence of Albania|Independence]] in 1912, established the climate for a new [[artistic movement]], which would reflect life and history more realistically and [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] came into dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=MaryLee Knowlton|title=Albania - Band 23 von Cultures of the world|publisher=Marshall Cavendish, 2004|isbn=9780761418528|pages=102–103|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=alNsb0fpX9IC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=impressionism+in+albania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fPpah7v3Kz&amp;sig=JGfwa8DMK_VAyq_75OHNgJni3qw&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj274SevZzZAhVDxxQKHQytBusQ6AEIUzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=impressionism%20in%20albania&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kolë Idromeno]] is perhaps the most famous of the Realist painters in the country and often considered as the introducer of Realism in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ferid Hudhri|title=Albania Through Art|date=2003|publisher=Onufri|location=Tirana|isbn=9992753676|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists captured the [[History of Albania|historical]] past and identity of [[Albanians]] in landscapes of vast forests, wide rivers, pristine lakes as well as portraits. Other artists have been focused on social criticism, showing the conditions of the people. By the early twentieth century, a radical artistic change occurred and experienced a patriotic renaissance. The year 1883 is dominated and celebrated for the creation of the most crucial and finest paintings The Portrait of Skanderbeg by Jorgji Panariti and [[Motra Tone]] by [[Kolë Idromeno]].

[[Impressionism]] did not make itself evident among Albanian artists until after 1900. It did inspired numerous painters among them Vangjush Mio, the first impressionist painter of Albania.

By the middle of the twentieth century, a [[communist]] government took rule over Albania and the artwork that arrived during the communist era reflects its time. Art was censored by the government and artists were urged to create works that endorsed [[socialism]]. The dominant theme of Albanian paintings was the [[proletariat]], the backbone of the socialist system. Much of the country's art focused on domestic scenes such as men working in the fields and women feeding chickens. Also, landscape scenes were highly popularized by Albanian painters.

=== Modern period ===
[[File:Detail_of_Painting_of_Female_Partisan_in_Battle_-_National_Historical_Museum_-_Tirana_-_Albania_-_01_(42748115122).jpg|thumb|Detail of female partisan in battle, National History Museum, Tirana, Albania]]
Although Albania left communism for democracy in 1991, scholars currently label Albanian artwork under the category of "[[socialist realism]]", for its emphasis on portraying real people and situations. Although much of Albanian artwork is influenced by [[impressionism]] and [[expressionism]], it is most [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] in its depiction of everyday life. Such works can be found at the National Arts Gallery of Albania and the National History Museum both located in Tirana. Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however, new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content.
 
Alt post-modernism was only introduced fairly recently among Albanian artists, there are a number of artists and works known internationally. Among the most famous Albanian post-modernists are [[Anri Sala]], [[Sislej Xhafa]], and [[Helidon Gjergji]].

Post-modern tendencies among Albanians were first spotted during the 1980s in [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.divus.cz/umelec/en/pages/umelec.php?id=1005&amp;roc=2003&amp;cis=3 |title=Shkëlzen Maliqi, Umelec Magazine |access-date=2009-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206231152/http://www.divus.cz/umelec/en/pages/umelec.php?id=1005&amp;roc=2003&amp;cis=3#clanek |archive-date=2008-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptures of national icons became popular throughout the country. In 1968, Sculptor [[Odhise Paskali]] (with help from fellow sculptors [[Andrea Mana]] and [[Janaq Paço]]) constructed a monument of [[Skanderbeg]], Albania’s national hero, in honor of the 500th anniversary of his death, and it is placed in the center of the capital city of [[Tirana]].

The Tirana Biennale is the main contemporary, international art event. Founded in 2001 by Edi Muka, Gezim Qëndro, and [[Giancarlo Politi]], it has enjoyed over the years the contribution of many international curators, like [[Francesco Bonami]], [[Adela Demetja]], [[Massimiliano Gioni]], [[Jens Hoffmann]], [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], and [[Harald Szeemann]]. Many famous Albanian and foreign artists are usually invited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tica-albania.org/TICAB/ TICA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dedications ==

Through different times, various [[visual art]] works of foreign artists throughout [[Europe]], such as [[painting]]s, [[portrait]]s, [[etching]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[relief]]s and works of other genres of art has been dedicated to [[Albania]] and the [[Albanian people]].

In 1809, the [[English people|English]] poet and nobleman [[Lord Byron]] arrived in Albania which made a great impression upon him and his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Galt|title=The life of Lord Byron|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers, 1835|location=Harvard University|pages=96-100|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=fPwVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=lord+byron+albania&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXr6-3tbfZAhXGC-wKHcI1COIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lord%20byron%20albania&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, [[Thomas Phillips]] completed in 1813 a portrait of Lord Byron that shows him wearing a [[Traditional Albanian clothing|traditional Albanian dress]] that Byron also described it the most magnificent in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Hüttler, Emily M.

'''''The Balloon''''' (in Hungarian: '''''Léghajó''''') is a work of art by Hungarian artist [[Pál Szinyei Merse]] from 1878.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063625/HU_280_007.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The picture is oil on canvas and has dimensions of 42 x 39.3&amp;nbsp;cm. 
The picture is part of the collection of the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mng.hu/kepkereso/oldal:2/608&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The work was inspired by a balloon trip taken by the brother-in-law of the artist after leaving [[Munich]] in May 1873, when he returned to his birthplace in Hungary. Like many of his countrymen, he travelled to [[France]] to study contemporary arts. After returning to Hungary, he married due to family care fails to implement many of their creative thinking. In 1878 he began to paint pictures full of optimism, a symbol of boldness and youth. Many of his works included themes of technological progress and innovation. His painting "bubble" symbolizes progress, as the air one forgets about all your petty problems and develop your imagination. In his painting overcome gravity marked human thought as flight and creative freedom.

'''Bhayānaka''' (Sanskrit: भयानक, Bhayānaka)  is one of the nine [[Indian aesthetics|rasas]], usually translated as fear. Rasa means "flavour", and the theory of rasa is the primary concept behind classical [[Indian art]]s, including [[theatre]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[poetry]], and even [[sculpture]].

The front is a shiny polished surface and could be used as a mirror, while the back has a design cast in the bronze.&lt;ref name=unesco-courrier&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Courier |date=October 1988 |pages=16–17 |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000817/081712eo.pdf |title=Magic Mirrors |accessdate=23 August 2011 |publisher=Unesco |issn=0041-5278}}&lt;/ref&gt; When bright sunlight or other bright light reflects onto the mirror, the mirror seems to become [[transparency and translucency|transparent]]. If that light is reflected from the mirror towards a wall, the pattern on the back of the mirror is then projected onto the wall.&lt;ref name=unesco-courrier/&gt;

In about 800 AD, during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), a book entitled ''Record of Ancient Mirrors'' described the method of crafting solid [[bronze mirror]]s with decorations, written characters, or patterns on the reverse side that could cast these in a reflection on a nearby surface as light struck the front, polished side of the mirror; due to this seemingly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent effect]], they were called "light-penetration mirrors" by the Chinese.&lt;ref name=unesco-courrier/&gt;&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;Temple, Robert (1986). ''The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention.'' New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. p. 66-67 {{ISBN|0-671-62028-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This Tang era book was lost over the centuries, but magic mirrors were described in the ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' by [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), who owned three of them as a family [[heirloom]].&lt;ref name=unesco-courrier/&gt;&lt;ref name="temple"/&gt; Perplexed as to how solid metal could be transparent, Shen guessed that some sort of [[quench]]ing technique was used to produce tiny wrinkles on the face of the mirror too small to be observed by the eye.&lt;ref name=unesco-courrier/&gt;&lt;ref name="temple"/&gt; Although his explanation of different cooling rates was incorrect, he was right to suggest the surface contained minute variations which the naked eye could not detect; these mirrors also had no transparent quality at all, as discovered by [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]] in 1932 (after an entire century of them confounding Western scientists).&lt;ref name=unesco-courrier/&gt;&lt;ref name="temple"/&gt;

Robert Temple describes their construction: "The basic mirror shape, with the design on the back, was cast flat, and the convexity of the surface produced afterwards by elaborate scraping and scratching. The surface was then polished to become shiny. The stresses set up by these processes caused the thinner parts of the surface to bulge outwards and become more convex than the thicker portions. Finally, a [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] amalgam was laid over the surface; this created further stresses and preferential buckling. The result was that imperfections of the mirror surface matched the patterns on the back, although they were too minute to be seen by the eye. But when the mirror reflected bright sunlight against a wall, with the resultant magnification of the whole image, the effect was to reproduce the patterns as if they were passing through the solid bronze by way of light beams."&lt;ref name="unesco-courrier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="temple" /&gt;

[[Michael Berry (physicist)|Michael Berry]] has written a paper describing the optics and giving some photos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelberryphysics.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/berry383.pdf "Oriental magic mirrors and the Laplacian image"] by Michael Berry, Eur. J. Phys. 27 (2006) 109–118, DOI:

'''Cholamandal Artists' Village''', established in 1966, is the largest artists' commune in India. Its artists are credited for the Madras Movement of Art (1950s–1980s), which brought [[modernism]] to art in [[South India]]. Their work is widely recognized as some of the best art produced in postwar India and is shown regularly in galleries across the country. Several Cholamandal artists have also shown in Europe, the United States and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=In India, Pioneers of Modernism Savor Their Success |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/29/arts/arts-abroad-in-india-pioneers-of-modernism-savor-their-success.html?pagewanted=all |date=29 January 1998 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=[[Stephen Kinzer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the village [[Injambakkam]], 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chennai]], [[India]], it has over 20 resident painters and sculptors, who live as a community and pool their skills. They run the Artists Handicrafts Association, a cooperative which manages the village and sale of works through the permanent exhibition at the complex, which includes paintings, sketches, terra-cotta/stone/metal sculptures, batiks and handicrafts etc., making the village a self-supporting entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Cholamandal-Artists%27-Village-25859.htm Cholamandal Artists' Village]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Celebrate the oeuvre|url=http://www.hindu.com/businessline/2000/10/02/stories/100244m2.htm|date=2 October 2000|publisher=[[Business Line]]|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The community was founded by [[K. C. S. Paniker]], the principal of the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Arts]], along with his students and a few artists associated with the college. It used the `art-meets-craft' approach where artists made handicrafts for a living as they pursued their art. By the 1970s, the village became self-sufficient and grew into one of the most important meeting places for international artists in India. Today, it is one of the few artist-driven movements in India. Four decades on, it is one of the few artists' colonies in the world to survive successfully and its foundation remains one of the "10 biggest art moments" in India.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=10 biggest art moments |url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=116&amp;id=22988&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=25|date=19 December 2008  |publisher=[[India Today]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Most of the original founding creative artists, painters and sculptors were students and artists associated with the [[Government School of Arts and Crafts, Chennai]] (Madras School of Arts), where [K.C.S. Paniker], noted metaphysical and abstract painter, was principal 1957 to 1967. These artists desired to form a congenial space for practising their art; 38 of them got together and formed the 'Artists Handicrafts Association' (AHA) in 1963 initially to sell the works of artists.

Gradually, the artists started working together, producing handicrafts in their spare time. They were among the first in the country to produce [[batik]] fabric; proceeds of their first batik exhibition went into buying the {{convert|8.5|acre|m2}} of land in 1966, which was to make up the village.&lt;ref name=art/&gt; By now K.C.S. Paniker had retired and founded the artists commune in April 1966.

It was named after the [[Chola dynasty]], which is known to have encouraged arts and ruled the region, 9-13th century AD — called ''Cholamandalam'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which literally translated as ''the realm of the [[Chola]]s''. Chola also lends its name to the [[Coromandel Coast]] of [[Bay of Bengal]], which is a short walk from the village.&lt;ref name=ab&gt;[http://www.cholamandalartistsvillage.org/aboutus.html About us]&lt;/ref&gt; Paniker was "worried that his students might deviate from art due to financial compulsions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tantric geometry: Velu Viswanadhan|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story_print.php?storyId=30155 |date=5 May 2007 |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |page=|quote="“Panicker was worried that his students might deviate from art due to financial compulsions. 'Cholamandalam gave them the security,' says Viswanadhan."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year six artists moved into live and work on their own land. In the 60s, while they could hardly sell their paintings, avant garde wood and leather work, batik, ceramics and metal craft, they found a good market. This sustained them, while the local buyers were familiarized to modernism, which their art represented.

Electricity was provided in 1968 and till 1972 the mud road ended at [[Muttukadu boat house|Muttukadu]]. The village was on a lonely, bumpy road, now known as the [[East Coast Road]] highway to [[Mahabalipuram]], from [[Adyar (Tamil Nadu)|Adyar]]. Chennai was further away, though today, it is right at its door steps, and the road is busy with traffic and shops and commercial establishments. Over the years, built their houses, studios, exhibition gallery, theatre, workshop and kitchen, which they jointly owned along with all the infrastructure of the village.

It nurtured artists such as [[J. Sultan Ali]], [[K.M. Gopal|Dr. K.M. Gopal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = K.M | first1 = Gopal | first2 = Selin | last2 = George

Nanda Gopal, S.G. Vasudev, K. Jayapala Panicker, Gopinath, Senathipathy, M.V. Devan and Richard Jesudas. Soon they formed a cooperative to look after the village and built a gallery, which displayed and sold their works; 20% of their sales went to the ‘Cholamandal Artists Handicrafts Association’, which used the funds for village upkeep. In time the cooperative became self-sufficient and held exhibitions of their work in major cities of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India: Country Guides, Lonely Planet |last= Singh|first=Sarina|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location= |isbn=1-74104-308-5|page=1044 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7ZHUhSEleYC&amp;pg=PA1044&amp;dq=%22Cholamandal+Artists+Village%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cholamandal%20Artists%20Village%22&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cholamandal collection  |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/life/2009/02/27/stories/2009022750120400.htm |date=27 February 2009 |publisher=[[Business Line]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art==
During his last days Paniker had offered his oeuvre to the Madras government on the condition that a separate gallery be created for his work. When no response came from the government, the Trivandrum Art Gallery took up the offer and now houses an important collection of Paniker's work. The artists at the village wanted a place to display the work of the Madras Movement, thus idea of the art museum took place.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt;

The artists raised money from the private sector to fund a museum in the village, which would house a permanent collection of artworks representative of the Madras Movement.&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{Cite web|title=Arts and ideas|url=http://www.hindu.com/businessline/2000/12/04/stories/100444a3.htm|date=4 December 2000 |publisher=[[Business Line]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Master takes |url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main42.asp?filename=hub080809mastertakes.asp |date=8 August 2009 |publisher=[[Tehelka]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial design was made by a visiting Dutch couple, the design for the art centre was made by architects [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] of [[Shilpa Architects]] and M. V. Devan. As the project gathered momentum help came in from artists and corporates alike.

After three and half years of construction the building was finished — thus started a long search for works that exemplified the Madras Movement, which flourished between the early 50s and the 80s. Eventually about 60 per cent of the works were donated by senior artists and the rest were given on extended loan by art collectors around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Another first for Indian art |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2008/06/03/stories/2008060350110100.htm |date=3 June 2008 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cholamandal Centre for Contemporary Art opened on 1 February 2009. It has a 'Museum of the Madras Movement', which display works of prominent artists of the movement (apart from that of Paniker) including J. Sultan Ali, [[K.M. Gopal|Dr. K.M. Gopal]] M.

It is surrounded by tree-shaded sands which sport an international sculpture garden, displaying sculptures made by visiting artists from across India and the world through the decades.&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{Cite web|title= Eclectic mix of styles |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2003011300100200.htm&amp;date=2003/01/13/&amp;prd=mp&amp; |date= 13 January 2003|newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cholamandal does not accept new members, though it has at least a dozen artists living or working there at any time, plus many artists-in-residence are at work.&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

The village is open daily from 10am to 5pm. It is 10-minute walking distance from the Golden Beach. Local transport is easily available, and the Chennai International Airport is the nearest airport.

'''''A Treatise on Painting''''' is a collection of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s writings entered in his notebooks under the general heading "On Painting". The manuscripts were gathered together by [[Francesco Melzi]] some time before 1542 and first printed in French and Italian as ''Trattato della pittura'' by Raffaelo du Fresne in 1651. The main aim of the treatise was to argue that painting was a science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336408/Leonardo-da-Vinci/59104/Science#ref=ref360266 |title=Science: Science of Painting |publisher=Britannica |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygU6MRiXBN8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The Collected Essays and Criticism: Affirmations and refusals, 1950-1956 By Clement Greenberg, John O'Brian, page 259 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo's keen observation of expression and character is evidenced in his comparison of laughing and weeping, about which he notes that the only difference between the two emotions in terms of the "motion of the [facial] features" is "the ruffling of the brows, which is added in weeping, but more elevated and extended in laughing." &lt;ref&gt;Chapter CLXXII, trans.

'''''Decoded''''' is the autobiography and memoir of rapper [[Jay-Z]], published by [[Random House]] and released November 16, 2010 on Hardcover and November 1, 2011 on Paperback.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoded|url=https://www.amazon.com/Decoded-Jay-Z/dp/1400068924/ref=br_lf_m_1000623831_1_6_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;pf_rd_p=1278243542&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_i=1000623831&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0F5A1QS83G9RD5VSFD8S|publisher=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book combines lyrics, their explanations, anecdotes, reflections, and autobiographical information. [[Jay-Z]] explains the three reasons why he wanted to write the book being a case for hip-hop lyrics as poetry, to tell a generational story turned into powerful experiences and revolved as a story everyone can relate to.&lt;ref name="Jay2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jay-Z|title=Decoded|year=2010|publisher=Random House|location=New York, New York|isbn=9781400068920|pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Narrative===
The book follows very rough chronological order, while switching from current stories to his story of growing up in the [[Marcy Projects]]. The autobiographical portion focuses on growing up in poverty which led to him to drug dealing during the [[crack epidemic]], fights, and a need to share the hustlers story during the beginnings in rap. His reflections on those harsh times shaped who he is and how artists are shaped by such experiences.

===Celebrity life===
[[Jay-Z]] explains the stresses of the rap industry and the celebrity life, while also trying to put it in perspective. He illustrates this point by explaining that when he and [[Puff Daddy]] were being charged with assault there were hundreds of cameras outside the courthouse of [[Puff Daddy]]'s trial and the courthouse where the perpetrator of the [[World Trade Center bombing]] was being tried was empty.

===Opinions and reflections===
Along with the narrative, there is also a substantial portion of the book dedicated to [[Jay-Z]]'s opinions and reflections, which are often illustrated with stories. [[Jay-Z]] expounds on his relationship with [[Barack Obama]] and his involvement in politics, as well as his thoughts on the [[Hurricane Katrina]].
[[Jay-Z]] reflects on his life and especially his beginnings. He explains that he still considers himself a hustler, despite being a corporate billionaire now as founder of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. He continues and describes the comparisons between drug dealing, rapping, and boxing and how his life in the streets has molded who he is and no matter how he lives now, he still acknowledges his roots.

===Lyrics===
The book contains lyrics to thirty-six songs with some songs having only part of the song.&lt;ref name="etonline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay-Z to 'Decode' Lyrics in New Book |url=http://www.etonline.com/music/101041_Jay_Z_to_Decode_Lyrics_in_New_Book/index.html |publisher=Entertainment Tonight |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019174402/http://www.etonline.com/music/101041_Jay_Z_to_Decode_Lyrics_in_New_Book/index.html |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the lyrics, there are annotations and footnotes that Jay-Z writes to explain the lyrics to the reader. The explanations range from just explaining what a "brick" is to in depth analysis and explanation of lines that underscore the points that [[Jay-Z]] makes in his writing.

==Critical response==
Most of the criticism is that the book is not personal enough and does not provide enough detail of [[Jay-Z]]'s life. Simon Vozick-Levinson writes in [[Entertainment Weekly]] ""Despite the career he has made out of rapping in the first person, Jay-Z is known for prizing privacy. His new book 'Decoded' may not erase that reputation." Although Vozick Levinson expands and reveals "it is nonetheless [[Shawn Carter]]'s most honest airing of the experiences he drew on to create the mythic figure of [[Jay-Z]],"  while giving the book a grade of A-.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|title=Book Review: Decoded, Jay-Z|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20440841,00.html|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adam Bradley of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] criticizes the structure of the book because it is not organized by chronological order, but by subject as well as criticizes its lack of depth in some areas by explaining "At times, these subject-driven sections leave one dissatisfied with the level of revelation and reflection, such as in his cursory treatment of race relations.&lt;ref name="bnreview.barnesandnoble"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Adam|title=Life of an Artist: Decoded, Jay-Z|url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Decoded/ba-p/3619|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Plagiarism claims==
On June 13, 2012 a lawsuit was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] accusing [[Jay-Z]] and coauthor [[Dream Hampton]] of copyright infringement and invasion of privacy for ''Decoded.'' The lawsuit, filed by Patrick White also names [[Random House]], the company that published ''Decoded.'' White alleges "In 2009, my personal computer was compromised, resulting in my personal work to be used in [[Jay-Z]]'s book 'Decoded' which was released in 2010.&lt;ref name="xxlmag"&gt;{{cite web|last=Narunsky|first=Kim|title=Jay-Z Sued For Copyright Infringement Over Decoded Book|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2012/06/jay-z-sued-for-copyright-infringement-over-decoded-book/|publisher=XXL Magazine|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;" White is claiming that he was working on a book on his personal computer when it was compromised and when reading ''Decoded'', he noticed a resemblance in "expressions/color/phrases, which correlates to my work.&lt;ref name="xxlmag" /&gt;"  In the handwritten lawsuit, White alleges that he sought out [[Jay-Z]] and [[Dream Hampton]], but they were unresponsive to his contact.&lt;ref name="allhiphop"&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Greg|title=EXCLUSIVE: Jay-Z Sued Over Book "Decoded"|url=http://allhiphop.com/2012/06/18/exclusive-jay-z-sued-over-book-decoded/|publisher=All Hip-Hop.com|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2040">In the design of [[user interface|human-machine user interfaces]] (HMIs or UIs), the '''Design Eye Position (DEP)''' is the position from which the user is intended to view the [[workstation]] for an optimal view of the visual interface. The Design Eye Position represents the ideal but notional location of the operator's view and is usually expressed as a monocular point midway between the pupils of the average user. The DEP may also allow for a standardisation of monocular and binocular "Field of View" and may be integrated into the [[CAD/CAM]] design system used to define the workstation build.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cockpiteval.home.att.net/MilStd1333.htm US Military Standard 1333A, Aircrew Station Geometry For Military Aircraft]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DEP is particularly important in those operator workstations, such as the [[cockpit]] of a military fast jet, where an accurate reading of information and symbols on displays may be critical. When designing such user interfaces the DEP is used as the reference point for the location of items (e.g. displays or controls) within the interface.

== Military Aviation ==
With [[collimated]] displays, such of the cockpit [[Head Up Display]], the projected symbology is aligned very precisely with the outside world to allow for precise delivery of weapons and also for safe landing. Unless located at the Design Eye Position the pilot cannot see the symbology as it is effectively focussed at infinity. Similarly, Head Down Displays will usually be angled precisely towards the DEP so that all symbols may be equally visible to the pilot without parallax or other display distortion errors.

Pilots who are below or above the 50% percentile point for sitting height, i.e. not of average stature, may need to adjust the seat in order to attain the DEP, even if this means compromising their optimal reach envelope. This is why, for example, rudder pedals may need to be adjustable.

[[File:Endless Night K83.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Endless Night'', oil on canvas, 2.25 X 3 meters (7.5 X 10 feet), 1983]]

'''''Endless Night''''' is the title of a [[painting]] executed in 1983 by [[Nabil Kanso]] in [[Oil painting|oil paint]] on [[canvas]] measuring 2.25 X 3 meters (7.5 X 10 feet).&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso: Paintings 1974-94'', p.69, NEV Editions, Atlanta, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a group of interrelated paintings made by Kanso in response to the [[Lebanese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine, ''Artist Inspired by War-Torn Homeland,'' The Atlanta Journal – The Atlanta Constitution, p. 5 H, July 8, 1984, online [http://lebanonpainting.com/fox.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, I: ''Nabil Kanso Work'', Panorama, April 10, 1985, Maracaibo, article  [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/panorama.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts the ravages war in a scene that “embodies recurrent themes of carnage, suffering and the disintegration of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Artist Inspired by War,'' The Atlanta Journal, p.5H&lt;/ref&gt; 

The composition seems to divide the canvas in two zones that contrast one mass of helpless and tormented figures on the left and one group of complacent looking and rigidly poised figures on the upper right. The focal point appears to fall between the two contrasting sections toward the central horizontal line in the middle distance creating a variation of focus that moves from one side to another and spread the attention over the various areas.&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso: Paintings 1980-83'', Catalog, p. 19, Atlanta, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The swirls of somber tone emanating from the blaze of torched places in the background seem to reinforce the tense mood and sharpen the interplay of dark and light.&lt;ref&gt;Fuenmayor, Carlos, Space Cries, Time Cries, La Columna, pp.8-9, May 21, 1987, Maracaibo, article [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/fuenmayor.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Critical opinion notes “A dark palette tending to brown is set afire by strongly contrasting hues. A lurid orange illuminates the ''Endless Night'', in which figures with masklike faces standing on a parapet stonily witness the suffering of people and animals below.”&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine, ''The Political Show'', Atlanta Journal – Constitution, p. 3H, June 24, 1984, [http://lebanonwarpainting.com/ajc684.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fine press''' [[printing]] and [[publishing]] comprises historical and contemporary printers and publishers publishing [[book]]s and other printed matter of exceptional intrinsic quality and artistic taste, including both commercial and [[private press]]es.  Their dedication to fine printing distinguishes them from other [[small press]]es.  Fine press publications are often published in [[limited edition]]s, that are swiftly bought up by [[Book collecting|book collectors]] and libraries.

==History of fine press==

As part of the [[Art Nouveau]] movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Englishman [[William Morris]] wanted to hearken back to a golden age of printing, printmaking, and publishing.  One of the books they published was the [[Kelmscott Chaucer]].  Soon, fine presses began to spring up in the United States as well.  The most prominent was the [[Roycroft Press]].  Los Angeles was a center of the fine press movement, particularly centered on the Ward Ritchie press

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8992">The '''Great American Lesbian Art Show (GALAS)''' was an art exhibition at the [[Woman's Building]] (a feminist art center) in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] with associated events in other locations.&lt;ref name=DIY-IK/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArtInLA/&gt; It ran from 3–31 May 1980.&lt;ref name=DIY-IK/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poster/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center also supported the exhibit.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=IM-pg91/&gt;

==Structure==
The GALAS consisted of an "invitational" event, a curated exhibition of the work of ten selected artists, and many "regional" or "sister" exhibitions in multiple cities across the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=DIY-IK/&gt; These locations included New York City, [[San Francisco]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]], [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], and [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] among "over 200 shows and events."&lt;ref name=IM-pg91/&gt;&lt;ref name=Art-of-Engage/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reed-Art/&gt; According to Margo Hobbs Thompson, the art displayed constituted "a critique of contemporary gender norms."&lt;ref name=DIY-IK/&gt; It was described by [[Terry Wolverton]], one of the organizers, as "a year-long project to bring national recognition to lesbian art and artists."&lt;ref name=IM-pg91/&gt; All of the invited artists lived in either Los Angeles or [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=IM-pg91/&gt; GALAS was curated by the GALAS Collective including:  Terry Wolverton, Bia Lowe, Jody Isanna Palmer, Tyaga, and Louise Moore.  &lt;ref name=Art-of-Engage/&gt;

==Artists invited==
The artists invited to participate in the curated exhibit were:&lt;ref name=Poster/&gt;&lt;ref name=IM-pg91/&gt;

==Origins==
Planning for the GALAS started in the spring of 1979. The organizing group, known as the GALAS Collective, was separate from the [[Lesbian Art Project]], which also met at the Woman's Building, although there was some overlap of membership.&lt;ref name=DIY-IK/&gt;

==Reactions==
Tyaga, one of the event curators, was quoted by the [[Los Angeles Times]] while the exhibition was running as saying: "Just having the name 'Great American Lesbian Art Show' says a lot. It helps overcome fear. Art is non-threatening--it hangs on the wall and people look. It's the label that's the threat."&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

[[Harmony Hammond]], writing in the ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures'' said that GALAS was "noteworthy for its innovative curatorial structure" and that it "marked the first time that lesbians of color participated in a major exhibition of lesbian art."&lt;ref name=EoLaGHaC/&gt;

Christopher Reed described GALAS as "poorly documented" but said that it showed "a greater interest in figuration among lesbian artists outside New York."&lt;ref name=Reed-Art/&gt;

Simon LeVay wrote about the art displayed at GALAS and another exhibition of roughly the same time: "For the first time a wide range of artists were willing to be public about being lesbians, although some of them still kept lesbian content as a suggestion rather than an overt statement in their art."&lt;ref name=City-of-Friends/&gt;

Sarah L. Stifler wrote of the "variety of media" in GALAS, but said that it did not include the "blatant references to sexuality" that were featured in the 1990 exhibition "All but the Obvious" (ABO).&lt;ref name=Stifler-2002/&gt; Stifler also wrote that "Much of my research has focused on" GALAS and ABO.&lt;ref name=Stifler-2002/&gt;

"'''I'll Walk You Home'''" is the thirty-fifth episode of the [[Holby City (series 18)|eighteenth series]] of the British [[medical drama]] television series ''[[Holby City]]''. The episode was written by Andy Bayliss and directed by Paulette Randall, and premiered on [[BBC One]] on 7 June 2016. The episode features the death of established character [[Arthur Digby]] ([[Rob Ostlere]]), a [[Modernising Medical Careers|CT2]] doctor who had worked on the show's fictitious Keller and AAU wards. Writers worked alongside a consultant oncologist for medical advice to provide an accurate depiction of terminal cancer. The episode also features the return of two former regular characters and includes an appearance of a character from ''Holby City's'' sister-show ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.

The episode was structured with positive and upbeat tones transitioning into the dark scenes focusing on death. "I'll Walk You Home" received positive reviews from critics for its "gritty" theme. All reviews noted that it was an emotional episode. Sarah Deen from the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' branded it one of the "saddest episodes ever".

==Plot==
Arthur and his wife [[Modernising Medical Careers|F1]] [[Morven Shreve|Morven Digby]] (Eleanor Fanyinka) announce their decision to go travelling. They want to spend the time Arthur has left visiting historic sites. His best friend [[Specialty registrar|CT1]] doctor [[Dominic Copeland]] ([[David Ames (actor)|David Ames]]) is upset and thinks that Arthur is being selfish. Consultant general surgeon [[Ric Griffin]] ([[Hugh Quarshie]]) tries to make Dom realise that it is Arthur's choice. He decides to distract himself by attending to patient Alison Jones (Elizabeth Cadwallader). Dom realises that he has been unfair to Arthur and they have a discussion. Dom hands Arthur war medals that were stolen from their flat months earlier. Arthur realises that he wants to stay in Holby City and live out his final days with friends.

Consultant cardiothoracic surgeon [[Jac Naylor]] ([[Rosie Marcel]]) sets [[Specialty registrar|CT1]] doctor [[Zosia March]] ([[Camilla Arfwedson]]) a series of surgical tasks to prove her worth. Zosia rises to the challenge but becomes tired of Jac's demands. Jac tells Zosia she is selfish and uncaring towards Arthur. She accuses her of giving Arthur a stent operation to advance her own career. Zosia confronts Jac and accuses her of being "cold", this does not phase Jac who ignores her. Zosia ex-boyfriend, [[Specialist registrar]] [[Oliver Valentine]] ([[James Anderson (English actor)|James Anderson]]) and [[Staff nurse]] [[Cara Martinez]] ([[Niamh Walsh]]) apologise to her for sharing a kiss. Cara gives Oliver a picture of his dead wife [[Tara Lo]] ([[Jing Lusi]]) and Zosia spots him with it. [[Staff nurse]] [[Essie Harrison]] ([[Kaye Wragg]]) rallies staff to get ready to perform a song and dance surprise for Arthur. They perform a dance routine and are joined by [[Ethan Hardy]] ([[George Rainsford (actor)|George Rainsford]]). [[Antoine Malick]] ([[Jimmy Akingbola]]) makes a video call to Arthur to wish him well.

Arthur goes to visit CEO [[Henrik Hanssen]] ([[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]]) and he tells him that he has finally realised what he wants from life. Arthur's stent bursts and he collapses on the floor. Hanssen calls a crash team and tries to comfort Arthur. [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] [[Sacha Levy]] ([[Bob Barrett (actor)|Bob Barrett]]) and Ric try to operate on Arthur. Sacha announces that the cancer is too advanced and nothing more can be done and Ric agrees. Hanssen goes to AAU to inform Morven who is in theatre with [[Serena Campbell]] ([[Catherine Russell (actress)|Catherine Russell]]). Arthur is taken into a side room where Morven tells him that she loves him. Arthur is unconscious and has visions of Morven, Dom, Zosia and his old friend [[Chantelle Lane]] ([[Lauren Drummond]]). Arthur responds to Morven holding his hand but then dies surrounded by his friends and colleagues. Zosia breaks down on Darwin ward and Jac rushes to console her.

==Production==
The episode focuses around the final scenes of Rob Ostlere as Arthur Digby following three years in the show. The actor had informed producers of his decision to leave six months prior. They then devised an exit storyline for the character in which he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ostlere was told of their intention to kill the character off, the results of which play out in "I'll Walk You Home".&lt;ref name=woti/&gt; The events of the episode could have been different as producer Simon Harper later gave Ostlere the chance to have his character leave the show alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Holby City producers reveal that Rob Ostlere could have saved his character Arthur Digby|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby-city/news/a796974/holby-city-rob-ostlere-arthur-digby-could-have-been-saved/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=8 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was produced by Jane Wallbank, written by Andy Bayliss and directed by Paulette Randall.&lt;ref name=episode&gt;{{cite web|title=I'll Walk You Home|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07f72gb|website=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storyliners had been liaising with a consultant oncologist named Bruce Sizer who gave advice on the medical condition featured in the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur's last walk|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03xk5d1|website=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers structured the episode so it began "lovely and upbeat" until the closing scenes which contained Arthur's death.&lt;ref name=woti/&gt;

Former regular cast members Jimmy Akingbola and Lauren Drummond returned to filming especially for the episode, reprising their roles as Antoine Malick and Chantelle Lane respectively. Akingbola filmed scenes which were featured in a [[Skype]] video call. Drummond filmed scenes with other cast members, with her footage stylised as part of a dream sequence envisioned by Arthur.&lt;ref name=woti/&gt; The cast were involved in filming a number of dream sequences which were given a "surreal" feeling to them.&lt;ref name=wotint&gt;{{cite journal|title=Arthur's final journey|journal=[[What's on TV]]|date=4–10 June 2016|issue=22|pages=15|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Rainsford guest starred as Ethan Hardy, a character from ''Holby City's'' sister-show ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''. His inclusion was a result of a decision made by executive producer Oliver Kent who oversees both shows. Rainsford and Ostlere had been asking Kent for the scenes for some time. The actors were friends for fourteen years and wanted their characters to share screen-time.&lt;ref name=woti&gt;{{cite web|title='It was a lovely, upbeat episode until Arthur's final moments!'

==Promotion==
Producers wanted to keep exact details of the episode a secret until it was broadcast. They also wanted to Akingbola and Drummond's involvement quiet to surprise viewers.&lt;ref name=insidesoap/&gt; Though Ostlere did disclose that past characters would return in an interview published via ''[[What's on TV]]''.&lt;ref name=wotint/&gt; Advance spoilers only indicated that Arthur and Morven planned to leave ''Holby City'' to go travelling and that Zosia and Jac would feature in scenes on the show's Darwin ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Goodbye Arthur &amp; Morven?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=4–10 June 2016|issue=22|pages=27|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show released a promotional trailer for the episode a week in advance.

She called Arthur being readmitted to hospital "the most heartbreaking scenes". The scene involving Zosia and Jac breaking down in each other's arms "left viewers completely overcome with emotion".

'''Japanese art''' covers a wide range of art styles and media, including [[Jōmon Pottery|ancient pottery]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], [[Ink wash painting|ink painting]] and [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on silk and paper, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], ceramics, [[origami]], and more recently [[manga]]—modern Japanese [[cartoon]]ing and comics—along with a myriad of other types. It has a long history, ranging from the beginnings of human habitation in Japan, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present.

Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with [[Buddhism]]. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the [[Ōnin War]] (1467–1477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.

[[Painting]] is the preferred artistic expression in Japan, practiced by amateurs and professionals alike. Until modern times, the Japanese wrote with a [[Ink brush|brush]] rather than a [[pen]], and their familiarity with brush techniques has made them particularly sensitive to the values and [[aesthetics]] of painting. With the rise of popular culture in the [[Edo period]], a style of woodblock prints became a major form and its techniques were fine tuned to produce colorful prints.  The Japanese, in this period, found [[sculpture]] a much less sympathetic medium for artistic expression; most Japanese sculpture is associated with [[religion]], and the medium's use declined with the lessening importance of traditional Buddhism.

[[Japanese pottery|Japanese ceramics]] are among the finest in the world and include the earliest known artifacts of their culture. In [[Japanese architecture|architecture]], Japanese preferences for natural materials and an interaction of interior and exterior space are clearly expressed.

== History of Japanese art ==

=== Jōmon art ===
The first settlers of Japan, the [[Jōmon]] people (c. 11000&amp;nbsp;– c. 300 BC), named for the [[rope|cord]] markings that decorated the surfaces of their clay vessels, were nomadic hunter-gatherers who later practiced organized farming and built cities with populations of hundreds if not thousands. They built simple houses of wood and thatch set into shallow earthen pits to provide warmth from the soil. They crafted [[Jōmon pottery|lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels]], clay figurines called ''[[dogū]]'', and crystal jewels.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Yayoi art===
The next wave of immigrants was the [[Yayoi]] people, named for the district in [[Tokyo]] where remnants of their settlements first were found. These people, arriving in Japan about 350 BC, brought their knowledge of wetland rice cultivation, the manufacture of copper weapons and bronze bells (''[[dōtaku]]''), and wheel-thrown, kiln-fired [[ceramics]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Kofun art===

The third stage in Japanese prehistory, the [[Kofun]] period (c. 250&amp;nbsp;– 552 AD), represents a modification of [[Yayoi]] culture, attributable either to internal development or external force. The period is named for the large number of ''kofun'' [[Tumulus|megalithic tombs]] created during this period. In this period, diverse groups of people formed political alliances and coalesced into a nation. Typical artifacts are bronze mirrors, symbols of political alliances, and clay sculptures called ''[[haniwa]]'' which were erected outside tombs.

===Asuka and Nara art===

[[File:Dragon head Pitcher former Horyuji.JPG|thumb|150px|A dragon-head pitcher with [[Pegasus]] pattern incised, [[Gilding|gilded]] bronze　with silver, Asuka period, 7th century, former [[Horyu-ji]] Temple treasures, [[Tokyo National Museum]]]]

During the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s, so named because the seat of Japanese government was located in the Asuka Valley from 552 to 710 and in the city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] until 784, the first significant influx of continental Asian culture took place in Japan.

The transmission of Buddhism provided the initial impetus for contacts between China, Korea and Japan. The Japanese recognized the facets of [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] that could profitably be incorporated into their own: a system for converting ideas and sounds into writing; [[historiography]]; complex theories of government, such as an effective [[bureaucracy]]; and, most important for the arts, new technologies, new building techniques, more advanced methods of casting in [[bronze]], and new techniques and media for painting.

Throughout the 7th and 8th centuries, however, the major focus in contacts between Japan and the Asian continent was the development of Buddhism. Not all scholars agree on the significant dates and the appropriate names to apply to various time periods between 552, the official date of the introduction of Buddhism into Japan, and 784, when the Japanese capital was transferred from Nara. The most common designations are the Suiko period, 552–645; the [[Hakuhō period]], 645–710, and the Tenpyō period, 710–784.

""It should also be pointed out that there was considerable influence from Koguryo on the southern kingdoms of Paekche and Silla even though Paekche also received direct influence from south China, as was mentioned above." "I have argued that various groups, including official envoys, monks and students, as well as Korean settlers, were responsible for bringing Korean icons to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the [[Kōryū-ji]] [[Maitreya|Miroku]] Bosatsu and the [[Chūgū-ji]] [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] statues.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;

They illustrate the terminal point of the [[Silk Road transmission of art]] during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese [[Fūjin]] Wind God,&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins.&amp;nbsp;... One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Niō]] guardians,&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of [[Vajrapani]] should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules.&amp;nbsp;... The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardina Deities (Niō)." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; and the near-[[classical antiquity|Classical]] floral patterns in temple decorations.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Buddhist structures still extant in Japan, and the oldest wooden buildings in the [[Far East]] are found at the [[Hōryū-ji]] to the southwest of Nara. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]], it consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or ''Kondō'' (Golden Hall), and ''Gojū-no-tō'' (Five-story [[Pagoda]]), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. The ''Kondō'', in the style of [[Buddhism in China|Chinese worship]] halls, is a two-story structure of post-and-beam construction, capped by an ''[[irimoya]]'', or hipped-gabled roof of ceramic tiles.

Inside the ''Kondō'', on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period. The central image is a Shaka Trinity (623), the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] flanked by two [[bodhisattva]]s, sculpture cast in bronze by the sculptor [[Tori Busshi]] (flourished early 7th century) in homage to the recently deceased Prince Shōtoku. At the four corners of the platform are the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Guardian Kings of the Four Directions]], carved in wood around 650. Also housed at [[Hōryū-ji]] is the [[Tamamushi]] Shrine, a wooden replica of a ''Kondō'', which is set on a high wooden base that is decorated with figural paintings executed in a medium of mineral pigments mixed with lacquer.

Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2-m (53-ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or ''Daibutsuden'', is a [[Rushana]] Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the [[Edo period]].

Clustered around the Daibutsuden on a gently sloping hillside are a number of secondary halls: the ''[[Hokke-dō]]'' (Lotus Sutra Hall), with its principal image, the [[Fukukenjaku Kannon|Fukukenjaku]] [[Kannon]] (不空羂索観音立像, the most popular bodhisattva), crafted of dry lacquer (cloth dipped in lacquer and shaped over a wooden armature); the ''[[Kaidanin]]'' (戒壇院, Ordination Hall) with its magnificent clay statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Four Guardian Kings]]; and the storehouse, called the ''[[Shōsōin]]''. This last structure is of great importance as an art-historical cache, because in it are stored the utensils that were used in the temple's dedication ceremony in 752, the eye-opening ritual for the Rushana image, as well as government documents and many secular objects owned by the Imperial family.

'''Choukin''' (or '''chōkin'''), the art of metal [[engraving]] or sculpting, is thought to have started in the Nara period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choukin (彫金)|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/c/choukin.htm|website=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System|JAANUS]]|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frédéric|first1=Louis|last2=Roth|first2=Käthe|title=Japan Encyclopedia|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=120|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heian art===
[[File:Kongokai.jpg|thumb|170px|Taizokai Mandala]]
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|170px|Taizokai Mandala, [[Tō-ji]] owning]]
In 794 the capital of Japan was officially transferred to Heian-kyō (present-day [[Kyoto]]), where it remained until 1868. The term ''[[Heian period]]'' refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at the end of the [[Genpei War]]. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara era]], the pivotal date being 894, the year [[Imperial Japanese embassies to China|imperial embassies to China]] were officially discontinued.

'''Early Heian art:''' In reaction to the growing wealth and power of organized [[Buddhism]] in Nara, the priest [[Kūkai]] (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) journeyed to China to study [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]], a form of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, which he introduced into Japan in 806. At the core of Shingon worship are [[mandala]]s, diagrams of the spiritual universe, which then began to influence temple design. Japanese Buddhist architecture also adopted the [[stupa]], originally an [[Indian architecture|Indian architectural form]], in its Chinese-style pagoda.

The temples erected for this new sect were built in the mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary.

The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the [[Murō-ji]] (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara. The wooden image (also early 9th century) of [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni]], the "historic" Buddha, enshrined in a secondary building at the [[Murō-ji]], is typical of the early Heian sculpture, with its ponderous body, covered by thick drapery folds carved in the ''[[honpa-shiki]]'' (rolling-wave) style, and its austere, withdrawn facial expression.

'''Fujiwara art:''' In the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara period]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]], which offered easy salvation through belief in [[Amitabha|Amida]] (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the [[Fujiwara family]], then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as [[Sesshō and Kampaku|regents]] for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. So secure and beautiful was their world that they could not conceive of Paradise as being much different. They created a new form of Buddha hall, the Amida hall, which blends the secular with the religious, and houses one or more Buddha images within a structure resembling the mansions of the nobility.

[[File:Byodo-in Uji01pbs2640.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Byōdō-in]] Phoenix Hall, [[Uji, Kyoto]]]]
The ''Hō-ō-dō'' (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by [[Jōchō]], who used a new canon of proportions and a new technique (''[[yosegi]]''), in which multiple pieces of wood are carved out like shells and joined from the inside. Applied to the walls of the hall are small relief carvings of celestials, the host believed to have accompanied Amida when he descended from the Western Paradise to gather the souls of believers at the moment of death and transport them in lotus blossoms to Paradise. ''[[Raigō]]'' paintings on the wooden doors of the Hō-ō-dō, depicting the Descent of the Amida Buddha, are an early example of [[Yamato-e]], Japanese-style painting, and contain representations of the scenery around Kyoto.

[[File:Genji emaki YADORIGI 2.JPG|thumb|260px|"YADORI GI" of [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]]]]
'''E-maki''': In the last century of the Heian period, the horizontal, illustrated narrative handscroll, known as ''[[emaki|e-maki]]'' (絵巻, lit. "picture scroll"), came to the fore. Dating from about 1130, the ''[[Genji Monogatari Emaki]]'', a famous illustrated ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' represents the earliest surviving yamato-e handscroll, and one of the high points of Japanese painting. Written about the year 1000 by [[Murasaki Shikibu]], a lady-in-waiting to the Empress [[Akiko (Empress)|Akiko]], the novel deals with the life and loves of Genji and the world of the Heian court after his death. The 12th-century artists of the ''e-maki'' version devised a system of pictorial conventions that convey visually the emotional content of each scene. In the second half of the century, a different, livelier style of continuous narrative illustration became popular. The ''[[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]]'' (late 12th century), a scroll that deals with an intrigue at court, emphasizes figures in active motion depicted in rapidly executed brush strokes and thin but vibrant colors.

''E-maki'' also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the ''[[otoko-e]]'' ("men's pictures") and ''[[onna-e]]'' ("women's pictures") styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of the genders. But perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. ''Onna-e'', epitomized by the Tale of Genji handscroll, typically deals with court life, particularly the court ladies, and with romantic themes. ''Otoko-e'' often recorded historical events, particularly battles. The [[Siege of Sanjō Palace|Siege of the Sanjō Palace]] (1160), depicted in the "Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace" section of the [[Heiji Monogatari]] handscroll is a famous example of this style.

In 1180 a war broke out between the two most powerful warrior clans, the [[Taira]] and the [[Minamoto]]; five years later the Minamoto emerged victorious and established a de facto seat of government at the seaside village of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], where it remained until 1333. With the shift of power from the nobility to the warrior class, the arts had to satisfy a new audience: men devoted to the skills of warfare, priests committed to making Buddhism available to illiterate commoners, and conservatives, the nobility and some members of the priesthood who regretted the declining power of the court. Thus, realism, a popularizing trend, and a classical revival characterize the art of the [[Kamakura period]]. In the Kamakura period, [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] remained the centres of artistic production and high culture.

[[File:Muchaku (detail, 2).jpg|thumb|left|210px|Detail of [[Muchaku]] at [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] by [[Unkei]]]]
'''Sculpture:''' The [[Kei school]] of sculptors, particularly [[Unkei]], created a new, more realistic style of sculpture. The two [[Niō]] guardian images (1203) in the Great South Gate of the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara illustrate Unkei's dynamic supra-realistic style. The images, about 8 m (about 26&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, were carved of multiple blocks in a period of about three months, a feat indicative of a developed studio system of artisans working under the direction of a master sculptor. Unkei's polychromed wood sculptures (1208, [[Kōfuku-ji]], Nara) of two Indian sages, [[Muchaku]] and [[Seshin]], the legendary founders of the [[Dharma character school|Hossō sect]], are among the most accomplished realistic works of the period; as rendered by Unkei, they are remarkably individualized and believable images. One of the most famous works of this period is an [[Amitabha]] Triad (completed in 1195), in [[Jōdo-ji (Ono)|Jōdo-ji in Ono]], created by [[Kaikei]], Unkei's successor.

'''Calligraphy and painting:''' The ''[[Kegon Engi Emaki]]'', the illustrated history of the founding of the [[Kegon]] sect, is an excellent example of the popularizing trend in Kamakura painting. The Kegon sect, one of the most important in the Nara period, fell on hard times during the ascendancy of the [[Pure Land]] sects. After the Genpei War (1180–1185), Priest [[Myōe]] of [[Kōzan-ji]] sought to revive the sect and also to provide a refuge for women widowed by the war. The wives of samurai had been discouraged from learning more than a [[syllabary]] system for transcribing sounds and ideas (see [[kana]]), and most were incapable of reading texts that employed Chinese ideographs ([[kanji]]).

Thus, the ''[[Kegon Engi Emaki]]'' combines passages of text, written with a maximum of easily readable syllables, and illustrations that have the dialogue between characters written next to the speakers, a technique comparable to contemporary comic strips. The plot of the ''e-maki'', the lives of the two Korean priests who founded the Kegon sect, is swiftly paced and filled with fantastic feats such as a journey to the palace of the Ocean King, and a poignant mom story.{{clarify|date=April 2016}}

A work in a more conservative vein is the illustrated version of [[The Murasaki Shikibu Diary|Murasaki Shikibu's diary]]. ''E-maki'' versions of her novel continued to be produced, but the nobility, attuned to the new interest in realism yet nostalgic for past days of wealth and power, revived and illustrated the diary in order to recapture the splendor of the author's times. One of the most beautiful passages illustrates the episode in which Murasaki Shikibu is playfully held prisoner in her room by two young courtiers, while, just outside, moonlight gleams on the mossy banks of a rivulet in the imperial garden.

=== Muromachi art ===
{{Main|Higashiyama period}}

During the [[Muromachi period]] (1338–1573), also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The [[Ashikaga clan]] took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the [[Muromachi district]] of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. [[Zen]] Buddhism, the [[Ch'an]] sect　traditionally thought to have been founded in China in the 6th century, was introduced for a second time into Japan and took root.

[[File:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Karesansui of [[Ryōan-ji]], Kyoto]]

'''Painting:''' Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of Yamato-e yielded to the [[Sumi-e|monochromes]] of painting in the Chinese manner, where paintings generally only have black and white or different tones of a single color.

Typical of early Muromachi painting is the depiction by the priest-painter [[Kao (painter)|Kao]] (active early 15th century) of the legendary monk [[Kensu]] (Hsien-tzu in Chinese) at the moment he achieved enlightenment. This type of painting was executed with quick brush strokes and a minimum of detail. ''Catching a Catfish with a Gourd'' (early 15th century, [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto), by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]] (active c. 1400), marks a turning point in Muromachi painting. Executed originally for a low-standing screen, it has been remounted as a hanging scroll with inscriptions by contemporary figures above, one of which refers to the painting as being in the "new style". In the foreground a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background mountains appear to be far in the distance. It is generally assumed that the "new style" of the painting, executed about 1413, refers to a more Chinese sense of deep space within the picture plane.

The foremost artists of the Muromachi period are the priest-painters [[Tenshō Shūbun|Shūbun]] and [[Sesshū Tōyō|Sesshū]]. Shūbun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]], created in the painting ''Reading in a Bamboo Grove'' (1446) a realistic landscape with deep recession into space. Sesshū, unlike most artists of the period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. ''Landscape of the Four Seasons'' (''Sansui Chokan''; c. 1486) is one of Sesshu's most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.

=== Azuchi-Momoyama art ===

[[File:Kano Eitoku - Cypress Trees.jpg|thumb|350px|''[[Cypress Trees]] Byōbu'', folding screen by [[Kanō Eitoku]], 1590]]

In the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1573–1603), a succession of military leaders, such as [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], attempted to bring peace and political stability to Japan after an era of almost 100 years of warfare. Oda, a minor chieftain, acquired power sufficient to take [[de facto]] control of the government in 1568 and, five years later, to oust the last Ashikaga shogun. Hideyoshi took command after Oda's death, but his plans to establish hereditary rule were foiled by Ieyasu, who established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1603.

'''Painting:''' The most important school of painting in the Momoyama period was that of the [[Kanō school]], and the greatest innovation of the period was the formula, developed by [[Kanō Eitoku]], for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. The decoration of the main room facing the garden of the [[Jukō-in]], a subtemple of [[Daitoku-ji]] (a Zen temple in Kyoto), is perhaps the best extant example of Eitoku's work. A massive ''[[ume]]'' tree and twin pines are depicted on pairs of sliding screens in diagonally opposite corners, their trunks repeating the verticals of the corner posts and their branches extending to left and right, unifying the adjoining panels. Eitoku's screen, ''Chinese Lions'', also in Kyoto, reveals the bold, brightly colored style of painting preferred by the samurai.

[[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], a contemporary of Eitoku, developed a somewhat different and more decorative style for large-scale screen paintings. In his ''[[Maple Screen]]'' (楓図), now in the temple of [[Chishaku-in]] ([[:ja:智積院]]), Kyoto, he placed the trunk of the tree in the center and extended the limbs nearly to the edge of the composition, creating a flatter, less architectonic work than Eitoku, but a visually gorgeous painting. His sixfold screen, ''[[Pine Wood]]'' (松林図), is a masterly rendering in [[sumi-e|monochrome ink]] of a grove of trees enveloped in mist.

===Art of the Edo period===

[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|210x210px|The print ''[[Red Fuji]]'' from [[Hokusai]]'s series ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]

The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] gained undisputed control of the government in 1603 with a commitment to bring peace and economic and political stability to the country; in large measure it was successful. The shogunate survived until 1867, when it was forced to capitulate because of its failure to deal with pressure from Western nations to open the country to foreign trade. One of the dominant themes in the Edo period was the repressive policies of the shogunate and the attempts of artists to escape these strictures. The foremost of these was the closing of the country to foreigners and the accoutrements of their cultures, and the imposition of strict codes of behavior affecting every aspect of life, the clothes one wore, the person one married, and the activities one could or should not pursue.

In the early years of the [[Edo period]], however, the full impact of Tokugawa policies had not yet been felt, and some of Japan's finest expressions in architecture and painting were produced: Katsura Palace in Kyoto and the paintings of [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]], pioneer of the [[Rinpa school]].

'''Architecture:''' [[Katsura Detached Palace]], built in imitation of [[The Tale of Genji|Genji]]'s palace, contains a cluster of shoin buildings that combine elements of classic Japanese architecture with innovative restatements. The whole complex is surrounded by a beautiful garden with paths for walking.
Many of powerful ''daimyōs'' (feudal lords) built a [[Japanese garden|Circuit style Japanese garden]] in the territory country, and competed for the beauty.

[[File:Kitagawa Utamaro - Toji san bijin (Three Beauties of the Present Day)From Bijin-ga (Pictures of Beautiful Women), published by Tsutaya Juzaburo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Three Beauties of the Present Day]]'', by [[Utamaro]], {{circa|1793}} ]]

'''Painting:''' Sōtatsu evolved a superb decorative style by re-creating themes from classical literature, using brilliantly colored figures and motifs from the natural world set against gold-leaf backgrounds. One of his finest works is the pair of screens ''The Waves at Matsushima'' in the [[Freer Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. A century later, Kōrin reworked Sōtatsu's style and created visually gorgeous works uniquely his own. Perhaps his finest are the screen paintings of ''[[Red and White Plum Blossoms]]''.

'''Sculpture''' The Buddhist monk [[Enkū]] carved 120,000 Buddhist images in a rough, individual style.

'''Ukiyo-e and Bunjinga:''' The school of art best known in the West is that of the [[ukiyo-e]] paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] of the demimonde, the world of the [[kabuki]] theater and the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]]. Ukiyo-e prints began to be produced in the late 17th century; in 1765 [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] produced the first [[Nishiki-e|polychrome print]]. Print designers of the next generation, including [[Torii Kiyonaga]] and [[Utamaro]], created elegant and sometimes insightful depictions of courtesans.

In the 19th century the dominant figures were [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]], the latter a creator of romantic and somewhat sentimental landscape prints. The odd angles and shapes through which Hiroshige often viewed landscape, and the work of Kiyonaga and Utamaro, with its emphasis on flat planes and strong linear outlines, had a profound impact on such Western artists as [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].  Via artworks held in Western museums, these same printmakers would later exert a powerful influence on the imagery and aesthetic approaches used by early [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[Richard Aldington]] and [[H.D.]]&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

A school of painting contemporary with ukiyo-e was [[Nanga (Japanese painting)|Nanga]], or Bunjinga, a style based on paintings executed by Chinese scholar-painters. Just as ukiyo-e artists chose to depict figures from life outside the strictures of the Tokugawa shogunate, Bunjin artists turned to Chinese culture. The exemplars of this style are [[Ike no Taiga]], [[Yosa Buson]], [[Tanomura Chikuden]], and [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]] ([[:ja:山本梅逸]]).

'''Ceramics'''
{{main|Japanese pottery and porcelain|Japanese export porcelain}}
Traditional, mostly [[stoneware]], styles continued in many parts of Japan, but Japanese ceramics were transformed around the start of the Edo period, by a large influx of Korean potters, captured or persuaded to emigrate in the course of the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s]].  Many of these were settled on the southern island of [[Kyushu]], and they brought with them experience of versions of the Chinese-style chambered [[Dragon kiln|climbing kiln]], called ''[[noborigama]]'' in Japan, which allowed high temperatures with more precise control.  By around 1620 they had discovered deposits of [[kaolinite]], and started to make porcelain for the first time in Japan.  The early wares (called "Early Imari") were relatively small and imitated the Chinese [[underglaze]] [[blue and white porcelain]], which Japan had been importing for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Impey, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

The porcelain industry greatly expanded in the late 1650s, as the collapse of the Chinese industry from civil war led to very large orders from the Chinese traders and the [[Dutch East India Company]], by then the traders only permitted to do business in Japan. The first great period of [[Japanese export porcelain]] lasted until about the 1740s, and the great bulk of Japanese porcelain was made for export, mostly to Europe, but also the Islamic world to the west and south of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Impey, 71-74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art of the Prewar period===

When [[Emperor of Japan]] regained ruling power in 1868, Japan was once again invaded by new and alien forms of culture. During the [[Empire of Japan|Prewar period]], The introduction of Western cultural values led to a dichotomy in Japanese art, as well as in nearly every other aspect of culture, between traditional values and attempts to duplicate and assimilate a variety of clashing new ideas. This split remained evident in the late 20th century, although much synthesis had by then already occurred, and created an international cultural atmosphere and stimulated contemporary Japanese arts toward ever more innovative forms.

[[File:Summer Airing by Kawamura Kiyoo (Tokyo National Museum).jpg|thumb|210x210px|''Summer Airing'', by [[Kawamura Kiyoo]], [[Tokyo National Museum]], Japan]]

By the early 20th century, European art forms were well introduced and their marriage produced notable buildings like the [[Tokyo Station|Tokyo Train Station]] and the [[National Diet Building]] that still exist today.

A lot of artistic new [[Japanese gardens]] were built with ''[[Ogawa Jihei VII|Jihei Ogawa]]''.

''[[Manga]]'' cartoons flourished the Meiji period, influenced greatly by English and French [[editorial cartoon|political cartoons]]. However, some art popular in the Meiji era, such as [[jōge-e]] (reversible images), is no longer popular in modern Japan.

'''Architecture:''' [[Tokyo Station]], a building of [[Giyōfū architecture]], full of [[brick]]s and pseudo-European style. This style of building was built in urban areas.

'''Painting''': The first response of the Japanese to Western art forms was open-hearted acceptance, and in 1876 the [[Technological Art School]] was opened, employing Italian instructors to teach Western methods. The second response was a pendulum swing in the opposite direction spearheaded by [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and the American [[Ernest Fenollosa]], who encouraged Japanese artists to retain traditional themes and techniques while creating works more in keeping with contemporary taste.  This was a strategy that eventually served to extend the influence of Japanese art as far as Calcutta, London, and Boston in the years leading up to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/asia-and-modernism Video of a Lecture discussing the importance of Okakura and Japanese Art to Global Modernism], ''[[School of Advanced Study]]'', July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these two poles of artistic theory—derived from Europe and from East Asia respectively—developed ''[[yōga]]'' ("Western-style painting") and [[Nihonga]] ("Japanese painting"), categories that have maintained currency.

===Art of the Postwar period===
After the [[surrender of Japan|end of World War II]] in 1945, many artists began working art forms derived from the international scene, moving away from local artistic developments into the mainstream of world art. But traditional Japanese conceptions endured, particularly in the use of modular space in architecture, certain spacing intervals in music and dance, a propensity for certain color combinations and characteristic literary forms.

Art from 1603 to 1945 (Edo period and Prewar period) were supported by merchants. Counter to Edo period and Prewar period, art of [[Postwar Japan|Postwar period]] was changed to the art which is supported by people as consumers. The wide variety of art forms available to the Japanese reflect the vigorous state of the arts, widely supported by the Japanese people and promoted by the government. In the 1950s and 1960s, Japan's artistic [[avant garde]] include the internationally influential [[Gutai group]], which originated or anticipated various postwar genres such as [[performance art]], [[installation art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[wearable art]]. In photography, [[Kansuke Yamamoto (artist)|Kansuke Yamamoto]] was prominent.

American art and architecture greatly influenced Japan.  Though fear of earthquakes severely restricted the building of a skyscraper, technological advances let Japanese build larger and higher buildings with more artistic outlooks.

As Japan has always made little distinction between 'fine art' and 'decorative art', as the West has done since the Renaissance, it is important to note Japan's significant and unique contributions to the fields of art in entertainment, commercial uses, and graphic design. Cartoons imported from America led to [[anime]] that at first were derived exclusively from manga stories.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Today, anime abounds, and many artists and studios have risen to great fame as artists; [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and the artists and animators of [[Studio Ghibli]] are generally regarded to be among the best the anime world has to offer. Japan also flourishes in the fields of [[graphic design]], commercial art (e.g. billboards, magazine advertisements), and in [[video game]] graphics and concept art.

====Contemporary art in Japan====
Japanese modern art takes as many forms and expresses as many different ideas as modern art in general, worldwide. It ranges from advertisements, anime, video games, and architecture as already mentioned, to sculpture, painting, and drawing in all their myriad forms.

Many artists do continue to paint in the traditional manner, with black ink and color on paper or silk. Some of these depict traditional subject matter in the traditional styles, while others explore new and different motifs and styles, while using the traditional media. Still others eschew native media and styles, embracing Western oil paints or any number of other forms.

In sculpture, the same holds true; some artists stick to the traditional modes, some doing it with a modern flair, and some choose Western or brand new modes, styles, and media. [[Yo Akiyama]] is just one of many modern Japanese sculptors. He works primarily in clay pottery and ceramics, creating works that are very simple and straightforward, looking like they were created out of the earth itself. Another sculptor, using iron and other modern materials, built a large modern art sculpture in the [[Israel]]i port city of [[Haifa]], called ''Hanabi'' (Fireworks). [[Nahoko Kojima]] is a contemporary Kirie artist who has pioneered the technique of Paper Cut Sculpture which hangs in 3d.

[[Takashi Murakami]] is arguably one of the most well-known Japanese modern artists in the Western world. Murakami and the other artists in his studio create pieces in a style, inspired by anime, which he has dubbed "[[superflat]]". His pieces take a multitude of forms, from painting to sculpture, some truly massive in size. But most if not all show very clearly this anime influence, utilizing bright colors and simplified details.

==Performing arts==

A remarkable number of the traditional forms of Japanese music, dance, and theater have survived in the contemporary world, enjoying some popularity through reidentification with Japanese cultural values. Traditional music and dance, which trace their origins to ancient religious use—[[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]], [[Shinto|Shintō]], and [[folk dance|folk]]—have been preserved in the dramatic performances of [[Noh]], [[Kabuki]], and [[bunraku]] theater. Ancient court music and dance forms deriving from continental sources were preserved through Imperial household musicians and temple and shrine troupes. Some of the oldest musical instruments in the world have been in continuous use in Japan from the [[Jōmon period]], as shown by finds of stone and clay [[flute]]s and [[zither]]s having between two and four strings, to which [[Yayoi period]] metal [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[gong]]s were added to create early musical ensembles. By the early historical period (6th to 7th centuries), there were a variety of large and small [[drum]]s, gongs, [[Tubular bell|chimes]], flutes, and stringed instruments, such as the imported mandolin-like [[biwa]] and the flat six-stringed zither, which evolved into the thirteen-stringed [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]]. These instruments formed the orchestras for the 7th-century continentally derived ceremonial court music ([[gagaku]]), which, together with the accompanying [[bugaku]] (a type of court dance), are the most ancient of such forms still performed at the Imperial court, ancient temples, and shrines. [[Buddhism]] introduced the rhythmic chants, still used, that underpin [[Shigin]], and that were joined with native ideas to underlay the development of vocal music, such as in [[Noh]].

==Aesthetic concepts==
[[File:Bodhidarma.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Calligraphy of [[Bodhidharma]], "Zen points directly to the human heart, see into your nature and become Buddha", [[Hakuin Ekaku]], 17th century]]
{{Main|Japanese aesthetics}}

Japanese art is characterized by unique polarities. In the ceramics of the prehistoric periods, for example, exuberance was followed by disciplined and refined artistry. Another instance is provided by two 16th-century structures that are poles apart: the [[Katsura Detached Palace]] is an exercise in simplicity, with an emphasis on natural materials, rough and untrimmed, and an affinity for beauty achieved by accident; [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]] [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū]] is a rigidly symmetrical structure replete with brightly colored relief carvings covering every visible surface. Japanese art, valued not only for its simplicity but also for its colorful exuberance, has considerably influenced 19th-century Western painting and [[Architectural history#Modern architecture and beyond|20th-century Western architecture]].

Japan's aesthetic conceptions, deriving from diverse cultural traditions, have been formative in the production of unique art forms. Over the centuries, a wide range of artistic motifs developed and were refined, becoming imbued with symbolic significance. Like a [[pearl]], they acquired many layers of meaning and a high luster. Japanese aesthetics provide a key to understanding artistic works perceivably different from those coming from Western traditions.

Within the East Asian artistic tradition, [[China]] has been the acknowledged teacher and Japan the devoted student. Nevertheless, several Japanese arts developed their own style, which can be differentiated from various Chinese arts. The monumental, symmetrically balanced, rational approach of Chinese art forms became miniaturized, irregular, and subtly suggestive in Japanese hands. Miniature [[Japanese rock garden|rock gardens]], diminutive plants (''[[bonsai]]''), and ''[[ikebana]]'' (flower arrangements), in which the selected few represented a garden, were the favorite pursuits of refined aristocrats for a millennium, and they have remained a part of contemporary cultural life.

The diagonal, reflecting a natural flow, rather than the fixed triangle, became the favored structural device, whether in painting, architectural or garden design, dance steps, or musical notations. Odd numbers replace even numbers in the regularity of a Chinese master pattern, and a pull to one side allows a motif to turn the corner of a three-dimensional object, thus giving continuity and motion that is lacking in a static frontal design. Japanese painters used the devices of the cutoff, close-up, and fade-out by the 12th century in ''[[yamato-e]]'', or Japanese-style, scroll painting, perhaps one reason why modern filmmaking has been such a natural and successful art form in Japan. Suggestion is used rather than direct statement; oblique poetic hints and allusive and inconclusive melodies and thoughts have proved frustrating to the Westerner trying to penetrate the meanings of literature, music, painting, and even everyday language.

The Japanese began defining such aesthetic ideas in a number of evocative phrases by at least the 10th or 11th century. The courtly refinements of the aristocratic Heian period evolved into the elegant simplicity seen as the essence of good taste in the understated art that is called ''[[shibui]]''. Two terms originating from [[Zen]] Buddhist meditative practices describe degrees of tranquility: one, the repose found in humble melancholy (''[[wabi-sabi|wabi]]''), the other, the serenity accompanying the enjoyment of subdued beauty (''[[wabi-sabi|sabi]]''). Zen thought also contributed a penchant for combining the unexpected or startling, used to jolt one's consciousness toward the goal of enlightenment. In art, this approach was expressed in combinations of such unlikely materials as lead inlaid in lacquer and in clashing poetic imagery. Unexpectedly humorous and sometimes grotesque images and motifs also stem from the Zen ''[[kōan]]'' (conundrum). Although the arts have been mainly secular since the [[Edo period]], traditional aesthetics and training methods, stemming generally from religious sources, continue to underlie artistic productions.

==Artists==
{{Japanese art history}}
{{Culture of Japan}}
Traditionally, the artist was a vehicle for expression and was personally reticent, in keeping with the role of an artisan or entertainer of low social status. The [[shodo|calligrapher]], a member of the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] literati class, or [[samurai]] class in Japan, had a higher status, while artists of great genius were often recognized in the [[Kamakura period]] by receiving a name from a feudal lord and thus rising socially. The performing arts, however, were generally held in less esteem, and the purported immorality of actresses of the early [[Kabuki]] theater caused the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] government to bar women from the stage; female roles in Kabuki and Noh thereafter were played by men.

After World War II, artists typically gathered in arts associations, some of which were long-established professional societies while others reflected the latest arts movement. The [[Japan Artists League]], for example, was responsible for the largest number of major exhibitions, including the prestigious annual Nitten ([[Japan Art Exhibition]]). The [[P.E.N. Club]] of Japan (P.E.N. stands for prose, essay, and narrative), a branch of an international writers' organization, was the largest of some thirty major authors' associations. Actors, dancers, musicians, and other performing artists boasted their own societies, including the [[Kabuki Society]], organized in 1987 to maintain this art's traditional high standards, which were thought to be endangered by modern innovation. By the 1980s, however, avant-garde painters and sculptors had eschewed all groups and were "unattached" artists.

===Art schools===
There are a number of specialized universities for the arts in Japan, led by the national universities. The most important is the [[Tokyo Arts University]], one of the most difficult of all national universities to enter. Another seminal center is [[Tama Art University]], which produced many of Japan's late 20th-century innovative young artists. Traditional training in the arts, derived from Chinese traditional methods, remains; experts teach from their homes or head schools working within a master-pupil relationship. A pupil does not experiment with a personal style until achieving the highest level of training, or graduating from an arts school, or becoming head of a school. Many young artists have criticized this system as stifling creativity and individuality. A new generation of the [[avant-garde]] has broken with this tradition, often receiving its training in the West. In the traditional arts, however, the master-pupil system preserves the secrets and skills of the past. Some master-pupil lineages can be traced to the Kamakura period, from which they continue to use a great master's style or theme. Japanese artists consider technical virtuosity as the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of their professions, a fact recognized by the rest of the world as one of the hallmarks of Japanese art.

The national government has actively supported the arts through the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]], set up in 1968 as a special body of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]]. The agency's budget for FY 1989 rose to ￥37.8 billion after five years of budget cuts, but still represented much less than 1 percent of the general budget. The agency's Cultural Affairs Division disseminated information about the arts within Japan and internationally, and the [[Cultural Properties Protection Division]] (文化財保護部, now 文化財部) protected the nation's cultural heritage. The Cultural Affairs Division is concerned with such areas as art and culture promotion, arts copyrights, and improvements in the [[Japanese language|national language]]. It also supports both national and local arts and cultural festivals, and it funds traveling cultural events in music, theater, dance, art exhibitions, and filmmaking. Special prizes are offered to encourage young artists and established practitioners, and some grants are given each year to enable them to train abroad. The agency funds national museums of modern art in Kyoto and Tokyo and [[The National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo, which exhibit both Japanese and international shows. The agency also supports the [[Japan Art Academy]], which honors eminent persons of arts and letters, appointing them to membership and offering ￥3.5 million in prize money. Awards are made in the presence of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], who personally bestows the highest accolade, the [[Order of Culture]].
Tokyo University of the Arts also taking active roles on several art events in previous years. Their other campuses are also involving varied courses.

===Private sponsorship and foundations===
Arts patronage and promotion by the government are broadened to include a new cooperative effort with corporate Japan to provide funding beyond the tight budget of the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Many other public and private institutions participate, especially in the burgeoning field of awarding arts prizes. A growing number of large corporations join major newspapers in sponsoring exhibitions and performances and in giving yearly prizes. The most important of the many literary awards given are the venerable [[Naoki Prize]] and the [[Akutagawa Prize]], the latter being the equivalent of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in the United States.

In 1989 an effort to promote cross-cultural exchange led to the establishment of a Japanese "[[Nobel Prize]]" for the arts, the [[Premium Imperiale]], by the [[Japan Art Association]]. This prize of US$100,000 was funded largely by the mass media conglomerate [[Fujisankei Communications Group]] and was awarded on a worldwide selection basis.

A number of foundations promoting the arts arose in the 1980s, including the [[Cultural Properties Foundation]] set up to preserve historic sites overseas, especially along the [[Silk Road]] in [[Inner Asia]] and at [[Dunhuang]] in [[China]]. Another international arrangement was made in 1988 with the United States [[Smithsonian Institution]] for cooperative exchange of high-technology studies of Asian artifacts. The government plays a major role by funding the [[Japan Foundation]], which provides both institutional and individual grants, effects scholarly exchanges, awards annual prizes, supported publications and exhibitions, and sends traditional Japanese arts groups to perform abroad. The Arts Festival held for two months each fall for all the performing arts is sponsored by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Major cities also provides substantial support for the arts; a growing number of cities in the 1980s had built large centers for the performing arts and, stimulated by government funding, were offering prizes such as the [[Lafcadio Hearn Prize]] initiated by the city of [[Matsue]]. A number of new municipal museums were also providing about one-third more facilities in the 1980s than were previously available. In the late 1980s, [[Tokyo]] added more than twenty new cultural halls, notably, the large [[Bunkamura]] built by [[Tokyu Group]] and the reconstruction of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Globe Theatre]]. All these efforts reflect a rising popular enthusiasm for the arts. Japanese art buyers swept the Western art markets in the late 1980s, paying record highs for [[Impressionism|impressionist]] paintings and US$51.7 million alone for one [[blue period]] [[Picasso]].

[[File:Passiflora laurifolia00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''[[Passiflora laurifolia]]''&lt;br&gt;from&lt;br&gt;''Flore Medicale des Antilles'']]
'''Jean-Theodore Descourtilz''' (1796 – 13 January 1855 in [[Riacho das Almas]]) was a French naturalist, painter and illustrator, the son of botanist [[Michel Étienne Descourtilz]] (1775-1835). Jean-Theodore was a noted ornithological artist who published ''Oiseaux brillans du Bresil'' in Paris in 1834, and did the plant illustrations for his father's ''[http://www.botanicus.org/item/31753002701453 Flore Medicale des Antilles]'' published between 1821 and 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passionflow.co.uk/art3121411151112.htm |title=Passiflora laurifolia |website=Passionflow.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jean-Theodore Descourtilz00.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;''[[Ramphastos vitellinus]]''&lt;br&gt;from&lt;br&gt;''Oiseaux Brillians du Bresil'']]

He arrived in Brazil in about 1826, since in 1831 his lavishly illustrated manuscript on the hummingbirds of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro was acquired by the library of the ''National Museum''. In this work, referring to a particular hummingbird, he states that it was a species so rare that in five years of research he collected only two specimens. Descourtilz was an interested and meticulous observer, concerned about the accuracy of his notes which concisely described the habits and appearance of each species. His poetic and flowery text was in keeping with the period, and was invariably accompanied by colour plates of the species studied. 

''Ornithologie Bresilienne ou Histoire des Oiseaux du Bresil'' describes and figures 164 species of Brazilian birds, 15 species and 1 genus new to science. Four parts of the work appeared, each with 12 plates by Descourtilz, before his sudden death in 1855. The plates were prepared in London, and apparently printed by [[Waterlow and Sons]] and also [[Joseph Masters and Co.]]. 

In the late 1840s or early 1850s he was sent by the Government to the province of [[Espírito Santo]] to investigate the animal life and to report on precious minerals. He discovered traces of gold and iron in the vicinity of the village Laurinha, created by the provincial government to house and [[proselytise]] the [[Purí people|Puri]] Indians. However, the ill-treatment suffered by the Indians drove them away and led to the decay of the village. At the site there was a village that eventually became the city of [[Conceição do Castelo]] on the headwaters of the [[Rio Castelo]], a tributary of the [[Itapemirim River|Itapemirim]]. Descourtilz explored the city of Itapemirim and nearby towns, gathering various minerals and a collection of crystals, all lodged with the National Museum of [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he took up an appointment in 1854.

Descourtilz was a member of the ''Société Linnéenne de Paris'' and of the ''Société Auxiliaire de l'Industrie de Rio de Janeiro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4808647 |title=DESCOURTILZ, Jean Théodore (c. 1796-1855).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37916">This is a '''list of book arts centers''' worldwide. These are university based programs, community programs, galleries, and museum collections, which focus on books arts, including [[bookbinding]], [[book design]], and the artistic medium known as [[artists books]], all as distinct from the writing or publishing of books.

=== Alabama ===
In 1985, [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] began to offer a master's degree in the book arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookarts.ua.edu/ University of Alabama book arts program]&lt;/ref&gt; in the School of Library and Informational Studies. It emphasizes making books by hand.

[[Edith Frohock]] taught book arts at [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]. Frohock specialized in painting, printmaking and artist's books and was the first instructor to teach books as art in the South. [[Mary Ann Sampson]] credits Frohock for steering her in the direction of book arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uab.edu/art/PDFs/scholarships/UAB_Art_Frohock_Scholar.pdf scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230202400/http://www.uab.edu/art/PDFs/scholarships/UAB_Art_Frohock_Scholar.pdf |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space One Eleven in Birmingham, Alabama is a not-for-profit under the direction of [[Anne Arrasmith]] and Peter Prinz. The organization has exhibited books as art on numerous occasions including the work of [[Larry Gens Anderson]], [[Pinky Bass]], [[Jon Coffelt]], [[Edith Frohock]], [[Ann Howard (author)|Anne Howard]], [[Joni Mabe]], [[Mary Ann Sampson]], [[David Sandlin]], [[Joel Seah]] and [[Marie Weaver]] among many others who have worked in book arts.

[[Agnes (gallery)|Agnes]] 1992–2001 was the first commercial gallery to show book arts in the South and one of only a handful in the country.

=== California ===
The CODEX Foundation, founded in 2005 and located in Berkeley, holds The CODEX International Symposium and Artists' Book Fair every two years in early February, on the odd year.  It is the largest artists' book fair in the world with over 300 artists coming from more than 26 countries. The Codex Foundation exists to preserve and promote the contemporary hand-made book as a work of art in the broadest possible context and to bring to public recognition the artists, the craftsmanship, and the rich history of the civilization of the book. Their mission also carries with it a deep obligation to publish in an affordable format essays, manifestos, and theoretical writings that serve to promote and contextualize the work of contemporary artists of the book. The editorial strategy is to publish exemplary materials that showcase the state of the art of the book worldwide, and to provide a broader public platform for the artists, writers, and printers whose art, craft, and livelihoods depend largely on a healthy commercial environment for their work. To support its mission they have published Book Art Object Vol.s 1 &amp; 2 devoted to the exhibitors and symposia proceedings of CODEX events, both volumes are considered as valuable books of reference for the field, 14 Code(X)+1 monographs devoted to critical theory, and Alchimie du Verbe and Mapping the Artist’s Cosmos box set Assembly-Exchanges, original prints from 52 renowned book artists and printers.

The [[San Francisco Center for the Book]] was founded by Mary Austin and Kathleen Burch in 1996 and was the first Center of its kind on the West Coast. SFCB maintains a 6,358 square foot facility that houses a large print studio, book bindery, and classroom and administrative space. SFCB offers four to five book arts-related exhibitions each year, focused on artist's books, design bindings, fine press books, artist retrospectives, and private collections among other topics. Its workshop program presents 325 letterpress printing, bookbinding, and related arts workshops to nearly 2,000 students annually. SFCB is also home to the annual Roadworks Steamroller Printing Festival, a local artist/vendor street festival that celebrates printing by using the road surface as a printing bed and antique steamrollers as presses for large-scale linocut prints. Attendance at this street festival tops 3,000.

The [[Los Angeles]] art scene (see: [[:Category:Art in the Greater Los Angeles Area|Art in the Greater Los Angeles Area]]) is considered one of the founding homes of the artist's book. "Twenty-Six Gasoline Stations", created by [[Ed Ruscha]] in 1964 is one of the first artist's books. The [[Athenaeum Music &amp; Arts Library]] in [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]] has a large collection of artists' books, focusing on conceptual artists' books, and those created by California artists and presses. The library holds the complete collection of Ruscha's conceptual artist's books created during the 1960s and 70s.

The Women's Graphic Center, at the [[Woman's Building]], was founded in 1973, for women artists to create artist's books. Exhibitions were held there. The center closed in 1991. The Lab Press was founded in the 1970s by Woman's Building co-founder [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] to teach printing and the making of books.

The [[Otis College of Art and Design]] began collecting and exhibiting artists' books in the 1960s.

Mills College in Oakland offers undergraduate as well as graduate degrees in Book Arts. Mills College offers a unique MFA in Book Art and Creative Writing Program, the first such program in the country, which is designed to help develop the student as both a writer and a visual artist, to enhance the understanding of contemporary writing and its visual forms, and to encourage a deep exploration of the book as both a literary artifact and a material object that exists in space and time.

=== Florida ===
[[Florida Atlantic University]]'s Wimberly Library is home to the [http://www.library.fau.edu/depts/spc/jaffe.htm Jaffe Center for Book Arts] which revolves around a collection of books as aesthetic objects focused on artists' books and limited editions. In 1998, Arthur and Mata Jaffe donated their collection of 2,800 books to FAU and the Jaffe Collection opened in 2000. Since then, the collection has grown to over 6,000 cataloged materials, as well as thousands more yet to be cataloged. In 2007, an expanded Jaffe Center for Book Arts opened; it included a letterpress studio, book bindery and paper making lab. In 2011, poet and artist Helen M. Salzberg established JCBA's Artist in Residence (AIR) program which funds two residencies each academic year. The AIRs produce creative works utilizing JCBA facilities. They also teach workshops and provide mentoring opportunities to FAU students and staff. JCBA is based at a university, but the center's programming is community-based: JCBA offers workshops and presents educational book arts programming (as well as intimate concerts, films and other book art related events) for the students and faculty of FAU as well as the broader community.

The [[University of Florida]] in Gainesville, FL has a small collection of [http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/rarebook/links.htm book arts] in the [[Harold and Mary Jean Hanson Rare Book Collection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Subject Guide to the Harold and Mary Jean Hanson Rare Book Collection |url=http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/rarebook/links.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; including engraving proofs from [[William Morris]], engraved wood blocks by [[Eric Gill]], and letterpress books by [[Julie Chen (book artist)]]. In addition, undergraduate and graduate courses in book arts and letterpress are offered in the [[University of Florida College of the Arts]].

=== Georgia ===
Nexus Press, in Atlanta, was a major publisher of artists books. Founded in 1978 by Michael Goodman and Gary Lee Super, Nexus Press encouraged artists to make books as original works of art. Nexus Press was one of the few artists book publishing centers that provided artists with access to offset lithography as a creative process. Though the press also had letterpress equipment, it never was a center for fine print production. It was a center for experimental book production and produced more than 150 titles, including I Want to Take Picture, by Bill Burke. The Atlanta Contemporary Art Center suspended all Nexus Press operations in 2003.

=== Illinois ===
The [[Columbia College Chicago]] [[Center for Book and Paper Arts (Columbia College Chicago)|Center for Book and Paper Arts]], founded in 1994, offers a wide range of classes in papermaking, bookbinding, and printing, in addition to an active exhibition program, artists' residencies, and a lecture series.

=== Iowa ===
The  [http://www.uiowa.edu/~ctrbook/index.shtml University of Iowa Center for the Book] is a research program dedicated to the past, present, and future of the book. Located in the University of Iowa Graduate College, the Center integrates practice in the art of the book with study of the book in society. The Center offers curricula in the arts of printing, binding, papermaking, and calligraphy, in the history and culture of books as a field of study, and in the expressive power of the book form. The Center hosts visiting lectures and workshops with book scholars and artists, including the annual Brownell Lecture on the History of the Book and Mitchell Lecture on the Arts of the Book.&lt;ref&gt;http://book.grad.uiowa.edu/content/center-for-the-book&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center offers a Master of Fine Arts in the Book Arts, as well as a Graduate Certificate, which can be pursued alongside a master’s or doctoral degree in another department. The UICB also offers a joint degree with the School of Library and Information Sciences and affiliates with book scholars in UI departments and programs such as History, English, Journalism and Communication Studies, Religious Studies, the Writers’ Workshop, and American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://book.grad.uiowa.edu/content/center-for-the-book&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Jersey ===
[[Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]] has several significant programs that support artists' books. [[The Brodsky Center]] (formerly, Rutgers Center for Innovative Print and Paper), in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] founded by [[Judith K. Brodsky]] teaches classes in book-making with an emphasis on both traditional and non-traditional (artists') books. The [[Rutgers University Libraries]] support an annual event in the fall on its [[Newark, New Jersey]] campus, it calls [[The New Jersey Book Arts Symposium]]. Founded in 1994 by [[Michael Joesph (curator)|Michael Joseph]] and [[Susan G. Swartzburg]],&lt;ref name="rutgers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rulib/spcol/bookarts/intro.htm|title=Introduction to New Jersey Book Arts Symposium|publisher=libraries.rutgers.edu|accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NJBAS consistently showcases artists' books by artists who reside, work, or were born or educated in the state, although its inclusive focus falls on every facet of the book arts. As well as featuring presentations by New Jersey artists, the NJBAS includes extended considerations of topics deemed of moment to students and practitioners of the book arts. The NJBAS goes beyond state borders and invites presenters from all parts of the world to speak when their expertise dovetails with that year's topic. The Symposium has posted numerous web pages including a photographic essay on a recent symposium on the [http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rulib/spcol/bookarts/intro03.htm relation of artists and collectors of artists' books].

=== New York ===
[[The Center for Book Arts]] was founded in 1974 by [[Richard Minsky]], and was the first center dedicated to all aspects of book arts. It has mounted over 140 exhibitions of artists’ books. Exhibited artists include [[Warja Honegger-Lavater]].

[[Franklin Furnace Archive]] and [[Printed Matter, Inc]] were both founded in 1976, originally as one organization which quickly splintered into two projects: the Franklin Furnace as a major collection of artists' books; Printed Matter as a publisher and distributor. The Franklin Furnace Collection is now held at the Library of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Printed Matter continues to publish and distribute artists' books, but also mounts exhibitions of artists' books, hosts book launches, and acts as an advisory service to both artists and collecting institutions. [[Printed Matter, Inc]] also hosts the annual [[NY Art Book Fair]].

[[Brooklyn, New York]] is a center for book arts and is the home of book artist [[Judy Hoffman (artist)|Judy Hoffman]].

2007–2008 SDCA (Seaport District Cultural Association) under its founding directors, Richard Sack, Jim Wintner and Florence Wack, opened SPACE gallery on Front street in the downtown seaport area of Manhattan. [[Jon Coffelt]] was the curator/director of SPACE upstairs book arts venue. [[Anne Bean]] exhibited a tie-in exhibition with [[Franklin Furnace]] here in the Summer of 2007. SPACE' inaugural exhibition was "''Cuerpos Santos''" by [[Pinky Bass]] followed with an organic book installation by [[Judy Hoffman (artist)|Judy Hoffman]]. SPACE venue represented artists books as an out-of-the-vernacular experience pushing the boundaries of what is considered a book.

Central Booking was founded in 2009 by [[Maddy Rosenberg]] collaborating with [[Jon Coffelt]] and Frank de Falco in [[DUMBO, Brooklyn|DUMBO]], Brooklyn gallery district. In 2010, it began publishing CENTRAL BOOKING Magazine. In early 2012 the gallery left its Dumbo space.

[[Booklyn Artist Alliance]] is an artist non-profit that helps document and distribute artist publications and also curates exhibitions. It is located in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]].

=== Ohio ===
Cincinnati has an active book arts community that formed The Cincinnati Book Arts Society approximately 9 years ago. Small but active, the society offers study groups, opportunities to exhibit, workshops and a friendly community of artists ranging from fine bookbinders, librarians, visual artists and novices. Visit the website for more information.
The Cincinnati Book Arts Society in conjunction with the Cincinnati Public Library has for the past eight years sponsored an annual "BookWorks" exhibit at the downtown main library. Typically held in the spring, the exhibit features a wide range of books from small edition to one of a kind books.

The Virginia Arts of the Book Center was founded in 1995 in Charlottesville as a public-access book arts workshop providing cooperative use of presses and type for letterpress printing. Begun by Josef Beery, Cal Otto, and Terry Belanger, the Center became the locus of serious artistic activity during the years preceding and following the turn of the millennium when book artist, art theoretician, and author Johanna Drucker became its visiting artist for almost a decade. Partnership with the University of Virginia Art Department through the sponsorship of art professor and book artist Dean Dass opened the center to the activities of college students from surrounding academic institutions. Through the leadership of Kevin McFadden, the self-governed organization was absorbed by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities during this period and then in 2018 became a part of the Virginia Center for the Book. The current resident artist and program director is Garrett Queen who provides support to a vibrant group of book artists who teach classes and sponsor events encouraging and supporting the arts of the book. They describe themselves as "a community of artists exploring books, paper, and printmaking."

The '''''Maestà''''' is a painting by the Italian artist   [[Cimabue]], painted around 1280 and housed in [[Musée du Louvre]] of [[Paris]], [[France]].

==History==
It was acquired by the Louvre in 1813, as part of the Napoleonic spoiling of artworks in Italy, together with [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Stigmata of Saint Francis (Giotto)|Stigmata of St. Francis]]'', also from San Francesco.

==Description==
The work is considered to be from around 1280, thus preceding the ''[[Santa Trinita Maestà]]''. It is also stylistically earlier to that work, being painted without pseudo-perspective, and having the angels around the Virgin simply placed one above the other, rather than being spatially arranged. The throne is similar to the ''Maestà'' painted by Cimabue in the [[Basilica of San Francesco di Assisi]] (1288–1292).

This work established a new canon for the Madonna with Child theme, which was subsequently used by other painters, such as [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] in his ''[[Rucellai Maestà]]''.

The '''Mañana Literary Society''' was an informal meeting of [[science fiction]] writers in [[Los Angeles]], California.  Hosted by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and his second wife Leslyn at their Laurel Canyon home,&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Jack ''Who Was Robert Heinlein?'' in ''Requiem : new collected works by Robert A. Heinlein and tributes to the grand master'' NY 1992 pp.333-4  {{ISBN|0312855230}}&lt;/ref&gt; the membership included authors such as [[Anthony Boucher]], [[Arthur K. Barnes]], [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[L. Ron Hubbard]], [[Henry Kuttner]], [[C.L. Moore]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Cleve Cartmill]], [[Leigh Brackett]], and [[Jack Williamson]]. The meetings took place in 1940 and 1941, until the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack resulting in the U.S. entering World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Jack ''Who Was Robert Heinlein?'' in ''Requiem : new collected works by Robert A. Heinlein and tributes to the grand master'' NY 1992 p.334  {{ISBN|0312855230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Rocket to the Morgue'' ==
The society and many of its members appear, thinly veiled, in Boucher's ''[[Rocket to the Morgue]]'', whose dedication (in the [[first edition]], read "For The Mañana Literary Society and in particular for Robert Heinlein and Cleve Cartmill." ''Rocket to the Morgue'' is something of a ''[[roman à clef]]''. Many characters are thinly-veiled versions of personalities such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]] ("Austin Carter"), [[L. Ron Hubbard]] ("D. Vance Wimpole"), then-[[literary agent]] [[Julius Schwartz]] ("M. Halstead Phynn") and [[rocket|rocket scientist]]/[[occultist]]/fan [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]] ("Hugo Chantrelle"); or recognizable composites of two writers ("Matt Duncan" - [[Cleve Cartmill]] and [[Henry Kuttner]]; "Joe Henderson" - [[Jack Williamson]] and [[Edmond Hamilton]]). Some writers' actual pseudonyms appear as minor characters, most prominently "Don Stuart, editor of ''Surprising''" ([[John W. Campbell]], editor of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'');  but also "Anson Macdonald", "Lyle Monroe" (both Heinlein pseudonyms)... and [[Anthony Boucher]] (whose real name was William Anthony Parker White).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34244">[[File:Murales Rivera - Markt in Tlatelolco 3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mural by [[Diego Rivera]] showing the pre-Columbian [[Aztec]] city of [[Tenochtitlán]]. In the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]] in [[Mexico City]].]]
'''Mexican muralism''' was the promotion of [[mural]] painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post [[Mexican Revolution]] government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in [[Mexico]] and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the [[United States]] where it served as inspiration for the [[Chicano art movement]].

==Antecedents==
[[File:Bonampak mural. Room 1. Musicians and dancers.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Mural from [[Bonampak]].]]

[[Mexico]] has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the [[Olmec]] civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was [[Juan Cordero]] in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the [[Santa Teresa la Antigua|Santa Teresa Church]] and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of [[Gabino Barreda]] at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] (since disappeared).&lt;ref name="plasmo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Plasmó Juan Cordero primer mural en México con temas filosóficos |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=May 27, 2008&lt;!--|918-917-9042--&gt;  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Juan Cordero plastered the first mural with philosophical themes in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:José Guadalupe Posada, Calavera oaxaqueña, broadsheet, 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 broadsheet by [[José Guadalupe Posada]].]]

The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the [[Porfirio Díaz]] regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making [[Mexico]] like [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; [[Dr. Atl|Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl]], is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcounty.gov/museum/media/press-kit/contretas/contreras-media-kit-mural-tradition.pdf |title= The art of Ramón Contreras and the Mexican Muralists movement |publisher= San Bernardino County Museum  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art.  Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism.&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=) Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253341 |title= Populist art and the Mexican mural renaissance |work= Hispanic Heritage in the Americas -Latin American art |publisher= Britannica  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]] .&lt;ref name="dratl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title=Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art  |last1=Burton |first1=Tony |date=March 14, 2008 |issn=1028-9089 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

The [[Mexican Revolution]] itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to [[Porfirio Díaz]] policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included [[Antonio Curo]], [[Alfonso Reyes]] and [[José Vasconcelos]]. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros |title= Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros.  |first=Rita |last=Pomade |date= May 5, 2007  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas gained power as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]], which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of [[Francisco I. Madero]] who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the [[Álvaro Obregón]] faction, which became the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI).&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.&lt;ref name="dratl"/&gt;

In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]]. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; These ideals or principles were to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the identity of [[Mexico]] as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;  The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, [[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], [[Federico Cantú]] and others but the main three would be [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by [[Roberto Montenegro]], but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; 
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|Mural in the Palacio de Bellas Artes by [[Rufino Tamayo]].]]

The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]], at that time used for the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]].&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]] painted ["dancers of Chalma"] "Los danzantes de Chalma", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, [[Jean Charlot]] painted ''La conquista de Tenochtitlán'' (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal.&lt;ref name="folgarait"&gt; {{cite book |title= Mural painting and Social Revolution in Mexico 1920-1940  |last= Folgariat |first= Leonard |year=1998 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58147-8 |pages=42-46 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

===After the mural project at the National Preparatory High School===
This project at the institution was followed by projects at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], the interior walls of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], the [[Chapingo Autonomous University|Escuela Nacional de Chapingo]] the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the [[Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters|Secretaria de Educación Pública building]] among many others.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;
[[File:DeembarcoCanalSICDF.JPG|thumb|[[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], Mural at [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]]]]
The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors.  The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of [[Marxism]], especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the "heroic" phase while the period after 1930 is the "statist" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Mary|title=Muralism and The People: Culture, Popular Citizenship, and Government in Post-Revolutionary Mexico|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|pages=7–38|doi=10.1080/10714420212350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who "acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as "propaganda for a corrupt state" as taking a hard line.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;  Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;

Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Folgarait|title=Mural Painting and Social Revolution in Mexico, 1920-1940: Art of the New Order|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt;  The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt; Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.

The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
[[File:MuralCamarenaBellasArtes.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Mural by [[Jorge González Camarena]] at the Palacio de Bellas Artes]]

Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate.&lt;ref name="anos30"&gt;{{cite news |title= Testigo de los anos 30 |author=James Oles |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 12, 2000 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Witness to the 1930s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minima"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/artmex/tema3.html |title=Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican School of Painting and Sculpting |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” &lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:
1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
Most painters in this school worked in [[Mexico City]] or other cities in [[Mexico]], working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of [[Mexico]] and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos.&lt;ref name="minima"/&gt;

A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the [[Mexican Revolution]], mestizo identity and [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural history.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The other political orientation was that of [[Marxism]], especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists.  The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The mural painters of [[Mexico]] freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the [[fresco]], painting on freshly plastered walls and [[encaustic painting|encaustic or hot wax painting]] .&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with [[pyroxlene]], a commercial enamel and [[Duco]] (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

==Los Tres Grandes==
[[File:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|thumb|Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace by Diego Rivera]]
By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]], called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones).&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;
[[File:La abolición de la esclavitud de Orozco.JPG|thumb|left|[[Miguel Hidalgo]] abolishing slavery by José Clemente Orozco]]
Of the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"/&gt; His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Orozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; His work shows an "expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure." &lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the [[Mexican Revolution]], having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:PolyforumSiqueiros05.jpg|thumb|View of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros in Mexico City]]
Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the [[Venustiano Carranza]] army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a "futurist blurring of form and technique." His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism.&lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"/&gt; His radical politics made him unwelcome in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], so he did much of his work in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, his masterpiece is considered to be the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], located in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. [[José Vasconcelos]], the Secretary of Public Education under President [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=William|title=The Dilemmas of a Communist Artist: Diego Rivera in Moscow, 1927-1928|journal=Mexican Studies|year=1987|volume=3|issue=1|pages=49–69|jstor=4617031|doi=10.2307/4617031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.

In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crosscultural"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbard |first=Kathy |date=September 2010 |title= A CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION: Using Visual Culture for the Creation of a Socially Relevant Mural in Mexico |journal=Art Education |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=68–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal market]] of [[Teotitlán del Valle]], a small town in the state of [[Oaxaca]]. High school and college students from [[State of Georgia|Georgia]], [[United States]], collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of [[Zapotec language]] and customs.&lt;ref name="crosscultural"/&gt;

Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after [[World War I]] with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include [[Carlos Mérida]] of [[Guatemala]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] of [[Ecuador]] and [[Candido Portinari]] of [[Brazil]] .&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 1 051.jpg|thumb|View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno]]
Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;  Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to [[Los Angeles]]. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The only one of the three to survive, [[América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos|''América Tropical'']] (full name: ''América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos'', or ''Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism''&lt;ref&gt;Del Barco, Mandalit.

The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. It served as inspiration to the later [[Chicano]] muralism but the political messages are different.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the [[Sandinista]] period.&lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, ''The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979-1992''.

A '''monochromic'''&lt;ref&gt;From the {{lang-grc|μονόχρωμος}} – monochromos “having one color”.&lt;/ref&gt; image is one composed of one color (or [[lightness|values]] of one color).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary | chapter = monochrome | year = 2009 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monochrome | accessdate = October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''''monochrome'''''&lt;!-- Bold per MOS:BOLDSYN; italics per MOS:WAW. --&gt; comes from the {{lang-grc|μονόχρωμος|monochromos|having one color}}.

A '''monochromatic'''&lt;!-- Bold per MOS:BOLDSYN. --&gt; object or image reflects colors in shades of limited [[color]]s or [[hue]]s. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called [[grayscale]] or [[Black and white|black-and-white]]. However, scientifically speaking, '''monochromatic light&lt;!-- Bold per MOS:BOLDSYN. --&gt;''' refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (''see [[spectral color]]'').

==Application==
Of an [[image]], the term monochrome is usually taken to mean the same as black and white or, more likely, [[grayscale]], but may also be used to refer to other combinations containing only tones of a single color, such as [[green]]-and-white or green-and-red. It may also refer to [[Sepia tone|sepia]] displaying tones from light tan to dark brown or [[cyanotype]] ("blueprint") images, and early photographic methods such as [[daguerreotypes]], [[ambrotypes]], and [[tintype]]s, each of which may be used to produce a monochromatic image.

In computing, monochrome has two meanings:
*it may mean having only one color which is either on or off (also known as a [[binary image]]), 
*allowing shades of that color.

A [[Monochrome monitor|monochrome computer display]] is able to display only a single color, often green, [[Amber (color)|amber]], red or white, and often also shades of that color.

In film photography, monochrome is typically the use of black-and-white [[Photographic film|film]].
Originally, all photography was done [[monochrome photography|in monochrome]]. Although [[color photography]] was possible even in the late 19th century, easily used color films, such as [[Kodachrome]], were not available until the mid-1930s.

In [[digital photography]], monochrome is the capture of only shades of black by the sensor, or by post-processing a color image to present only the perceived brightness by combining the values of multiple channels (usually red, blue, and green). The weighting of individual channels may be selected to achieve a desired artistic effect; if only the red channel is selected by the weighting then the effect will be similar to that of using a red filter on [[panchromatic film]]. If the red channel is eliminated and the green and blue combined then the effect will be similar to that of [[orthochromatic film]] or the use of a cyan filter on panchromatic film. The selection of weighting thus allows a wide range of artistic expression in the final monochromatic image.

For production of an [[anaglyph image]] the original color [[Stereoscopy|stereogram]] source may first be reduced to monochrome in order to simplify the rendering of the image. This is sometimes required in cases where a color image would render in a confusing manner given the colors and patterns present in the source image and the selection filters used (typically [[red]] and its [[Complementary color|complement]], [[cyan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/monochromatic |title=Monochromatic |work=Dictionary.com Unabridged |publisher=Random House, Inc. |date= |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In physics==
{{See also|Spectral color}}
In physics, monochromatic light is [[electromagnetic radiation]] of a single frequency. In the physical sense, no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic, since that would require a wave of infinite duration as a consequence of the [[Fourier transform#Localization property|Fourier transform's localization property]] (cf. [[Coherence (physics)#Spectral coherence|spectral coherence]]). Even very controlled sources such as [[laser]]s operate in a range of frequencies (known as the [[spectral linewidth]]). In practice, filtered light, [[diffraction grating]] separated light and laser light are all routinely referred to as monochromatic. Often light sources can be compared and one be labeled as “more monochromatic” (in a similar usage as ''monodispersity''). A device which isolates a narrow band of frequencies from a broader-bandwidth source is called a [[monochromator]], even though the bandwidth is often explicitly specified, and thus a collection of frequencies is understood.

[[File:Novecento10.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Robert De Niro]], [[Stefania Casini]] and [[Gérard Depardieu]] in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' (1976)]]

'''Nudity in film''' is the presentation in a film of at least one person who is [[Nudity|nude]], partially nude or wearing less clothing than contemporary norms in some societies consider "[[Modesty|modest]]". Since the development of the medium, inclusion in films of any form of sexuality has been controversial, and in the case of most nude scenes has had to be justified as being part of the story, in the concept of "artistically justifiable nudity". In some cases nudity is itself the object of a film or is used in the development of the character of the subject. In some cases, nudity has been criticized as "superfluous" or "gratuitous" to the plot, and some film producers have been accused of including nudity in a film to appeal to certain audiences. Many actors and actresses have appeared nude, or exposing parts of their bodies or dressed in ways considered provocative by contemporary standards at some point in their careers.

Nudity in film should be distinguished from sex in film. Erotic films are suggestive of sexuality, and usually contain nudity, though that is not a prerequisite. Nudity in a sexual context is common in [[pornographic film]]s, but [[softcore pornography|softcore]] pornographic films generally avoid depiction of a [[human penis|penis]] or a [[vulva]]. A film on [[naturism]] or about people for whom nudity is common may contain non-sexual nudity, and some other non-pornographic films may contain very brief nude scenes. The vast majority of nudity in film is found in pornographic films.

Nude scenes can be controversial in some cultures because they may challenge some of the community's standards of modesty. These standards vary by culture, and depend on the type of nudity, who is exposed, which parts of the body are exposed, the duration of the exposure, the pose, the context, and other aspects. Regardless, in many cultures nudity in film is subject to censorship or rating regimes which control the content of films, with the intention of limiting content that is deemed by the classification authorities or the movie industry, or both, to be harmful or undesirable, morally or otherwise.

Many directors and producers apply [[self-censorship]], limiting nudity (and other content) in their films, to avoid external censorship or a strict rating, in countries that have a rating system.{{efn|In the US, the strict rating [[NC-17]] reduces the number of people going to the movie theater not only because it excludes people under 18, but because few theaters show these films at all.}} Directors and producers may choose to limit nudity because of objections from actors involved, or for a wide variety of other personal, artistic, genre-bound or narrative-oriented reasons.

Nudity has almost universally not been permitted on stage, but sheer or simulated nudity may have been. Devices used include use of skin-tight flesh-colored [[bodystocking]]s to simulate nudity or vital parts to be covered by long hair, for roles such as [[Lady Godiva in popular culture|Lady Godiva]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=csaQtOXBEusC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=lady+godiva+on+stage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EPeyU-070j&amp;sig=QyfBiZMqOXs_UxTmF-KAKY4DNBI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj658e74OvKAhXFI5QKHWPLA4U4ChDoAQggMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=lady%20godiva%20on%20stage&amp;f=false ''Actresses on the Victorian Stage: Feminine Performance and the Galatea Myth'', p.134]  by Gail Marshall&lt;/ref&gt;

American actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]] created controversy in 1861 when she wore a flesh-colored bodystocking in the play ''Mazeppa'', based on [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Mazeppa (poem)|Mazeppa]]'', in which she played a Polish man who was tied nude to the back of a wild horse by his enemies.&lt;ref name=Brooks&gt;Brooks, Daphne A.

[[Sarah Bernhardt]] early in her career posed topless on several occasions for French photographer [[Felix Nadar]]. She is nevertheless seen with her top covered in surviving stills of these sessions. At least one later topless photograph of the young Bernhardt made in 1873 survives. These nude sessions were not meant for outright public viewing but for the encouraging of theatrical employers or personal guests. Thus nude photos of women like Menken and Bernhardt are known only to scholars and perhaps theater buffs.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the 1880s, [[Eadweard Muybridge]], at the dawn of the invention of the motion picture, used a device he called a [[zoopraxiscope]] to project a series of successive still photographs. The photos would then be played one after the other giving the illusion of movement. Sometimes the same sequence would be filmed using several cameras. Many of Muybridge's photographic sessions using the zoopraxiscope had nude anonymous models, both female and male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/muybridge/ |title=Freeze Frame |publisher=[[National Museum of American History]] |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKJIq2GhjUM |title=Eadward J.

== Early films: the silent era ==
The first films containing nudity were the early erotic films. Production of such films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. The earliest film containing a simulated nude scene appears to be the 1897 ''[[After the Ball (1897 film)|After the Ball]]'' by French director [[George Méliès]], in which the director's future wife wears a bodystocking to simulate nudity. Two of the earliest pioneers of such erotica were Frenchmen [[Eugène Pirou]] and [[Albert Kirchner]]. Kirchner (under the name "Léar") directed such films for Pirou. The 7-minute 1899 film ''[[Le Coucher de la Mariée]]'' had [[Louise Willy]] performing a bathroom striptease.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Abel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&amp;pg=PA518&amp;dq=%22Louise+Willy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LDEqT9y5HsbWrQeoqLDADA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Louise%20Willy%22&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of early cinema |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-23440-5 |page=518 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqué films, showing women disrobing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |editor1=Stephen Herbert |editor2=Luke McKernan |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/lear.htm |title=Léar (Albert Kirchner) |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |editor1=Stephen Herbert |editor2=Luke McKernan |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/pirou.htm |title=Eugène Pirou |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Austria, [[Johann Schwarzer]] sought to break the dominance of French-produced erotic films being distributed by the [[Pathé]] brothers. Schwarzer formed his Saturn-Film production company which between 1906 and 1911 produced 52 erotic productions, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to be shown at men-only theatre nights (called ''Herrenabende''). These films were promoted as erotic and artistic, rather than pornographic, but in 1911, Saturn was dissolved by the censorship authorities and its films destroyed.&lt;ref name="Projektionen der Sehnshucht"&gt;Michael Achenbach, Paolo Caneppele, Ernst Kieninger: ''Projektionen der Sehnsucht: Saturn, die erotischen Anfänge der österreichischen Kinematografie''. Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, {{ISBN|3-901932-04-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, copies of at least a half of the films have been found in private hands. Filmarchiv Austria has included four of Schwarzer's works on the Europa Film Treasures site: ''Das Sandbad'' (1906), ''Baden Verboten'' (1906), ''Das Eitle Stubenmädchen'' (1908) and ''Beim Fotografen'' (1908).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europafilmtreasures.eu/films/origin/Austrian-4-0.htm|title=Johann Schwarzer films on the Europa Film Treasures site|author=|date=|website=europafilmtreasures.eu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821210055/http://www.europafilmtreasures.eu/films/origin/austrian-4-0.htm|archivedate=21 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1911 Italian film ''Dante's Inferno'', directed by Francesco Bertolini, is loosely adapted from Dante's epic poem ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]'' and inspired by the illustrations of [[Gustave Doré]]. In depicting tormented souls in hell, there are frequent glimpses of nude male and female actors (including the first male frontal scenes). Remade many times, the U.S. version, ''[[Dante's Inferno (1924 film)|Dante's Inferno]]'' (1924) from the [[Fox Film Corporation]], also contains groups of nude figures and scenes of [[flagellation]].
[[File:Audrey Munson as nude art model in movie Inspiration (1915).jpg|thumb|[[Audrey Munson]] in ''[[Inspiration (1915 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1915), the first non-pornographic American film containing nude scenes.]]

''[[Inspiration (1915 film)|Inspiration]]'', a silent film released in 1915, is believed to be the first American motion picture with a leading actor in a nude scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0613242/bio |title=IMDB Bio of Audrey Munson |accessdate=26 November 2008 |publisher=IMDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The context of the nudity in the film was that of an artist's model, played by [[Audrey Munson]], at work. Munson appeared nude again in a similar role in the 1916 film ''[[Purity (film)|Purity]]''. A feature of these films was that Munson was a [[tableau vivant]], not being required to move, and only her backside and breasts were in view. [[Annette Kellermann]], the famous Australian swimming star, appeared fully nude in an active role in Fox's ''[[A Daughter of the Gods]]'' in 1916. Though shot from the front, most of Kellerman's body is covered by her long hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=James Crighton |title=The Hidden Cinema: British Film Censorship in Action, 1913-1975 |publisher=Routledge |year=1993 |pages=9–10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNfV-Ussp0gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-415-09034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kellerman had appeared in several lost films prior to 1912, but whether she did nude scenes in them is unknown. A couple of her films from 1910, thought to have been lost, have been rediscovered in Australia.

Several early films of the [[silent era]] and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|early sound era]] include women in nude scenes, presented in a historical or religious context. One such film was the [[anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] ''[[The Hypocrites (1915 film)|Hypocrites]]'' (1915), directed by [[Lois Weber]], which contained several sequences with Margaret Edwards appearing nude (uncredited) as a ghostly apparition representing Truth. Her scenes were created using innovative traveling [[multiple exposure|double exposure]] sequences which made her appear as a semi-transparent spirit. In 1917, Fox produced the lavish [[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]] in which [[Theda Bara]] wore a number of risqué outfits. [[Gordon Griffith]] appeared as a young naked Tarzan in ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918), making him the first child actor to appear naked on screen. [[Nell Shipman]] appeared nude in the Canadian film ''[[Back to God's Country (1919 film)|Back to God's Country]]'' (1919). Fox produced ''[[The Queen of Sheba (1921 film)|The Queen of Sheba]]'' in 1921 starring [[Betty Blythe]], who displayed ample nudity even when wearing 28 different [[diaphanous]] costumes. There is also a brief moment in [[D.W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Orphans of the Storm]]'' (1921 at 43.15 min) to display the debauchery of the French aristocracy.
[[File:Annette Kellerman in tree, arms spread.jpg|thumb|left|A still of [[Annette Kellermann]] from ''[[A Daughter of the Gods]]'' (1916).]]

''[[Is Your Daughter Safe?]]'' (1927) was one of the earliest exploitation films which contained nudity. A compilation of medical documentary films and stock footage of nude scenes dating back to the 1900s, it was presented as an educational film about the dangers of venereal disease, white slavery, and prostitution. ''[[Hula (film)|Hula]]'' (1927) is a feature film of this period in which then-popular star [[Clara Bow]] does a nude bathing scene.

Exploitation short subjects (three to 15 minutes in length) with comedic plots and frequent nudity were also produced in the silent era. A few have survived to the present such as ''Forbidden Daughters'' (13 minutes, 1927), directed by prominent nude photographer [[Albert Arthur Allen]], ''Hollywood Script Girl'' (three minutes, 1928), and ''Uncle Si and the Sirens'' (eight minutes, c. 1928). These were the forerunners of the "nudie" comedy feature films that emerged in the late 1950s. Years later, when the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]] came into force, these films were considered too obscene to be reshown. Most of these films are now [[lost film|lost]].

In France in the 1920s, short-subject films were made of a topless [[Josephine Baker]] performing exotic dance routines. The 1922 Swedish/Danish silent horror film ''[[Häxan]]'' contained nude scenes, torture and [[sexual perversion]]. The film was banned in the U.S. and had to be edited before it was shown in other countries. The 1929 Russian film ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' by [[Dziga Vertov]] featured nudity within the context of [[naturism]], including live childbirth.

== U.S. cinema since 1929 ==

=== Overview ===

Filmmaking started in the 1890s, with the first feature-length film being produced in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Nude scenes appeared in films from the start of the new invention. Several Hollywood films produced in the 1910s and 1920s, which contained only brief nudity, created controversy. Various groups objected to these features on moral grounds, and several states set up film censorship boards, arguing that such content was obscene and should be banned. Under pressure, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) created its own censorship agency, the Hays Code, which brought an end to nudity and risqué content in films produced by the main Hollywood studios (i.e., MPAA members). The Code was adopted in 1930, and began to be effectively enforced in 1934. At the same time, the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] was formed to keep an eye on the morals conveyed in films and indicate its disapproval by "condemning" films it considered morally objectionable (theaters would not show a condemned film until this system was defeated in the 1960s).

Social and official attitudes toward nudity have eased since those days and the Code came under repeated challenge in the 1950s and '60s. In 1958, the New York Court of Appeals ruled, in the context of prohibition of screenings of films, that a film that merely contains nudity was not obscene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ny.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac/SAC/NY/1957/19570703_0043403.NY.htm/qx |title=Excelsior Pictures Corp. v.

From its early days the presence of nudity in a film has been controversial and even today its presence is invariably noted by critics and censors. Until the 1980s, male nudity was rarely shown on screen. Though female nudity was routinely treated with respect and solemnity, male nudity, when it finally found its way onto the screen, was generally treated humorously and mockingly. Today, though nudity in film is much more common, its presence in dramas is still expected to be justified on artistic grounds.

=== Pre-Hays Code Hollywood, 1929–1934 ===
{{Main article|Pre-Code Hollywood}}

The silent film era came to an end in 1929. In 1930, the Motion Picture Association of America drew up the Motion Picture Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, to raise the moral standards of films by directly restricting the materials which the major film studios could include in their films. The code authorized nudity only in naturist quasi-documentary films and in foreign films. However, the code was not enforced until 1934.

After the end of silent films, movies with sound that included brief glimpses of nudity appeared as early as 1930 with ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]''. [[Cecil B. DeMille]], later known as a family entertainment specialist, included several nude scenes in his early films such as ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' (1932), ''[[Four Frightened People]]'' (1934), and ''[[Cleopatra (1934 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1934). The "Dance of the Naked Moon" and orgy scene was cut for ''The Sign of the Cross'' in a 1938 reissue to comply with the production code. Other filmmakers followed suit, particularly in historical dramas such as ''[[The Scarlet Empress]]'' (1934) – which, among other things, shows topless women being burned at the stake – and contemporary stories filmed in exotic, mostly tropical, locations. ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'', directed by [[King Vidor]] in 1932, featured a nude swimming scene with [[Dolores del Río]], and [[Harry Lachman]]'s ''[[Dante's Inferno (1935 film)|Dante's Inferno]]'' featured many naked men and women suffering in hell.

The early [[Tarzan#Film|''Tarzan'' films]] with [[Johnny Weissmuller]] featured at least partial nudity justified by the natural surroundings in which the characters lived; in ''[[Tarzan and His Mate]]'' in 1934, Jane ([[Maureen O'Sullivan]], [[body double|doubled]] by Olympic swimmer [[Josephine McKim]]) swims in the nude.

Under the pretense of being an educational [[ethnography|ethnographic]] film, producers could justify showing half-clad natives in jungle epics and South-Sea-island documentaries. This was often done by editing in stock footage or fabricating new scenes with ethnic-looking stand-ins. Examples of [[docufiction]] include ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930), notorious for its fake scenes of semi-nude "native" girls filmed on a back lot. ''Forbidden Adventure in Angkor'' (1937) is a 1912 Cambodia documentary with scenes added, for dramatic effect, of two explorers and a dozen topless female bearers, incongruously played by African-American women. ''The Sea Fiend'' (1935), re-issued as ''[[Devil Monster]]'' (1946), is a low-budget South-Sea drama spiced up with stock footage inserts of half-dressed native girls.

Other films of questionable authenticity in this subgenre include ''[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]]'' (1926), ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]'', ''The Blonde Captive'', ''[[Tabu: A Story of the South Seas]]'' (all 1931), ''Goona Goona'' aka ''Kriss'', ''Isle of Paradise'', ''Virgins of Bali'', ''Bird of Paradise'' (all 1932), ''Gow'' aka ''Gow the Killer'' (1934, re-released as ''Cannibal Island'' in 1956), ''Inyaah, Jungle Goddess'' (1934), ''Legong: Dance of the Virgins'' (1935), ''Love Life of a Gorilla'' (1937), ''Mau-Mau'' (1955), and ''Naked Africa'' (1957).

Due to the [[diaphanous]] or sheer nature of 1920s and 1930s fashions, female body parts or virtual nudity, or both, can be on display even when the performer is fully clothed. As a result, when the Hays Code came into force in 1934, studio wardrobe departments had to attire actresses in more conservative as well as contemporary dress.

=== Hays Code Enforcement Hollywood, 1934–1960s ===
[[File:Childbride.jpeg|thumb|left|Scene of [[Shirley Mills]] from ''[[Child Bride]]'' (1938)]]

Though in place, the Hays Code was not enforced until 1934, spurred on in response to objections voiced by several groups to the content of Hollywood films – provoked at least partly by the notorious 1933 Czech film ''[[Ecstasy (film)|Ecstasy]]'', which was highly controversial in its time largely because of a nude swimming scene by [[Hedy Lamarr]] as well as perhaps the first non-pornographic film to portray sexual intercourse,&lt;ref&gt;"Curiously, ''Extase'' is celebrated as the first motion picture containing a nude scene, which it was not, rather than the first to show sexual intercourse, which it was." {{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Robertson |title=Film Facts |location=New York |publisher=Billboard Books |year=2001 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; although never showing more than the actors' faces. It has also been called the first on-screen depiction of a female orgasm.

The restrictions of the production code were strictly enforced from 1934 until the early 1960s to restrict nudity in films produced by the studios. United States produced films were also under the scrutiny of moral guardians, such as the Catholic Legion of Decency, which had an influence on the content and subject matter of films in the 1930s and 1940s. They were also subject to constraints of state censorship authorities. These bodies followed inconsistent guidelines through which the film producers had to navigate; with some films being exhibited in cut versions in some states.

The Hays Code was so strict that even the display of cleavage was controversial. Producer [[Howard Hughes]] created controversy by his emphasis on cleavage, especially that of [[Jane Russell]], first in the 1941 film ''[[The Outlaw]]'' and also in the 1953 film ''[[The French Line]]''. The film was found objectionable under the Hays Code because of Russell's "breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" while some of her [[decollete]] gowns were regarded to be "intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Doherty, Thomas  |author2=Doherty, Thomas Patrick  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=Hollywood's censor: Joseph I. Breen &amp; the Production Code Administration |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=310 |isbn=0-231-14358-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both films were condemned by the Legion of Decency and were released only in cut versions.

Independent film producers – i.e., those outside the studio system – were not bound by the restrictions of the Hays Code. However, they were subject to state censorship regimes and could be excluded from so-called "family" theatres. These films claimed to be educational and dealt with taboo topics such as drug parties, prostitution, and sexually transmitted infections. In the course of presenting the message, nudity at times made an appearance. These films, which emerged in the 1930s, were obliged to play in independent theaters or traveled across the United States in "roadshow" fashion. They were normally low-budget, and described as sensationalized [[exploitation film]]s. Using this framework, brief nude scenes of women appeared in ''[[Maniac (1934 film)|Maniac]]'' (1934) and ''[[Sex Madness]]'' (1937), and nude swimming sequences in ''[[Marihuana (film)|Marihuana]]'' (1936) and ''[[Child Bride]]'' (1938). ''Child Bride'' was controversial because it included a topless and skinny dipping scene by 12-year-old [[Shirley Mills]], which was described by Allmovie as "gratuitous child nudity",&lt;ref name=AllRovi&gt;{{AllRovi movie|9205|Child Bride}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in some versions the topless scene was cut out.

Exploitative films with pseudo-ethnographic pretensions continued well into the 1960s. For example, ''Mau-Mau'' (1955), presented as a documentary of the violent nationalist uprising in Kenya, played the grind-house circuit. Fabricated scenes filmed in front of a painted backdrop of an African village show nude and semi-clad "native" women being raped, strangled, and stabbed by machete-wielding maniacs.

Other films containing nudity were the early underground 8mm [[pornographic film]]s and fetish reels which, due to various censorship regimes, had only limited (usually clandestine) means of distribution and were only shown in private until the 1970s.

=== Nudist films ===
Nudist films first appeared in the early 1930s as documentaries, [[Utopian Fiction|Utopian]] and docu-dramas promoting the healthy lifestyle of the naturist movement in Europe and the U.S. Earliest examples include ''This Nude World'' (1933), a narrated documentary filmed in the U.S., France, and Germany, and ''Elysia, Valley of the Nude'' (1933), a docu-drama filmed at a nudist camp in Elsinore, California. Throughout the thirties, nudist films like ''Why Nudism?'' (1933), ''Nudist Land'' (1937), and ''The Unashamed'' (1938) flourished in road shows, but disappeared entirely in the forties.

The nudist-camp movie was revived in the 1950s with ''[[Garden of Eden (1954 film)|Garden of Eden]]'' (1954), the first naturist film shot in color. Changes in censorship laws led to a flood of films such as ''Naked Venus'' (1958) directed by [[Edgar G. Ulmer]], ''Nudist Memories'' (1959), and ''[[Daughter of the Sun]]'' (1962) by [[David F. Friedman]], and [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]]. [[Doris Wishman]] was probably the most active producer/director in the genre, with eight nudist films to her credit between 1960 and 1964, with ''[[Hideout in the Sun]]'' (1960), ''[[Nude on the Moon]]'' (1961), ''[[Diary of a Nudist]]'' (1961), ''[[Blaze Starr Goes Nudist]]'' (1962), ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Nature Girls]]'' (1963), ''[[Playgirls International]]'' (1963), ''[[Behind the Nudist Curtain]]'' (1964), and ''[[The Prince and the Nature Girl]]'' (1964).

[[Edward Craven Walker]] (1918-2000) the inventor of the [[lava lamp]] was a major figure in the naturist movement. He made three nudist films under the name Micheal Keatering. They were ''[[Travelling Light (1959 film)|Travelling Light]]'' (1959), ''[[Sunswept]]'' (1962), and ''[[Eves on Skis]]'' (1963).

Ramsey Harrington produced ''The Nudist Story'' (1960) (retitled "For Members Only" or "Pussycat's Paradise" for the U.S. market), Arthur Knight produced ''[[My Bare Lady (film)|My Bare Lady]]'' (1963) and [[Leo Orenstein]] (under the pseudonym Alan Overton) directed ''Have Figure, Will Travel'' (1963).&lt;ref name=Storey&gt;Storey, Mark (2003). ''Cinema Au Naturel: A History of Nudist Film''. {{ISBN|9780974084404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Exploitation producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]] also released films such as ''Nudist Life'' (1961), which comprised vintage nudist camp footage. In the same year, in England, [[Harrison Marks]] released ''[[Naked as Nature Intended]]'' which starred [[Pamela Green]] and was a box office success (Marks soon went to make softcore pornographic and caning/spanking fetish films.)&lt;ref name=Storey/&gt;

Nudist films claimed to depict the lifestyles of members of the nudism or naturist movement, but were largely a vehicle for the exhibition of female nudity. They were mainly shot in naturist resorts, but augmented by attractive glamour models. The nudity was strictly non-sexual and when filmed frontally the members' pubic area was strictly covered by the angle of shot or some clothing or other objects. There was uninhibited exposure of breasts and backsides though. The acting and technical production standards were not very high and the outlets for their exhibition were very limited, as was the size of the audience interested in these films, and many films were re-released several times under new titles, to trick patrons into seeing the films additional times. What audience there was lost interest in these films by the mid-1960s and production ceased.&lt;ref name=Storey/&gt;

=== Nudie-cuties ===
At the same time, some independent producers produced erotic feature films which openly contained female nudity without a pretext of a naturist context. ''[[The Immoral Mr. Teas]]'' (1959) directed by [[Russ Meyer]] was the first of such films. In that film, the context for the presentation of female nudity was the fantasies of the main character involving nude women. A feature of the film was the use of larger-breasted women, which became a feature of this genre. The film is widely considered the first pornographic feature not confined to under-the-counter distribution, and the film was commercially successful. For the next few years a wave of such films, known as "nudies" or "nudie-cuties", were produced for adult theatres (in the United States sometimes called [[grindhouse]] theatres). Films in this genre included [[Doris Wishman|Doris Wishman's]] science fiction spoof ''[[Nude on the Moon]]'' (1961), the [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]] and [[David F. Friedman]] film ''[[The Adventures of Lucky Pierre]]'' (1961), and Ed Wood's horror-nudie ''[[Orgy of the Dead]]'' (1965), with its bevy of topless dancers from beyond the grave, following his western screenplay, ''[[Revenge of the Virgins]]'' (1959), which shows a fierce tribe of bare-breasted Indian women hunting a group of treasure seekers. There were very many other similar films and sequels. They all boasted their low budgets and were generally of poor quality. Their producers generally did not claim any artistic merit for their work, but such films were very profitable. The only director in this field to go on to mainstream and critical success is [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who began his career writing and directing a pair of nudie comedies in 1962, ''[[Tonight for Sure]]'' and ''[[The Bellboy and the Playgirls]]''.

=== Challenges to the Hays Code, 1960–1966 ===
[[File:Jayne Mansfield in Promises! Promises!.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jayne Mansfield]] nude in ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'' (1963)]]

In [[Michael Powell]]'s controversial British film ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]'', released in 1960, a model ([[Pamela Green]]) lies back on a bed waiting to be photographed by the killer in a key scene. She undoes her top briefly exposing one of her breasts. The scene is regarded as the first female nude scene in a mainstream postwar English-language feature film, and notably the first such scene for a British film. The movie was panned by critics at the time and it reportedly destroyed Powell's directing career in the UK. The film is now seen as a [[cult classic]]; [[Martin Scorsese]] re-released it in 1979. Another 1960 release, the American horror film ''[[Macumba Love]]'', featured a brief topless scene of [[June Wilkinson]] frolicking in the ocean. This segment, which caused a sensation at the time, only was seen in the European release of the film.

By now the Production Code had been revised so that it served less as a doctrine of rules and more as a workable set of precautions, including those on sex and nudity, to which filmmakers were advised on the more graphic depictions and given exceptions that could be made. It gave the MPAA the power to label certain films that were seen as containing adult or provocative material as "Suggested for Mature Audiences".

==== First major nude scenes in studio films ====
The [[Unfinished creative work|unfinished]] 1962 film ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' included a nude pool swim scene with [[Marilyn Monroe]]. For the filming of the scene, a body stocking was made for Monroe, and the set was to be closed to all but necessary crew. However, Monroe asked photographers to come in, including [[William Woodfield]], and took off the body stocking and swam in only a flesh-colored bikini bottom.&lt;ref name="vanityFair"&gt;{{cite web | last = Schiller | first = Lawrence | title = Marilyn: Inside the Lost Nudes | publisher = Condé Nast | date = June 2012 | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2012/06/marilyn-monroe-nude-photos-exclusive | accessdate = May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulpinternational.com/images/postimg/confidence_dames_02.jpg|title=Pulp International: Confidential|author=|date=|website=pulpinternational.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After filming was completed, Monroe was photographed in the bikini bottom, and without it.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.marilynmonroe.ca/camera/mags/lifeJune62.htm They Fired Marilyn: Her Dip Lives On]", ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', June 22, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everlasting-star.net/sgtg_caps0004.php Marilyn Monroe Pictures: Something's Got to Give].&lt;/ref&gt; Had the project been completed and released as planned, it would have been the first Hollywood film of the sound era to feature a [[Mainstream#In film|mainstream]] actress in the nude.

However, this wasn't the first instance of Monroe being filmed in the nude. In the 1961 [[John Huston]] film ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'', Monroe, playing the lead female character, drops a sheet during an intimate scene, exposing herself on camera. Huston, however, decided not to include the footage in the final cut, as he believed it was of no value to the story.&lt;ref name=VF /&gt; The script did not emphasize nudity in the 45-second-long love scene, but Monroe thought it was required, seeing that her character is putting on her clothes while being alone in the room, and it made "no sense" that "a woman sitting up in bed, with nobody in the room, [would] pull the sheet up and then try to put a blouse on at the same time".&lt;ref name=VF /&gt; Charles Casillo, author of ''Marilyn Monroe: The Private Life of a Public Icon'', says the footage was preserved by ''Misfits'' producer Frank E. Taylor and has been, as of 2018, in the possession of his son, Curtice Taylor, since 1999.&lt;ref name=VF&gt;{{cite web|last=Desta|first=Yohana|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/marilyn-monroe-nude-scene-the-misfits|title=A Lost Marilyn Monroe Nude Scene Has Been Found.

The distinction of being the first mainstream American actress to appear nude in a starring role went to actress [[Jayne Mansfield]] in the 1963 film ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'', though her pubic area is never visible on film. The film was banned in Cleveland and some other cities,&lt;ref name=dirks&gt;{{cite web | last = Dirks | first = Tim | title = Sex in Cinema: The Greatest and Most Influential Erotic / Sexual Films and Scenes | publisher = Film Site | url = http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms15.html | accessdate = 2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; though later the Cleveland court decided the nude scenes in the film were not lewd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Raymond | last = Strait | title = Here They Are Jayne Mansfield | page = 209 | publisher = SP Books | year = 1992 | isbn = 1-56171-146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the original and an edited version enjoyed box office success elsewhere.&lt;ref name=dirks/&gt; As a result of the film's success, Mansfield landed on the Top 10 list of Box Office Attractions for that year.&lt;ref name=Faris01&gt;{{cite book |last=Faris |first=Jocelyn |year=1994 |title=Jayne Mansfield: a bio-bibliography |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Greenwood |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Chicago Sun-Times'' movie critic Roger Ebert wrote, "Finally in ''Promises!

''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'', released in 1964, breached the Motion Picture Production Code with actresses [[Linda Geiser]] and Thelma Oliver (who later became the mystic and yoga teacher [[Krishna Kaur Khalsa]]) fully exposing their breasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-sex-records.com/first-breast-exposure-modern-times.htm World Sex Records] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313000851/http://www.world-sex-records.com/first-breast-exposure-modern-times.htm |date=13 March 2009 }}.

The nudity resulted in a backlash from moral and religious conservatives, including the Catholic Legion (which by that time had become a virtually powerless fringe organization). However, critical and overall public response was positive, and many Catholics rebuked the Legion's condemnation of the film. The National Council of Churches even gave the movie an award for Best Picture of the Year.&lt;ref name=Pictures&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2008 |pages=173–176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_T9tCvzIFrcC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=The+PAwnbroker+steiger |isbn=978-1-59420-152-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1965 thriller ''[[The Collector (1965 film)|The Collector]]'' contained mild nudity of [[Samantha Eggar]] and added to the challenge to the blanket prohibition of nudity in films. That same year [[Paula Prentiss]] performed a strip-tease in the [[Woody Allen]]-scripted comedy ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'', which ended up on the cutting room floor but resurfaced on the pages of ''Playboy'', and [[Julie Christie]] appeared nude in the British drama film ''[[Darling (1965 film)|Darling]]''. U.S. release prints of the film and even later U.S. video and DVD versions cut the nudity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059084/alternateversions "''Darling'' (1965) - Alternative Versions"].

Antonioni's [[mod (subculture)|mod]]-influenced murder-mystery contained a scene involving two girls undressing before being chased around a studio by a fashion photographer, who wrestles them to the ground and exposes their torsos. There are additional scenes depicting sexuality and partial nudity, as well as blatant drug use. The film was produced in Britain and released to American audiences by [[MGM]] without Production Code approval, the first mainstream motion picture containing nudity to be released by a major studio in the US,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060176/ "''Blowup''"].

That same year the biblical epic based on the book of Genesis, ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'', was released by [[Twentieth Century Fox]] featuring a nude sequence of Adam and Eve. Another epic, the historical film ''[[Hawaii (1966 film)|Hawaii]]'' (1966) featured scenes of topless native girls. [[John Frankenheimer]]'s 1966 sci-fi thriller ''[[Seconds (film)|Seconds]]'' contained an extended sequence of full frontal male and female nudity that was deleted from the original American release in which bohemian revelers dance and play in a wine vat.

By 1967, the MPAA had abandoned the Production Code altogether, and in November 1968, the voluntary MPAA film rating system was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpaa.org/ratings/ratings-history|title=Motion Picture Association of America, Ratings history|author=|date=|website=mpaa.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730224925/http://www.mpaa.org/ratings/ratings-history|archivedate=30 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rating system has changed in minor ways since its inception, but the type and intensity of nudity continue to be rating criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpaa.org/ratings/what-each-rating-means|title=Motion Picture Association of America, What Each Rating Means|author=|date=|website=mpaa.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819074431/http://www.mpaa.org/ratings/what-each-rating-means|archivedate=19 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexploitation films in the U.S. and Japan ===
By the mid-1960s, the novelty of the purely voyeuristic nudie-cutie/nudist camp comedy had dissipated.  A new cycle of more realistic sex dramas and gritty, film noir-inspired crime stories (mostly filmed in black-and-white) emerged to dominate the adult market. These films had a much harder edge and dealt with racy subjects such as infidelity, wife-swapping, prostitution, lesbianism, drugs, white slavery, rape, psycho-killers, sex cults, decadence, sadomasochism, and sexual perversion. The films that concentrate on the dark and violent side of sexuality are generally known as "roughies".

Prime examples of roughie [[sexploitation]] include: Lewis and Friedman's ''[[Scum of the Earth!]]'' (1963); Russ Meyer's ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964); Joseph P. Mawra's misogynistic Olga trilogy, ''White Slaves of Chinatown'', ''Olga's Girls'', and ''Olga's House of Shame'' (all 1964); R. Lee Frost's ''The Defilers'' (1965); Doris Wishman's ''[[Bad Girls Go to Hell]]'' (1965); ''The Sexploiters'' (1965);  ''The Agony of Love'' (1966), and [[Michael Findlay]]'s ''Body of a Female'' (1965) and psycho-killer trilogy starting with ''The Touch of Her Flesh'' (1967).

Sexploitation films initially played in grindhouse theatres{{sfn|Sconce|2007|p=42}} and struggling independent theaters. However, by the end of the 1960s they were playing in established cinema chains.{{sfn|Sconce|2007|p=20}} As the genre developed during the 1960s films began showing scenes of simulated sex.{{sfn|Sconce|2007|p=28}} By the late 1960s, the films were attracting a larger and broader audience, including couples rather than the single males who originally made up the vast majority of patrons.{{sfn|Sconce|2007|p=35}} The genre rapidly declined in the early 1970s due to advertising bans, the closure of many grindhouses and drive-in theaters, and the growth of hardcore pornography in the "[[Golden Age of Porn]]".{{sfn|Sconce|2777|p=42}} During this period a number of [[adult film]]s that were sexually explicit received general theatrical releases, including ''[[Blue Movie]]'' (1969), ''[[Mona the Virgin Nymph]]'' (1970), ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972), and others.

Frost's ''[[Love Camp 7]]'' (1968) was the forerunner of the women in prison and [[Nazi exploitation]] subgenres which have continued to the present day. Their stories feature women in prison who are subjected to sexual and physical abuse, typically by sadistic male or female prison wardens and guards. The genre also features many films in which imprisoned women engage in lesbian sex. These films discarded all moralistic pretensions and were works of pure fantasy intended only to titillate the audience with a lurid mix of sex and violence, including voyeurism (strip searches, group shower scenes, cat-fights) to sexual fantasies (lesbianism, rape, sexual slavery), to fetishism (bondage, whipping, degradation), and outright sadism (beatings, torture, cruelty).

In Japan, [[Seijun Suzuki]]'s ground-breaking ''[[Gate of Flesh]]'' (1964) was the first mainstream film with nudity seen in "general release" (as opposed to adults-only) theaters. Suzuki was a pioneer of the [[film noir]]–inspired [[Yakuza film|Yakuza genre]]. His surreal and influential ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' (1967) contains several scenes of casual nudity (the actors had to wear adhesive patches to avoid censorship problems).

At the same time, Japan's adult film industry began churning out sex-and-violence B-movies similar to the roughie sexploitation films coming out of the U.S. These so-called [[pink film]]s (a.k.a. pinku eiga and "pinky violent" movies) were partly influenced by the [[Ero guro]] movement which focuses on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence. Many, such as ''[[Shogun's Joys of Torture]]'' (1968), deal directly with sadomasochism or include fetishistic scenes of female victims being bound, whipped and otherwise abused. Other films use the theme of strong women exacting violent revenge for past injustices.

=== 1968–present day ===
In 2007, [[Judd Apatow]] announced "I'm gonna get a penis or a vagina in every movie I do from now on. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. It really makes me laugh in this day and age, with how psychotic our world is, that anyone is troubled by seeing any part of the human body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2007/12/judd_apatow_vows_to_include_wa.html |title=Judd Apatow Vows to Include Wangs in Every Film He Makes |work=Vulture |date=18 December 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2010, the Motion Picture Association of America's Classification and Rating Administration announced that it would specifically note in the future which films contained "male nudity" in direct response to parental concerns about the content of the movie ''[[Brüno]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spanglemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=551 |title=The Slippery Slope of the MPAA's New Ratings Policy |publisher=Spangle Magazine |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2011-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113755/http://www.spanglemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=551 |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors and actresses are usually informed of nude scenes well in advance, and nudity waivers require directors to state what will be shown and how it will be presented. This is generally stipulated in the [[nudity clause]] of a performer’s contract. Actress [[Anne Hathaway]] said in an interview with National Public Radio, "The director submits a shot list, and you look over them for approval. And a lot of times, if an actor feels the shot demands a lot of them, they'll demand money for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/liam-lacey/the-naked-truth-about-on-screen-nudity/article2355513/ |title=The naked truth about on-screen nudity |first=Liam |last=Lacey |work=The Globe and Mail |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tastefulness of nude scenes is hotly debated in the United States. Adding nudity to films may potentially hurt a film's commercial potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/SexCinema.htm |title=Sex and The Cinema |date=15 August 2005 |last=Epstein |first=Edward Jay |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some movie critics{{who|date=July 2011}} view gratuitous nudity (that which is not necessary for the plot) negatively. Various actors have refused to appear on film in the nude, citing either their personal morals or the risk to their reputations and careers. Since the 2000s, many American films have included actors and actresses in nude or partially nude roles.

== European cinema since 1929 ==
Europeans were more relaxed about nudity in film than the United States. European films exhibited in the United States were not subject to the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]], though some did create controversy. The 1931 Greek film ''[[Daphnis and Chloe (film)|Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Orestis Laskos]] featured the first nude scene in a European fiction film, showing Chloe bathing in a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Babis, Aktsoglou (c. 2003): [http://www.filmfestival.gr/tributes/2003-2004/cinemythology/uk/film1.html ''CineMythology: Greek Myths in World Cinema''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720020321/http://www.filmfestival.gr/tributes/2003-2004/cinemythology/uk/film1.html |date=20 July 2014 }}, a catalogue published within the frame of the Cultural Olympiad 2001-2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustav Machatý]]'s ''[[Ecstasy (film)|Extase]]'' (1933) with Hedy Lamarr was condemned by [[Pope Pius XI]]. It was very controversial on its release in the United States and is credited with contributing to the repressive regime under the Hays Code.

[[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'' (1938), which was produced as Nazi propaganda and a documentary of the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, has an opening sequence noted for its idealized, non-exploitive use of male and female nudity. Another film from Germany, ''[[Liane, Jungle Goddess]]'' (1956), featured [[Marion Michael]] as a topless female variant on the Tarzan legend.

[[Alessandro Blasetti]]'s ''[[La cena delle beffe (film)|La cena delle beffe]]'' (''Dinner of fun'', 1941) had [[Clara Calamai]] in what is credited as being the first topless scene in an Italian film. It was soon followed by similar scenes in the Italian films ''[[La corona di ferro]]'' (''The Iron Crown'', 1941) and ''[[Carmela]]'' (1942). Other noteworthy European films which contained nudity include Italian film ''[[Era lui... sì! sì!]]'' (1951, with then-15 year old [[Sophia Loren]] in a harem scene), two of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s Swedish films ''Hamnstad'' (''[[Port of Call (1948 film)|Port of Call]]'', 1948) and ''[[Summer with Monika]]'' (1953), [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]'s French film ''[[Bob le flambeur]]'' (''Bob the Gambler'', 1956, with [[Isabelle Corey]], then-age 16), [[François Truffaut]]'s ''[[Shoot the Piano Player]]'' (1960), ''[[The Awful Dr. Orloff]]'' (1961), a French-Spanish horror film by [[Jesús Franco]], [[Brigitte Bardot]]'s casual nude scenes in ''[[Contempt (film)|Contempt]]'' (1963) by [[Jean-Luc Godard]], the French film ''The Game Is Over'' (1966, with [[Jane Fonda]]), [[Luis Buñuel]]'s ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'' (1967, with [[Catherine Deneuve]]) and ''[[Isadora]]'' (1968, with [[Vanessa Redgrave]]).

Makers of the British film ''[[The Pleasure Girls]]'' (1965) shot an alternate version of a party scene with brief nudity that only appears in the export print. The 1966 British-Italian film ''[[Blowup]]'' became the first mainstream English-language film to show a woman's pubic hair, although the particular shot was only a few seconds long. (Some sources, such as ''Playboy'''s ''History of Sex in Cinema'' series, have stated that the pubic hair exposure was unintended).

Two Swedish films from 1967, ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' and ''[[Inga (film)|Inga]]'', were ground-breaking—and famous—for showing explicit sex and nudity. Both were initially banned in the U.S. and were rated X when they were shown in 1968. ''I Am Curious (Yellow)'' was banned in Massachusetts, more on the basis of the sexuality than the nudity, and was the subject of prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] - ''Karalexis v. Byrne'', 306 F. Supp. 1363 (D. Mass. 1969), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States (''Byrne v. Karalexis'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/396/976/case.html 396 U.S. 976 (1969)] and [http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/216/case.html 401 U.S. 216 (1971)].&lt;/ref&gt; The film was held not to be obscene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/31 I Am Curious / Jag är nyfiken | Film International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a surge in nudity in film in the United Kingdom after 1960. The gritty social drama ''[[This Sporting Life]]'' (1963) was among the first to include glimpses of male nudity. [[Judy Geeson]]'s uninhibited nude swim in ''[[Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (film)|Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush]]'' (1967) created a stir at the time. The surreal student protest film ''[[If....]]'' (1968) was notorious and controversial for its frontal male nudity (excised by censors), female nudity, sex, violence and homosexuality. [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'' (1969) was especially controversial for showing frontal male nudity in a wrestling scene between [[Oliver Reed]] and [[Alan Bates]]. [[Glenda Jackson]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in that film, the first performer to win for a role that included nude scenes.

There was also a long line of [[Sex comedy#British sex comedy|sex comedies]], beginning with ''[[Mary Had a Little...]]'' (1961), which were more intended to display nudity than sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;McGillivray, David: ''Doing Rude Things: The History of the British Sex Film 1957-1981'', Sun Tavern Fields Books, 1992. {{ISBN|9780951701225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other British sex comedies included ''[[What's Good for the Goose]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1400998,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Oo-er missus |first=Jacques |last=Peretti |date=29 January 2005 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There apparently are two versions of the film, one being an uncensored version (105 minutes vs. the censored 98-minute version), which shows nudity from [[Sally Geeson]] (Judy's sister); this version was released in continental Europe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Other films include ''[[Percy (1971 film)|Percy]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Percy's Progress]]'', as well as the ''[[Carry On films|Carry On]]'' series, which added nudity to its saucy [[Seaside postcard#British seaside postcards|seaside postcard]] [[innuendo]]. Series producer [[Peter Rogers]] saw the [[George Segal]] movie ''[[Loving (1970 film)|Loving]]'' (1970) and added his two favorite words to the title, making ''[[Carry On Loving]]'' the twentieth in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mr. Carry On: The Life and Work of Peter Rogers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1UdAQAAIAAJ|first1=Morris|last1=Bright|first2=Robert|last2=Ross|publisher=BBC|year=2000|isbn=9780563551836}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''[[Carry On Girls]]'', based around a [[Miss World]]-style beauty contest. Next in the series was ''[[Carry On Dick]]'', with more risque humour and [[Sid James]] and [[Barbara Windsor]]'s on- and off-screen lovemaking.&lt;ref&gt;Behind the scenes of Carry Ons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0228157|Cor, Blimey!}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the [[science fiction]] comedy ''[[Zeta One]]'' (1969) with [[Yutte Stensgaard]] and biographical films such as ''[[Savage Messiah (1972 film)|Savage Messiah]]'' (1972) which contained a long nude scene with [[Helen Mirren]].

Traditionally conservative [[Hammer Film Productions]] introduced nudity into their line of horror and fantasy films starting with ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970), ''[[Countess Dracula]]'' (1971), both featuring [[Ingrid Pitt]], ''[[When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth]]'' (1970) with [[Victoria Vetri]], ''[[Lust for a Vampire]]'' (1971), ''[[Twins of Evil]]'' (1971), et al.

The ''[[Commedia sexy all'italiana]]'' genre of Italian film of the 1970s and early 1980s featured abundant female nudity in a clichéd form, most of it for the local market, but some for the international market. The Italian-produced ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (1973), directed by [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], was one of the first commercial films to openly contain nudity, and led to the boom of other fashion erotic films, such as the French-produced ''[[Emmanuelle (film)|Emmanuelle]]'' (1974) and the Franco-German production ''[[Story of O (film)|Story of O]]'' (1975) by [[Just Jaeckin]], the Franco-Japanese production ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976) by Nagisa Oshima, and the Italian-American produced ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'' (1979) by Tinto Brass.

The films of [[Catherine Breillat]], a French filmmaker, are well known for containing explicit nudity. Her film ''[[Une vraie jeune fille]]'' (1975) contains close-ups of actress [[Charlotte Alexandra]]'s breasts and vulva and actor [[Bruno Balp]]'s erect penis, some of which are particularly graphic in nature (including a sequence where an actor attempts to insert an earthworm into Alexandra's vagina). This resulted in the film not officially being released until 1999. Other actresses who have appeared in explicit full-frontal nude scenes in Breillat's films include Caroline Ducey in ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (1999) and [[Roxane Mesquida]] in ''[[Sex Is Comedy]]'' (2002). [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s film ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'' (2003) included extensive full frontal nude scenes, male and female, and graphic sex scenes.
[[File:Gloria Guida in Quella età maliziosa.jpg|thumb|Italian actress [[Gloria Guida]], one of the ''Commedia sexy''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s icons, in ''[[That Malicious Age]]'' (1975)]]

European attitudes towards depictions of nudity tend to be relatively relaxed and there are few taboos around it. Showing of full frontal nudity in movies, even by major actors, is common and it is not considered damaging to the actors' careers. In recent years explicit unsimulated sexual intercourse occurs in movies which target the general movie-going audience, albeit those usually labeled 'arthouse' product; for example, [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s ''[[9 Songs]]'' and [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[The Idiots]]''.

The Italian film ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' (1976), a.k.a. ''Novecento'', includes an explicit scene of the actors [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Gérard Depardieu]], who are shown on either side of the actress [[Stefania Casini]] as their penises are briefly fondled and masturbated by her.

They then compare the lengths of their penises, and attempt to retract their foreskins, during which one of them becomes fully erect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms27.html|title=Sex in Films: 1970s -  History of Sex in Cinema: The Greatest and Most Influential Sexual Films and Scenes (Illustrated)|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish documentary ''[[Steam of Life]]'' about men in saunas shows nudity throughout the film.

In the Dutch movie ''[[All Stars 2: Old Stars]]'' the main characters stay in a nudist campsite. Much full frontal nudity is displayed, but not of any of the main characters.

The French film ''[[Stranger by the Lake]]'' (2013) is set on a male nude beach, showing much male full frontal nudity.

Although there has been a gradual relaxation of attitudes towards nudity, changes in laws can lead to more stringent criteria. One prominent case involved ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'' (1971) which includes numerous scenes of full frontal nudity featuring 17-year-old [[Jenny Agutter]] which did not pose a problem when submitted to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) in 1971 and later in 1998, since the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]] permitted the distribution and possession of indecent images of people over the age of 16; however, the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] raised the age threshold to 18 which meant the actress' age was a factor when the film was re-submitted in 2011. The BBFC reviewed the scenes in regards to the law and deemed them to not be "indecent" and passed the film uncut. Had this not been the case, the film would have been refused classification and it would have effectively made it illegal to possess a copy of the film, including copies that had been purchased legally at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Walkabout (1971) |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/walkabout-1999 |accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary trends in Western cinema ==

Over the years, nudity in film was a source of scandal and provocation; but its presence today is treated largely naturally, frequently with nudity being shown in scenes that naturally require it, such as those that take place in nature or in the bathroom or in [[sex in film|love scenes]]. For example, ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' (1980) shows the awakening of the sexual instinct in two shipwrecked young cousins – one male, one female – on a tropical island where nudity is a natural part of the environment in which they find themselves. The relationship between a painter and his model, who traditionally poses in the nude, is the context of a number of films. In ''[[La Belle Noiseuse]]'' ("The Beautiful Liar", 1991) the painter's model motivates him again after a period of lack of inspiration of the artist. Similarly, in ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997) [[Kate Winslet]] poses nude for [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kate-winslet-nude-titanic-portrait-3410954 |title=Kate Winslet: Nude Titanic portrait still haunts me and I always refuse to autograph a copy of it |first=Warren |last=Manger |date=13 April 2014 |access-date=16 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror]] |publisher=MGN Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films show the close relationship between film and the traditional [[art nude]] in art in films such as ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988), where [[Uma Thurman]] poses as Botticelli's ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', and ''[[Goya in Bordeaux]]'' (1999), where [[Maribel Verdú]] poses as Goya's ''[[La maja desnuda|The Naked Maja]]''. Another scenario for nudity in film involves scenes with a [[Nude swimming|nude swim]], also called skinny-dipping, such as [[Kelly Brook]] and [[Riley Steele]] in ''[[Piranha 3D]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://metro.co.uk/2010/08/02/kelly-brooks-naked-lesbian-sex-scene-in-piranha-3d-revealed-in-raunchy-pic-467146/ |title=Kelly Brook’s naked Piranha 3D scene revealed |first=Ann |last=Lee |date=2 August 2010 |access-date=16 October 2018 |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toplessness]] in film is regarded by some as partial nudity, such as [[Halle Berry]] in ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/story-behind-halle-berrys-infamous-onscreen-topless-scene/news-story/4073b3b8a3fa926b7339a2788d6e57aa |title=Story behind Halle Berry’s infamous on-screen topless scene |first=Meghan |last=O'Keefe |date=16 July 2018 |access-date=16 October 2018 |work=[[News.com.au]] |publisher=News Pty Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== East Asian cinema since 1929 ==
Female nudity has been fairly common in Japanese cinema since at least the 1960s when the director [[Seijun Suzuki]] included nude scenes in his yakuza exploitation films such as ''Branded to Kill'' (1967). The actress [[Reiko Ike]] headlined a number of exploitation flicks in the early 1970s: ''Girl Boss Guerilla'' (1972), ''Criminal Woman'' (1973) and ''Sex and Fury'' (1973). [[Nagisa Oshima]] directed the overtly sexual ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' in 1976 starring [[Eiko Matsuda]] and [[Tatsuya Fuji]]. The unexpurgated version of the film has never been shown in Japan, and the film negatives had to be secretly shipped out of the country to France for developing. [[Eri Ishida]] appeared naked in ''Enrai'' (1981) and ''Daburu Beddo'' (1983), before going on to mainstream success. In 1986, [[Hitomi Kuroki]] appeared nude in ''[[Keshin (film)|Keshin]]''. In the early 1990s, [[Loletta Lee]] appeared nude in a whole series of Hong Kong category III movies, e.g. ''Girls Unbutton'', ''Crazy Love'', and ''Sex and Zen 2'' with [[Shu Qi]].  ''New Love in Tokyo'' (1994) was notable for having one of the first scenes of uncensored pubic hair. 2000 saw [[Harumi Inoue]] strip down for her role in ''Freeze Me''.

Full-frontal adult male nudity (in which genitals are fully revealed) traditionally has been taboo in mainstream cinema from East Asia (and for actors of East Asian origin living outside East Asia), in sharp contrast to the situation in mainland Europe, but similar to the US. However, two rare early examples of a challenge to this taboo occurred: first, in the early years of cinema in mainland China, in the black-and-white silent film ''[[The Big Road]]'' (1934), directed by radical 1930's Chinese film director [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]], which features the full-frontal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatchn.com/travels/3416.shtml "Sinic Youth: Chinese Films Both Modern and Old Capture the Generation Gap - The Big Road (1934)"].

''The Chinese Mirror''. Retrieved 12 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; a scene described as "very advanced for the time".&lt;ref name=RetroReview/&gt; Another example of nudity (but with simulated genitals) in East Asian cinema is the Japanese film ''[[Hanzo the Razor]]'' (1972). It is the first part of a trilogy, depicting Officer Hanzo Itami's foiling of a plot by corrupt officials in Edo period Japan. Simulated male and female genitals are shown in various scenes. There are also scenes showing Hanzo using sexually aggressive tactics in order to extract secrets from women who associated with Hanzo's suspects.

However, a number of films from the early 1990s onwards have begun to lift this taboo. Among them are: the notable frequent full-frontal nudity of Hong Kong Chinese females and the brief but particularly notable full-frontal adult male nudity of a Hong Kong Chinese male actor, Chung Lin, who plays the robot version of Japanese scientist Ryuichi Yamamoto, in the 1991 Hong Kong science fiction/comedy film ''[[Robotrix]]'' (perhaps the first time in Hong Kong cinema that a Chinese adult male's genitals have been fully revealed on camera in a film on general release); the full-frontal male and female nudity of young Hong Kong Chinese actor [[Tony Leung Ka-fai]] and young British actress [[Jane March]] in the French/Vietnamese film ''[[The Lover (film)|The Lover]]'' (1992); the brief view of the genitals of Hong Kong Chinese actor [[Mark Cheng]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omgblog.com/2015/06/omg-hes-naked-actor-mark-cheng.php/#axzz4d2wINJAp|title=OMG, he’s naked: Actor Mark Cheng|work=OMGBlog.com|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=April 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he walks around a room fully naked in the Hong Kong movie ''[[Raped by an Angel]]'' (1993); the full-frontal appearance of Hong Kong Chinese actor [[Michael Lam]], who was the lead in the Hong Kong/Singapore film, ''[[Bugis Street (film)|Bugis Street]]'' (1995), as his clothes and underwear are torn off by his lover, fully exposing his genitals; a variety of East Asian actors whose genitals are shown in ''[[The Pillow Book (film)|The Pillow Book]]'' (1996); of Hong Kong Chinese lead actor [[Sunny Chan]] in a bathroom scene as he enters a shower, fully revealing his genitals for a few moments, in the Hong Kong film ''[[Hold You Tight (film)|Hold You Tight]]'' (1997), directed by Hong Kong film director [[Stanley Kwan]]; of mainland China lead actor [[Wang Hongwei]] in the mainland China film ''[[Xiao Wu]]'' (English title: ''The Pickpocket'', 1998),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nitrateonline.com/1999/fsiff99-2.html "25th Seattle International Film Festival - Xiao Wu"].

== Animation ==
{{see also|Adult animation}}

In animated films in the U.S., nudity is limited. Only a few mainstream animated films like ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'' (1972), ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (1973), and ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), have contained significant female full frontal nudity. 

In Japanese cinema, nudity taboos have evolved greatly since the dawn of animation, and [[anime]], the general category of animated films, includes some films with a spectrum of nudity and sexual situations. The [[Toei Animation]] films ''[[Hols: Prince of the Sun]]'' in the 1960s and ''[[Tatsu no ko Taro]]'' in the 1970s include brief full nudity of their title characters. The popularity of OVA ([[Original Video Animation]]) direct-to-video series in Japan has been a major factor in the unique blend of content in Japanese anime. Starting in the mid-1980s when [[video tape]] players became common home appliances, themes of nudity and sexual content flourished in Japanese animation with the hallmarks of many modern subgenres being established early with such films and OVA series as ''[[Lolita Anime]]'', ''[[Cream Lemon]]'' and ''[[Urotsukidōji]]''. Such sexually explicit films or those with significant nudity are referred to as [[hentai]] outside of Japan.

'''Patrick von Kalckreuth''' (1892–1970) was a leading German [[maritime painter]]. He was born Patrick Dunbar and was the son of a German naval officer. After his father’s death, his mother remarried to Richard von Kalckreuth in 1931. Richard von Kalckreuth adopted Patrick and despite being in his 30s, he changed his [[Family name|last name]]. Thus, early works of von Kalckreuth are signed under the name Patrick Dunbar whereas his paintings after 1931, are signed under the name Kalckreuth. After a brief career as a seaman, von Kalckreuth (at that time Dunbar) enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts]] in Berlin and studied with the German painter [[Hugo Schnars-Alguist]]. Von Kalckreuth lived in both Düsseldorf and Berlin, but frequently spent summers along [[North Sea|the North Sea]] in [[Cuxhaven]]. His works generally feature scenes from the North Sea, both scenes of waves crashing along beaches and ships at sea. Von Kalckreuth’s early works primarily of ships at sea are heavily influenced by Schnars-Alguist. Later in his career, he focused more on the sea itself, frequently painting beautiful seascapes highlighted by crashing waves and sunsets. Considered a master maritime painter, his paintings are displayed in several museums and galleries in Hamburg and in the North of Germany including the Historiches Museum located in [[Bremerhaven|Bremerhaven, Germany]]. Von Kalckreuth died in 1970.

In the history of [[art]], '''prehistoric art''' is all art produced in preliterate, [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] cultures beginning somewhere in very late geological history, and generally continuing until that culture either develops writing or other methods of record-keeping, or makes significant contact with another culture that has, and that makes some record of major historical events. At this point [[ancient art]] begins, for the older literate cultures. The end-date for what is covered by the term thus varies greatly between different parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;"The term "prehistoric" ceases to be valid some thousands of years B.C. in the Middle East but remains a warranted description down to about 500 A.D. in Ireland", Review by "A. T. L." of ''Prehistoric Art'' by T. G. E. Powell, ''The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland'', Vol. 97, No. 1 (1967), p. 95, [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25509644 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are the subject of some debate. It is clear that such workmanship  existed by 40,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier. In September 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the earliest known drawing by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180912" /&gt;

Engraved shells created by [[homo erectus]] dating as far back as 500,000 years ago have been found, although experts disagree on whether these engravings can be properly classified as ‘art’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429983.200-shell-art-made-300000-years-before-humans-evolved.html#.VISuEibfWnM|title=Shell 'art' made 300,000 years before humans evolved - New Scientist|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Upper Palaeolithic through to the [[Mesolithic]], [[cave painting]]s and portable art such as  [[figurine]]s and [[bead]]s predominated, with decorative figured workings also seen on some utilitarian objects. In the [[Neolithic]] evidence of early [[pottery]] appeared, as did [[sculpture]] and the construction of [[megalith]]s. Early [[rock art]] also first appeared during this period. The advent of [[metalworking]] in the [[Bronze Age]] brought additional media available for use in making art, an increase in stylistic diversity, and the creation of objects that did not have any obvious function other than art. It also saw the development in some areas of artisans, a class of people specializing in the production of art, as well as [[history of writing|early writing systems]]. By the [[Iron Age]], civilizations with writing had arisen from [[Ancient Egypt]] to [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]].

Many indigenous peoples from around the world continued to produce artistic works distinctive to their geographic area and culture, until exploration and commerce brought record-keeping methods to them.  Some cultures, notably the [[Maya civilization]], independently developed writing during the time they flourished, which was then later lost.  These cultures may be classified as prehistoric, especially if their writing systems have not been deciphered.

===Lower and Middle Paleolithic===
{{main|Art of the Middle Paleolithic}}

The earliest undisputed art originated with the [[Aurignacian]] [[archaeological culture]] in the Upper Paleolithic. However, there is some evidence that the preference for the [[aesthetic]] emerged in the [[Middle Paleolithic]], from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. Some archaeologists have interpreted certain Middle Paleolithic artifacts as early examples of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/science/14paint.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of New York City [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/preh/hd_preh.htm ''Introduction to Prehistoric Art''] Retrieved 2012-5-12&lt;/ref&gt;
The symmetry of artifacts, evidence of attention to the detail of tool shape, has led some investigators to conceive of [[Acheulean]] [[hand axe]]s and especially laurel points as having been produced with a degree of artistic expression.

Similarly, a zig-zag etching made with a shark tooth on a freshwater clam-shell around 500,000 years ago (i.e. well into the [[Lower Paleolithic]]), associated with ''[[Homo erectus]]'', was proposed as the earliest evidence of artistic activity in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joordens|first1=Josephine C. A.|last2=d’Errico|first2=Francesco|last3=Wesselingh|first3=Frank P.|last4=Munro|first4=Stephen|last5=de Vos|first5=John|last6=Wallinga|first6=Jakob|last7=Ankjærgaard|first7=Christina|last8=Reimann|first8=Tony|last9=Wijbrans|first9=Jan R.|last10=Kuiper|first10=Klaudia F.|last11=Mücher|first11=Herman J.|last12=Coqueugniot|first12=Hélène|last13=Prié|first13=Vincent|last14=Joosten|first14=Ineke|last15=van Os|first15=Bertil|last16=Schulp|first16=Anne S.|last17=Panuel|first17=Michel|last18=van der Haas|first18=Victoria|last19=Lustenhouwer|first19=Wim|last20=Reijmer|first20=John J.

There are other claims of Middle Paleolithic sculpture, dubbed the  "[[Venus of Tan-Tan]]" (before 300 kya)&lt;ref name="Chase145"&gt;[[#Chase|Chase]], pp. 145-146&lt;/ref&gt;  and the "[[Venus of Berekhat Ram]]" (250 kya). In 2002 in [[Blombos cave]], situated in [[South Africa]], stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago. This suggested to some researchers that [[Human#Paleolithic|early ''Homo sapiens'']] were capable of abstraction and production of abstract art or symbolic art. Several archaeologists including [[Richard Klein (paleoanthropologist)|Richard Klein]] are hesitant to accept the Blombos caves as the first example of actual art.

In September 2018 the discovery in South Africa of the earliest known drawing by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' was announced, which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180912" /&gt;

In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known [[Figurative art|figurative art painting]], over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of [[Lubang Jeriji Saléh]] on the [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] island of [[Borneo]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20181107-cz"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=In Cave in Borneo Jungle, Scientists Find Oldest Figurative Painting in the World - A cave drawing in Borneo is at least 40,000 years old, raising intriguing questions about creativity in ancient societies. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/science/oldest-cave-art-borneo.html |date=7 November 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20181107"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aubert, M. et al. |title=Palaeolithic cave art in Borneo |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0679-9 |date=7 November 2018 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |accessdate=8 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest undisputed works of figurative art were found in the [[Schwäbische Alb]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany. The earliest of these, the [[Venus figurine]] known as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]] and the [[Lion-man|Lion-man figurine]], date to some 40,000 years ago.
[[File:Venus of Willendorf frontview retouched 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Venus of Willendorf]]]]
Further depictional art from the Upper Palaeolithic period (broadly 40,000 to 10,000 years ago) includes [[cave painting]] (e.g., those at [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]], [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]], [[Pech Merle]], [[Caves of Arcy-sur-Cure|Arcy-sur-Cure]] and [[Lascaux]]) and [[portable art]]: Venus figurines like the [[Venus of Willendorf]], as well as animal carvings like the [[Swimming Reindeer]], [[Wolverine pendant of Les Eyzies]], and several of the objects known as [[bâtons de commandement]].

Paintings in [[Pettakere cave]] on the Indonesian island of [[Sulawesi]] are up to 40,000 years old, a similar date to the oldest European cave art, which may suggest an older common origin for this type of art, perhaps in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/08/354166930/indonesian-cave-paintings-as-old-as-europes-ancient-art|title=Indonesian Cave Paintings As Old As Europe's Ancient Art|date=8 October 2014|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monumental open-air art in Europe from this period includes the rock-art at [[Côa Valley Paleolithic Art|Côa Valley]] and [[Mazouco]] in Portugal, [[Domingo García, Segovia|Domingo García]] and [[Siega Verde]] in Spain, and {{illm|Rocher gravé de Fornols|fr}} in France.

A cave at [[Turobong cave|Turobong]] in South Korea containing human remains has been found to contain carved deer bones and depictions of deer that may be as much as 40,000 years old.&lt;ref name="Portal25"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Petroglyphs of deer or reindeer found at Sokchang-ri may also date to the Upper Paleolithic.  [[Sherd|Potsherds]] in a style reminiscent of early Japanese work have been found at Kosan-ri on [[Jeju island]], which, due to lower sea levels at the time, would have been accessible from Japan.&lt;ref name="Portal26"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest [[petroglyph]]s  are dated to approximately the Mesolithic and late [[Upper Paleolithic]] boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.
The earliest undisputed [[Rock art#Africa|African rock art]] dates back about 10,000 years. The first naturalistic paintings of humans found in Africa date back about 8,000 years apparently originating in the [[Nile River]] valley, spread as far west as Mali about 10,000 years ago.
Noted sites containing early art include [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] in southern Algeria, [[Tadrart Acacus]] in Libya (A Unesco World Heritage site), and the [[Tibesti Mountains]] in northern Chad.&lt;ref name="Coulson150"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], pp. 150–155&lt;/ref&gt; Rock carvings at the [[Wonderwerk Cave]] in South Africa have been dated to this age.&lt;ref name="Thackeray"&gt;[[#Thackeray|Thackeray]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Contentious dates as far back as 29,000 years have been obtained at a site in Tanzania.  A site at the [[Apollo 11 Cave]] complex in Namibia has been dated to 27,000 years.

[[Göbekli Tepe]] in Turkey has circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars dating back to the 10th–8th millennium BCE; the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs.

Asia was the cradle for several significant civilizations, most notably those of China and South Asia.  The prehistory of eastern Asia is especially interesting, as the relatively early introduction of writing and historical record-keeping in China has a notable impact on the immediately surrounding cultures and geographic areas.  Little of the very rich traditions of the [[art of Mesopotamia]] counts as prehistoric, as writing was introduced so early there, but neighbouring cultures such as [[Urartu]], [[Luristan]] and [[Persia]] had significant and complex artistic traditions.

===Indian sub-continent===
The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the  [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. The [[Indus Valley civilization]] produced fine small [[cylinder seal]]s and sculptures, and may have been literate, but after its collapse there are relatively few artistic remains until the literate period, probably as perishable materials were used.

===China===
[[File:Gold Mask (黄金面罩).jpg|thumb|left|Two bronze heads from [[Sanxingdui]], covered with [[gold leaf]]s]]
Prehistoric artwork such as painted pottery in [[Neolithic]] China can be traced back to the [[Yangshao culture]] and [[Longshan culture]] of the Yellow River valley. During China's [[Bronze Age]], Chinese of the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] and [[Zhou Dynasty]] produced multitudes of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], which are elaborate versions of ordinary vessels and other objects used in rituals of [[ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], decorated with ''[[taotie]]'' motifs and by the late Shang [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]].  Discoveries in 1987 in [[Sanxingdui]] in central China revealed a previously unknown pre-literate Bronze Age culture whose artefacts included spectacular very large bronze figures (example left), and which appeared culturally very different from the contemporary late Shang, which has always formed part of the account of the continuous tradition of Chinese culture.

===Japan===
{{main|Jōmon period}}
[[Image:JomonStatue.JPG|thumb|175px|A [[Jōmon]] statue]]
According to archeological evidence, the [[Jōmon]] people in ancient Japan were among the first to develop [[Jomon pottery|pottery]], dated from the [[11th millennium BCE]]. With growing sophistication, the Jōmon created patterns by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks.

===Korea===

{{See also|Prehistoric Korea|List of archaeological periods (Korea)}}
[[File:Korea-Neolithic.age-Pot-01.jpg|thumb|left|A Korean Neolithic pot found in Busan, 3500 BCE]]

The earliest examples of Korean art consist of Stone Age works dating from 3000 BCE. These mainly consist of [[Votive offering|votive sculptures]], although petroglyphs have also been recently rediscovered. [[Rock art]]s, elaborate [[stone tools]], and [[pottery|potteries]] were also prevalent.

This early period was followed by the art styles of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties. In these periods, artists often adopted Chinese style in their artworks. However, Koreans not only adopted but also modified Chinese culture with a native preference for simple elegance, purity of nature and spontaneity. This filtering of Chinese styles later influenced Japanese artistic traditions, due to cultural and geographical circumstances.

The prehistory of Korean ends with the founding of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], which are documented in the [[Samguk Sagi]], a 12th-century CE text written in [[Classical Chinese]] (the written language of the literati in traditional Korea), as beginning in the 1st century BCE; some mention of earlier history is also made in Chinese texts, like the 3rd-century CE [[Sanguo Zhi]].

====Jeulmun period====
{{further|Jeulmun pottery period}}
Clearer evidence of culture emerges in the late Neolithic, known in Korea as the [[Jeulmun pottery period]], with pottery similar to that found in the adjacent regions of China, decorated with Z-shaped patterns.  The earliest Neolithic sites with pottery remains, for example [[Osan-ri]], date to 6000–4500 BCE.&lt;ref name="Portal26"/&gt;  This pottery is characterized by comb patterning, with the pot frequently having a pointed base.  Ornaments from this time include masks made of shell, with notable finds at [[Dongsam-dong Shell Midden|Tongsam-dong]], Osan-ri, and Sinam-ri.  Hand-shaped clay figurines have been found at Nongpo-dong.&lt;ref name="Portal27"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mumun period====
{{further|Mumun pottery period}}
[[File:Korea-Bronze.age-Jinju-Pot-01.jpg|thumb|right|Large Middle Mumun (c. 800 BCE) storage vessel unearthed from a pit-house in or near [[Daepyeong]]]]
During the [[Mumun pottery period]], roughly between 1500 BCE and 300 BCE, agriculture expanded, and evidence of larger-scale political structures became apparent, as villages grew and some burials became more elaborate.  Megalithic tombs and [[dolmen]]s throughout Korea date to this time.  The pottery of the time is in a distinctive undecorated style.  Many of these changes in style may have occurred due to immigration of new peoples from the north, although this is a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="Portal29"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  At a number of sites in southern Korea there are rock art panels that are thought to date from this period, mainly for stylistic reasons.&lt;ref name="Portal33"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact date of the introduction of bronzework into Korea is also a matter of debate, it is clear that bronze was being worked by about 700 BCE.  Finds include stylistically distinctive daggers, mirrors, and belt buckles, with evidence by the 1st century BCE of a widespread, locally distinctive, bronzeworking culture.&lt;ref name="Portal34_35"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protohistoric Korea====
[[File:Goguryeo tomb mural.jpg|thumb|left|[[Goguryeo tomb mural]]]]
The time between 300 BCE and the founding and stabilization of the Three Kingdoms around 300 CE is characterized artistically and archaeologically by increasing trade with China and Japan, something that Chinese histories of the time corroborate.  The expansionist Chinese invaded and established [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] in northern Korea as early as the 1st century BCE; they were driven out by the 4th century CE.&lt;ref name="Portal38"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  The remains of some of these, especially that of [[Lelang Commandery|Lelang]], near modern [[Pyongyang]], have yielded many artifacts in a typical Han style.&lt;ref name="Portal39"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese histories also record the beginnings of iron works in Korea in the 1st century BCE.  Stoneware and [[kiln]]-fired pottery also appears to date from this time, although there is controversy over the dates.&lt;ref name="Portal40"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  Pottery of distinctly Japanese origin is found in Korea, and metalwork of Korean origin is found in northeastern China.&lt;ref name="Portal41"&gt;[[#Portal|Portal]], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steppes Art===
[[File:Placca pantera, da regione di krasnodar, kurgan chertomlyk, oro a sbalzo e cesellato, fine VII sec ac..JPG|thumb|Late 7th-century [[Scythia]]n plaque of a leopard]]
{{main|Scythian art}}
Superb samples of [[Steppes art]] - mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse - are found over a vast expanses of land stretching from [[Hungary]] to [[Mongolia]]. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BCE, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an [[animal style|animal art]], i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the [[Scythians]], at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items.

Among the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist [[Sergei Rudenko]] discovered a royal burial at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], [[Altay Mountains]], which featured - among many other important objects - the most ancient extant [[pile rug]], probably made in Persia.  Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay.  Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia.

==Near East==
[[File:Gobekli Tepe 2.jpg|thumb|Pillar from [[Göbekli Tepe]] with [[low relief]]s of what are believed to be a [[bull]], [[fox]], and [[Crane (bird)|crane]], 9600 to 8800 BCE.]]
The ''[[Ain Sakhri Lovers]]'' from modern [[Israel]], is a small [[Natufian]] carving in [[calcite]], from about 9,000 BCE.  Around the same time, the extraordinary site of [[Göbekli Tepe]] in eastern [[Turkey]] was begun. During the first phase, belonging to the [[pre-pottery Neolithic A|Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA), circles of massive but neatly shaped T-shaped stone pillars were erected – the world's oldest known [[megalith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|title=The Archaeology of Malta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107006690|page=47|language=en|last1=Sagona|first1=Claudia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical surveys]]. Each pillar has a height of up to {{convert|6|m|0|abbr=on}} and weighs up to 10 tons. They are fitted into sockets that were hewn out of the [[bedrock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Curry |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/gobekli-tepe.html |date=November 2008 |publisher=Smithsonian.com |title=Gobekli Tepe: The World’s First Temple? |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second phase, belonging to the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB), the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished [[Lime (material)|lime]]. On the smoothed surfaces of the pillars there are [[relief]]s of animals, abstract patterns, and some human figures.

By convention, prehistory in the Near East is taken to continue until the rise of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 6th century BCE, although writing existed in the region from nearly 2,000 years earlier. On that basis the very rich and long tradition of the [[art of Mesopotamia]], as well as [[Assyrian sculpture]], [[Hittite art]] and many other traditions such as the [[Luristan bronzes]] all fall under prehistoric art, even if covered with texts extolling the ruler, as many Assyrian palace reliefs are.

==Europe==

===Stone Age===
[[File:Prehistoric Hand Outline Cosquer Cave.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Hand stencil]], [[Cosquer Cave]], France, c. 27,000 years old]]
The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] includes carvings on antler and bone, especially of animals, as well as the so-called [[Venus figurines]] and [[cave paintings]], discussed above.  Despite a warmer climate, the [[Mesolithic]] period undoubtedly shows a falling-off from the heights of the preceding period.  [[Rock art]] is found in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and around the Mediterranean in [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin|eastern Spain]] and the earliest of the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]] in northern Italy, but not in between these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 75-98&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of portable art include painted pebbles from the [[Azilian]] culture which succeeded the [[Magdalenian]], and patterns on utilitarian objects, like the paddles from [[Tybrind Vig]], [[Denmark]].  The Mesolithic statues of [[Lepenski Vir]] at the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]], [[Serbia]] date to the [[7th millennium BCE]] and represent either humans or mixtures of humans and fish.  Simple pottery began to develop in various places, even in the absence of farming.

====Mesolithic====
Compared to the preceding Upper Paleolithic and the following Neolithic, there is rather less surviving art from the Mesolithic.  The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]], which probably spreads across from the Upper Paleolithic, is a widespread phenomenon, much less well known than the cave-paintings of the Upper Paleolithic, with which it makes an interesting contrast. The sites are now mostly cliff faces in the open air, and the subjects are now mostly human rather than animal, with large groups of small figures; there are 45 figures at [[Roca dels Moros]].  Clothing is shown, and scenes of dancing, fighting, hunting and food-gathering.  The figures are much smaller than the animals of Paleolithic art, and depicted much more schematically, though often in energetic poses.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, Nancy K., ''Prehistoric Art in Europe'', Penguin (Pelican, now Yale, History of Art), pp. 87-96, 1968 (nb 1st edn.)&lt;/ref&gt;  A few small engraved [[pendant]]s with suspension holes and simple engraved designs are known, some from northern Europe in [[amber]], and one from [[Starr Carr]] in Britain in [[shale]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2016/research/mesolithic-shale-pendant/ "11,000 year old pendant is earliest known Mesolithic art in Britain"], University of York&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock art in the [[Urals]] appears to show similar changes after the Paleolithic, and the wooden [[Shigir Idol]] is a rare survival of what may well have been a very common material for sculpture.  It is a plank of [[larch]] carved with geometric motifs, but topped with a human head. Now in fragments, it would apparently have been over 5 metres tall when made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.livescience.com/62404-shigir-idol-age-and-new-face.html |title=This Eerie, Human-Like Figure Is Twice As Old As Egypt's Pyramids |last=Geggel |first=Laura |work=[[Live Science]] |date=April 25, 2018 |access-date=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neolithic====

In [[Central Europe]], many [[Neolithic]] cultures, like [[Linearbandkeramic]], [[Lengyel]] and [[Vinča culture|Vinča]], produced female (rarely male) and animal statues that can be called art, and elaborate pottery decoration in, for example, the [[Želiesovce]] and painted [[Lengyel]] style.

[[Megalithic]] (i.e., large stone) monuments are found in the Neolithic Era from [[Malta]] to Portugal, through France, and across southern England to most of Wales and Ireland. They are also found in northern Germany and Poland, as well as in Egypt in the [[Sahara desert]] (at [[Nabta Playa]] and other sites). The best preserved of all temples and the oldest free standing structures are the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta]]. They start in the 5th millennium BC, though some authors speculate on Mesolithic roots. One of the best-known prehistoric sites is [[Stonehenge]], part of the [[Stonehenge World Heritage Site]] which contains hundreds of monuments and archaeological sites.  Monuments have been found throughout most of Western and Northern Europe, notably at [[Carnac]], France.
[[File:Newgrange Entrance Stone.jpg|thumb|Entrance stone with megalithic art at Newgrange]]
The large mound tomb at [[Newgrange]], Ireland, dating to around 3200 BC, has its entrance marked with a massive stone carved with a complex [[Triple spiral|design of spirals]]. The mound at nearby [[Knowth]] has large flat rocks with rock engravings on their vertical faces all around its circumference, for which various meanings have been suggested, including depictions of the local valley, and the oldest known image of the Moon. Many of these monuments were megalithic tombs, and archaeologists speculate that most have religious significance. Knowth is reputed to have approximately one third of all megalithic art in Western Europe.

In the central Alps, the [[Camunni]] made some 350,000 petroglyphs: see [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]].

===Bronze Age===
[[File:Tanumshede 2005 rock carvings 5.jpg|left|thumb|Three men performing a ritual, [[Bohuslän]], [[Sweden]]]]
During the 3rd millennium BCE, the [[Bronze Age]] began in Europe, bringing with it a new medium for art. The increased efficiency of bronze tools also meant an increase in productivity, which led to a surplus — the first step in the creation of a class of artisans. Because of the increased wealth of society, luxury goods began to be created, especially decorated weapons.

Examples include ceremonial bronze helmets, ornamental ax-heads and swords, elaborate instruments such as [[lur]]er, and other ceremonial objects without a practical purpose, such as the oversize [[Oxborough Dirk]].  Special objects were made in gold; many more gold objects have survived from Western and Central Europe than from the Iron Age, many mysterious and strange objects ranging from [[Gold lunula|lunula]]s, apparently an Irish speciality, the [[Mold Cape]] and [[Golden hat]]s. Pottery from Central Europe can be elaborately shaped and decorated. [[Rock art]], showing scenes from the religious rituals have been found in many areas, for example in [[Bohuslän]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Val Camonica]] in northern [[Italy]].

In the Mediterranean, the [[Minoan civilization]] was highly developed, with palace complexes from which sections of [[fresco]]s have been excavated.  Contemporary [[Ancient Egyptian art]] and that of other advanced Near Eastern cultures can no longer be treated as "prehistoric".

===Iron Age===
[[File:Hochdorf golden shoes ornaments.jpg|thumb|left|Gold shoe plaques from the [[Iron Age]] [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave]], Germany, {{circa|lk=no|530}}&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
{{Main|Celtic art}}

The [[Iron Age]] saw the development of anthropomorphic sculptures, such as the [[warrior of Hirschlanden]], and the statue from the [[Glauberg]], Germany. [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] artists in the early Iron Age favored geometric, abstract designs perhaps influenced by trade links with the Classical world.

The more elaborate and curvilinear [[La Tène style]] developed in Europe in the later Iron Age from a centre in the [[Rhine]] valley but it soon spread across the continent. The rich chieftain classes appear to have encouraged ostentation and Classical influences such as bronze drinking vessels attest to a new fashion for wine drinking. Communal eating and drinking were an important part of [[Celt]]ic society and culture and much of their art was often expressed through plates, knives, [[cauldron]]s and cups. [[Horse tack]] and weaponry were also decorated. Mythical animals were a common motif along with religious and natural subjects and their depiction is a mix between the naturalistic and the stylized. [[Megalithic art]] was still sometimes practiced, examples include the carved limestone pillars of the sanctuary at Entremont in modern-day France. Personal adornment included [[torc]] necklaces whilst the introduction of [[coin]]age provided a further opportunity for artistic expression.  The coins of this period are derivatives of Greek and Roman types, but showing the more exuberant Celtic artistic style.
[[File:Romano-Celtic mirror (Desborough).jpg|thumb|A 1st century BCE mirror found in [[Desborough]], England, showing the spiral and trumpet motif]]

The famous late 4th century BCE [[Waldalgesheim chariot burial]] in the [[Rhineland]] produced many fine examples of La Tène art including a bronze flagon and bronze plaques with [[repoussé]] human figures. Many pieces had curvy, organic styles though to be derived from Classical tendril patterns.

In much of western Europe elements of this artistic style can be discerned surviving in the art and architecture of the Roman colonies. In particular in Britain and Ireland there is a tenuous continuity through the Roman period, enabling Celtic motifs to resurface with new vigour in the Christian [[Insular art]] from the 6th century onwards.

The sophisticated [[Etruscan culture]] developed from the 9th to 2nd centuries, with considerable influence from the Greeks, before finally being absorbed by the Romans.  By the end of the period they had developed writing, but early [[Etruscan art]] can be called prehistoric.

==Africa==
[[Ancient Egypt]] falls outside the scope of this article; it had a close relationship with the [[Sudan]] in particular, known in this period as [[Nubia]], where there were advanced cultures from the 4th millennium BCE, such as the "[[A-Group]]", "[[C-Group]]", and the [[Kingdom of Kush]].

===Southern Africa===

[[File:San Painting, Ukalamba Drakensberge 1.JPG|left|thumb|[[San rock art|San rock painting]] of an [[Taurotragus|eland]] at [[Drakensberg]]]]
In September 2018, scientists{{who?|date=October 2018}} reported the discovery of the earliest known drawing by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'',{{where?|date=October 2018}} which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180912"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas|title=Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/science/oldest-drawing-ever-found.html |date=12 September 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=15 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


There is a significant body of rock painting in the region around [[Matobo National Park]] of Zimbabwe dating from as early as 6000 BCE to 500 CE.&lt;ref name="Coulson86"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant [[San rock art|San rock painting]]s exist in the [[Waterberg National Park|Waterberg]] area above the [[Palala River]] and around [[Drakensberg]] in South Africa, some of which are considered to derive from the period 8000 BCE.  These images are very clear and depict a variety of human and [[wildlife]] motifs, especially [[antelope]].  There appears to be a fairly continuous history of rock painting in this area; some of the art clearly dates into the 19th century.  They include depictions of horses with riders, which were not introduced to the area until the 1820s.&lt;ref name="Coulson80"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], pp. 80–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Namibia, in addition to the [[Apollo 11 Cave]] complex, has a significant array of San rock art near [[Twyfelfontein]].  This work is several thousand years old, and appears to end with the arrival of pastoral tribes in the area.&lt;ref name="UnescoTwyfel"&gt;[[#UnescoTwyfel|Unesco World Heritage designation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horn of Africa===
[[File:Laas Geel.jpg|thumb|Long-horned [[cattle]] and other [[rock art]] in the [[Laas Geel]] complex.]]
[[Laas Geel]] is a complex of [[cave]]s and [[rock shelter]]s in northwestern [[Somalia]]. Famous for their rock art, the caves are located in a rural area on the outskirts of [[Hargeisa]]. They contain some of the earliest known cave paintings in the [[Horn of Africa]], many of which depict pastoral scenes. Laas Geel's rock art is estimated to date back to somewhere between [[9th millennium BCE|9,000]]–[[8th millennium BCE|8,000]] and [[3rd millennium BCE|3,000]] [[BCE]].

In 2008, archaeologists also announced the discovery of cave paintings in Somalia's northern [[Dhambalin]] region, which the researchers suggest includes one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1000 to 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Tdodras"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mire|first=Sada|title=The Discovery of Dhambalin Rock Art Site, Somaliland|journal=African Archaeological Review|year=2008|volume=25|pages=153–168|url=http://www.mbali.info/doc494.htm|accessdate=22 June 2013|doi=10.1007/s10437-008-9032-2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627100400/http://www.mbali.info/doc494.htm|archivedate=27 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guafcpaonas"&gt;{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|title=UK archaeologist finds cave paintings at 100 new African sites|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/17/cave-paintings-found-in-somaliland|accessdate=25 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prehistoric art in the Horn region include stone [[megalith]]s and engravings, some of which are 3,500 years old. The town of Dillo in [[Ethiopia]] has a hilltop covered with stone [[stele|stelae]]. It is one of several such sites in southern Ethiopia dating from historic period{{Clarification needed|date=October 2018}} (10th-14th centuries).&lt;ref name="Coulson147"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saharan Africa===
{{See also|Saharan rock art}}
[[File:Sleeping Antelope Tin Taghirt.jpg|thumb|A [[petroglyph]]ic [[Saharan rock art|Saharan rock carving]] from southern [[Algeria]] depicting an [[antelope]] or [[gazelle]].]]
The early art of this region has been divided into five periods:

* Bubalus Period, roughly 12-8 kya
* Round Head Period, roughly 10-8 kya
* Pastoral Period, roughly 7.5-4 kya
* Horse Period, roughly 3-2 kya
* Camel Period, 2,000 years ago to the present
[[File:Libya 5041 Petroglyphs Tadrart Acacus Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rock carving of an elephant at [[Tadrart Acacus]]]]
Works of the Bubalus period span the Sahara, with the finest work, carvings of naturalistically depicted megafauna, concentrated in the central highlands.  The Round Head Period is dominated by paintings of strangely shaped human forms, and few animals, suggesting the artists were foragers.  These works are largely limited to [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] and the [[Tadrart Acacus]].  Toward the end of the period, images of domesticated animals, as well as decorative clothing and headdresses appear.  Pastoral Period art was more focused on domestic scenes, including herding and dancing.  The quality of artwork declined, as figures became more simplified.&lt;ref name="Coulson156"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], pp. 156–160&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horse Period began in the eastern Sahara and spread west.  Depictions from this period include carvings and paintings of horses, chariots, and warriors with metal weapons, although there are also frequent depictions of wildlife such as giraffes.  Humans are generally depicted in a stylized way.  Some of the chariot art bears resemblance to temple carvings from ancient [[Egypt]].  Occasionally, art panels are accompanied by [[Tifinagh]] script, still in use by the [[Berber people]] and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] today; however, modern Tuareg are generally unable to read these inscriptions.  The final Camel period features carvings and paintings in which camels predominate, but also include humans with swords, and later, guns; the art of this time is relatively crude.&lt;ref name="Coulson160_205"&gt;[[#Coulson|Coulson]], pp. 160–162,205&lt;/ref&gt;

Much Olmec art is highly stylized and uses an iconography reflective of the religious meaning of the artworks. Some Olmec art, however, is surprisingly naturalistic, displaying an accuracy of depiction of human anatomy perhaps equaled in the pre-Columbian New World only by the best Maya Classic-era art. Olmec art-forms emphasize monumental statuary and small [[jade]] carvings. A common theme is to be found in representations of a divine [[jaguar]]. [[Olmec figurine]]s were also found abundantly through their period.

These finds include rock paintings that controversially date as far back as 9500 BCE in the [[Toquepala Caves]].&lt;ref name="Lavallee94"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  Burial sites in Peru like one at Telarmachay as old as 8600-7200 BCE contained evidence of ritual burial, with red ocher and bead necklaces.&lt;ref name="Lavallee115"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest ceramics that appear in Peru may have been imported from the Validivia region; indigenous pottery production almost certainly arrived in the highlands around 1800 BCE at [[Kotosh]], and on the coast at La Florida c. 1700 BCE.  Older calabash gourd vessels with human faces burned into them were found at [[Huaca Prieta]], a site dating to 2500-2000 BCE&lt;ref name="Lavallee186"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Huaca Prieta also contained some early patterned and dyed textiles made from twisted plant fibers.&lt;ref name="Bruhns80"&gt;[[#Bruhns|Bruhns]], p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Initial Period and First Horizon=====
{{Further|Chavín culture}}
[[File:Estela.jpg|thumb|right|An image of the [[Lanzón]] deity on the great wall at [[Chavín de Huantar]], a First Horizon site]]
The Initial Period in Central Andean cultures lasted roughly from 1800 BCE to 900 BCE.  Textiles from this time found at Huaca Prieta are of astonishing complexity, including images such as crabs whose claws transform into snakes, and double-headed birds.  Many of these images are similar to [[optical illusion]]s, where which image dominates depends in part on which the viewer chooses to see.  Other portable artwork from this time includes decorated mirrors, bone and shell jewelry, and unfired clay female effigies.&lt;ref name="Stone19_20"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Public architecture, including works estimated to require the movement of more than 100,000 tons of stone, are to be found at sites like Kotosh, [[El Paraíso, Peru]], and [[La Galgada (archaeological site)]].  Kotosh, a site in the Andean highlands, is especially noted as the site of the Temple of the Crossed Hands, in which there are two reliefs of crossed forearms, one pair male, one pair female.&lt;ref name="Stone21"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Also of note is one of South America's largest ceremonial sites, [[Sechín Alto]].  This site's crowning work is a twelve-story platform, with stones incised with military themes.&lt;ref name="Stone27"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  The architecture and art of the highlands, in particular, laid down the groundwork for the rise of the [[Chavín culture]].&lt;ref name="Stone22"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chavín culture dominated the central Andes during the First Horizon, beginning around 900 BCE, and is generally divided into two stages.  The first, running until about 500 BCE, represented a significant cultural unification of the highland and coastal cultures of the time.  Imagery in all manner of art (textiles, ceramics, jewelry, and architectural) included sometimes fantastic imagery such as jaguars, snakes, and human–animal composites, much of it seemingly inspired by the jungles to the east.&lt;ref name="Stone28_29"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

The later stage of the Chavín culture is primarily represented by a significant architectural expansion of the [[Chavín de Huantar]] site around 500 BCE, accompanied by a set of stylistic changes.  This expansion included, among other changes, over forty large stone heads, whose reconstructed positions represent a transformation from human to supernatural animal visages.  Much of the other art at the complex from this time contains such supernatural imagery.&lt;ref name="Stone40"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  The portable art associated with this time included sophisticated metalworking, including alloying of metals and soldering.&lt;ref name="Stone44"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Textiles found at sites like [[Karwa]] clearly depict Chavín cultural influences,&lt;ref name="Stone46"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cupisnique]] style of pottery disseminated by the Chavín would set standards all across the region for later cultures.&lt;ref name="Stone49"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  (The vessel pictured at the top of this article, while from the later [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture, is representative of the stirrup-spouted vessels of the Chavín.)

=====Early Intermediate Period=====
{{Further|Paracas culture|Nazca culture|Moche (culture)}}
[[File:Paracas Mantle.jpg|thumb|left|A Paracas Mantle dating from 200 CE]]
The Early Intermediate Period lasted from about 200 BCE to 600 CE.  Late in the First Horizon, the Chavín culture began to decline, and other cultures, predominantly in the coastal areas, began to develop.  The earliest of these was the [[Paracas culture]], centered on the [[Paracas Peninsula]] of central Peru.  Active from 600 BCE to 175 BCE, their early work clearly shows Chavín influence, but a locally distinctive style and technique developed.  It was characterized by technical and time-consuming detail work, visually colorful, and a profusion visual elements.  Distinctive technical differences include painting on clay after firing, and embroidery on textiles.&lt;ref name="Stone50"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  One notable find is a mantle that was clearly used for training purposes; it shows obvious indications of experts doing some of the weaving, interspersed with less technically proficient trainee work.&lt;ref name="Stone58"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nazca-lineas-perro-c01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nazca lines|Nazca line]] figure known as The Dog]]
The [[Nazca culture]] of southern Peru, which is widely known for the enormous figures traced on the ground by the [[Nazca lines]] in southern Peru, shared some similarities with the Paracas culture, but techniques (and scale) differed.  The Nazca painted their ceramics with [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], and also painted their textiles.&lt;ref name="Stone67"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Nazca ceramics featured a wide variety of subjects, from the mundane to the fantastic, including utilitarian vessels and effigy figures.  The Nazca also excelled at goldsmithing, and made [[pan pipes]] from clay in a style not unlike the pipes heard in music of the Andes today.&lt;ref name="Stone74_75"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous Nazca lines are accompanied by temple-like constructions (showing no sign of permanent habitation) and open plazas that presumably had ritual purposes related to the lines.  The lines themselves are laid out on a sort of natural blackboard, where a thin layer of dark stone covers lighter stone; the lines were thus created by simply removing the top layer where desired, after using surveying techniques to lay out the design.&lt;ref name="Stone78_82"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 78–82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mochica Headress Condor.jpg|thumb|left|Gold [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] headdress representing a [[Andean condor|condor]]]]
In the north of Peru, the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture dominated during this time.  Also known as ''Mochica'' or ''Early Chimú'', this warlike culture dominated the area until about 500 CE, apparently using conquest to gain access to critical resources along the desert coast: arable land and water.  Moche art is again notably distinctive, expressive and dynamic in a way that many other Andean cultures were not.  Knowledge of the period has been notably expanded by finds like the pristine royal tombs at [[Sipán]].&lt;ref name="Stone83"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moche very obviously absorbed some elements of the Chavín culture, but also absorbed ideas from smaller nearby cultures that they assimilated, such as the [[Recuay culture]] and the Vicús.&lt;ref name="Stone88"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  They made fully sculpted ceramic animal figures, worked gold, and wove textiles.  The art often featured everyday images, but seemingly always with a ritual intent.&lt;ref name="Stone86"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In its later years, the Moche came under the influence of the expanding [[Huari culture|Huari]] empire.  The Cerro Blanco site of [[Huaca del Sol]] appears to have been the Moche capital.  Largely destroyed by natural events around 600 CE, it was further damaged by Spanish conquistadors searching for gold, and continues with modern looters.&lt;ref name="Stone92"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Middle Horizon=====
[[File:Tiwanaku1.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Ponce monolith in the sunken courtyard of the Tiwanaku's Kalasasaya temple]]
The Middle Horizon lasted from 600 CE to 1000 CE, and was dominated by two cultures: the [[Huari culture|Huari]] and the [[Tiwanaku]].  The Tiwanaku (also spelled ''Tiahuanaco'') culture arose near [[Lake Titicaca]] (on the modern border between Peru and [[Bolivia]]), while the Wari culture arose in the southern highlands of Peru.  Both cultures appear to have been influenced by the [[Pukara culture]], which was active during the Early Intermediate in between the primary centers of the Wari and Tiwanaku.&lt;ref name="Stone121_123"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;  These cultures both had wide-ranging influence, and shared some common features in their portable art, but their monumental arts were somewhat distinctive.&lt;ref name="Stone119"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The monumental art of the Tiwanaku demonstrated technical prowess in stonework, including fine detailed reliefs, and monoliths such as the Ponce monolith (photo to the left), and the Sun Gate, both in the main Tiwanaku site.  The portable art featured "portrait vessels", with figured heads on ceramic vessels, as well as natural imagery like jaguars and raptors.&lt;ref name="Stone131_134"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 131–134&lt;/ref&gt;  A full range of materials, from ceramics to textiles to wood, bone, and shell, were used in creative endeavours.  Textiles with a weave of 300 [[thread count|threads per inch]] (80 threads per cm) have been found at Tiwanaku sites.&lt;ref name="Stone136"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piquillacta view4.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The ruins of [[Pikillacta]], a [[Huari culture|Wari]] site]]
The Wari dominated an area from central Peru to Ecuador, with their main center near [[Ayacucho, Peru]].  Their art is distinguished from the Tiwanaku style by the use of bolder colors and patterns.&lt;ref name="Stone138_139"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable among Wari finds are tapestry garments, presumed to be made for priests or rulers to wear, often bearing abstract geometric designs of significant complexity, but also bearing images of animals and figures.&lt;ref name="Stone146_148"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 146–148&lt;/ref&gt;  Wari ceramics, also of high technical quality, are similar in many ways to those of the preceding cultures, where local influences from fallen cultures, like the Moche, are still somewhat evident.  Metalwork, while rarely found due to its desirability by looters, shows elegant simplicity and, once more, a high level of workmanship.&lt;ref name="Stone149_150"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Late Intermediate Period=====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Vasoslambayeque.jpg|right|thumb|Lambayeque (Sicán) metalworks from the [[Larco Museum]] in Lima, Peru.]] --&gt;
Following the decline of the Wari and Tiwanaku, the northern and central coastal areas were somewhat dominated by the [[Chimú culture]], which included notable subcultures like the [[Sican Culture|Lambayeque (or Sicán)]] and [[Chancay culture|Chancay]] cultures.  To the south, coastal cultures dominated in the [[Ica region]], and there was a significant cultural crossroads at [[Pachacamac]], near Lima.&lt;ref name="Stone151"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  These cultures would dominate from about 1000 CE until the 1460s and 1470s, as the [[Inca Empire]] began to take shape and eventually absorbed the geographically smaller nearby cultures.

'''Chimú and Sicán Cultures'''
[[File:Sican funerary mask in the Metropolitan Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Sicán]] funerary mask, [[Metropolitan Museum]]]]
{{Further|Chimú culture|Sican Culture}}

The [[Chimú culture]] in particular was responsible for an extremely large number of artworks.  Its capital city, [[Chan Chan]], appears to have contained building that appeared to function as museums—they seem to have been used for displaying and preserving artwork.  Much of the artwork from Chan Chan in particular has been looted, some by the Spanish after the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]].&lt;ref name="Stone151"/&gt;  The art from this time at times displays amazing complexity, with "multimedia" works that require artists working together in a diversity of media, including materials believed to have come from as far away as Central America.  Items of increasing splendor or value were produced, apparently as the society became increasing stratified.&lt;ref name="Stone153"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same, the quality of some of the work declined, as demand for pieces pushed production rates up and values down.&lt;ref name="Stone154"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicán culture flourished from 700 CE to about 1400 CE, although it came under political domination of the Chimú around 1100 CE, at which time many of its artists may have moved to Chan Chan.  There was significant copperworking by the Sicán, including what seems to be a sort of currency based on copper objects that look like axes.&lt;ref name="Stone156"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;
Artwork includes burial masks, beakers and metal vessels that previous cultures traditionally made of clay.  The metalwork of the Sicán was particularly sophisticated, with innovations including [[repoussé]] and shell inlay.  Sheet metal was also often used to cover other works.&lt;ref name="Stone156_158"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 156–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent in Sicán iconography is the Sicán deity, which appears on all manner of work, from the portable to the monumental.  Other imagery includes geometric and wave patterns, as well as scenes of fishing and shell diving.&lt;ref name="Stone160"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chancay culture'''
[[Chancay culture]], before it was subsumed by the Chimú, did not feature notable monumental art.  Ceramics and textiles were made, but the quality and skill level was uneven.  Ceramics are generally black on white, and often suffer from flaws like poor firing, and drips of the slip used for color; however, fine examples exist.  Textiles are overall of a higher quality, including the use of painted weaves and tapestry techniques, and were produced in large quantities.&lt;ref name="Stone175_177"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], pp. 175–177&lt;/ref&gt;  The color palette of the Chancay was not overly bold: golds, browns, white, and scarlet predominate.&lt;ref name="Stone179"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pachacamac'''
[[Pachacamac]] is a temple site south of [[Lima, Peru]] that was an important pilgrimage center into Spanish colonial times.  The site boasts temple constructions from several periods, culminating in Inca constructions that are still in relatively good condition.  The temples were painted with murals depicting plants and animals.  The main temple contained a carved wooden sculpture akin to a [[totem pole]].&lt;ref name="Stone179"/&gt;

'''Ica culture'''
The [[Ica region]], which had been dominated by the Nazca, was fragmented into several smaller political and culture groups.  The pottery produced in this region was of the highest quality at the time, and its aesthetics would be adopted by the Inca when they conquered the area.&lt;ref name="Stone180"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Late Horizon and Inca culture=====
{{Further|Inca architecture}}
[[File:Cuzco1860.jpg|thumb|An 1860 map of [[Cusco]].  The [[Cougar|puma]] shape is discernible, with the head at the upper left and the tail at the lower right.]]
[[File:CuscoPiedra12angulo.jpg|thumb|The ''twelve angle stone'', in the Hatum Rumiyoc street of [[Cusco]], is an example of Inca masonry.]]
This time period represents the era in which the culture of the central Andes is almost completely dominated by the [[Inca Empire]], which began its expansion in 1438.  It lasted until the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] in 1533.  The Inca absorbed much technical skill from the cultures they conquered, and disseminated it, along with standard shapes and patterns, throughout their area of influence, which extended from [[Quito, Ecuador]] to [[Santiago, Chile]].  Inca stonework is notably proficient; giant stones are set so tightly without mortar that a knife blade will not fit in the gap.&lt;ref name="Stone181"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the Inca's monumental structures deliberately echoed the natural environment around them; this is particularly evident in some of the structures at [[Machu Picchu]].&lt;ref name="Stone190"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inca laid the city of [[Cusco]] in the shape of a [[puma (animal)|puma]], with the head of the puma at [[Sacsayhuaman]],&lt;ref name="Stone194"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; a shape that is still discernible in aerial photographs of the city today.

The iconography of Inca art, while clearly drawing from its many predecessors, is still recognizably Inca.  Bronzework owes a clear debt to the Chimú, as do a number of cultural traditions: the finest goods were reserved to the rulers, who wore the finest textiles, and ate and drank from gold and silver vessels.&lt;ref name="Stone186"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Inca metalwork was relatively rare, and an obvious source of plunder for the conquering Spanish.

[[File:Tupa-inca-tunic.png|160px|thumb|right|An Inca period tunic]]
Textiles were widely prized within the empire, in part as they were somewhat more portable in the far-flung empire.&lt;ref name="Stone209"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramics were made in large quantities, and, as with other media, in standardized shapes and patterns.  One common shape is the ''urpu'', a distinctive urn shape that came in a wide variety of standard capacities, much as modern storage containers do.&lt;ref name="Stone215"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of this standardization, many local areas retained some distinctive aspects of their culture in the works they produced; ceramics produced in areas under significant Chimú control prior to the Inca rule still retain characteristics indicative of that style.&lt;ref name="Stone216"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Spanish conquest, the art of the central Andes was significantly affected by the conflict and diseases brought by the Spanish.  Early colonial period art, began to show influences of both Christianity and Inca religious and artistic ideas, and eventually also began to encompass new techniques brought by the conquerors, including oil painting on canvas.&lt;ref name="Stone217"&gt;[[#Stone|Stone-Miller]], p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early ceramics in northern South America====
{{See also|Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Indigenous ceramics of the Americas}}
The earliest evidence of decorated pottery in South America is to be found in two places.  A variety of sites in the Santarém region of [[Brazil]] contain ceramic sherds dating to a period between 5000 and 3000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Lavallee182"/&gt;  Sites in [[Colombia]], at [[Monsú, Colombia|Monsú]] and [[San Jacinto, Colombia|San Jacinto]] contained pottery finds in different styles, and date as far back as 3500 BCE.&lt;ref name="Bruhns116"/&gt;  This is an area of active research and subject to change.&lt;ref name="Lavallee176"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], pp. 176–182&lt;/ref&gt;   The ceramics were decorated with curvilinear incisions.  Another ancient [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|site at Puerto Hormiga]] in the [[Bolívar Department]] of [[Colombia]] dating to 3100 BCE contained pottery fragments that included figured animals in a style related to later Barrancoid cultural finds in Colombia and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="Bruhns116"&gt;[[#Bruhns|Bruhns]], pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Valdivia, Ecuador]] also has a site dated to roughly 3100 BCE containing decorated fragments, as well as figurines, many represent nude females.  The Valdivian style stretched as far south as northern Peru,&lt;ref name="Bruhns117"&gt;[[#Bruhns|Bruhns]], pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; and may, according to Lavallée, yet yield older artifacts.&lt;ref name="Lavallee182"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- to be continued: traditions from 1800 BCE to Spanish/Portuguese arrival:
 succeeding Puerto Hormiga: Canapote and Barlovento (to 1000 BCE), Malambo (to 0 CE)
 succeeding Valdivia: Machalilla (to 1100 BCE)
--&gt;

By 2000 BCE, pottery was evident in eastern Venezuela.  The La Gruta style, often painted in red or white, included incised animal figures in the ceramic, as well as ceramic vessels shaped as animal effigies.  The Rancho Peludo style of western Venezuela featured relatively simple textile-type decorations and incisions.&lt;ref name="Bruhns117"/&gt;  Finds in the central Andes dating to 1800 BCE and later appear to be derived from the Valdivian tradition of Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Bruhns119"&gt;[[#Bruhns|Bruhns]], p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- to be continued: traditions in this geography from 1800 BCE to Spanish/Portuguese arrival --&gt;

====Early art in eastern South America====
{{See also|Indigenous peoples in Brazil}}
Relatively little is known about the early settlement of much of South America east of the Andes.  This is due to the lack of stone (generally required for leaving durable artifacts), and a [[jungle]] environment that rapidly recycles organic materials.  Beyond the Andean regions, where the inhabitants were more clearly related to the early cultures of Peru, early finds are generally limited to coastal areas and those areas where there are stone outcrops.  While there is evidence of human habitation in northern Brazil as early as 8000 BCE,&lt;ref name="Lavallee113"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; and rock art of unknown (or at best uncertain) age,  ceramics appear to be the earliest artistic artifacts. The Mina civilization of Brazil (3000–1600 BCE) had simple round vessels with a red wash, that were stylistic predecessors to later Bahia and Guyanan cultures.&lt;ref name="Bruhns117"/&gt;
&lt;!-- to be continued: Periperi (Bahia) and Alaka (Guyana) --&gt;

====Southern South America====
The southern reaches of South America show evidence of human habitation as far back as 10,000 BCE.  A site at [[Arroio do Fosseis]] on the pampa in southern Brazil has shown reliable evidence to that time,&lt;ref name="Lavallee108"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the southern tip of the continent has been occupied since 7000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Lavallee112"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;  Artistic finds are scarce; in some parts of Patagonia ceramics were never made, only being introduced by contact with Europeans.&lt;ref name="Lavallee187"&gt;[[#Lavallee|Lavallée]], p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- to be continued: earliest finds are not nonexistent --&gt;

==Native arts of Oceania==

===Australia===
{{see also|Indigenous Australian art}}
[[File:Yankee Hat art-MJC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Australian Aboriginals|Aboriginal]] rock painting at [[Namadgi National Park]]]]
From earliest times, the natives of Australia, often known as [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigines]], have been creating distinctive patterns of art. Much of Aboriginal art is transitory, drawn in sand or on the human body to illustrate a place, an animal totem, or a tribal story. Early surviving artworks of the Aborigines are mostly rock paintings. Many are called [[X-ray]] paintings because they show the bones and organs of the animals they depict. Some Aboriginal art seems [[abstract art|abstract]] to modern viewers; Aboriginal art often employs geometrical figures and lines to represent landscape, which is often shown from a birds-eye view. For instance, in Aboriginal [[symbol]]ism, a swirl stands for a watering hole.

[[File:Bradshaw rock paintings.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Bradshaw rock paintings]] found in the north-west [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]]]]
The [[Bradshaw rock paintings]] are a style of rock art found in Western Australia.  They are predominantly human figures drawn in fine detail with accurate anatomical proportioning.  They are usually dated to be around 17,000 years old, and there have been suggestions they are as much as 70,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/bradshaws|title=The Bradshaw Paintings - Australian Rock Art Archive|author=Bradshaw Foundation|work=Bradshaw Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sydney rock engravings]] are also prominent rock art sites in the country.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowdler|first=Sandra|title=Balls Head: the excavation of a Port Jackson rock shelter.

===Polynesia===
The natives of [[Polynesia]] have a distinct artistic heritage. While many of their artifacts were made with organic materials and thus lost to history, some of their most striking achievements survive in clay and stone. Among these are numerous pottery fragments from western [[Oceania]], from the late 2nd millennium BCE. Also, the natives of Polynesia left scattered around their islands [[Petroglyph]]s, stone platforms or [[Marae]], and sculptures of [[ancestor figure]]s, the most famous of which are the [[Moai]] of [[Easter Island]].

'''Pseudo-Kufic''', or '''Kufesque''', also sometimes '''Pseudo-Arabic''', is a style of decoration used during the [[Middle Ages]] or the [[Renaissance]], consisting of imitations of the [[Arabic]] [[Kufic]] script, or sometimes Arabic cursive script, made in a non-Arabic context: "Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration".&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"&gt;Mack, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-Kufic appears especially often in [[Renaissance art]] in depictions of people from the [[Holy Land]], particularly the [[Virgin Mary]]. It is an example of [[Islamic influences on Western art]].

[[British Museum]].]]
Some of the first imitations of the Kufic script go back to the 8th century when the English King [[Offa]] (r. 757–796) produced gold coins imitating Islamic [[dinars]]. These coins were copies of an [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] dinar struck in 774 by Caliph [[Al-Mansur]], with "Offa Rex" centred on the reverse. It is clear that the moneyer had no understanding of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as the Arabic text contains many errors. The coin may have been produced in order to trade with [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]; or it may be part of the annual payment of 365 [[mancus]]es that Offa promised to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TGkz9NGFXIMC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=manqush+coin#PPA330,M1 ''Medieval European Coinage'' by Philip Grierson p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Medieval southern [[Italy]] (in merchant cities such as [[Amalfi]] and [[Salerno]]) from the mid-10th century, imitations of Arabic coins, called [[tarì]], were widespread but only used illegible pseudo-Kufic script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pePPvGkGZDQC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=kharruba+coin&amp;lr= Cardini, p.26]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CQfub3l_ejkC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=Tar%C3%AC+Arabic#PPA240,M1 Matthew, p.240]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples are known of the incorporation of Kufic script and Islamic-inspired colourful diamond-shaped designs such as a 13th French [[Limoges enamel]] [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]] at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Museum]] exhibit&lt;/ref&gt; The band in pseudo-Kufic script "was a recurrent ornamental feature in [[Limoges]] and had long been adopted in [[Aquitaine]]".&lt;ref name="Louvre"&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;bmLocale=en Louvre museum notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615183547/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2011-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance painting==

[[File:Paolo Veneziano 1354 La Vierge et l Enfant detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pseudo-Kufic mantle hem, in [[Paolo Veneziano]]'s ''Virgin Mary and Child'', 1358. [[Louvre Museum]].]]

The script is further divided by [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]s like those on [[Mamluk]] dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.65-66&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Numerous instances of pseudo-Kufic are known from European art from around the 10th to the 15th century. Pseudo-Kufic inscriptions were often used as decorative bands in the architecture of [[Byzantine]] [[Greece]] from the mid 11th century to mid-12th century, and in decorative bands around religious scenes in French and German wall paintings from the mid-12th to mid-13th century, as well as in contemporary manuscript illuminations.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudo-Kufic would also be used as writing or as decorative elements in textiles, religious [[halos]] or frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/spotlight/beautiful-gibberish-fake-arabic-in-medieval-and-renaissance-art|title=Beautiful Gibberish: Fake Arabic in Medieval and Renaissance Art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are visible in the paintings of [[Giotto]] (c. 1267 – 1337).&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"/&gt;

From 1300 to 1600, according to Rosamond Mack, the Italian imitations of Arabic script tend to rely on cursive Arabic rather than Kufic, and therefore should better be designated by the more generalist term of "Pseudo-Arabic".&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"/&gt; The habit of representing gilt halos decorated with pseudo-Kufic script seems to have disappeared in 1350, but was revived around 1420 with the work of painters such as [[Gentile da Fabriano]], who was probably responding to artistic influence in [[Florence]], or [[Masaccio]], who was influenced by Gentile, although his own script was "jagged and clumsy", as well as [[Giovanni Francesco Toscani|Giovanni Toscani]] or [[Fra Angelico]], in a more [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.64-66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 037.jpg|thumb|upright|Pseudo-Arabic on the Christ Child's blanket. [[Gentile da Fabriano]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
[[File:Fra Angelico 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Virgin with a [[Gothic art|Gothicizing]] pseudo-Arabic halo, by [[Fra Angelico]] (1428–1430).]]
[[File:Central panel - Pala di San Zeno by Andrea Mantegna - San Zeno - Verona 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|The Virgin Mary in [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]] combines pseudo-Arabic halos and garment hems, with a Turkish carpet at her feet (1456–1459).]]

From around 1450, northern Italian artists also started to incorporate pseudo-Islamic decorative devices in their paintings. [[Francesco Squarcione]] started the trend in 1455, and he was soon followed by his main pupil, [[Andrea Mantegna]]. In the 1456–1459 [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]], Mantegna combines pseudo-Islamic script in halos and garment hems ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 025.jpg|see detail]]), to depiction of [[Mamluk]] book-bindings in the hand of San Zeno ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 023.jpg|see detail]]), and even to a Turkish carpet at the feet of the Virgin Mary ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 028.jpg|see detail]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic or pseudo-Arabic in Medieval or early Renaissance painting is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13-14th century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them:&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.52, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; "In Renaissance art, pseudo-Kufic script was used to decorate the costumes of [[Old Testament]] heroes like David".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tsiIvJ16AU0C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Pseudo-Kufic&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=en Freider. p.84]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason might be that artist wished to express a cultural universality for the Christian faith, by blending together various written languages, at a time when the church had strong international ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;"Perhaps they marked the imagery of a universal faith, an artistic intention consistent with the Church's contemporary international program." Mack, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudo-Hebrew is also sometimes seen,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; as in the [[mosaic]] at the back of the [[abse]] in [[Marco Marziale]]'s ''Circumcision'', which does not use actual Hebrew characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/largeImage?workNumber=NG803&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work National Gallery, image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507202827/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/largeImage?workNumber=NG803&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work |date=2009-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was especially common in German works.

Finally pseudo-Arabic elements became rare after the second decade of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.71"&gt;Mack, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosamond Mack: "The Eastern scripts, garments, and halos disappeared when the Italians viewed the Early Christian era in an antique [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] context."&lt;ref name="Mack, p.71"/&gt;

[[File:Locke Essay 1690.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first edition of ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' by John Locke, 1689.]]
[[File:Emma Hamilton...Stipple engraving, 1789. Wellcome L0075392.jpg|thumb|[[Emma Hamilton]] as ''Sensibility''. Stipple engraving, 1789, after a painting by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wellcomeimages.org/indexplus/image/L0075392.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Sensibility''' refers to an acute [[perception]] of or responsiveness toward something, such as the [[emotion]]s of another.  This concept emerged in eighteenth-century Britain, and was closely associated with studies of [[sense perception]] as the means through which knowledge is gathered. It also became associated with [[sentimentality|sentimental]] [[moral philosophy]].

==Origins==
One of the first of such texts would be [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), where he says, "I conceive that Ideas in the Understanding, are coeval with Sensation; which is such an Impression or Motion, made in some part of the Body, as makes it be taken notice of in the Understanding."&lt;ref&gt;J. Locke, An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding (London, 1690), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Cheyne (physician)|George Cheyne]] and other medical writers wrote of "The English Malady," also called "[[hysteria]]" in women or "[[hypochondria]]" in men, a condition with symptoms that closely resemble the modern diagnosis of [[clinical depression]]. Cheyne considered this malady to be the result of over-taxed nerves.  At the same time, theorists asserted that individuals who had ultra-sensitive nerves would have keener senses, and thus be more aware of beauty and moral truth. Thus, while it was considered a physical and/or emotional fragility, sensibility was also widely perceived as a virtue.

==In literature==
Originating in philosophical and scientific writings, sensibility became an English-language literary movement, particularly in the then-new genre of the novel. Such works, called sentimental novels, featured individuals who were prone to sensibility, often weeping, fainting, feeling weak, or having fits in reaction to an emotionally moving experience. If one were especially sensible, one might react this way to scenes or objects that appear insignificant to others. This reactivity was considered an indication of a sensible person's ability to perceive something intellectually or emotionally stirring in the world around them. However, the popular sentimental genre soon met with a strong backlash, as anti-sensibility readers and writers contended that such extreme behavior was mere histrionics, and such an emphasis on one's own feelings and reactions a sign of [[narcissism]]. [[Samuel Johnson]], in his portrait of Miss Gentle, articulated this criticism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
She daily exercises her benevolence by pitying every misfortune that happens to every family within her circle of notice; she is in hourly terrors lest one should catch cold in the rain, and another be frighted by the high wind. Her charity she shews by lamenting that so many poor wretches should languish in the streets, and by wondering what the great can think on that they do so little good with such large estates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel. ''[[The Idler (1758–1760)|The Idler]]'', No. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
Objections to sensibility emerged on other fronts.  For one, some conservative thinkers believed in ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' concepts, that is, knowledge that exists independent of experience, such as innate knowledge believed to be imparted by God.  Theorists of the ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' distrusted sensibility because of its over-reliance on experience for knowledge.  Also, in the last decades of the eighteenth century, anti-sensibility thinkers often associated the emotional volatility of sensibility with the exuberant violence of the French Revolution, and in response to fears of revolution coming to Britain, sensible figures were coded as anti-patriotic or even politically subversive.  [[Maria Edgeworth]]'s ''[[Leonora (novel)|Leonora]],'' for example, depicts the "sensible" Olivia as a villainess who contrives her passions or at least bends them to suit her selfish wants; the text also makes a point to say that Olivia has lived in France and thus adopted "French" manners.  [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' provides a more familiar example of this reaction against the excesses of feeling, especially those associated with women readers, and many critics have seen the novel as a critique of the "cult" of sentimentalism prevalent in the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sensibility: An introduction|last = Todd|first = Janet|publisher = Methuen|year = 1986|isbn = 9780416377200|location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effusive nature of many sentimental heroes, such as Harley in [[Henry Mackenzie]]'s ''[[The Man of Feeling]],'' was often decried by contemporary critics as celebrating a weak, effeminate character, which ultimately contributed to a discrediting of previously popular sentimental novels (and to a lesser extent, ''all'' novels) as unmanly works. This concern coincided with a marked rise in the production of novels by women writers of the period, whether they chose to write in a sentimental mode or not, and played a significant role in larger debates about gender, genre, literary value, and nationalist political aims during the last decade of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth, when the "National Tale" emerged in the wake of the French Revolution and England's ongoing conflict—and highly fraught Union—with Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Equivocal Beings: Politics, Gender, and Sentimentality in the 1790s--Wollstonecraft, Radcliffe, Burney, Austen.|last = Johnson|first = Claudia|publisher = Chicago UP|year = 1995|isbn = 978-0226401843|location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bardic Nationalism: The Romantic Novel and the British Empire|last = Trumpener|first = Katie|publisher = Princeton UP|year = 1997|isbn = 978-0691044804|location = Princeton|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}
'''Stylistics''', a branch of [[applied linguistics]], is the study and interpretation of texts of all types and/or spoken language in regard to their linguistic and tonal [[style (sociolinguistics)|style]], where style is the particular [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of language used by different individuals and/or in different situations or settings. For example, the [[vernacular]], or everyday language may be used among casual friends, whereas more formal language, with respect to [[grammar]], [[accent (sociolinguistics)|pronunciation or accent]], and [[lexicon]] or choice of words, is often used in a cover letter and resumé and while speaking during a job interview. 

As a discipline, stylistics link [[literary criticism]] to [[linguistics]]. It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own, and it can be applied to an understanding of [[literature]] and [[journalism]] as well as [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H.G. 1975. Stylistics and the teaching of literature. Longman: London.  {{ISBN|0-582-55076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Paul. 2004. Stylistics : A resource book for students. Routledge p. 2: "Stylistics is a method of textual interpretation in which primacy of place is assigned to language".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/7604758/Rape_is_rape_except_when_it_s_not_the_media_recontextualisation_and_violence_against_women Attenborough, F. (2014) 'Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women', Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict, 2(2): 183-203.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts, and from [[advertising]] copy to [[news]],&lt;ref&gt;Davies, M.

Stylistics: A resource book for students. Routledge p. 3: "The preferred object of study in stylistics is literature, whether that be institutionally sanctioned 'literature' as high art or more popular 'non-canonical' forms of writing.".&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, as recent work in critical stylistics,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L.

(2014) Jokes, pranks, blondes and banter: recontextualising sexism in the British print press, Journal of Gender Studies, 23(2): 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt; has made clear, non-literary texts may be of just as much interest to stylisticians as literary ones. Literariness, in other words, is here conceived as 'a point on a cline rather than as an absolute'.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, L., McIntyre, D. (2010) Stylistics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R., Nash, W. (1990) Seeing through Language: a guide to styles of English writing. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language, such as in the literary production and reception of [[genre]], the study of [[folk art]], in the study of spoken [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], and can be applied to areas such as [[discourse analysis]] as well as [[literary criticism]].

Common features of style include the use of [[dialogue]], including regional [[accent (dialect)|accents]] and individual [[dialects]] (or [[ideolects]]), the distribution of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] lengths, the use of particular language registers, and so on. In addition, stylistics is a distinctive term that may be used to determine the connections between the form and effects within a particular variety of language. Therefore, stylistics looks at what is 'going on' within the language; what the linguistic associations are that the style of language reveals.

==Early twentieth century==
The analysis of literary style goes back to the study of [[rhetoric|classical rhetoric]], though modern stylistics has its roots in [[Russian Formalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Jeffries, Daniel McIntyre, ''Stylistics'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p 1. {{ISBN|0-521-72869-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the related [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague School]] of the early twentieth century.

In 1909, [[Charles Bally]]'s ''Traité de stylistique française'' had proposed stylistics as a distinct academic discipline to complement [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics. For Bally, Saussure's linguistics by itself couldn't fully describe the language of personal expression.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot J. Taylor, ''Mutual Misunderstanding: Scepticism and the Theorizing of Language and Interpretation'', Duke University Press, 1992, p 91. {{ISBN|0-8223-1249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bally's programme fitted well with the aims of the Prague School.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon, ''Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties'', Walter de Gruyter, 1989, p 518. {{ISBN|0-89925-356-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking forward the ideas of the Russian Formalists, the Prague School built on the concept of ''[[foregrounding]]'', where it is assumed that poetic language is considered to stand apart from non-literary background language, by means of ''deviation'' (from the norms of everyday language) or ''[[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Wales, ''A Dictionary of Stylistics'', Pearson Education, 2001, p 315. {{ISBN|0-582-31737-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prague School, however, this background language isn't constant, and the relationship between poetic and everyday language is therefore always shifting.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Pope, ''The English Studies Book: an Introduction to Language, Literature and Culture'', Routledge, 2002, p 88. {{ISBN|0-415-25710-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late twentieth century==
[[Roman Jakobson]] had been an active member of the Russian Formalists and the Prague School, before emigrating to America in the 1940s. He brought together Russian Formalism and American [[New Criticism]] in his ''Closing Statement'' at a conference on stylistics at [[Indiana University]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bradford, ''A Linguistic History of English Poetry'', Routledge, 1993, p 8. {{ISBN|0-415-07057-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published as ''Linguistics and Poetics'' in 1960, Jakobson's lecture is often credited with being the first coherent formulation of stylistics, and his argument was that the study of poetic language should be a sub-branch of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Coupland, ''Style: Language Variation and Identity'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p 10. {{ISBN|0-521-85303-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''poetic function'' was one of six general [[Jakobson's functions of language|functions of language]] he described in the lecture.

[[Michael Halliday]] is an important figure in the development of British stylistics.&lt;ref&gt;Raman Selden, ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism: From Formalism to Poststructuralism'', Cambridge University Press, 1989, p83. {{ISBN|0-521-30013-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1971 study ''Linguistic Function and Literary Style: An Inquiry into the Language of William Golding's '''The Inheritors''''' is a key essay.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Simpson, ''Stylistics: a Resource Book for Students'', Routledge, 2004, p75. {{ISBN|0-415-28104-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Halliday's contributions has been the use of the term [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] to explain the connections between language and its context.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Halliday register is distinct from [[dialect]]. Dialect refers to the habitual language of a particular user in a specific geographical or social context. Register describes the choices made by the user,&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Coupland, ''Style: Language Variation and Identity'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p 12. {{ISBN|0-521-85303-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; choices which depend on three variables: ''field'' ("what the participants... are actually engaged in doing", for instance, discussing a specific subject or topic),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Butler, ''Structure and Function: a Guide to Three Major Structural-Functional Theories'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2003, p 373. {{ISBN|1-58811-361-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[tenor (linguistics)|tenor]]'' (who is taking part in the exchange) and ''mode'' (the use to which the language is being put).

Fowler comments that different fields produce different language, most obviously at the level of [[vocabulary]] (Fowler. 1996, 192) The linguist [[David Crystal]] points out that Halliday's 'tenor' stands as a roughly equivalent term for 'style', which is a more specific alternative used by linguists to avoid ambiguity (Crystal. 1985, 292). Halliday's third category, ''mode'', is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the [[genre]] of the text (Downes. 1998, 316). Halliday refers to genre as pre-coded language, language that has not simply been used before, but that predetermines the selection of textual meanings. The linguist [[William Downes (linguist)|William Downes]] makes the point that the principal characteristic of register, no matter how peculiar or diverse, is that it is obvious and immediately recognisable (Downes. 1998, 309).

==Literary stylistics==
In ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'', Crystal observes that, in practice, most stylistic analysis has attempted to deal with the complex and 'valued' language within literature, i.e. 'literary stylistics'. He goes on to say that in such examination the scope is sometimes narrowed to concentrate on the more striking features of [[literary language]], for instance, its 'deviant' and abnormal features, rather than the broader structures that are found in whole texts or discourses. For example, the compact language of poetry is more likely to reveal the secrets of its construction to the [[stylistician]] than is the language of plays and novels (Crystal. 1987, 71).

===Poetry===
As well as conventional styles of language there are the unconventional – the most obvious of which is [[poetry]]. In ''Practical Stylistics'', [[Henry Widdowson|HG Widdowson]] examines the traditional form of the [[epitaph]], as found on headstones in a cemetery. For example:&lt;br&gt;
:His memory is dear today
:As in the hour he passed away.
:(Ernest C. Draper 'Ern'. Died 4.1.38)
:(Widdowson. 1992, 6)

Widdowson makes the point that such sentiments are usually not very interesting and suggests that they may even be dismissed as 'crude verbal carvings' and crude verbal disturbance (Widdowson, 3). Nevertheless, Widdowson recognises that they are a very real attempt to convey feelings of human loss and preserve affectionate recollections of a beloved friend or family member. However, what may be seen as poetic in this language is not so much in the formulaic [[phraseology]] but in where it appears. The verse may be given undue reverence precisely because of the sombre situation in which it is placed. Widdowson suggests that, unlike words set in stone in a graveyard, poetry is unorthodox language that vibrates with inter-textual implications (Widdowson. 1992, 4).

Two problems with a stylistic analysis of poetry are noted by [[PM Wetherill]] in ''Literary Text: An Examination of Critical Methods''. The first is that there may be an over-preoccupation with one particular feature that may well minimise the significance of others that are equally important (Wetherill. 1974, 133). The second is that any attempt to see a text as simply a collection of stylistic elements will tend to ignore other ways whereby meaning is produced (Wetherill. 1974, 133).

===Implicature===
In '[[Poetic Effects]]' from ''Literary Pragmatics'', the [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Adrian Pilkington]] analyses the idea of '[[implicature]]', as instigated in the previous work of [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Deirdre Wilson]]. Implicature may be divided into two categories: 'strong' and 'weak' implicature, yet between the two extremes there are a variety of other alternatives. The strongest implicature is what is emphatically implied by the speaker or writer, while weaker implicatures are the wider possibilities of meaning that the hearer or reader may conclude.

Pilkington's '[[poetic effects]]', as he terms the concept, are those that achieve most relevance through a wide array of weak implicatures and not those meanings that are simply 'read in' by the hearer or reader. Yet the distinguishing instant at which weak implicatures and the hearer or reader's conjecture of meaning diverge remains highly subjective. As Pilkington says: 'there is no clear cut-off point between assumptions which the speaker certainly endorses and assumptions derived purely on the hearer's responsibility.' (Pilkington. 1991, 53) In addition, the stylistic qualities of poetry can be seen as an accompaniment to Pilkington's poetic effects in understanding a poem's meaning.

===Tense===
Widdowson points out that in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]" (1798), the mystery of the Mariner's abrupt appearance is sustained by an idiosyncratic use of tense. (Widdowson. 1992, 40) For instance, the Mariner 'holds' the wedding-guest with his 'skinny hand' in the [[present tense]], but releases it in the [[past tense]] ('...his hands dropt he.'); only to hold him again, this time with his 'glittering eye', in the present (Widdowson. 1992, 41).

===The point of poetry===
Widdowson notices that when the content of poetry is summarised, it often refers to very general and unimpressive observations, such as 'nature is beautiful; love is great; life is lonely; time passes', and so on (Widdowson. 1992, 9). But to say:&lt;br&gt;
:Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
:So do our minutes hasten to their end ...
:William Shakespeare, '60'.
Or, indeed:&lt;br&gt;
:Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
:Nor hours, days months, which are the rags of time ...
:[[John Donne]], '[[The Sun Rising]]', ''Poems'' (1633)
This language gives the reader a new perspective on familiar themes and allows us to look at them without the personal or social conditioning that we unconsciously associate with them (Widdowson. 1992, 9). So, although the reader may still use the same exhausted words and vague terms like 'love', 'heart' and 'soul' to refer to human experience, to place these words in a new and refreshing context allows the poet the ability to represent humanity and communicate honestly. This, in part, is stylistics, and this, according to Widdowson, is the point of poetry (Widdowson. 1992, 76).

'''Sylvia Beach''' (March 14, 1887 – October 5, 1962), born '''Nancy Woodbridge Beach''', was an American-born bookseller and  publisher who lived most of her life in [[Paris]], where she was one of the leading [[expatriate]] figures between [[World War I]] and [[World War II|II]].{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}

She is known for her Paris bookstore, [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], where she published [[James Joyce]]'s controversial book, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), and encouraged the publication and sold copies of Hemingway's first book, ''[[Three Stories and Ten Poems]]'' (1923).

==Early life==
Beach was born in her father's [[parsonage]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], United States, on March 14, 1887, the second of three daughters of Sylvester Beach and Eleanor Thomazine Orbison. She had an older sister, Holly, and a younger sister, Cyprian.&lt;ref&gt;1900 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; Although named Nancy after her grandmother Orbison, she later decided to change her name to Sylvia.  Her maternal grandparents were missionaries to India, and her father, a Presbyterian minister, was descended from several generations of clergymen.  When the girls were young the family lived in Baltimore and in [[Bridgeton, New Jersey]]. Then in 1901, the family moved to France upon Sylvester Beach's appointment as assistant minister of the [[American Church in Paris]] and director of the American student center.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Beach spent the years 1902-1905 in Paris, returning to New Jersey in 1906 when her father became minister of the First Presbyterian Church of Princeton.  Beach made several return trips to Europe, lived for two years in Spain, and worked for the Balkan Commission of the Red Cross.  During the last years of the Great War, she was drawn back to Paris to study contemporary French literature.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

==Shakespeare and Company==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:James Joyce with Sylvia Beach at Shakespeare &amp; Co Paris 1920.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Joyce]] photographed with Sylvia Beach and [[Adrienne Monnier]] at [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]] in Paris in c. 1920.]] --&gt;
While conducting some research at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], Beach found the name of a lending library and bookshop, ''La Maison des Amis des Livres''&lt;ref&gt;"The House of the Friends of Books"&lt;/ref&gt; at 7 [[rue de l'Odéon]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|Paris VI]], in a French literary journal.{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} There she was warmly welcomed by the owner who, to her surprise, was a plump fair-haired young woman, [[Adrienne Monnier]]. Monnier was wearing a garment that looked like a cross between a peasant’s dress and a nun’s habit, "with a long full skirt … and a sort of tight-fitting velvet waistcoat over a white [[silk blouse]]. She was in gray and white like her bookshop."{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} Although Beach was dressed in a Spanish cloak and hat, Monnier knew immediately that she was American.  At that first meeting Monnier declared, "I like America very much".{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} Beach replied that she liked France very much. They later became lovers and lived together for 36 years&lt;ref name=andre/&gt; until Monnier’s suicide in 1955.

Beach immediately became a member of Monnier’s lending library, and when in Paris she regularly attended the readings by authors such as [[André Gide]],  [[Paul Valéry]] and [[Jules Romains]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Inspired by the literary life of the [[Left Bank]] and by Monnier’s efforts to promote innovative writing, Beach dreamed of starting a branch of Monnier’s book shop in New York that would offer contemporary French works to American readers.  Since her only capital was US$3,000 which her mother gave her from her savings, Beach could not afford such a venture in New York.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} However, Paris rents were much cheaper and the exchange rates favorable, so with Monnier’s help, Beach opened an English language bookstore and lending library that she named [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]]. Four years beforehand, Monnier had been among the first women in France to found her own bookstore. Beach's bookstore was located at 8 rue Dupuytren, Paris VI.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}
[[File:12 Rue Odéon, Paris May 2014.jpg|thumb|150px|left|12 Rue Odéon, Paris VI, location of the original Shakespeare &amp; Co., with memorial plaque on the right]]
[[File:Paris Rue de l Odeon 12 plaque retouched.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque, at 12 Rue Odéon, Paris VI mentioning that " In July 1920, Beach met Irish writer [[James Joyce]] at a dinner party hosted by French poet [[André Spire]]. Soon after, Joyce joined Beach's lending library.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, "When Paris Sizzled," p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce had been trying, unsuccessfully, to publish his manuscript for his masterpiece, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulyssess]]'' and Beach, seeing his frustration, offered to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, 'When Paris Sizzled," p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Sylvia Beach published James Joyce's Ulysses in this apartment."]]
Shakespeare and Company quickly attracted both French and American readers - including a number of aspiring writers to whom Beach offered hospitality and encouragement as well as books.  As the [[franc]] dropped in value and the favorable exchange rate attracted a huge influx of Americans, Beach’s shop flourished and soon needed more space.  In May 1921, Shakespeare and Company moved to 12 [[rue de l'Odéon]], just across the street from Monnier’s ''Maison des Amis des Livres''.  Shakespeare and Company gained considerable fame after it published [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in 1922, as a result of Joyce's inability to get an edition out in English-speaking countries.{{sfnp|Fitch|1983|pp=12-13}}{{sfnp|Griffin|1992|p=3}} Beach would later be financially stranded when Joyce signed on with another publisher, leaving Beach in debt after bankrolling, and suffering severe losses from, the publication of ''Ulysses''.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Shakespeare and Company experienced difficulty throughout the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but remained supported by wealthy friends, including [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]].  In 1936 when Beach thought that she would be forced to close her shop, André Gide organized a group of writers into a club called Friends of Shakespeare and Company.  Subscribers paid 200 francs a year to attend readings at Shakespeare and Company.  Although subscriptions were limited to a select group of 200 people (the maximum number the store could accommodate), the renown of the French and American authors participating in readings during those two years attracted considerable attention to the store.  Beach recalled that by then, "we were so glorious with all these famous writers and all the press we received that we began to do very well in business".{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp = 210-211}} [[Violette Leduc]] describes meeting her and the ambiance of the shop in her autobiography ''La Bâtarde''.{{sfnp|Leduc|Coltman|2003|p=TBA}} Shakespeare and Company remained open after the [[Fall of Paris#A new German offensive and the fall of Paris|Fall of Paris]], but by the end of 1941, Beach was forced to close.{{sfnp|Glass|2009|pp = 24–27}}
She was interned for six months during [[World War II]] at [[Vittel]] until [[Tudor Wilkinson]] managed to secure her release in February 1942. Beach kept her books hidden in a vacant apartment upstairs at 12 rue de l'Odeon. [[Ernest Hemingway]] symbolically "liberated" the shop in person in 1944,{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=219-220}} but it never re-opened for business.

In 1956, Beach wrote ''Shakespeare and Company'', a memoir of the inter-war years that details the cultural life of Paris at the time.  The book contains first-hand observations of [[James Joyce]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Valery Larbaud]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[André Gide]], [[Leon-Paul Fargue]], [[George Antheil]], [[Robert McAlmon]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Stephen Benet]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Harry Crosby]], [[Mary Phelps Jacob|Caresse Crosby]], [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], [[Berenice Abbott]], [[Man Ray]], and many others.

After Monnier's suicide in 1955, Beach had a relationship with [[Camilla Steinbrugge]].{{sfnp|Monnier|McDougall|1996| p=529}}&lt;ref name=andre/&gt; Although Beach's income was modest during the last years of her life, she was widely honored for her publication of ''Ulysses'' and her support of aspiring writers during the 1920s. She remained in Paris until her death in 1962, and was buried in [[Princeton Cemetery]]. Her papers are archived at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name=andre&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biob2/beac2.html|title=Sylvia Beach|date=May 4, 2003|accessdate=2010-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820084635/http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biob2/beac2.html|archivedate=August 20, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[George Whitman]] opened a new bookshop in 1951 at a different location in Paris (in the [[rue de la Bûcherie]]) originally called ''Le Mistral'', but renamed Shakespeare and Company in 1964 in honor of the late Sylvia Beach.{{sfnp|Sharkey|2002|}} Since his death in 2011, it has been run by his daughter [[Sylvia Beach Whitman]], named after Beach.{{sfnp|Lennan|2014}}

'''''The Punishment of Lust''''' ({{lang-it|La Punizione della Lussuria}}), also called '''''The Punishment of Luxury''''', is an 1891 oil painting on canvas by the artist [[Giovanni Segantini]].

==Background==
Giovanni Segantini was born in the [[County of Tyrol]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], but his parents died when he was still young and he went to live with his step-sister Irene in [[Milan]]. Hoping that she and Giovanni could become Italian citizens, Irene revoked their Austrian citizenship, but for some reason failed to apply for Italian citizenship, leaving the pair stateless. Giovanni soon ran away and after a time living on the streets was sent to a reformatory, where he was encouraged to take up art.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segantini-museum.ch/en/giovanni-segantini/biography.html|title=Segantini Museum : Biography|work=segantini-museum.ch|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1873, his half-brother Napoleon took him in and put him to work in his photographic studio. He worked as a decorative artist and studied at [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera]] in Milan and had some success as a painter, but eventually grew tired of the strictures of the academy and relocated with his family to [[Brianza]] in the foothills of the [[Alps]] where he adopted a more naturalistic approach, capturing the landscapes and daily lives of the workers.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

A visit from the art dealer and critic Vittore Grubicy, who had discovered and promoted Segantini, around the end of 1886 or beginning of 1887 with news of the latest developments in painting sparked Segantini's interest in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Divisionism]]; from that point on he began to produce more [[Allegory|allegorical]] studies, often set in the bleak, snowy, clearly lit landscapes of the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicodimgallery.com/exhibitions/the-punishment-of-lust-and-luxury|title=The Punishment of Lust and Luxury|work=nicodimgallery.com|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Segantini painted ''The Punishment of Lust'' in 1891; it was an early entry in a thematic series on ''cattive madri'' (bad mothers) that he produced between 1891 and 1896 (the ''Nirvana'' cycle). Taking its inspiration from ''Nirvana'' published in 1889 – supposedly a translation from the 12th-century Indian [[Panghiavahli of Maironpada]] by the librettist [[Luigi Illica]] but probably written by him or translated from an intermediate work –&lt;ref name=LaL&gt;{{cite book | author = Cheney, Liana De Girolami | date=2010 | chapter = Giovanni Segantini's Nirvana Series: Symbols of ''Luxuria'' and ''Vanitas'' [Ch. 24] | editor = Neginsky, Rosina | title=Symbolism, Its Origins and Its Consequences | pages = 426–454, esp. 438 | location = Newcastle upon Tyne | publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7WwnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA438| access-date=12 May 2016| isbn=9781443824521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it shows women being punished for preferring a life of ease over a life of duty by being suspended among the barren landscape of the Alps.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.aspx?id=30|title=Artwork highlights – The Punishment of Lust, also known as The Punishment of Luxury, 1891, by Giovanni Segantini (1858–1899)|work=liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segantini had been raised a Catholic and believed strongly that the role of a woman was to be a mother; the ''Nirvana'' cycle illustrates the outcome for women who failed in that role and contrasts with Segantini's ''Angel'' cycle, produced over the same period, that depicts the reward derived from being a good mother.&lt;ref name=LaL/&gt; Segantini's longing for the mother who had died when he was a child coupled with his resentment at losing her may be reflected in this dichotomous approach to the theme of motherhood.&lt;ref name=LaL/&gt;

The women in ''The Punishment of Lust'' are suggested to have aborted or lost their children, and although this would have been a sin in Segantini's eyes, he has still treated them sympathetically and, as the poem ''Nirvana'' does, hints that they could be redeemed; they are suspended in a dream-like state and, though stark, the landscape is not unpleasant –  Segantini regarded the mountains as his spiritual home – and the inclusion of withered trees symbolises a possible return to life in a new spring.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

==History==
The painting was purchased by the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]] in 1893, but before it was exhibited it was retitled ''The Punishment of Luxury'' (''Luxury'' being an archaic translation of the Italian ''lussuria'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-punishment-of-lust/ZgFteROYPN6p9A?hl=en|title=The Punishment of Lust – Giovanni Segantini – Google Cultural Institute|work=google.com|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the mention of "Lust" was thought to be too challenging for a Victorian public.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

The British band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] named their 13th studio album ''[[The Punishment of Luxury (album)]]'' as a play on the title of Segantini's canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2018/03/08/for-four-decades-omd-has-cast-wary-eye-toward-future/WdZAsvOdUSajWGuncGwFHP/story.html | title = For four decades, OMD has cast a wary eye toward the future | date = 8 March 2018 | accessdate = 10 July 2018 | publisher = ''The Boston Globe'' | author = Maura Johnston }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Teniers the Younger - modello for Theatrum Pictorium 1673.jpg|thumb|Modello for the frontispiece for the ''Theatrum Pictorium'', by Teniers]]
'''''Theatrum Pictorium''''', or ''Theatre of Painting'', is a short-hand name of a book published in the 1660s by [[David Teniers the Younger]] for his employer, the [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]]. It was a catalog of 243 Italian paintings in the Archduke's collection of over 1300 paintings, with engravings of the paintings taken from small models that Teniers had personally prepared. A second edition with page numbers was published in 1673.

During the years 1646-1656  Leopold Wilhelm was governor of the Netherlands and formed one of the greatest art collections of his age. Teniers effectively became its curator after the death of his predecessor [[Jan van den Hoecke]] in 1651. Leopold Wilhelm’s collection came to hold works by [[Hans Holbein the Elder]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Raphael]], [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]] and more than 15 works by [[Titian]]. Teniers made a list of the painters in the collection as part of the forward to his 1673 catalog:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Theatrum Pictorium gri 33125009347911 0012.jpg
File:Theatrum Pictorium gri 33125009347911 0013.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This list is an important document that reflects the contemporary taste in paintings in Brussels at that time. Of all the painters, the names [[Magdalena Woutiers]] and [[Madonna Fitta de Milano]] are the only women whose work is documented as being in the Archduke's collection. No matter how illustrious the name however, only works by the better known Italian painters were chosen to be engraved for illustrations. At the end of his governorship, the Archduke and his collection moved to the [[Stallburg]]. This archducal collection now forms the heart of Vienna’s [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]].

Before moving to Vienna in 1659, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm formed his art collection in [[Brussels]], where [[David Teniers the Younger]] painted views of the most prized possessions of his Brussels gallery. He painted several of these in various compositions which are now spread among various collections:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/en/visit/collections/picture-gallery/history-of-the-collection/ History of the collections] of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Teniers employed a team of 12 engravers for reproducing the 243 paintings in the Theatrum. He produced small copies in oil of each of the chosen paintings, issuing these as models to his engravers and 120 of which were auctioned by the estate of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7BU-36sK16MC&amp;pg=PA130 Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-century European Paintings in the Robert Lehman Collection: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain and Great Britain], by [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Charles Sterling&lt;/ref&gt; Teniers’ painted copies measuring approximately 17 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm are now spread among various collections. The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] Gallery holds 14 of these works, the largest group in any public collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codart.com/exhibitions/details/1139/ David Teniers and the Theatre of Painting, 19 October 2006 – 21 January 2007] exhibition press release on [[codart]]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 12 engravers, the five who contributed most were [[Jan van Troyen]] with 56, [[Lucas Vorsterman the Younger]] with 52, [[Pieter van Lisebetten]] 40, [[Theodoor van Kessel]] 27, and [[Coryn Boel|Coryn]] or Quirin Boel 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2007/04/vegelin.html History of the project] on website for ''Historians of Netherlandish Art''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Popels]] contributed five engravings.

==Surviving works==
The works listed in the book that survive are generally in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, while the modelli or small models for the engravings have been lost or are in other collections. The engravings and the modelli were inscribed with the dimensions of the original paintings, though their characteristics were often adjusted to take advantage of the maximum illustration possibilities of the album page size. The dimensions were in the form "4 alta 3 lata", which means 4 palm-widths high and 3 palm-widths wide, such as the case with the engraving after [[Francesco Bassano the Younger|Bassano's]] ''Boy with a Flute'':

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7488">The '''Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts''' consists of more than 22,000 pamphlets, broadsides, manuscripts, books, and news sheets, most of which were printed and distributed in [[London]] from 1640 to 1661. The collection represents a major [[primary source]] for the political, religious, military, and [[social history of England]] during the final years of the reign of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[English Civil War]], the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], and the [[English Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. It is now held in the [[British Library]].

== Compilation of the collection ==
Bookseller and publisher [[George Thomason]] (died 1666), who maintained a shop in the churchyard of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London, methodically collected and preserved the works over two decades. The tracts consist of a broad range of writings, including sermons, songs, political speeches, debates, opinions, jokes, gossip, news reports, descriptions of the trial and execution of Charles I, accounts of Civil War battles, reports from Parliament, and several regularly appearing publications that historians consider the forebears of modern newspapers. Thomason's collection represents approximately 80 percent of the published works released in England during this period.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=868}}{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

Thomason frequently made handwritten annotations on the tracts, providing such information as publication dates and the authorship of anonymous works. During the turbulent years of the Civil War and [[the Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] Thomason reputedly moved the collection several times to protect the more controversial works from destruction by government or opposition censors.{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

== History of the collection ==
Thomason appears to have entrusted the collection to the care of [[Thomas Barlow (bishop)|Thomas Barlow]], provost of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] and former librarian of the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]], and a future [[Bishop of Lincoln]]. Between 1660 and 1664 Barlow offered the tracts, together with two copies of a manuscript catalogue to the university for £4,000 but the sale was not agreed. Thomason remained hopeful that they would be sold, and in his will dated 1664, he charged his three executors (Barlow, Thomas Lockey, and [[John Rushworth]]) with selling the collection to the University on behalf of his children.

After Thomason's death in April 1666, the negotiations fell through and the collection remained in Barlow's hands, until they were acquired about 1677–1679 by the bookbinder [[Samuel Mearne]] on behalf of the Royal Library at the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. Mearne rebound the tract volumes in a uniform manner but was never paid for his work and so retained the collection. Eventually Mearne's widow sought and obtained the permission of the [[Privy Council]] in May 1684 to dispose of them on her family's behalf. Over the next four decades various members of the Sisson family (descendants of Samuel Mearne) endeavoured to sell the collection on numerous occasions to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth]], [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos]], [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the [[Radcliffe Library]] in Oxford and the antiquary and book collector [["Honest Tom" Martin]], but in each case the potential purchasers were put off by the high price asked.

In January 1754 Elizabeth Sisson approached [[Thomas Birch]] one of the trustees of the newly established [[British Museum]], loaning him the 12 volume catalogue, but again nothing was to come of the sale during Elizabeth Sisson's lifetime. Finally, in 1762, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]] purchased the collection on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] for the bargain price of £300 (a fraction of the cost of forming the collection). In that same year [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] donated the collection to the new [[British Museum]] at [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], where they were originally known as the "King's pamphlets" and added to the Royal Library Collection. In 1973, the museum transferred the Thomason Tracts to the British Library where they continue to be housed.{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

==Significance of the collection ==
According to [[Thomas Carlyle]], the Thomason Tracts were;
{{quote|
the most valuable set of documents connected with English history; greatly preferable to all the sheepskins in the Tower and other places, for informing the English what the English were in former times; I believe the whole secret of the seventeenth century is involved in that hideous mass of rubbish there (Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the constitution and government of the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoker|1992}} cites ''Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the constitution and government of the British Museum'', (London, 1850), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== The Thomason Tracts today ==
Many of the publications that comprise the collection are exceedingly rare. In fact, some are not known to exist anywhere else. The tracts are bound into some 2,000 volumes and housed at the British Library's main building at [[St Pancras, London|St. Pancras]]. Because of their rarity and fragile condition, the originals are not available to general researchers. However, the library maintains paper facsimiles in its rare books collection, and in 1977 University Microfilms International released a set of 256 [[microfilm]] reels containing the entire collection. The microfilms are available at research libraries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Library of Congress, "[https://www.loc.gov/rr/microform/brit_govt.html British Government Documents in the Microform Reading Room]."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter W. Horn''' (18 January 1908 – 26 December 1995) was a [[medieval studies|medievalist scholar]] noted for his work on the [[Timber framing|timber]] [[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] [[medieval architecture|architecture of the Middle Ages]]. He was born in [[Germany]], but fled [[Nazism]] and spent most of his [[academia|academic career]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he became the university system's first [[art historian]] and co-founded the History of Art department. A [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]], Horn served in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War II]] and then in the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|special intelligence unit]] that tracked down [[Nazi plunder|art works plundered by the Nazis]]. His most celebrated exploit was the recovery of the [[crown jewels]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], also known as [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Imperial Regalia]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Eugene Kleinbauer, James Marrow and Ruth Mellinkoff, "Memoirs of [[Fellow#Academia|Fellows]] and Corresponding Fellows of the [[Medieval Academy of America]]: Walter W. Horn," ''Speculum'' 71 (1996), p. 800 ("his most important piece of detective work led to the recovery of the coronation regalia of the Holy Roman Empire"); "Walter Horn," ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 30 December 1995, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/12/30/MN38089.DTL&amp;type=printable obituary]; University of California (System) Academic Senate, "1996, University of California: In Memoriam,"

==Early life==
Horn was born in the town of [[Waldangelloch]] in rural [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]]. His mother was Matilde Peters; she married Karl Horn, a [[Lutheran]] minister. Walter [[Education in Germany|attended a ''Gymnasium'']] in nearby [[Heidelberg]] and went on to study [[art history]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and the [[University of Berlin]]. He earned his [[doctorate]] in 1934 at the [[University of Hamburg]], studying under [[Erwin Panofsky]]. His [[dissertation]], ''Die Fassade von Saint-Gilles'', on the [[façade]] of [[Saint-Gilles, Gard]], was published in 1937.

==World War II era==
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (169)pano2.jpg|thumb|150px|As a [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|special intelligence officer]], Horn recovered the "crown of Charlemagne", part of the [[Imperial Regalia]] hidden by the Nazis]]
Horn fled Germany in opposition to the Nazi regime. He continued his studies from 1934 to 1937 as a research associate at the German Institute for the History of Art in [[Florence, Italy]]. In 1938, Horn moved to the [[United States]] and began his long association with the University of California, Berkeley, as a [[lecturer]]. A year later, he was given a permanent position as the first art historian in the University of California system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text UC In Memoriam], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he married Ann Binkley Rand.

Horn became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1943. That same year, he volunteered for [[military duty]] in the [[U.S. Army]]. By 1945, he was a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Third United States Army|Third Army]] under General [[George S. Patton]]. Horn's skills as a native speaker of [[German language|German]] were put to use in [[interrogation|interrogating]] [[prisoners of war]]. After the war, he continued as a special investigator in the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]], using his expertise as an art historian to track down [[Nazi plunder|art that had been stolen or concealed by the Nazis]]. Horn served until 1946, attaining the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].

In 1946, Horn succeeded in recovering the [[Imperial Regalia]] of [[Charlemagne]], the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown]], [[sceptre]], and [[Imperial Regalia#Components|jewels]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. These had been kept hidden by Germans who hoped to return to power even after their defeat by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text UC In Memoriam.]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has been elaborated, sometimes with inaccuracies, by writers who take particular interest in the [[Holy Lance]], the spear supposed to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]]. This artifact is sometimes called the Spear of Destiny and identified with the [[Holy Lance#Vienna Lance (Hofburg spear)|Vienna Lance]], one of the components of the regalia. In speculative works of [[non-fiction]] that endow the lance with [[National Socialism and Occultism|occult powers or mystical significance in Nazism]],&lt;ref&gt;See Trevor Ravenscroft, ''The Spear of Destiny: The Occult Power behind the Spear Which Pierced the Side of Christ'' (Red Wheel, 1982). Ravenscroft reproduces a portion of Horn's report on the recovery of the regalia (called there "insignia"), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BKt_4HbED6AC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;lpg=PA348&amp;dq=spear+%22Walter+W.+Horn%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F3xrA_ZVM1&amp;sig=Pku4BJhvr_4T9V8nLeZdLbCtIXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pWtvSpmaOIbiNe7kqdoI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 p. 348.] For issues raised by Ravenscroft's methodology, see [[Holy Lance#Trevor Ravenscroft|Holy Lance: Trevor Ravenscroft]].&lt;/ref&gt; Horn appears in narratives about its retrieval from the possession of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;A detailed version by Jerry E. Smith and George Piccard, ''Secrets of the Holy Lance: The Spear of Destiny in History and Legend'' (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2005), pp. 267–270 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qGX3ZtD_UikC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=%22The+Hunt+for+the+Spear+In+1945%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3  online]; see also E.

Walter William Horn," he is said to have retrieved the lance at the behest of Patton on the very day of Hitler's death, that is, 30 April 1945.

==The McCarthy era==
Returning from the war, Horn married Alberta West Parker, a [[physician]], who became a Clinical Professor of Public Health at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Chronicle, March 31, 2012, [http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=alberta-horn&amp;pid=156776720#fbLoggedOut  Alberta Horn, obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Horn and his family became embroiled in the controversy at his university over a [[loyalty oath]] requirement. During the era of the [[Cold War]], the [[Red Scare]], and [[McCarthyism]], the [[Board of Regents]] at the University of California began to require that all university employees sign an oath affirming their loyalty to the [[California constitution|state constitution]] and denying their membership or belief in organizations advocating the overthrow of the [[U.S. government]]. The requirement met with resistance, and in the summer of 1950 thirty-one [[Professors in the United States|professors]]&lt;ref&gt;Along with a number of other employees.&lt;/ref&gt; who refused to sign were fired, despite their stature as "internationally distinguished scholars."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/symposium/index.html The University Loyalty Oath.]&lt;/ref&gt; Horn's fellow [[medieval studies|medievalist]] [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] resigned rather than sign the oath, stating his reasons in two letters to the [[university president]] that were only published in English decades after the episode. Kantorowicz also presented a letter from Horn, who had signed the oath under protest. In the letter dated 23 August 1950, Horn, then acting [[chairman]] of the art department, pointed to his former military service and to his voluntary [[reactivation]] that same month as a [[reservist]] in the [[United States armed forces|Armed Services]].

{{quote|Being thus confronted a second time with a disruption of my academic career, and feeling unable to expose my wife and my son to the consequences of being denied continuance of my civilian occupation upon return from military duty, it is with profound regret that I find myself compelled to yield to the pressure which the Regents saw fit to exercise in order to extort from me a declaration concerning my political beliefs. I am enclosing the requested statement, signed. I should like to make known that, in doing so, I am acting against the better precepts of my [[conscience]] and for no other reason than that of protecting my family against the contingencies of economic distress. … It was in avoidance of pressures of this type that I left Germany in 1938 and came to this country. And it was in the desire of contributing to the eradication of such methods that I volunteered during the last war to take up arms against the country of my birth. I am expecting my recall to active duty [[Korean War#Escalation|in the present conflict]] with the bitter feeling that, this time, I shall be fighting abroad for the defense and propagation of [[Freedoms]] which I have been denied in my professional life at home.}}

Kantorowicz noted that Horn's letter "illustrates the grave conflict of conscience and savage [[economic coercion]] to which, after fifteen months of pressure and struggle, he had finally to yield."&lt;ref&gt;Horn's letter appears following two letters by Kantorowicz at The University Loyalty Oath: A 50th Anniversary Retrospective, [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/symposium/kantorowicz.html "The Fundamental Issue."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career and scholarship==
[[File:Firenze.Baptistry06.JPG|thumb|200px|Horn established methods for dating with his work on the [[Florence Baptistry]]]]
[[File:Great Coxwell Tithe Barn c.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Great Coxwell Barn]] was one of two Cistercian structures studied by Horn and [[Ernest Born]] for their first book]]
Horn's early position as research associate in Florence gave him firsthand knowledge of the city's [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|medieval church architecture]] and produced two important studies, ''Das Florentiner Baptisterium'' (1938), an analysis of the fabric and ornamentation of the [[Florence Baptistry]] that established new criteria for its dating, and ''[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] Churches in Florence: A Study of Their [[Chronology]] and Stylistic Development'' (1943), which included an examination of the [[masonry]] construction of [[San Miniato al Monte]]. Throughout his career, he continued to explore the conceptual connections between [[Classical architecture|classical]] and northern architecture.&lt;ref name="content.cdlib.org"&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text "Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley"]&lt;/ref&gt; His specialty was [[Aisle#Cathedral architecture|three-aisled]] timber structures in medieval churches, [[Market house|market halls]] and [[manor house|manor halls]]. He was known for arriving at a precise dating of medieval buildings through studying [[Architectural engineering|their technologies]] and observing the physical evidence, drawing on scientific disciplines; he dated timber structures with reference to [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon analysis]] and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological tables]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 801. See, for example, Walter Horn, "The Potential and Limitations of Radiocarbon Dating in the Middle Ages," in ''Scientific Methods in Medieval Archaeology'', edited by [[Rainer Berger]] (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1970), pp. 23-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Horn published what is considered his most important article,&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir,"  p. 800.&lt;/ref&gt; "On the Origins of the Medieval Bay System" in the ''Journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]]''. He argued that [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]-divided [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|medieval churches]] derived from [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] timber buildings and represented a continuous tradition of [[vernacular architecture]] in [[transalpine]] Europe. Horn was the first to assemble the known timber examples, which dated from as early as 1200 BC and extended into the medieval period. Because traces of early wooden structures were often scanty or oblique, Horn used scientific methods to uncover their architectural principles, and demonstrated that these were developed and applied to stone [[cathedral]]s in the Romanesque and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 800; [http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text "Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley"]; [http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/hornw.htm Dictionary of Art Historians.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1958 article was significant also in that it marked Horn's first collaboration with [[Ernest Born]], the [[San Francisco|San Franciscan]] architect and [[draftsman]] with whom he was to author a series of books and articles over the next twenty years. Their first book was ''The Barns of the [[Beaulieu Abbey|Abbey of Beaulieu]] at Its [[wikt:grange|Granges]] of [[Great Coxwell Barn|Great Coxwell]] and Beaulieu St. Leonard'' (1965), a study of the only two [[Cistercian]] [[tithe barn]]s, dating from the 13th century, that survive in England.&lt;ref name="content.cdlib.org" /&gt; But their major project was the three-volume work ''The Plan of St. Gall: A Study of the Architecture and Economy of, and Life in a Paradigmatic [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] Monastery'', which has been called "one of the greatest [[monograph]]s on medieval architecture that has ever appeared."&lt;ref name="Kleinhauer p. 801"&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 801.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan of St. Gall===
[[File:Pianta dell'abbazia di san gallo, 816-830, san gallo, stiftbibliothek.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Plan of Saint Gall]]]]
The [[plan of Saint Gall]] had engaged Horn's imagination and curiosity since he was introduced to it by his mentor [[Erwin Panofsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 800.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Horn had participated in an international [[academic conference|congress]] on the plan, and his interest in its guest and service buildings led to his survey of medieval structures in France and England. In 1965, Horn and Born contributed to the creation of a [[scale model]] of the 40 buildings rendered on the plan. The model was displayed at the international exhibit ''[[Charlemagne|Karl der Grosse]]'' held at [[Aachen]]. Their two decades of collaboration culminated in a work of 1,056 pages with an estimated 1,200 illustrations.

''The Plan of St. Gall'' was praised by French historian [[Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie]] for its "prodigious scholarship," and for its wide-ranging elucidation of [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] daily life.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;William Grimes, "Walter Horn, 87, a Historian Of Medieval Cloisters and Barns," ''[[New York Times]]'' 29 December 1995,  [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/nyregion/walter-horn-87-a-historian-of-medieval-cloisters-and-barns.html?pagewanted=print obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume offers a reconstruction of the church and the living quarters for a [[Christian monasticism|community of monks]] numbering about a hundred. The second volume covered the guest and service buildings and the [[Medieval gardening|horticultural]] spaces for growing vegetables, medicinal herbs, and fruit and nut trees. The third volume contains supplemental material such as Horn's 88-page catalogue of the plan's explanatory ''tituli'', or captions, and [[Charles W. Jones (medievalist)|Charles W. Jones]]' English translation of the ''Consuetudines Corbienses'' by [[Adalard of Corbie|Adalhard]] of the [[abbey of Corbie]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Charles W. Jones (medievalist)|Charles W. Jones]] for more on this collaboration.&lt;/ref&gt; Through meticulous reimagining of the activities that the architecture was meant to facilitate, Horn presents a rich picture of Carolingian life and thought.

The most controversial aspect of the work was Horn's major thesis: that the plan was a copy of a lost [[blueprint|master plan]] dating to 816 or 817 that would have been part of documents pertaining to the official monastic reform movement under [[Louis the Pious]] at Aachen. The dominant strand of criticism to the contrary holds that the plan was intended to represent an ideal and was never meant to be carried out at a particular site. Horn's last article on the plan, "The Medieval Monastery as a Setting for the Production of Manuscripts,"&lt;ref&gt;Co-authored with Born in the ''Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' 44 (1986) 16–47.&lt;/ref&gt; was a response to this criticism.&lt;ref name="Kleinhauer p. 801" /&gt;

''The Plan of St. Gall'' earned twelve major awards for its scholarship, [[bookbinding|bookmaking]], and [[typography]], including a prize from France's [[Académie d'architecture]] and a 1982 medal from the [[American Institute of Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 801; Grimes, ''NYT'' obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later work===
In 1974, Horn retired to [[emeritus]] status after 36 years at the University of California. His last publication, ''The Forgotten [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|Hermitage]] of [[Skellig Michael]]'' (1990), co-authored with Jenny White Marshall and Grellan D. Rourke, resulted from [[fieldwork]] begun in 1978 on [[List of islands of Ireland|Ireland's Atlantic offshore islands]]. His interest in the Celtic [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]] had been indicated earlier in "On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister" (1973).

===Honors and administrative achievements===
Horn worked with [[classical archaeologist]] [[Darrell A. Amyx]] to establish History of Art as a separate department at the University of California in 1971. He was a [[Fellow#Academia|fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1970) and of the [[Medieval Academy of America]] (1980). Horn was an active supporter of arts institutions outside academia, serving as [[trustee]] of the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] and chairman of the museum's acquisitions committee.&lt;ref&gt;''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 30 December 1995, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/12/30/MN38089.DTL&amp;type=printable obituary "Walter Horn."]&lt;/ref&gt; He was on the board of the [[College Art Association]] 1950–54 and 1964–68 and on the board of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]] 1964–68.

==Death==
Horn died at home of [[pneumonia]] on Tuesday, 26 December 1995, at [[Point Richmond, Richmond, California|Point Richmond]], California. He was 87. He was survived by his wife, Alberta; his son, Michael; two daughters, Rebecca and Robin; and a grandson, Matthew. His [[obituary]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' labeled him "historian of medieval [[cloister]]s and [[barn]]s."&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; Horn was remembered by colleagues as one of the university's "best-loved and most influential teachers and … most effective leaders."&lt;ref&gt;"Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley," [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id= Calisphere.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was eulogized for "his oratorical skills and uncanny ability to bring the medieval building or pile of [[ruins]] vividly to life. His eloquence and grace matched his endless curiosity about prehistoric and medieval buildings in northern Europe and how people utilized them."&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," pp. 801–802.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Festival of Black Arts''' (French: [[:fr:Festival Mondial des Arts Nègres|Festival Mondial des Arts Nègres]]), also known as '''FESMAN''', is a month-long culture and arts festival that takes place in [[Africa]]. The festival features poetry, sculpture, painting, music, cinema, theatre, fashion, architecture, design and dance from artists and performers from around the [[African Diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90856/6574894.html "World Festival of Black Arts launched at UN Headquarters"], ''People's Daily'', 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festivals were planned as Pan-African celebrations, and ranged in content from debate to performance — particularly dance and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Banham, [[Errol Hill]], George Woodyard (eds), ''The Cambridge Guide to African &amp; Caribbean Literature'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1994; "''FESTAC''", p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
