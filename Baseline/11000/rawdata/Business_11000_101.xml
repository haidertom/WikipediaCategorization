Under [[United States]] law, '''account stated''' is a statement between a [[creditor]] (the person to whom money is owed) and a [[debtor]] (the person who owes) based upon a series of prior transactions that a particular amount is owed to the creditor as of a certain date. Often the account stated is a bill, [[invoice]] or a summary of invoices, signed by the customer or sent to the customer who pays part or all of it without protest.

An account stated may also be established when the debtor retains the statement of account (for example the bill or invoice) without objecting, for a reasonable length of time. "Reasonable" is determined by looking at the surrounding circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;1 Am. Jur. 2d Accounts &amp; Accounting section 26 (West 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; An account stated is in the nature of a kind of settlement between the parties, such as when a person receives a [[bank statement]], is capable and even obligated to check the math within a specified period of time, otherwise the account as between the parties is thus "stated." The key element is either the express agreement or an agreement implied by law under all the facts and circumstances.

==Purpose==
Arthur Corbin's influential treatise on Contracts explains the purpose and historic context of "account stated" as follows: 
{{quote|Persons who carry on business with each other often have a series of transactions constituting an open running account with various items of debit and credit. For long periods neither one may know which one is actually indebted to the other. Under such circumstances, they may get together and compare their books and their memories, cast up their mutual accounts, and strike a balance. In [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase, they were formerly said to have accounted together&amp;mdash;''[[insimul computassent]]''. Assumpsit lay for the recovery of the balance so found due, before the development of many of the principles of present-day contract law. Common illustrations of such accounts, with recurring debits and credits, are those between banker and depositor, between customer and grocer or department store, between principal and agent, and between partners in business. In all such cases, if the items are liquidated in money, one of the parties is a debtor to the other in an amount that can be determined at any time by an accounting process. The amount of the debt is the balance of debits over credits. The debt becomes due and payable only as the parties may have agreed;  this may be in installments or as a whole, at regular intervals or as demanded by the presentation of drafts or statements of account."&lt;ref&gt;Corbin on Contracts, § 1303 at 234.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Elements==
The elements of account stated are: (1) prior [[Financial transaction|transactions]] between the parties which establish a debtor-creditor relationship; (2)an express or implied agreement between the parties as to the amount due; and (3) an express or implied promise from the debtor to pay the amount due.&lt;ref&gt;1 Am. Jur. 2d Accounts &amp; Accounting section 26 (West 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; When a creditor [[Lawsuit|sues]] for account stated, this sets both the debtor's [[legal liability|liability]] and the exact amount the debtor must pay, which on its surface is less complicated than claiming a debt is due and payable. An account stated may carry a longer [[statute of limitations]] (time to file suit) than some other forms of debt, depending on the state.

In other states, such as [[Washington state]], "account stated" is generally asserted as a defense in a contract action.&lt;ref&gt;''Northwest Motors, Ltd. v. James'', 118 Wash.2d 294, 304, 822 P.2d 280 (1992), citing ''Goodwin v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co.'', 196 Wash. 391, 410, 83 P.2d 231 (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; Courts in those states characterize "account stated" as being merely a defense or a "doctrine" that prevents parties from raising issues that have already been dealt with, compromised and/or settled by the parties.

“An account stated has been defined as an agreement between parties who have had previous transactions that the account representing those transactions is true and that the balance stated is correct, together with a promise, express or implied, for the payment of such balance."&lt;ref&gt;''McHugh v. Olsen'', 189 Ill.App.3d 508, 514, 545 N.E.2d 379 (1st Dist. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; "An account stated is merely a form of proving damages for the breach of a promise to pay on a contract."&lt;ref&gt;''Dreyer Medical Clinic, S.C. v. Corral'', 227 Ill.App.3d 221, 226, 591 N.E.2d 111 (2d Dist. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for litigation==
Nevertheless, even where account stated is recognized as a cause of action in and of itself, defenses such as [[fraud]] or mistake may still be asserted to the "account stated," as with any settlement of parties to complex transactions. In situations where no account has been proven as stated, or where the existence of an agreement between the parties on a particular amount as being correct is effectively denied, all of the defenses or counterclaims that may exist with respect to the underlying transaction are preserved, and therefore may still be [[litigation|litigated]].

Both the basic agreement and rendition of account must be proved. “[T]he rule that an account rendered and not objected to within a reasonable time is to be regarded as correct assumes that there was an original indebtedness, but there can be no liability on an account stated if no liability in fact exists, and the mere presentation of a claim, although not objected to, cannot of itself create liability. . . . In other words, an account stated cannot create original liability where none exists; it is merely a final determination of the amount of an existing debt.”&lt;ref&gt;''Motive Parts Co. of America, Inc. v. Robinson'', 53 Ill.App.3d 935, 940, 369 N.E.2d 119 (1st Dist. 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant [[litigation]] occurs on "account stated" issues where professional legal or medical services are involved, and the recipient of the services happens not to object in writing to bills allegedly sent and received. Professional services are required to be "reasonable and necessary" in amount by both law and ethical rules, yet these professional creditors often assert that non-objection constitutes agreement to whatever figure was billed. Especially where legal or medical relations are or may be ongoing, arguing that silence constitutes agreement to what might otherwise be an overcharge can be hotly contested by parties. At least in the case of attorney fees, voluminous litigation exists regarding what's reasonable and necessary given the professional services rendered in a particular context, and accounts are rarely "stated" in professional services cases absent facts such as where there has been payment by the alleged debtor without objection, or a final and unappealed court order for the payment of those professional fees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4722">[[File:Nenačovice, tabulka Akce-Z.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque that says that the building was constructed in course of ''Akce Z'']]

"Initiative Z" was the Czechoslovak communist regime's attempt to tap a volunteer work and community spirit toward supplementing local infrastructure and public facility improvement using volunteer work while the construction material and the logistics were provided by the government.

In [[Communist Czechoslovakia]], '''Initiative Z''' ({{lang-cs|Akce Z}}) was a nationwide program of a volunteer, community-improvement unpaid manual labor by population, which was officially recognized as [[Volunteering|volunteer]] work which run for several decades, mainly on the projects where the 5-year planned economy was in a substantial delay.

Specific local plans with Initiative Z community-improvement projects were usually announced by a local ''[[:cs:Národní výbor (1945-1990)|Národní výbor]]'' ("[[People's Committee (Czechoslovakia)|People's Committee]]", i.e. an elected city council-like local government administrative body). Larger projects undertaken within the  Initiative Z have eventually found their place into the nationwide [[planned economy|state plans of economic development, such as Five-Year Plans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexdata.cz/lexdata/sb_free.nsf/c12571cc00341df1c12566af007f1a09/c12571cc00341df1c12566d40071fc2f?OpenDocument Notice 6/1960 of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Finance and State Bank]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, see sections 15, 18 {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was done outside the regular work hours, very often on Saturday morning and was somehow similar to ''[[subbotnik]]s'' in the [[Soviet Union]] or standard community-action or community-improvement initiatives and programs in the West.&lt;ref&gt;''The Czechoslovak Cooperator'', Issues 3-4, [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=JRooAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=czechoslovakia+%22action+z%22&amp;q=%22action+z%22#search_anchor p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was meant to be entirely voluntary work, the names of volunteers and a number of worked hours were duly documented. Those citizens who did not participate and their names therefore did not figure on the lists, were questioned, why they did not come to contribute and in many cases put under an unpleasant pressure by mentioning possible disadvantages such as a reduced choice with respect to future education or difficult change of employer.

Those citizens who worked the most hours were publicly recognized and there was an award-system which gave those who contributed more than 50 hours in a given year a Silver Akce Z Pin and those with more than 100 hours a Golden Akce Z Pin. Many, especially young people, earned - over the years - several of these and mentioned the fact say in applications for university admission.

"Z" stands for the Czech word ''zvelebování'', "improvement", referring to improvement of public places. Typical activities ranged from garbage removal and planting trees to construction of some public-service facilities, such as children [[playground]]s, [[cultural center]]s (Kulturní domy, Houses of Culture), municipal pipelines or sewage lines, large number of grocery stores in small villages (for example grocery store [[Smíšené Zboží]] in village ([[Hůrky]] coordinates 49.049331 N ,15.133108 E) near [[Nová Bystřice]]) etc..

In the late 1980s when the planned economy was in the latest phase of its struggle, even technically advanced projects were attempted to be progressed by sending numbers of unskilled volunteers to help under the umbrella of '''Initiative Z'''. However, the lack of skills among volunteers often resulted in contra-productive outcome and faulty results of volunteer work, although well hidden, regularly led to even longer delays. Many participants recalled futile work be ordered upon them, for illustration having to shuffle a large heap of sand with shovels and wheelbarrows the whole day by 20 meters, just to witness it being relocated by a machine to its original location in the following working days.

Under any regime always sceptical, Czech folk wit claimed that "Z" stood for ''zdarma'', i.e., "without pay".&lt;ref name=from&gt;"From Good King Wenceslas to the Good Soldier Švejk: a dictionary of Czech Popular Culture ", by Andrew Lawrence Roberts, {{ISBN|963-7326-27-8}}, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qlnrXT2yS0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22akce+z%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22akce%20z%22&amp;f=false p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, another very common type of aleatory contract is an [[insurance]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/4227/Aleatory-Contract.html Thomson-Gale Encyclopedia of American Law, courtesy of Jrank]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was a classification developed in later medieval [[Roman law]] to cover all contracts whose fulfilment depended on chance, including [[gambling]], [[insurance]], speculative investment and [[life annuity|life annuities]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), ch. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern forms of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Option (finance)|options]] may in some cases also be considered aleatory contracts. For example, the [[French civil code]] contains a chapter on aleatory contracts, with specific provisions for gaming (gambling) and [[Life annuity|life annuities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/codes_traduits/code_civil_textA.htm Text of French Civil Code (in English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629090905/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/codes_traduits/code_civil_textA.htm |date=2008-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In HubSpot's 2016 Year In Review, the company reported $271 million in total revenue and 1,597 employees with headquarters in Cambridge, MA and offices in Dublin, Ireland (EMEA HQ); Berlin; Singapore; Sydney, Australia; Tokyo, Japan; and Portsmouth, NH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/assets/hubspot.com/year-in-review/2016/yir-2016.pdf|title=HubSpot 2016 Year In Review|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|work=[[Hubspot]]|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hubspot.com/contact|title=Contact Us {{!}} HubSpot|last=HubSpot|website=www.hubspot.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He credits the company's success, in part, to innovations like the "Alpha, Beta, Version One" policy, in which employees begin proving their ideas might profit the company "nights and weekends" (the alpha phase) before receiving additional resources (the beta and version one phases).&lt;ref name="inc-2010-09"&gt;{{cite journal

==Publications, speeches, and awards==
Halligan's first book, ''Inbound Marketing,'' was co-authored with HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah. The thesis of the book is that because people now block marketing that interrupts them, such as advertisements and spam, companies need to instead provide information that is useful to prospects, who will then self-identify. Reviewing the book, Meryl Evans said that it contains "elementary stuff..." but it "does a good job for those who don’t have a clue about how to use social media for business." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Daniel Lyons incidents==
In his book ''[[Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start Up Bubble]]'', which is sharply critical of HubSpot's management and culture, former HubSpot employee [[Daniel Lyons]] accused Halligan of age discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Primack, Dan (April 16, 2016) [http://fortune.com/2016/04/06/tech-workers-and-investors-should-read-disrupted/ "Why Tech Workers and Investors Should Read 'Disrupted."] Forbes. (Retrieved 8-16-2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act]] showed that certain Hubspot executives working under Halligan considered the book "a financial threat to HubSpot, its share price, and the company’s future potential." The FBI report discusses "tactics such as email hacking and extortion" in the attempt to prevent the book from being published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/03/23/documents-released-hubspot-probe-involving-author-dan-lyons/VZH4CN4kR5p7iyhsKEdwJI/story.html Extortion, hacking claims sparked HubSpot investigation, FBI records show], Boston Globe, 24 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halligan was forced to pay financial penalties by the HubSpot board of directors because he failed to promptly alert the board after he discovered that staff members at HubSpot behaved inappropriately. "There was definitely some fishiness. But I didn’t report it. That was my bad," Halligan said about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/07/29/hubspot-fires-marketing-chief-sanctions-ceo-over-incident-involving-book-about-the-company/ beta Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/disrupted-excerpt-hubspot-startup-dan-lyons/ My Year in Startup Hell], Dan Lyons in ''Fortune'', April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward2016"&gt;{{Cite news

== Biography ==
Churchman was born in 1913 in [[Mount Airy, Philadelphia]],  to Clark Wharton Churchman and Helen Norah Fassitt, descendents of [[Philadelphia Main Line]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Assad | first1 = Arjang A. | chapter = C.

Mason (2004), "IFORS’ Operational Research Hall of Fame : C. West Churchman" in: ''Intl. Trans. in Op. Res.'' Vol 11 pp 585–588&lt;/ref&gt; He studied philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was admitted to the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity. He earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1935, a [[master's degree|master's]] in 1936, and a [[PhD]] in 1938, all in philosophy. One of his teachers was [[Edgar A. Singer]], who had been a student at Harvard of the philosopher and psychologist [[William James]].

Before completing his dissertation, in 1937, he became Instructor of Philosophy, also at the University of Pennsylvania. Upon finishing his degree, he was appointed Assistant Professor at the University. During World War II, Churchman headed the mathematical section of the U.S. Ordnance Laboratory at the Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia and devised a way to test small arms ammunition and detonators based on the statistical methods of bioassay.&lt;ref name="KM 04"/&gt; He also investigated the theory of detonation, applying high-speed photography. In 1945, back in Pennsylvania he was elected Chairman of the Department of Philosophy. In 1951, Churchman moved to the [[Case Institute of Technology]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and until 1957 he was Professor of Engineering Administration at Case. In 1957, he joined the faculty of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and remained there as a Professor Emeritus after his retirement.

During 1946-1954, he served as the secretary and program chairman of the American [[Philosophy of Science Association]]. He is a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Churchman was a founding member of TIMS, now [[INFORMS]], and was its ninth president in 1962. In 1989, Churchman was elected president of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]].

Churchman edited the journal ''Philosophy of Science'' for a long period beginning in 1948. He was also the first editor-in-chief of the journal ''[[Management Science]]'' in 1954.

Churchman’s honors include the [[Academy of Management]]’s Best Book in Management Award and the McKinsey Book Award, both in 1968.&lt;ref name="Informs"&gt;[http://www2.informs.org/History/Gallery/Presidents/TIMS/cchurchman.htm C.

In 1983, Churchman received the [http://awards.berkeley.edu/berkeleyCitation.cfm Berkeley Citation], one of the campus's highest awards. In 1999 he received the LEO Award for Lifetime Exceptional Achievement in Information Systems.

Churchman has been cited by [[Noam Chomsky]] as the only professor from whom he learned anything as an undergraduate. European students of C. West Churchman are [[Werner Ulrich]] and [[Kristo Ivanov]] who developed his work in related fields&lt;ref&gt;For an extension of Churchman's concepts to philosophy of science in general and informatics or computer science in particular, see Kristo Ivanov (2002),  [http://www.informatik.umu.se/~kivanov/chuindex.html Index to The Design of Inquiring Systems.] Retrieved 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to its diffusion in Europe.

Churchman died in 2004 in [[Bolinas, California]].

== Work ==
Churchman made significant contributions in the fields of [[management science]], [[operations research]] and [[systems theory]]. During a career spanning six decades, Churchman investigated a vast range of topics such as [[accounting]], research and development [[management]], [[city planning]], [[education]], [[mental health]], [[space exploration]], and [[peace and conflict studies]].&lt;ref name="KM 04"/&gt;

Churchman became internationally recognized due to his then radical concept of incorporating ethical values into operating systems. Hasan Ozbekhan, his friend, in ''The Predicament of Mankind'' proposal to the [[Club of Rome]] &lt;ref&gt;Ozbekhan, H. (1970).  The Predicament of Mankind: A Quest for Structured Responses to Growing World-Wide Complexities and Uncertainties. www.redesignresearch.com/docs/ThePredicamentofMankind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated ethical values in the 49 Continuous Critical Problems that constitute the '''Global Problematique'''. The proposal was not accepted because it was "too humanistic" &lt;ref&gt;Christakis,A.N.(1998)The Club of Rome Revisited in General Systems, W.L. Reckmeyer (ed.) International Society for the Systems Sciences, Vol XXXI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
His wife Gloria Churchman died in 2009. About her husband, she said, "Academic philosophy wasn't satisfying to him. He demanded that philosophy have meaning in the world. He wanted to insert an ethical dimension into science. And he really made it his job to remind all these CEOs that they had ethical responsibilities."

"He was a tremendous teacher. People would flock to his class," Gloria Churchman said. "He always kept you on the edge of your chair, because he was a very, very exciting lecturer. He had students from everywhere, all over the world."

Professor Churchman and Gloria Churchman are survived by their son Daniel Wharton Churchman (Josh) of Bolinas, his daughter-in-law Joy Churchman and two grandchildren, Jenna and Kyle Churchman.

== West Churchman Memorial Prize ==
The West Churchman Memorial Prize was awarded in 2014, during the 10th Brazilian Congress of systems, conducted by CORS - USP, after a selection carried out by an editorial committee, composed of researchers from several countries. The purpose of it was to provide recognition to an important systemic research work developed within the highest ethical and methodological standards as advocated C. West Churchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2376/full|title= Systems Research And Behavioral Science - Guest Editorial|date= 2015 |access-date= |author= J.

[[File:Carlossouto98.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Carlos Souto in 1998]]
'''Carlos Souto''' ([[Buenos Aires]], May 13, 1955) is an Argentine advertising executive. He is regarded as one of the leading [[political advertising]] executives in [[Argentina]]. He runs the advertising agency South Communications, which has been engaged in political advertising since 1996. The work teams he organizes and leads have been a key factor in transforming the Latin American political language over the last decade. He took part in work teams with [[David Ratto]], [[Ramiro Agulla]], '''Dick Morris''', '''Miguel Sal''' and '''Darío Lanis'''.

== Childhood and Youth ==

'''Carlos Souto''' was born in [[Parque Patricios]] neighborhood in [[Buenos Aires City]], [[Argentina]], on May 13, 1955. His parents, Maruja and Celestino, were [[Galician people|Galician]] immigrants. Thanks to them and to his grandmother Carmen, both his sister Ana María and Carlos acquired [[Galician language]] before [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. He spends his childhood and early youth in the southern suburbs of [[Buenos Aires City]]. He started his studies at Colegio Bernasconi. Later, in second grade, he changed school (to Cangallo Schule, a German school in Balvanera neighborhood) where he completed his elementary and high school studies.

== Cursus Honorum ==
After the [[military coup]] in [[Argentina]] and considering the political commitment he had assumed as a student representative at the [[Buenos Aires University]] Engineering School, Souto travels to [[Brazil]] and settles in [[Sao Paulo City]]. His first job is as an office boy in the advertising agency Diálogo Propaganda. In 1976, he publishes his first and only storybook, illustrated by [[María Teresa Lemos Fontao]]. After a while, he starts working as a [[TV commercial]] production assistant. His beginnings are in Flipfilms and in the advertising agency Mauro Salles Interamericana. His rise is rapid.  In this way, he meets the French director [[Olivier Perroy]], who jointly with [[Carlo Ponti, Jr.]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} establishes the international “Filmar do Brasil”. In [[Angra dos Reis]] they produce the feature film “Pirañas.” This would be Souto’s only experience in feature films. During the four years he lived in [[Sao Paulo]] Carlos Souto shared an apartment, O Quatorze in Pinheros, with the Catalan plastic artist and advertising executive [[Xavier Ruáix Durán]]. O quatorze would turn into a place of worship for the intellectual, the creative and young moviemakers that came together in [[Sao Paulo]] during the second half of the 1970s. At the beginning of the 1980s, Souto decides to come back to [[Argentina]]. In 1983, he organizes his first business venture. In 1984, he establishes a company engaged in the development of brand events. Souto would work in the field of public relations and communication. In the following years, definitely settled in [[Argentina]], Souto develops his first work team connected with the [[advertising industry]].

== First advertising hits ==
[[File:Souto leon plata.jpg|thumb|Carlos Souto at the Cannes Festival]]
In the late 1980s, Souto decides to focus all his experience in setting up a small advertising agency with Argentine share capitals.  The basics of his project would be the approach to communication, the primary function of which would be to respect the cultural identity of the society in which the company would operate. Even it could act as a forum to help understand the constructive potential of advertising in social development. As his project is settling, in 1991 he receives his first award, the third place in [[Clarín Award]] for Creativity in Newspapers.  This would be the beginning of a long path of recognitions for the development of his project. In those years he builds a famous duo with [[Darío Lanis]] that would be awarded both nationally and internationally. At the same time, he organizes a work team with remarkable young people like Juan Cravero, Carlos Bayala, Pablo del Campo, Gustavo Taretto, Fernando Tchechenitsky, and Álvaro Fernández Mendy. In 1993, he finally establishes his first [[advertising agency]]. In 1994, he enters the advertising agencies creative ranking of the Argentine Chamber of Advertisers, being in the tenth place in the country. In 1995, he participates for the first time in a selection process for the organization of a [[political campaign]]. He emerges as the winner; he runs his first political campaign and wins the election. Nevertheless, his communicational work in the goods and services market continues to collect many awards. A short time later he would be awarded with the '''“Silver Lion”''' on TV at the [[Cannes Festival]], with a Gold on TV at the [[London Festival]], with a Gold and a Platinum Pencil Award, besides the [[prize|Grand Prix]] at [[Festival Iberoamericano de Publicidad|Festival Iberoamericano de Publicidad (FIAP)]], and Gold awards on TV and Radio at the same festival.  He is also multi-awarded in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, apart from receiving noteworthy recognitions at festivals like the [[New York Festival]] or at the [[Argentine Circle of Creative Designers]].  The first Souto’s website receives the Silver award at the [[London Festival]] and at FIAP. During 1999 he decides to set up a new company, '''Adlatina.com''', a website specialized in [[marketing]] and [[advertising]].

== Political Marketing ==

Carlos Souto begins his experience in the field of political advertising in 1995 and since then the team he leads has accompanied each of the most important moments in the history of [[Argentine elections]]. Throughout his career and thanks to his work, Carlos Souto is called for the most important [[political campaigns]] in [[Argentina]], in which he achieves memorable hits. He wins two [[presidential elections]], two elections for [[Buenos Aires Mayor]], and one for [[Mendoza Province Governor]]. Recently, he has won a mid-term legislative election in [[Buenos Aires Provinc]]e. He has the chance to be responsible for the institutional communication of several government efforts and to advise different politicians and businessmen in crisis situations. His work in the elections field is praised for the creative quality of the audiovisual pieces as well as for those of the public highway, apart from the standards applied to production. Many of the commercials he has made throughout his career are part of the communicational and cultural values of his country.

'''Cockpit iPads''' are [[iPad]]s used in the aviation industry to replace paper charts and manuals. This technology is currently being used by both private and commercial aircraft pilots.

== History and testing ==
The iPad has been used in [[General Aviation]] in conjunction with its paper backup counterpart, which is mandated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). There are many applications available which include everything that would be on the paper charts plus aviation tools including [[navigation chart]]s, taxi procedures, weather maps, [[GPS]], Minimum Equipment List, Company Policy Manual, Federal Aviation Regulations and flight controls. Although these tools have been used in the private sector, the use of the iPad in commercial aviation is just taking flight.

The Federal Aviation Administration finished a three-month testing project which included putting the device thru adverse conditions such as rapid decompression testing and tests to make sure the tablet did not interfere with the avionic equipment. Early in 2011 the FAA authorized charter company Executive Jet Management to use iPad records without the backup paper charts.&lt;ref name="Paur_2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paur|first=Jason|title=FAA Approves iPads for pilots' electronic charts|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/02/28/FAA.approves.iPads/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=3/12/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helps make way for the iPad to become an aviation instrument for the rest of the industry.   Alaska Airlines,&lt;ref name="padgadget_2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberto|title=Delta Air Lines, Alaska Airlines Testing iPad as "In-Cockpit" Flight Tool|url=http://www.padgadget.com/2011/03/07/delta-air-lines-alaska-airlines-testing-ipad-as-in-cockpit-flight-tool/|publisher=Pad Gadget|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delta Air Lines,&lt;ref name="padgadget_2011"/&gt; and American Airlines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cormier|first=Jeff|title=Apple iPad 2 may soon replace paper charts in airline cockpits|url=http://www.theipadfan.com/apple-ipad-2-replace-paper-charts-airline-cockpits/|publisher=The iPad Fan|accessdate=12 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311112031/http://www.theipadfan.com/apple-ipad-2-replace-paper-charts-airline-cockpits/|archivedate=11 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; planned test programs.

== Practicality ==
The main motive to use the iPad as a navigation tool is the practicality of the product. The iPad would replace about 25 pounds of paper charts used by pilots that include [[aircraft flight manual]]s, [[approach plate]]s, navigation charts, policy manuals, minimum equipment list and taxi charts.&lt;ref name="Paur_2011"/&gt; Major airlines based in the United States are mainly paper based, which includes some who have fleets of 900 plus planes. This translates to a lot of paper in the form of charts that could be saved by the iPad. The switch to an electronic system would also make life easier on the pilot. No longer would pilots carry around a heavy [[flight bag]]. It would be replaced by the 9.5&amp;nbsp;inch by 7.31&amp;nbsp;inch 1.33 pound tablet. When used in conjunction with a specially designed strap, this small size allows them to be used in place of [[Pilot's kneeboard|kneeboards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximizing Cockpit Functionality|url=http://www.theappstrap.com|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight planning is also made easier by the iPad. The pilot would be able to use one device to check everything from weather, other airport facilities and flight plans. All this makes a pilot's life a lot easier. 
[[File:IPad-WiFi-1stGen.jpg|thumb|upright|Apple iPad]]

== Safety ==
The iPad brings several safety advantages into the cockpit.  First is the currency and completeness of the charts.  Paper chart revisions are issued every two weeks.  A pilot can easily misfile a paper chart, remove the wrong one or forget to file the chart altogether by the time of the flight occurs.  An outdated or misplaced chart can increase the possibility of accidents.

Secondly, carrying the 40+ pound kitbag that holds all of the navigation charts is a cause of personal injuries of the pilots themselves.  According to Patrick O’Keeffe, [[American Airlines]]’s vice president of Airline Operations Technology, “[American Airlines has] reduced the single biggest source of pilot injuries: carrying those packs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frost|first=Kyle|title=Report: iPad lowering number of pilot injuries|url=http://www.todaysiphone.com/2013/05/report-ipad-lowering-number-of-pilot-injuries/|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPad also allows for a decrease of clutter in the cockpit. This leads to a safer flight for the pilot and passengers. Pilots need not spread out the large charts in the small cockpit, hence they don't obstruct the view.  Pilots can quickly swipe their fingers around the chart as well as switch charts in matter of seconds. This give pilots more time to look out the cockpit window and allows them to be able to just take a glance instead of searching around on a map.

A number of issues have been brought up including distractions in the cockpit, but the Internet on the iPad could not be used at those altitudes and pilots would still be using onboard GPS instruments.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes_2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Business Staff|title=Alaska Airlines testing iPads in cockpits|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sundaybuzz/2014402413_sundaybuzz06.html|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other safety issues include software failure and power outage, but in the three-month test Executive Jet Management conducted, not once did the application shut off or have a failure.  Tests did show that if a failure did take place the program could reboot in four to six seconds. Extra iPads in the cockpit are also being talked about as a backup to a system failure.&lt;ref name="Paur_2011"/&gt; Airlines are also looking into the safety of the placement of the iPads in the cockpit. The most popular placement is on a [[pilot's kneeboard]], a strap that connects to the pilot's upper thigh and makes the device [[hands free]], but many commercial airlines are looking into a dock that is connected to the plane itself.&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes_2011"/&gt;

      <comment>/* Dry-sand cores */ "most simple" -&gt; "simplest"</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10810">A '''core''' is a device used in [[casting]] and [[molding (process)|moulding]] processes to produce internal cavities and [[wikt:reentrant|reentrant]] angles (an interior angle that is greater than 180°). The core is normally a disposable item that is destroyed to get it out of the piece.&lt;ref name="degarmo311"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They are most commonly used in [[sand casting]], but are also used in [[die casting]] and [[injection moulding]].

For example, cores define multiple passages inside cast [[engine block]]s. One model of GM V-8 engine requires 5 dry-sand cores for every casting.&lt;ref name="degarmo311"/&gt;

==Materials required to make cores==
*Core sand
*Bentonite clay
*Pulverized coal
*Resin oil

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Cores are useful for features that cannot tolerate [[draft (engineering)|draft]] or to provide detail that cannot otherwise be integrated into a core-less casting or mold.&lt;ref name="degarmo311"/&gt;

The main disadvantage is the additional cost to incorporate cores.&lt;ref name="degarmo311"/&gt;

==Requirements==
There are seven requirements for cores:&lt;ref name="degarmo312"/&gt;

#Green strength: In the green condition, there must be adequate strength for handling
#In the hardened state, it must be strong enough to handle the forces of casting; therefore, the compression strength should be 100 to 300 psi (0.69 to 2.07 MPa).
#[[Permeability (foundry sand)|Permeability]] must be very high to allow for the escape of gases.
#Friability: As the casting or molding cools, the core must be weak enough to break down as the material shrinks. Moreover, they must be easy to remove during [[wikt:shakeout|shakeout]].
#Good [[refractoriness]] is required as the core is usually surrounded by hot metal during casting or molding.
#A smooth [[surface finish]].
#Minimum generation of gases during metal pouring.

==Types==
Many types of cores are available. The selection of the correct type of core depends on production quantity, production rate, required precision, required surface finish, and the type of metal being used. For example, certain metals are sensitive to gases that are given off by certain types of core sands; other metals have too low of a melting point to properly break down the binder for removal during the shakeout.&lt;ref name="degarmo312"/&gt;

===Green-sand cores===
[[File:Green sand cores.svg|thumb|Green-sand cores]]

''[[Molding sand|Green-sand]] cores makes casting long narrow features difficult or impossible. Even for long features that can be cast it still leave much material to be machined. A typical application is a through hole in a casting.&lt;ref name="degarmo312"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry-sand cores===
The simplest way to make a dry-sand cores is in a ''dump core box'', in which sand is packed into the box and scraped level with the top. A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core segments are then [[hot glue]]d together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are [[filing (metalworking)|filed]] or [[sanding|sanded]] down. Finally, the core is lightly coated with [[graphite]], [[silica]], or [[mica]] to give a smoother [[surface finish]] and greater resistance to heat.&lt;ref name="degarmo312"/&gt;
''Single-piece cores'' do not need to be assembled because they are made in a ''split core box''. A split core box, like it sounds, is made of two halves and has at least one hole for sand to be introduced. For simple cores that have constant cross-sections they can be created on special core-producing [[extruding|extruders]]. The extrusions are then cut to the proper length and hardened. More complex single-piece cores can be made in a manner similar to [[injection molding]]s and [[die casting]]s.&lt;ref name="degarmo312"/&gt;

Types of core:
*Cold Box
*half core box
*dump core box
*split core box
*left and right core box
*gang core box
*strickle core box
*loose piece core box

===Lost cores===
{{Main|Fusible core injection molding}}

Cores are used for complex [[injection molding]]s in the [[fusible core injection molding]] process. First, a core is made from a [[fusible alloy]] or low melting temperature [[polymer]]. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is shot into the mold. The molding is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of the molding in a hot bath.

==Binders==
Special ''binders'' are introduced into core sands to add strength. The oldest binder was [[vegetable oil]], however now [[synthetic oil]] is used, in conjunction with [[cereal]] or [[clay]]. The core is then baked in a [[convection oven]] between {{convert|200|and|250|C|F}}. The heat causes the binder to [[cross-link]] or [[polymerize]]. While this process is simple, the dimensional accuracy is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|pp=312–313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of binder process is called the ''hot-box process'', which uses a [[thermoset]] and [[catalyst]] for a binder. The sand with the binder is packed into a core box that is heated to approximately {{convert|230|C|F|abbr=on}} (which is where the name originated from). The binder that touches the hot surface of the core box begins to [[cure]] within 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;seconds. Depending on the type of binder it may require further baking to fully cure.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cores produced using this method are sometimes referred to as "shell-core" because often, only the outside layer of the core is hardened when in contact with the hot corebox. When the corebox is opened and the core removed, the uncured sand inside the core is dumped out to be reused. This practice can also be observed in some cold-box coremaking practices, though cold box shell-core making is much less common.

In a similar vein, the ''cold-box process'' uses a binder that is hardened through the use of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. [[amine]] gas) or odorous (i.e. [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), so special handling systems must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt; For example, a cold-box sand casting core binder is [[sodium silicate]] which hardens on exposure to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="bcs"&gt;{{Citation |title= Sodium silicate for core making |url= http://www.budgetcastingsupply.com/Sodium_Silicate.php |accessdate= 2009-08-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Special binders are used in ''air-set sands'' to produce core at room temperature. These sands do not require a gas catalyst because organic binders and a curing catalyst are mixed together in the sand which initiates the curing process. The only disadvantage with this is that after the catalyst is mixed in there is a short time to use the sand. A third way to produce room temperature cores is by [[shell molding]].&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt;

The term ''no-bake sands'' can refer to either the cold-box process or air-set process.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcs"/&gt;

===Other considerations===
To increase the strength of cores internal wires and rods can be added. To enhance collapsibility, straw can be added to the middle of the core or a hollow core can be used. This attribute is especially important for steel casting because a large amount of shrinkage occurs.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt;

Except for very small cores, all cores require vent holes to release gases. These are usually formed by using small wires to create holes from the surface of the mold to the core. When this is not feasible [[cinder]] and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] can be added to the core to increase permeability.&lt;ref name="degarmo313"/&gt;

==Chaplets==&lt;!-- [[Chaplet (metallurgy)]] links here --&gt;
[[File:Chaplets.svg|thumb|340px&lt;!-- Image must be larger than 332 to display correctly --&gt;|A diagram of chaplet usage]]
[[File:Types of chaplets.png|thumb|Various types of chaplets.]]

If Fub≤0, no chaplet is used.

If Fub&gt;0, chaplets is used.

As mentioned earlier, cores are usually supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means are required to support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied in the form of ''chaplets''. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create weak spots in the casting.&lt;ref name="degarmo314"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will tend to float upward in the molten metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Palmer |first= Reginald Heber |title= Foundry practice |page= 162 |publisher= Wiley |year= 1911 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0qBIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA162 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cheeks==
[[File:Casting cheek.svg|thumb|left|340px&lt;!-- This image must be larger than 332px to display correctly --&gt;|A cheek used to create a pulley]]

When casting a reentrant angle, instead of using a core a ''cheek'' can be used. This is a third segment in the [[flask (casting)|flask]], in addition to the [[cope and drag]]. This allows the entire mold to be made from green sand and from removable patterns. The disadvantage of this is more mold-making operations are required, but it is usually advantageous when the quantities are low. However, if large quantities of casting are required, it is usually more cost effective to simply use a core.&lt;ref name="degarmo314"/&gt;

'''Data cleansing''' or '''data cleaning''' is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate [[Storage record|records]] from a record set, [[Table (database)|table]], or [[database]] and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the [[dirty data|dirty]] or coarse data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2013 |last1=Wu |first1 = S. |title= A review on coarse warranty data and analysis | journal = Reliability Engineering and System |volume = 114 |pages=1–11 |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832013000100 |doi=10.1016/j.ress.2012.12.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data cleansing may be performed [[interactively]] with [[data wrangling]] tools, or as [[batch processing]] through [[script (computing)|script]]ing.

After cleansing, a [[data set]] should be consistent with other similar data sets in the system. The inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by user entry errors, by corruption in transmission or storage, or by different [[data dictionary]] definitions of similar entities in different stores. Data cleaning differs from [[data validation]] in that validation almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at the time of entry, rather than on batches of data.
;
The actual process of data cleansing may involve removing [[typographical error]]s or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. The validation may be strict (such as rejecting any address that does not have a valid [[postal code]]) or [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] (such as correcting records that partially match existing, known records). Some data cleansing solutions will clean data by cross checking with a validated data set. A common data cleansing practice is data enhancement, where data is made more complete by adding related information. For example, appending addresses with any phone numbers related to that address. Data cleansing may also involve activities like, harmonization of data, and standardization of data. For example, harmonization of short codes (st, rd, etc.) to actual words (street, road, etcetera). Standardization of data is a means of changing a reference data set to a new standard, ex, use of standard codes.

== Motivation ==
Administratively, incorrect or inconsistent data can lead to false conclusions and misdirected [[investment]]s on both public and private scales. For instance, the [[government]] may want to analyze population census figures to decide which regions require further spending and investment on [[infrastructure]] and services. In this case, it will be important to have access to reliable data to avoid erroneous fiscal decisions. In the business world, incorrect data can be costly. Many companies use customer information [[database]]s that record data like contact information, addresses, and preferences. For instance, if the addresses are inconsistent, the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers. The profession of forensic accounting and fraud investigating uses data cleansing in preparing its data and is typically done before data is sent to a data warehouse for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Nigrini, M. Forensic Analytics: Methods and Techniques for Forensic Accounting Investigations, Wiley. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There are packages available so you can cleanse/wash address data while you enter it into your system. This is normally done via an [[application programming interface]] (API).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171204114529/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/importance-data-cleansing-user-generated-content The importance of data cleansing user-generated-content] Published by spotlessdata.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data quality ==
High-quality data needs to pass a set of quality criteria. Those include:

* '''Validity''': The degree to which the measures conform to defined business rules or constraints (see also [[Validity (statistics)]]). When modern database technology is used to design data-capture systems, validity is fairly easy to ensure: invalid data arises mainly in legacy contexts (where constraints were not implemented in software) or where inappropriate data-capture technology was used (e.g., spreadsheets, where it is very hard to limit what a user chooses to enter into a cell, if cell validation is not used). Data constraints fall into the following categories:
** ''Data-Type Constraints'' – e.g., values in a particular column must be of a particular datatype, e.g., Boolean, numeric (integer or real), date, etc.
** ''Range Constraints:'' typically, numbers or dates should fall within a certain range. That is, they have minimum and/or maximum permissible values.
** ''Mandatory Constraints:'' Certain columns cannot be empty.
** ''Unique Constraints:'' A field, or a combination of fields, must be unique across a dataset. For example, no two persons can have the same social security number.
** ''Set-Membership constraints'': The values for a column come from a set of discrete values or codes. For example, a person's gender may be Female, Male or Unknown (not recorded).
** ''Foreign-key constraints'': This is the more general case of set membership. The set of values in a column is defined in a column of another table that contains unique values. For example, in a US taxpayer database, the "state" column is required to belong to one of the US's defined states or territories: the set of permissible states/territories is recorded in a separate States table. The term [[foreign key]] is borrowed from relational database terminology.
** Regular expression patterns: Occasionally, text fields will have to be validated this way. For example, phone numbers may be required to have the pattern (999) 999-9999.
** Cross-field validation: Certain conditions that utilize multiple fields must hold. For example, in laboratory medicine, the sum of the components of the differential white blood cell count must be equal to 100 (since they are all percentages). In a hospital database, a patient's date of discharge from hospital cannot be earlier than the date of admission.
* '''Accuracy''': The degree of conformity of a measure to a standard or a true value - see also [[Accuracy and precision]]. Accuracy is very hard to achieve through data-cleansing in the general case, because it requires accessing an external source of data that contains the true value: such "gold standard" data is often unavailable. Accuracy has been achieved in some cleansing contexts, notably customer contact data, by using external databases that match up zip codes to geographical locations (city and state), and also help verify that street addresses within these zip codes actually exist.
* '''Completeness''': The degree to which all required measures are known. Incompleteness is almost impossible to fix with data cleansing methodology: one cannot infer facts that were not captured when the data in question was initially recorded. (In some contexts, e.g., interview data, it may be possible to fix incompleteness by going back to the original source of data, i,e., re-interviewing the subject, but even this does not guarantee success because of problems of recall - e.g., in an interview to gather data on food consumption, no one is likely to remember exactly what one ate six months ago. In the case of systems that insist certain columns should not be empty, one may work around the problem by designating a value that indicates "unknown" or "missing", but supplying of default values does not imply that the data has been made complete.
* '''Consistency''': The degree to which a set of measures are equivalent in across systems (see also [[Consistency]]). Inconsistency occurs when two data items in the data set contradict each other: e.g., a customer is recorded in two different systems as having two different current addresses, and only one of them can be correct. Fixing inconsistency is not always possible: it requires a variety of strategies - e.g., deciding which data were recorded more recently, which data source is likely to be most reliable (the latter knowledge may be specific to a given organization), or simply trying to find the truth by testing both data items (e.g., calling up the customer).
* '''Uniformity''': The degree to which a set data measures are specified using the same units of measure in all systems ( see also [[Units of measurement|Unit of measure]]). In datasets pooled from different locales, weight may be recorded either in pounds or kilos, and must be converted to a single measure using an arithmetic transformation.

The term '''integrity''' encompasses accuracy, consistency and some aspects of validation (see also [[data integrity]]) but is rarely used by itself in data-cleansing contexts because it is insufficiently specific. (For example, "[[referential integrity]]" is a term used to refer to the enforcement of foreign-key constraints above.)

== Process ==
* '''Data auditing''': The data is audited with the use of [[statistical]] and database methods to detect anomalies and contradictions: this eventually gives an indication of the characteristics of the anomalies and their locations. Several commercial software packages will let you specify constraints of various kinds (using a grammar that conforms to that of a standard programming language, e.g., JavaScript or Visual Basic) and then generate code that checks the data for violation of these constraints. This process is referred to below in the bullets "workflow specification" and "workflow execution." For users who lack access to high-end cleansing software, Microcomputer database packages such as Microsoft Access or File Maker Pro will also let you perform such checks, on a constraint-by-constraint basis, interactively with little or no programming required in many cases.
* '''Workflow specification''': The detection and removal of anomalies is performed by a sequence of operations on the data known as the workflow. It is specified after the process of auditing the data and is crucial in achieving the end product of high-quality data. In order to achieve a proper workflow, the causes of the anomalies and errors in the data have to be closely considered.
* '''Workflow execution''': In this stage, the workflow is executed after its specification is complete and its correctness is verified. The implementation of the workflow should be efficient, even on large sets of data, which inevitably poses a trade-off because the execution of a data-cleansing operation can be computationally expensive.
* '''Post-processing and controlling''': After executing the cleansing workflow, the results are inspected to verify correctness. Data that could not be corrected during execution of the workflow is manually corrected, if possible. The result is a new cycle in the data-cleansing process where the data is audited again to allow the specification of an additional workflow to further cleanse the data by automatic processing.

Good quality source data has to do with “Data Quality Culture” and must be initiated at the top of the organization. It is not just a matter of implementing strong validation checks on input screens, because almost no matter how strong these checks are, they can often still be circumvented by the users. There is a nine-step guide for organizations that wish to improve data quality:&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, R., Ross, M., Thornthwaite, W., Mundy, J., Becker, B. ''The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit'', Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-470-14977-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J. E. ''Data Quality: The Accuracy Dimension", [[Morgan Kaufmann]], 2002. {{ISBN|1-55860-891-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Declare a high level commitment to a [[data quality]] culture
* Drive process reengineering at the executive level
* Spend money to improve the data entry environment
* Spend money to improve application integration
* Spend money to change how processes work
* Promote end-to-end team awareness
* Promote interdepartmental cooperation
* Publicly celebrate data quality excellence
* Continuously measure and improve data quality

Others include:
* '''Parsing''':  for the detection of syntax errors. A parser decides whether a string of data is acceptable within the allowed data specification. This is similar to the way a parser works with [[grammars]] and [[languages]].
* '''Data transformation''': Data transformation allows the mapping of the data from its given format into the format expected by the appropriate application. This includes value conversions or translation functions, as well as normalizing numeric values to conform to minimum and maximum values.
* '''Duplicate elimination''': Duplicate detection requires an [[algorithm]] for determining whether data contains duplicate representations of the same entity. Usually, data is sorted by a key that would bring duplicate entries closer together for faster identification.
* '''Statistical methods''': By analyzing the data using the values of [[mean]], [[standard deviation]], [[range (statistics)|range]], or [[cluster analysis|clustering]] algorithms, it is possible for an expert to find values that are unexpected and thus erroneous. Although the correction of such data is difficult since the true value is not known, it can be resolved by setting the values to an average or other statistical value. Statistical methods can also be used to handle missing values which can be replaced by one or more plausible values, which are usually obtained by extensive data augmentation algorithms.

==System==
The essential job of this system is to find a suitable balance between fixing [[dirty data]] and maintaining the data as close as possible to the original data from the source production system. This is a challenge for the [[Extract, transform, load]] architect. The system should offer an architecture that can cleanse data, record quality events and measure/control quality of data in the [[data warehouse]]. A good start is to perform a thorough [[data profiling]] analysis that will help define to the required complexity of the data cleansing system and also give an idea of the current data quality in the source system(s).

== Tools ==
There are lots of data cleansing tools like [[Trifacta]], [[OpenRefine]], [[Paxata]], [[Alteryx]], and others. It's also common to use libraries like [[Pandas (software)]] for [[Python (programming language)]], or [http://dplyr.tidyverse.org Dplyr] for [[R (programming language)]]. 

One example of a data cleansing for distributed systems under [[Apache Spark]] is called [https://hioptimus.com Optimus], an [[Open-source model|OpenSource]] framework for laptop or cluster allowing pre-processing, cleansing, and exploratory data analysis.  It includes several data wrangling tools.

==Quality screens==
Part of the data cleansing system is a set of diagnostic filters known as quality screens. They each implement a test in the data flow that, if it fails records an error in the Error Event Schema. Quality screens are divided into three categories:
* Column screens. Testing the individual column, e.g. for unexpected values like [[Null character|NULL]] values; non-numeric values that should be numeric; out of range values; etc.
* Structure screens. These are used to test for the integrity of different relationships between columns (typically foreign/primary keys) in the same or different tables. They are also used for testing that a group of columns is valid according to some structural definition to which it should adhere.
* Business rule screens. The most complex of the three tests. They test to see if data, maybe across multiple tables, follow specific business rules. An example could be, that if a customer is marked as a certain type of customer, the business rules that define this kind of customer should be adhered to.

When a quality screen records an error, it can either stop the dataflow process, send the faulty data somewhere else than the target system or tag the data.
The latter option is considered the best solution because the first option requires, that someone has to manually deal with the issue each time it occurs and the second implies that data are missing from the target system ([[integrity]]) and it is often unclear what should happen to these data.

==Criticism of existing tools and processes==
Most data cleansing tools have limitations in usability:
* '''Project costs''': costs typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars
* '''Time''': mastering large-scale data-cleansing software is time-consuming
* '''Security''': cross-validation requires sharing information, giving an application access across systems, including sensitive legacy systems

==Error event schema==
The Error Event schema holds records of all error events thrown by the quality screens. It consists of an Error Event [[Fact table]] with [[foreign key]]s to three dimension tables that represent date (when), [[batch job]] (where) and screen (who produced error). It also holds information about exactly when the error occurred and the severity of the error. In addition there is an Error Event Detail [[Fact table]] with a [[foreign key]] to the main table that contains detailed information about in which table, record and field the error occurred and the error condition.

== Challenges and problems ==
* '''Error correction and loss of information''': The most challenging problem within data cleansing remains the correction of values to remove [[data redundancy|duplicate]]s and invalid entries. In many cases, the available information on such anomalies is limited and insufficient to determine the necessary transformations or corrections, leaving the deletion of such entries as a primary solution. The deletion of data, though, leads to [[Data loss|loss of information]]; this loss can be particularly costly if there is a large amount of deleted data.
* '''Maintenance of cleansed data''': Data cleansing is an expensive and time-consuming process. So after having performed data cleansing and achieving a data collection free of errors, one would want to avoid the re-cleansing of data in its entirety after some values in data collection change. The process should only be repeated on values that have changed; this means that a cleansing lineage would need to be kept, which would require efficient data collection and management techniques.
* '''Data cleansing in virtually integrated environments''': In virtually integrated sources like [[IBM]]’s DiscoveryLink, the cleansing of data has to be performed every time the data is accessed, which considerably increases the response time and lowers efficiency.
* '''Data-cleansing framework''': In many cases, it will not be possible to derive a complete data-cleansing graph to guide the process in advance. This makes data cleansing an [[iterative]] process involving significant exploration and interaction, which may require a framework in the form of a collection of methods for error detection and elimination in addition to data auditing. This can be integrated with other data-processing stages like integration and maintenance.

A '''digital strategy''' is a form of&amp;nbsp;[[strategic management]] and a business answer or response to a digital question,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/dave-aron/2013/11/12/the-difference-between-it-strategy-and-digital-strategy/|title=The Difference Between IT Strategy and Digital Strategy - Dave Aron|date=2013-11-12|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; often best addressed as part of an overall [[business strategy]]. A digital strategy is often characterized by the application of new technologies to existing business activity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blogs-digital-what-is-digital-strategy|title=What Is A Digital Strategy? - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or a focus on the enablement of new digital capabilities to their business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/what-we-think/digitization/digital-strategy-capabilities|title=Digitization {{!}} Digital strategy and capabilities to win in a digitized world {{!}} PwC’s Strategy&amp;|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as those created by the&amp;nbsp;[[Information Age]]&amp;nbsp;and often as a result of advancements in digital technologies such as&amp;nbsp;[[Digital computers|computers]],&amp;nbsp;[[Digital data|data]],&amp;nbsp;[[telecommunication]]s,&amp;nbsp;[[Internet]], etc.). As is the case with its&amp;nbsp;[[business strategy]]&amp;nbsp;parent, a digital strategy can be formulated and implemented through a variety of different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Business_Strategy/Approaches_to_Strategic_Management|title=Business Strategy/Approaches to Strategic Management - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulation often includes the process of specifying an organization's vision, goals, opportunities and related activities in order to maximize the business benefits of digital initiatives to an organization. These can range from an enterprise focus, which considers the broader opportunities and risks digital can create and often includes&amp;nbsp;[[customer intelligence]], collaboration, new product/market exploration, sales and service optimization,&amp;nbsp;[[Enterprise architecture|enterprise technology architectures and processes]], innovation and governance; to more marketing and customer-focused efforts such as web sites, mobile,&amp;nbsp;[[E-commerce|eCommerce]], social, site and&amp;nbsp;[[search engine optimization]], and advertising.

==Overview==
The digital strategy is part of the business strategy and experts maintain that it cannot be effective or successful if built independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Marketing Strategy: An Integrated Approach to Online Marketing|last=Kingsnorth|first=Simon|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|year=2016|isbn=9780749474706|location=London|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that it represents how the business strategy is influenced by leveraging digital resources to create differential value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=10th European Conference on Information Systems Management: ECISM 2016|last=Silva|first=Paulo|last2=Guerreiro|first2=Antonio|last3=Quaresma|first3=Rui|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=9781911218050|location=Reading, UK|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, it reshapes traditional organizational strategies into modular, distributed, cross-functional, and global business processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There, are numerous approaches to conducting digital strategy, but at their core, all go through four steps:&lt;ref name="mash1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Macala|title=How to Develop Your Digital Strategy|url=http://mashable.com/2012/09/05/how-to-digital-strategy/|accessdate=2 November 2013|newspaper=Mashable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#identifying the opportunities and/or challenges in a business where online assets can provide a solution;
#identifying the unmet needs and goals of the external stakeholders that most closely align with those key business opportunities and/or challenges;&lt;ref&gt;Center for Digital Strategies (2003): ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/Programs/CorporateEvents/EnablingCustFocusdOrg/Overview_Article.pdf Enabling a Customer-Focused Organization: Thought Leadership Summit on Digital Strategies]'',  Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business and Cisco Systems&lt;/ref&gt; 
#developing a vision around how the online assets will fulfill those business and external stakeholder needs, goals, opportunities and challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Quinn (2006):  ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/PressHits/SCMQA.pdf Ready for the Digital Future?]'',pg. 30-31, Supply Chain Management Review.&lt;/ref&gt; and 
#prioritizing a set of online initiatives which can deliver on this vision.
Within each of those stages, a number of techniques and analyses may be employed.

===Identifying the key opportunities and/or challenges in a business===
*Stakeholder interviews
Includes one-on-one interviews, group interviews and workshops with a company's senior management, marketing and sales, operations and service stakeholders with a goal of understanding the business strategy, challenges and opportunities, products, organization, processes, supply chain and vendors, distributors, customers, and competitive landscape, as well as the potential role of their online assets.

*[[Competitor analysis]]
Includes evaluations of a company's main competitors and potential substitutes with the goal of understanding a company's strengths and weaknesses relative to their competitors and potential substitutes.  While this often includes steps found in traditional marketing competitor analysis, such as products, prices, etc.  Competitor analysis includes two unique items:

:#[[Heuristic evaluation]]: An evaluation by an expert of the usability and user experience of a company's online assets compared and contrasted to those of its competitors and potential substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen (2004):  ''[http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040119.html How Big is the Difference Between Websites?]'', Jakob Nielsen''s Alertbox.&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Features/functionality analysis: An evaluation of the features and functionality provided by a company's online assets, compared and contrasted to those of its competitors and potential substitutes.

*[[Financial analysis]]
An analysis of a company's financial data (which may include everything from public financial statements to private ERP data) with the goal of understanding the financial impact (positive and negative) that certain changes would have on a company.

*Bridge between business challenges and digital roadmap 
ASSIMPLER Blueprinting - The Business Blueprinting of the organization is designed based on the ASSIMPLER framework. ASSIMPLER stands for Availability, Scalability, Security, Interoperability, Maintainability, Performance, Low cost of ownership, Extendability and Reliability - applied to business services and processes. The framework helps model the business expectations and challenges to be addressed through the Digital Strategy.

===Identifying the unmet needs and goals of external stakeholders (consumers of online assets)===
*External stakeholder interviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalstrategies.tuck.dartmouth.edu/cds-uploads/case-studies/pdf/Norwegian.pdf | title=Case Studies | publisher=Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth | work=Vincent L. Lacorte Case Studies | date=2013 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author1=Sibley, Dave | author2=Johnson, Eric | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503055333/http://digitalstrategies.tuck.dartmouth.edu/cds-uploads/case-studies/pdf/Norwegian.pdf | archivedate=3 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Includes one-on-one interviews and focus groups with a company's external stakeholders, with a goal of understanding external stakeholders behaviours, needs, goals and perceptions of the company and their industry both in the broadest business context as well as specifically online.  In addition to standard marketing strategy methodologies and questions ([[Quantitative marketing research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative marketing research|qualitative]]), external stakeholder interviews for Digital Strategy may include [[usability testing]], an analysis of how effectively external stakeholders can use the online assets developed by a company for their intended purposes.  In digital strategy this is used to uncover usability barriers that may prevent the online vision being achieved.

*[[Ethnography|Ethnographic research]]
An analysis of external stakeholder behaviors in their environment, for example:  field observations of shoppers in a store.  In addition to standard ethnographic research, digital strategy research may include video recording of an external stakeholder using their computers or specific computer applications or web sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hbr.org/2009/03/ethnographic-research-a-key-to-strategy/ | title=Ethnographic Research: A Key to Strategy | publisher=Harvard Business Review | date=March 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Anderson, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Web analytics]]&lt;ref name="mash1"/&gt;
An analysis of the usage patterns of a company's online assets with the goal of better understanding external stakeholder behavior as well as identifying strengths and weakness of the company's current online offerings.  This may include understanding how many people are visiting a web site, what are the most popular pages, what are the most popular paths, where are people coming from, where do they drop off, how long do they stay, etc.

*Performance assessment: Review of effectiveness of current digital technologies.
*[[Path analysis (computing)|Funnel analysis]]
A specific methodology for web analytics where the company's online assets are modeled as a sales funnel, with a visit or impression representing a new lead, a certain page or action in the web site considered a conversion (such as a user hitting the purchase confirmation page) and specific pages in the web site representing specific stages of the sales funnel.  The goal of the analysis is to provide insight into the overall conversion rate as well as the key weak points of the funnel (the stages in which the largest percentages of users drop out of the funnel).&lt;ref&gt;Extra Paycheck Blog (2014):  ''[http://blog.extra-paycheck.com/wealthy-affiliate-review/ Online Business Training]'', Online Marketing.&lt;/ref&gt; This may also involve analysis of a company's [[search engine optimization]] situation and changes in online traffic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blissdrive.com/internet-marketing-tips/the-evolution-of-seo-how-digital-marketing-has-changed-in-the-last-5-years/ | title=The Evolution of SEO: How Digital Marketing Has Changed in the Last 5 Years | publisher=BlissDrive | date=27 March 2014 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Fong, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Analytical [[Customer relationship management|CRM]]
An analysis of a company's customer databases and information repositories with the goal of segmenting customers into homogeneous groups across one or more dimensions of behavior, demographics, value, product or marketing message affinity, etc.  In digital strategy this often includes the online customer registration database which companies use to provide access to their customer specific, protected areas.

*[[Multichannel marketing|Multichannel]] analysis
An analysis of a customer's behavior (such as their purchase or service behavior) that looks across all of the different channels, in which customers interact with a company's products or information.  There are lots of different ways to do this; a representative example would be, a company focuses on the customer purchase process (how a customer becomes aware of a product, how a customer develops the intent to purchase a product, and how a customer actually purchases the product).  The analysis would look at which channels (for example:  phone, catalog, retail store, web site, 3rd party search engine, etc.) a customer uses at which stage of the purchase process, attempting to understand why each channel is used, each channel's relative [[Attribution (marketing)|attribution]] and evaluating the company's strengths or weaknesses in that particular channel for the particular stage of the process.&lt;ref&gt;Bean (2001):  ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/Research/ExecutivePublications/ApplicationOfTechnology.pdf The Application of Technology to Marketing:  A Twenty Year Perspective]'',pg. 5, Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Statistical survey]]s
An approach to the collection of external stakeholder feedback in a quantitative manner from a large population.  In digital strategy, surveys may be used to validate or invalidate key questions raised in more qualitative exercises such as external stakeholder interviews and focus groups.  Depending on the breadth of the survey population and the degree of variation within the population, survey results may be segmented to form homogeneous groups across one or more dimensions of behavior, demographics, value, product or marketing message affinity, etc.  Surveys are often conducted online using web surveys, e-mail lists, or 3rd party panels, although phone surveys or other offline methods may sometimes be used when there are questions as to the online savviness of a particular target population.

===Developing a vision and prioritizing a set of online initiatives===
*[[Business plan]] or [[Business case|case]]
A spreadsheet with supporting documentation that quantifies the investments and returns over time, resulting from the execution of the online strategy.  The Business plan also defines the Key Performance Indicators [[Key performance indicator|(KPIs)]] that will be used to measure and evaluate the success of the online strategy.

*Technical assessment
A design of a technical architecture which will meet the needs of the business vision and conform to the business plan and roadmap.  This is often done as a [[gap analysis]] where the current technical architecture is assessed.  A future technical architecture, which meets the needs of the online vision, is designed.  The gaps between the current state and future state are identified, and a series of initiatives or projects to fill those gaps are developed and sequenced.

*Organizational and process assessment
Similar to a technical assessment, organizational and process assessments look at the changes that need to be made to an organization and its processes in order to achieve the online vision.  They may involve a series of [[business process reengineering]] projects focused on the areas of an organization most affected by the online initiatives.

*[[IT portfolio management|Portfolio management]]
A way of prioritizing various initiatives by comparing their cost of implementation with their expected business benefits.  This is often done by creating a two by two matrix where cost of implementation runs along the x-axis (from high cost to low cost) and expected business benefit runs along the y-axis, from low benefit to high benefit.  Individual initiatives or projects are then plotted on the matrix in terms of their calculated costs and benefits.  Priorities are then determined according to which projects will provide the greatest benefit for the lowest cost.

*Online media plan
A plan detailing the allocation of media spending across online media (such as [[search engine marketing]], [[banner advertising]], and [[affiliate marketing]]) usually as part of the customer acquisition or retention elements of the digital strategy. Since the late 2000s, [[social media]] has become increasingly important in engaging with customers both for marketing and customer support purposes, especially benefiting smaller businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jasper (2015): ''[http://digitalmarketingmagazine.co.uk/articles/the-increasing-importance-of-real-time-marketing/2437 The Increasing Importance of Real-Time Marketing]''. Digitalmarketingmagazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Proof of concept
Graphical representations or an outline of key ideas or processes of the digital strategy.  These are often created in order to better communicate a key concept or to build excitement among stakeholders when building consensus or socializing a digital strategy.

*Roadmap
A high-level project plan which details the durations and dependencies of all the initiatives in the digital strategy.  The roadmap will often include checkpoints to assess the progress and success of the digital strategy, over time.

*Measurement plan
A description of the [[key performance indicators]] used to measure the effectiveness of the digital strategy as well as the process for collecting and sharing this information.  The measurement plan usually covers the financial, operational, and e-business metrics and their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Kim (2006):  ''[http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/0,7211,39552,00.html#heading4 Reinventing The Marketing Organization:  Customer Groups Should Trump Channels, Products, Or Geography]''. Forrester.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2006): ''[http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/0,7211,40808,00.html Leaders Take A Strategic Approach To Web Analytics]''. Forrester.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Governance model
The organizational structure, roles, and process description of the operational entity that will manage the initiatives in a digital strategy.  The governance model describes who is responsible for what, how decisions are made, how issues are escalated, and how information on the performance of the projects is communicated within the organization.

==Personas==
As of 2007, a trend in digital strategy is the use of [[persona (marketing)|personas]] as a framework for using customer information to prioritize online initiatives.  Personas are character sketches which represent a typical member of one customer segment and highlights their needs, goals and behaviors.  Because it is representative of a customer segment, it allows decision makers to prioritize various features based on the needs of the segment.  Because it is a character sketch, it is sometimes easier for decision makers to internalize the key needs of the segment than it would be by reading large quantities of information.  A typical approach is to create the segment based on customer analysis such as customer interviews, ethnographic research, and statistical surveys.  Then assemble key decision makers or stakeholders, present the findings of the personas, and use them to kick start a brainstorming session around different online initiatives which can meet the personas needs and goals.

==Execution==
Historically, execution of a business or digital strategy is done as a big bang, with large initiatives such as site redesigns and transactional systems taking 6–12 months to develop and often an additional 6–12 months before they deliver any results.  As of 2007, a trend has emerged where companies adopt a more iterative approach to rolling out their strategies, one which leverages a series of smaller tests, which are carefully measured and analyzed and used to modify or optimize the digital strategy.  An example of this test-measure-optimize-scale approach is that a company might take some key pages on their site and test a number of versions of those pages with different marketing messages, design approaches, user experience optimizations, navigation optimizations, and even new features and functions using a [[multivariate analysis|multivariate]] or A/B test.  The company would then identify the page which had the best combination of changes in terms of some key business metric (such as conversion), analyzing the results to understand which changes were most instrumental in affecting the high conversion rate, and applying those learnings to future pages and future tests ([[conversion optimization]]).  

The advantage of this approach is that in the long run, it tends to be more successful in delivering business results, because each step is measured and adjusted for.  In addition, it tends to favor smaller (less risky, less expensive) steps rather than larger (more risky, more expensive) initiatives before getting the payback.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport (2006):  ''Competing on Analytics'', Harvard Business Review, January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disadvantage is that over time this approach tends to converge on a solution ([[local optimum]]), not necessarily the best solution ([[global optimum]]) that might have been reached if a company starts from scratch instead of building each step on the previous one.  Another disadvantage is that although this solution tends to favor smaller, more incremental changes, there is often a larger up front cost to setting up all the measurement systems and staffing a company with the right analysts and change processes to react to these tests in a timely and effective manner.  As a result, companies often adopt a mix of big bang efforts augmented by some smaller, more iterative efforts as part of their overall strategy.  A person who is primarily focused on digital strategy may be referred to as a [[digital architect]] or digital strategist and a person who executes a digital strategy may be referred to as a [[digital marketing engineer]].

There are also several challenges when developing and implementing a digital strategy.

==Digital strategy vs. online strategy==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2010}}
The two terms, "digital strategy" and "online strategy", tend to be thrown out somewhat interchangeably. However, there is some consensus{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} around the differences between digital strategy and online strategy.  According to some,{{who|date=May 2014}} digital strategy refers to the strategy a company takes to become a digital company, where digital connotes deeper interactions with their customers, more customized and personalized offerings and interactions, data driven decision making, and organizational models and processes that are more reactive to changes in the company's environment. Online is a subset of digital, as there may be digital assets which are not online. In this context, a company may use the term online strategy to be limited to the development of plans to deploy their online assets to maximize business results and digital strategy to be the more transformative step of changing the organization, although the latter is also referred as a [[Digital_transformation | digital transformation strategy]]. &lt;ref&gt; Matt, Christian; Hess, Thomas; Benlian, Alexander (2015).

'''Entrepreneurship''' is the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often initially a [[small business]]. The people who create these businesses are called '''entrepreneurs'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=AK Yetisen|author2=LR Volpatti|author3=AF Coskun|author4=S Cho|author5=E Kamrani|author6=H Butt|author7=A Khademhos\\seini|author8=SH Yun|title=Entrepreneurship|journal=Lab Chip|volume=15|issue=18|pages=3638–3660|doi=10.1039/c5lc00577a|pmid=26245815|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/lc/c5lc00577a|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name="moves"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Riitta|last1=Katila|first2=Eric L.|last2=Chen|first3=Henning|last3=Piezunka|title=All the right moves: How entrepreneurial firms compete effectively|journal=Strategic Entrepreneurship Jnl|date=7 June 2012|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.1002/sej.1130|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~rkatila/new/pdf/KatilaSEJ12.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2017|pages=116–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurship has been described as the "capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks in order to make a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]".&lt;ref name="businessdictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/entrepreneurship.html#ixzz3xv9ci0nt|title=Business Dictionary definition|publisher=Business Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses, due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up, a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to "lack of funding, bad business decisions, an economic crisis, lack of market demand—or a combination of all of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224113|title=How to Properly Close Your Business|first=Mikal E.|last=Belicove|date=2 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader definition of the term is sometimes used, especially in the field of [[economics]]. In this usage, an Entrepreneur is an entity which has the ability to find and act upon opportunities to translate inventions or technology into new products: "The entrepreneur is able to recognize the commercial potential of the invention and organize the capital, talent, and other resources that turn an invention into a commercially viable innovation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Economics of Science and Technology|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=27|issue=2|page=157|doi=10.1023/A:1014382532639|year=2002|last1 = Audretsch|first1 = David B.|last2=Bozeman|first2=Barry|last3=Combs|first3=Kathryn L.|last4=Feldman|first4=Maryann|last5=Link|first5=Albert N.|last6=Siegel|first6=Donald S.|last7=Stephan|first7=Paula|last8=Tassey|first8=Gregory|last9=Wessner|first9=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the term "Entrepreneurship" also captures innovative activities on the part of established firms, in addition to similar activities on the part of new businesses.

== Elements ==
Entrepreneurship is the act of being an [[entrepreneur]], or "the owner or manager of a business enterprise who, by risk and initiative, attempts to make profits".&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|entrepreneur|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs act as managers and oversee the launch and growth of an enterprise. Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it "shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different—they change or transmute values.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessary. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.&lt;ref name="Shane"&gt;Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful innovation. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called "the gale of creative destruction" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.

The exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developing a [[business plan]]
* Hiring the [[human resources]]
* Acquiring financial and material resources
* Providing leadership
* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure
* [[Risk aversion]]

Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as "[[creative destruction]]" – launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches. For Schumpeter, the changes and "dynamic [[Economic equilibrium#Disequilibrium|disequilibrium]] brought on by the innovating entrepreneur [were] the norm of a healthy [[economy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/innovation/ambition.aspx|title= Entrepreneurial Ambition - Innovation Provincial Rankings - How Canada Performs|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While entrepreneurship is often associated with new, small, for-profit start-ups, entrepreneurial behavior can be seen in small-, medium- and large-sized firms, new and established firms and in for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, including voluntary-sector groups, [[charitable organization]]s and [[Civil service|government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Clifford|first1= Catherine|title= Why everyone will have to become an entrepreneur|url= https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/228176|website= entrepreneur.com|accessdate= 8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurship may operate within an [[entrepreneurship ecosystem]] which often includes:
* Government programs and services that promote entrepreneurship and support entrepreneurs and start-ups
* Non-governmental organizations such as small-business associations and organizations that offer advice and mentoring to entrepreneurs (e.g. through entrepreneurship centers or websites)
* Small-business [[advocacy organization]]s that lobby governments for increased support for entrepreneurship programs and more small business-friendly laws and regulations
* Entrepreneurship resources and facilities (e.g. [[business incubator]]s and [[seed accelerator]]s)
* Entrepreneurship education and training programs offered by schools, colleges and universities
* Financing (e.g. bank loans, [[venture capital financing]], [[angel investing]] and government and private foundation grants)&lt;ref name=VentureCapitalNY1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvca.org/research/venture-investment/|title=Venture Investment - Regional Aggregate Data|publisher=National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}}

In the 2000s, usage of the term "entrepreneurship" expanded to include how and why some individuals (or teams) identify opportunities, evaluate them as viable, and then decide to exploit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=S.|last2=Venkatraman|first2=S.|date=2000|title=The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=25|pages=217–226|doi=10.5465/amr.2000.2791611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used to discuss how people might use these opportunities to develop new products or services, launch new firms or industries, and create [[wealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brush|first1=C.|display-authors=etal|year=2003|title=Doctoral education in the field of entrepreneurship|journal=Journal of Management|volume=29|issue=3|pages=309–331|doi=10.1016/s0149-2063(03)00014-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrepreneurial process is uncertain because opportunities can only be identified after they have been exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramoglou|first1=S.|last2=Tsang|first2=E.W.K.|display-authors=etal|year=2016|title=A realist perspective of entrepreneurship: Opportunities as propensities|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=41|issue=3|pages=409–434|doi=10.5465/amr.2014.0281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs tend exhibit positive [[biases]] towards finding new possibilities and seeing unmet market needs, and a tendency towards risk-taking that makes them more likely to exploit [[Business opportunity|business opportunities]].&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S.X.

Cantillon considered the entrepreneur to be a risk taker who deliberately allocates resources to exploit opportunities in order to maximize the financial return.&lt;ref name="Cantillon, R. 1931"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cantillon |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Cantillon |year=1755 |title=Essai sur la nature du commerce en général |location=London |publisher=MacMillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson |first1=H. |last2=Jarillo |first2=J. |title=A Paradigm of Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurial Management, in |editor1-first=Álvaro |editor1-last=Cuervo|editor2-first=Domingo |editor2-last=Ribeiro|editor3-first=Salvador |editor3-last=Roig|work=Entrepreneurship: Concepts, Theory and Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2v-aWpdgoPQC |pg=5}}|date=26 May 2007|publisher=Springer Science Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-48543-8|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantillon emphasized the willingness of the entrepreneur to assume the risk and to deal with uncertainty, thus he drew attention to the function of the entrepreneur and distinguished between the function of the entrepreneur and the owner who provided the money.&lt;ref name="Cantillon, R. 1931"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Landström, H. 2005"&gt;• Landström, H. &amp; SpringerLink 2005, Pioneers in entrepreneurship and small business research, Springer Science+Business Media, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Baptiste Say also identified entrepreneurs as a driver for economic development, emphasizing their role as one of the collecting factors of production allocating resources from less to fields that are more productive. Both Say and Cantillon belonged to French school of thought and known as the physiocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enterprise: Entrepreneurship and Innovation|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7506-6920-7|location=|pages=5|last1=Lowe|first1=Robin|last2=Marriott|first2=Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating back to the time of the medieval [[guilds]] in Germany, a [[craftspeople|craftsperson]] required special permission to operate as an entrepreneur, the small proof of competence (''Kleiner Befähigungsnachweis''), which restricted training of apprentices to craftspeople who held a [[Meister]] certificate. This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Großer Befähigungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a [[Meister]] apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067–1101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
In the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word "entrepreneur" dates to the 1850, the term "entrepreneurship" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1976"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called "the gale of [[creative destruction]]" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]]. The idea that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in [[endogenous growth theory]]{{clarify|date=October 2013}} and as such continues to be debated in academic economics. An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.

For Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational, but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].

For Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production–possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1934"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.&lt;ref name="Landstrom2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for "entrepreneurs" as an economic activity creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

In the 2000s, entrepreneurship has been extended from its origins in for-profit businesses to include [[social entrepreneurship]], in which business goals are sought alongside social, environmental or humanitarian goals and even the concept of the [[political entrepreneur]].{{according to whom|date=August 2013}} Entrepreneurship within an existing firm or large organization has been referred to as [[intrapreneurship]] and may include corporate ventures where large entities "spin-off" subsidiary organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Scott Andrew |last=Shane |title=A General Theory of Entrepreneurship: The Individual-opportunity Nexus|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0FxO_Wsh30kC}}|year=2000|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78100-799-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs are leaders willing to take risk and exercise initiative, taking advantage of market opportunities by planning, organizing and deploying resources,{{sfn|Deakins|Freel|2009}} often by innovating to create new or improving existing products or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Johnson, D.

According to Paul Reynolds, founder of the [[Global Entrepreneurship Monitor]], "by the time they reach their retirement years, half of all working men in the United States probably have a period of self-employment of one or more years; one in four may have engaged in self-employment for six or more years. Participating in a new business creation is a common activity among U.S. workers over the course of their careers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul D.

Entrepreneurial activities differ substantially depending on the type of organization and creativity involved. Entrepreneurship ranges in scale from solo, part-time projects to large-scale undertakings that involve a team and which may create many jobs. Many "high value" entrepreneurial ventures seek [[venture capital]] or [[angel investor|angel funding]] ([[seed money]]) in order to raise [[capital (economics)|capital]] for building and expanding the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mark Van Osnabrugge |author2=Robert J. Robinson |title=Angel Investing |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-7879-5202-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations exist to support would-be entrepreneurs, including specialized government agencies, [[business incubator]]s (which may be for-profit, non-profit, or operated by a college or university), [[science park]]s and [[non-governmental organization]]s, which include a range of organizations including not-for-profits, charities, foundations and business advocacy groups (e.g. [[Chamber of commerce|Chambers of commerce]]). Beginning in 2008, an annual "[[Global Entrepreneurship Week]]" event aimed at "exposing people to the benefits of entrepreneurship" and getting them to "participate in entrepreneurial-related activities" was launched.{{who|date=October 2013}}

=== Relationship between small business and entrepreneurship ===
The term "entrepreneur" is often conflated with the term "[[small business]]" or used interchangeably with this term. While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner—or they have a small number of employees—and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s. In this way, the term "entrepreneur" may be more closely associated with the term "[[Startup company|startup]]". Successful entrepreneurs have the ability to lead a business in a positive direction by proper planning, to adapt to changing environments and understand their own strengths and weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://www.ondernemerstest.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ICSBv5.pdf|first1=Martyn P. |last1=Driessen |first2=Peter S. |last2=Zwart|title=The role of the entrepreneur in small business success: the  Entrepreneurship Scan|year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of entrepreneurs==
=== Ethnic ===
The term "ethnic entrepreneurship" refers to self-employed business owners who belong to racial or [[ethnic minority]] groups in the United States and Europe. A long tradition of academic research explores the experiences and strategies of ethnic entrepreneurs as they strive to integrate economically into mainstream U.S. or European society. Classic cases include Jewish merchants and tradespeople in large U.S. cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries as well as Chinese and Japanese small business owners (restaurants, farmers, shop owners) on the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Out Of Print : Ethnic Enterprise in America: Business and Welfare Among Chinese, Japanese, and Blacks : Ivan Light - University of California Press|url = http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|website = www.ucpress.edu|access-date = 2016-01-16|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161020162025/http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|archivedate = 2016-10-20|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, ethnic entrepreneurship has been studied in the case of Cuban business owners in Miami, Indian motel owners of the U.S. and Chinese business owners in [[Chinatown]]s across the United States. While entrepreneurship offers these groups many opportunities for economic advancement, self-employment and business ownership in the United States remain unevenly distributed along racial/ethnic lines.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Racialized Incorporation: The Effects of Race and Generational Status on Self-Employment and Industry-Sector Prestige in the United States|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/imre.12087/abstract|journal = International Migration Review|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1747-7379|pages = 318–354|volume = 49|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/imre.12087|first = Ali R.|last = Chaudhary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous success stories of Asian entrepreneurs, a recent statistical analysis of U.S. census data shows that whites are more likely than Asians, African-Americans and Latinos to be self-employed in high prestige, lucrative industries.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"/&gt;

=== Institutional ===
The American-born British economist [[Edith Penrose]] has highlighted the collective nature of entrepreneurship. She mentions that in modern organizations, human resources need to be combined in order to better capture and create business opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Edith T. (1959). The Theory of the Growth of the Firm. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Paul DiMaggio]] (1988:14) has expanded this view to say that "new institutions arise when organized actors with sufficient resources [institutional entrepreneurs] see in them an opportunity to realize interests that they value highly".&lt;ref&gt;DiMaggio, P. 1988 'Interest and agency in institutional theory'. In Institutional patterns and culture, L. Zucker (ed.), Cambridge, MA: Ballinger Publishing Company: 3-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion has been widely applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = D. | last2 = Scully | first2 = M. | year = 2007 | title = The institutional entrepreneur as modern prince: The strategic face of power in contested fields | url = | journal = Organization Studies | volume = 28 | issue = 7| pages = 971–991 | doi=10.1177/0170840607078109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan, F., K.

British Food Journal, vol. 116, p. 2-15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural ===
According to Christopher Rea and Nicolai Volland, cultural entrepreneurship is "practices of individual and collective agency characterized by mobility between cultural professions and modes of cultural production", which refers to creative industry activities and sectors. In their book ''[https://www.ubcpress.ca/the-business-of-culture The Business of Culture]'' (2015), Rea and Volland identify three types of cultural entrepreneur: "cultural personalities", defined as "individuals who buil[d] their own personal brand of creativity as a cultural authority and leverage it to create and sustain various cultural enterprises"; "tycoons", defined as "entrepreneurs who buil[d] substantial clout in the cultural sphere by forging synergies between their industrial, cultural, political, and philanthropic interests"; and "collective enterprises", organizations which may engage in cultural production for profit or not-for-profit purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea and Nicolai Volland, "The Business of Culture" (UBC Press, 2015), pp. 4-7. (See also pp. 9-31: "Enter the Cultural Entrepreneur")&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist===
A [[feminist]] entrepreneur is an individual who applies feminist values and approaches through entrepreneurship, with the goal of improving the quality of life and well-being of girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=22349|title=Feminine Capital: Unlocking the Power of Women Entrepreneurs|last=Orser|first=Barbara|last2=Elliott|first2=Catherine|date=2015-03-25|publisher=Stanford Business Books|year=|isbn=9780804783798|location=|pages=214|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are doing so by creating "for women, by women" enterprises.

===Social===
[[File:DSC 9963 (5431654949).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Student organizers from the Green Club at Newcomb College Institute formed a social entrepreneurship organization in 2010.]]
{{Main|Social entrepreneurship}}
Social entrepreneurship is the use of the by [[Startup company|start up companies]] and other [[entrepreneur]]s to develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150811030258/https://www.pbs.org/opb/thenewheroes/whatis/ ''The New Heros''], What is Social Entrepreneurship, Oregon Public Broadcasting, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This concept may be applied to a variety of organizations with different sizes, aims, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;"The Meaning of Social Entrepreneurship," J. Gregory Dees, 1998, rev 2001 {{cite web | publisher=caseatduke.org | title=The Meaning of Social Entrepreneurship | url=http://caseatduke.org/ | accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For-profit entrepreneurs typically measure performance using business metrics like [[Profit (economics)|profit]], [[revenues]] and increases in [[stock price]]s, but social entrepreneurs are either [[non-profit organization|non-profits]] or blend for-profit goals with generating a positive "return to society" and therefore must use different metrics. Social entrepreneurship typically attempts to further broad social, cultural, and environmental goals often associated with the [[voluntary sector]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = J.L. | year = 2002 | title = The World of the Social Entrepreneur | url = | journal = The International Journal of Public Sector Management | volume = 15 | issue = 4/5| page = 413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in areas such as poverty alleviation, [[health care]] and [[community development]]. At times, profit-making [[social enterprise]]s may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in itself. For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the [[homelessness|homeless]] may operate a [[restaurant]], both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless people.

===Nascent===
A nascent [[entrepreneur]] is someone in the process of establishing a business venture.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, P. D. and White, S. (1997). The Entrepreneurial Process. Westport, CT: Quorum Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In this observation, the nascent entrepreneur can be seen as pursuing an [[Business opportunity|opportunity]], i.e. a possibility to introduce new services or products, serve new markets, or develop more efficient production methods in a profitable manner.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, M., 1982. The entrepreneur: An economic theory. Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane, S. and Venkataraman, S. (2000). ‘The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research’. Academy of Management Review, 25, 217–26.&lt;/ref&gt; But before such a venture is actually established, the opportunity is just a venture idea.&lt;ref&gt;Davidsson, P. (2006). ‘Nascent entrepreneurship: empirical studies and developments’. Foundations and Trends in Entrepreneurship, 2, 1–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the pursued opportunity is perceptual in nature, propped by the nascent entrepreneur's personal beliefs about the feasibility of the venturing outcomes the nascent entrepreneur seeks to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Dimov, D. (2007b). ‘Beyond the single-person, single-insight attribution in understanding entrepreneurial opportunities’. Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 31, 713–31. ‘From opportunity insight to opportunity intention: the importance of person-situation learning match’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice|volume= 31|pages = 561–583|last = Dimov|first = Dimo|title = From Opportunity Insight to Opportunity Intention: The Importance of Person-Situation Learning Match|issue= 4|date = July 2007|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6520.2007.00188.x |ssrn=999462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, D. A., McMullen, J. S. and Jennings, P. D. (2007). ‘The formation of opportunity beliefs: overcoming ignorance and reducing doubt’. Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1, 75–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Its prescience and value cannot be confirmed ex ante but only gradually, in the context of the actions that the nascent entrepreneur undertakes towards establishing the venture,&lt;ref&gt;Sarasvathy, S. D. (2001). ‘Causation and effectuation: toward a theoretical shift from economic inevitability to entrepreneurial contingency’. Academy of Management Review, 26, 243–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, these actions can lead to a path that the nascent entrepreneur deems no longer attractive or feasible, or result in the emergence of a (viable) business. In this sense, over time, the nascent venture can move towards being discontinued or towards emerging successfully as an operating entity.

The distinction between the novice, serial and portfolio entrepreneurs is an example of behavior-based categorization.&lt;ref&gt;Ucbasaran, D., Westhead, P. and Wright, M., 2009. The extent and nature of opportunity identification by experienced entrepreneurs. Journal of business venturing, 24(2), pp.99-115.

Journal of Business Venturing, 22(2), 236–261.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the solitary act of exploiting an opportunity. Such research will help separate entrepreneurial action into its basic sub-activities and elucidate the inter- relationships between activities, between an activity (or sequence of activities) and an individual's motivation to form an opportunity belief, and between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge needed to form an opportunity belief. With this research, scholars will be able to begin constructing a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action.

Scholars interested in nascent entrepreneurship tend to focus less on the single act of opportunity exploitation and more on the series of actions in new venture emergence,&lt;ref name="Delmar, F 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, P.H., Longest, K.C. and Lippmann, S., 2015. The tortoise versus the hare: Progress and business viability differences between conventional and leisure-based founders. Journal of Business Venturing, 30(2), pp.185-204.&lt;/ref&gt;,.&lt;ref name="Lichtenstein, B. B. 2007"/&gt; Indeed, nascent entrepreneurs undertake numerous [[entrepreneurial]] activities, including actions that make their businesses more concrete to themselves and others. For instance, nascent entrepreneurs often look for and purchase facilities and equipment; seek and obtain financial backing, form [[legal entities]], organize teams; and dedicate all their time and energy to their business&lt;ref&gt;Carter, N.M., Gartner, W.B. and Reynolds, P.D., 1996. Exploring start-up event sequences. Journal of business venturing, 11(3), pp.151-166.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project-based ===
Project entrepreneurs are individuals who are engaged in the repeated assembly or creation of temporary organizations.&lt;ref name="Ferriani2009"&gt;Ferriani, S., Cattani, G., C. Baden-Fuller (2009) "The Relational Antecedents of Project-Entrepreneurship: Network Centrality, Team Composition, and Project Performance", Research Policy, 2009, 38 (10): 1545–1558.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlM1NabFZra1RiUDg/edit?usp=sharing]&lt;/ref&gt; These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where project-based enterprises are widespread include: [[sound recording]], [[film production]], [[software development]], television production, [[new media]] and construction.&lt;ref name="Faulkner1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkner | first1 = R. R. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = A. B. | year = 1987 | title = Short-term projects and emergent careers: evidence from Hollywood | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 92 | issue = 4| pages = 879–909 | doi=10.1086/228586}}&lt;/ref&gt; What makes project-entrepreneurs distinctive from a theoretical standpoint is that they have to "rewire" these temporary ventures and modify them to suit the needs of new project opportunities that emerge. A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model or team for a subsequent project.

Project entrepreneurs are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks typical of the entrepreneurial process.&lt;ref name="DeFillippi2004"&gt;DeFillippi, R., &amp; Spring, S. 2004 Project entrepreneurs for project-based enterprises: Extension or complement to project management competencies? Projects and Profits, 4(2): 50-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize the creation of a new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.

=== Millennial ===
The term "millennial entrepreneur" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media—the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who created [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/the-richest-millennial-entrepreneurs-in-america.htm.html|title=The 10 Richest Millennial Entrepreneurs in America|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=June 6, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the expectation of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.  The comparison between millennials who are self-employed and those who are not self-employed shows that the latter is higher. The reason for this is because they have grown up in a different generation and attitude than their elders. Some of the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs are the economy, debt from schooling and the challenges of regulatory compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Millenial_IB.pdf|title=The Missing Millennial Entrepreneurs|last=Wilmouth|first=Daniel|date=|website=U.S. Small Business Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurial behaviors ==
The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator—a designer of new ideas and business processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp ''Investopedia'']; Investopedia.com; access date.&lt;/ref&gt; Management skills and strong team building abilities are often perceived as essential leadership attributes for successful entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/19/top-10-qualities-that-make-a-great-leader | title=Top 10 Qualities That Make A Great Leader | first=Tanya | last=Prive | work=[[Forbes]] | date=19 December 2012 | accessdate=1 August 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020062832/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/19/top-10-qualities-that-make-a-great-leader | archivedate = 10 October 2017 | deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political economist [[Robert Reich]] considers leadership, management ability and [[team-building]] to be essential qualities of an entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard | last=Cantillon | title=Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général | year=1755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter F. | last=Drucker | title=Innovation and Entrepreneurship | year=1985}} attributes the coining and defining of "entrepreneur" to Jean-Baptiste Say in his ''A Treatise on Political Economy''; (1834).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertainty perception and risk-taking ===

Theorists [[Frank Knight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank Hyneman |last=Knight |authorlink=Frank H. Knight |title=Risk, Uncertainty and Profit|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-alYLsfnCXUC}}|year=2005|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59605-242-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Drucker]] defined entrepreneurship in terms of risk-taking. The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:
* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)
* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)
* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)

[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]
Entrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Zürich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Martínez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Coachability" and advice taking ===
The ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161–176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.

===Strategies===
Strategies that entrepreneurs may use include:
* [[Innovation]] of new products, services or processes&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Qureshi|first1=Hamid|title=Decoding Right Strategies for Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/decoding-right-strategies-for-entrepreneurship/195820.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|work=Greater Kashmir|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Continuous process improvement (CPI)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Exploration of new business models
* Use of technology&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Use of [[business intelligence]]
* Use of economical strategics
* Development of future products and services&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Optimized talent management&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Designing individual/opportunity nexus ===
According to Shane and Venkataraman, entrepreneurship comprises both "enterprising individuals" and "entrepreneurial opportunities", so researchers should study the nature of the individuals who identify opportunities when others do not, the opportunities themselves and the nexus between individuals and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2000.2791611 | title=THE PROMISE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A FIELD OF RESEARCH. | journal=Academy of Management Review | date=2000 | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=217–226 | first=S. | last=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Reynolds et al.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds PD, Hay M, Bygrave WD et al. (2002) Global Entrepreneurship Monitor: 2002 Global Executive Report. Kansas City, MO: Kauffman Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that individuals are motivated to engage in entrepreneurial endeavors driven mainly by necessity or opportunity, that is individuals pursue entrepreneurship primarily owing to survival needs, or because they identify business opportunities that satisfy their need for achievement. For example, higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level, suggesting that most entrepreneurial behavior is based on necessity rather than opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier-Oliveira et al. (1 July 2015). ''[http://hum.sagepub.com/content/68/7/1183.abstract What motivates entrepreneurial entry under economic inequality? The role of human and financial capital].''

=== Opportunity perception and biases===
The ability of entrepreneurs to [[Innovation|innovate]] relates to innate traits, including [[extroversion]] and a proclivity for [[risk-taking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why risk-taking is Important as an Entrepreneur|author=Mike Smith|url=http://www.bestbusinessbooks.store/entrepreneurship-business-blog/why-risk-taking-is-important-as-an-entrepreneur |publisher=Best Business Books Blog |accessdate=22 Aug 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010062710/http://www.bestbusinessbooks.store/entrepreneurship-business-blog/why-risk-taking-is-important-as-an-entrepreneur |archivedate=10 Oct 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Joseph Schumpeter]], the capabilities of innovating, introducing new technologies, increasing efficiency and productivity, or generating new products or services, are characteristic qualities of entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Dailybsness.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/The_basic_characteristics_of_a_successful_entrepreneur |title=The basic characteristics of a successful entrepreneur |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010062714/http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/The_basic_characteristics_of_a_successful_entrepreneur |archivedate=10 Oct 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has found that certain genes affecting personality may influence the income of self-employed people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shane | first1=S. | last2=Nicolaou | first2=N. | year=2013 | title=The genetics of entrepreneurial performance | journal=International Small Business Journal | volume=31 | issue=5 | pages=473–495 | doi=10.1177/0266242613485767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people may be able to use{{weasel inline|date=February 2015}} "an innate ability" or [[Spiral of silence#Quasi-statistical sense|quasi-statistical sense]] to gauge [[public opinion]]&lt;ref name= "Miller 2005:278"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets| Miller | 2005 | p = 278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and market demand for new products or services. Entrepreneurs tend to have the ability to see unmet market needs and underserved markets. While some entrepreneurs assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking, the [[mass media]] plays a crucial role in shaping views and demand.{{sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} Ramoglou argues that entrepreneurs are not that distinctive and that it is essentially poor conceptualizations of "non-entrepreneurs" that maintain laudatory portraits of "entrepreneurs" as exceptional innovators or leaders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ramoglou | first1=S. | year=2013 | url=http://isb.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/04/0266242611425838.abstract | title=Who is a 'non-entrepreneur'?

=== Styles===
Differences in entrepreneurial organizations often partially reflect their founders' [[heterogenous]] identities. Fauchart and Gruber have classified entrepreneurs into three main types: [[Charles Darwin|Darwinians]], [[Communitarianism|communitarians]] and [[Missionary|missionaries]]. These types of entrepreneurs diverge in fundamental ways in their self-views, social motivations and patterns of new firm creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fauchart | first1=E | last2=Gruber | first2=M. | year=2011 | title=Darwinians, Communitarians, and Missionaries: The Role of Founder Identify in Entrepreneurship | journal=Academy of Management Journal | volume=54 | issue=5 | pages=935–957 | doi=10.5465/amj.2009.0211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication ===
Entrepreneurs need to practice effective [[communication]] both within their firm and with external partners and investors in order to launch and growth a venture and enable it to survive. An entrepreneur needs a communication system that links the staff of her firm and connects the firm to outside firms and clients. Entrepreneurs should be [[charismatic leader]]s, so they can communicate a [[vision statement|vision]] effectively to their team and help to [[team building|create a strong team]]. Communicating a vision to followers may be well the most important act of the transformational leader.&lt;ref name="HackmanJohnson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackman|first=M.Z.|title=Leadership: A communication perspective|year=2009|publisher=Waveland|location=Long Grove, IL|edition=5th|author2=Johnson, C.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compelling visions provide employees with a sense of purpose and encourage commitment. According to Baum et al.&lt;ref name="Baum et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Robert J.|author2=Locke, Edwin A. |author3=Kirkpatrick, Shelley A. |title=A longitudinal study of the relation of vision and vision communication to venture growth in entrepreneurial firms.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1998|volume=83|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.83.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kouzes and Posner,&lt;ref name=Kouzes&gt;{{cite book|last=Kouzes|first=J.M|title=The leadership challenge: How to get extraordinary things done in organizations|year=1987|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|author2=Posner, B.Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vision must be communicated through written statements and through in-person communication. Entrepreneurial leaders must speak and listen to articulate their vision to others.&lt;ref name="Locke et al."&gt;{{cite book|last=Locke|first=E.A.|title=The essence of leadership|year=1991|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|author2=Kirkpatrick, S. |author3=Wheeler, J.K |author4=Schneider, J |author5=Niles, K. |author6=Goldstein, H |author7=Welsh, K |author8=Chah, D.O. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication is pivotal in the role of entrepreneurship because it enables leaders to convince potential investors, partners and employees about the feasibility of a venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=J.|author2=Cornelissen, J|title=Language, communication, and socially situated cognition in entrepreneurship.

The [[Communication Accommodation Theory]] posits that throughout communication people will attempt to accommodate or adjust their method of speaking to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=H|title=Language, social comparison and power. The handbook of communication science|year=1987|pages=350–384|author2=Wiemann, J.M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Face Negotiation Theory]] describes how people from different cultures manage conflict negotiation in order to maintain "[[face (sociological concept)|face]]".&lt;ref name="Ting Toomey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ting-Toomey|first=S|title=Toward a theory of conflict and culture in communication. Culture &amp; Organizational processes|year=1985|pages=71–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Rank's "intensify and downplay" communications model can be used by entrepreneurs who are developing a new product or service. Rank argues that entrepreneurs need to be able to intensify the advantages of their new product or service and downplay the disadvantages in order to persuade others to support their venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rank|first=H|title=Teaching about public persuasion|year=1976|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Links to sea piracy ====
Research from 2014 found links between entrepreneurship and historical sea [[piracy]]. In this context, the claim is made for a non-moral approach to looking at the history of piracy as a source of inspiration for entrepreneurship education&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, D. (2014) Disruptors are just pirates on the high seas of capitalism. ''The Globe and Mail Special on Business Education'', 5 November 2014.

== Psychological makeup ==
[[File:Steve Jobs Headshot 2010-CROP.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Apple co-founder and longtime leader [[Steve Jobs]] (pictured in 2010) led the introduction of many innovations in the computer, [[smartphone]] and digital music industry]]
[[Stanford University]] economist [[Edward Lazear]] found in a 2005 study that variety in education and work experience was the most important trait that distinguished entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Lazear |first = Edward | title = Entrepreneurship | publisher = Journal of Labor Economics |volume = 23| issue =  4 | date = 2005 | accessdate = 24 February 2015 |url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ521/orazem/Papers/Lazear_entrepreneurship.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study by Uschi Backes-Gellner of the [[University of Zurich]] and Petra Moog of the [[University of Siegen]] in Germany found that a diverse social network was also important in distinguishing students that would go on to become entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Backes-Ge1llner |first=Uschi |last2=Moog |first2 =Petra |title=The disposition to become an entrepreneur and the jacks-of-all-trades in social and human capital |volume=47 |date=December 2013 |pages = 55–72 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713001236 | accessdate= 24 February 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.socec.2013.08.008 | journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baer  |first=Drake |date= 19 February 2015 |accessdate= 25 February 2015|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/personality-difference-between-entrepreneurs-and-employees-2015-2#ixzz3SklQUxLd-2 |title=Scientists have discovered a personality difference between entrepreneurs and employees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that the psychological propensities for male and [[female entrepreneur]]s are more similar than different. [[Empirical studies]] suggest that female entrepreneurs possess strong negotiating skills and consensus-forming abilities.&lt;ref name= Entrepreneurship&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Paul|editor-last= Muljadi|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=eNy7hA-rvOUC}}|publisher=Paul Muljadi|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231164003/https://books.google.com/books?id=eNy7hA-rvOUC|archivedate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asa Hansson, who looked at empirical evidence from Sweden, found that the probability of becoming self-employed decreases with age for women, but increases with age for men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanssan|first=Asa|date=2012|title=Tax policy and entrepreneurship: empirical evidence from Sweden|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also found that marriage increased the probability of a person becoming an entrepreneur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jesper Sørensen wrote that significant influences on the decision to become an entrepreneur are workplace peers and social composition. Sørensen discovered a correlation between working with former entrepreneurs and how often these individuals become entrepreneurs themselves, compared to those who did not work with entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sørensen | first1=J. | last2=Nanda | first2=R. | url=http://www.edegan.com/pdfs/Nanda%20Sorensen%20(2010)%20-%20Workplace%20peers%20and%20entrepreneurship.pdf | title=Workplace Peers and Entrepreneurship | journal=Management Science | volume=56 | issue=7 | pages=1116–1126 | date=July 2010 | accessdate=30 June 2013 | doi = 10.1287/mnsc.1100.1179 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171010062717/http://www.edegan.com/pdfs/Nanda%20Sorensen%20(2010)%20-%20Workplace%20peers%20and%20entrepreneurship.pdf | archivedate = 10 October 2017 | deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social composition can influence entrepreneurialism in peers by demonstrating the possibility for success, stimulating a "He can do it, why can't I?" attitude. As Sørensen stated: "When you meet others who have gone out on their own, it doesn't seem that crazy".&lt;ref name="sorensen_interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/sorensen_peers.html | title=Peers Influence Decision to Become an Entrepreneur | publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business; News | date=1 September 2009 | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurs may also be driven to entrepreneurship by past experiences. If they have faced multiple work stoppages or have been unemployed in the past, the probability of them becoming an entrepreneur increases&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Per Cattell's personality framework, both personality traits and attitudes are thoroughly investigated by psychologists. However, in case of entrepreneurship research these notions are employed by academics too, but vaguely. According to Cattell, personality is a system that is related to the environment and further adds that the system seeks explanation to the complex transactions conducted by both—traits and attitudes. This is because both of them bring about change and growth in a person. Personality is that which informs what an individual will do when faced with a given situation. A person's response is triggered by his/her personality and the situation that is faced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Entrepreneurship#http://www.nyenrode.com/FacultyResearch/research/Documents/Research Paper Series/2007/07-04.pdf?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR]], Retrieved 17 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovative entrepreneurs may be more likely to experience what psychologist [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] calls "[[flow (psychology)|flow]]". "Flow" occurs when an individual forgets about the outside world due to being thoroughly engaged in a process or activity. Csikszentmihalyi suggested that breakthrough innovations tend to occur at the hands of individuals in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mihaly |last=Csikszentmihalyi|title=Flow|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=epmhVuaaoK0C}}|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-187672-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has concluded that a strong internal motivation is a vital ingredient for breakthrough innovation.&lt;ref name="ChristensenJohnson2008"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Clayton |last1=Christensen|first2=Curtis W. |last2=Johnson|first3=Michael B. |last3=Horn|title=Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wiBcUl44FEcC}}|date=14 May 2008|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-164174-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow can be compared to [[Maria Montessori]]'s concept of normalization, a state that includes a child's capacity for joyful and lengthy periods of intense concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Absorbent Mind|year=1967|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Csikszentmihalyi acknowledged that Montessori's prepared environment offers children opportunities to achieve flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rathunde|first=Kevin|first2=Mihaly |last2=Csikszentmihalyi|title=Middle School Students' Motivation and Quality of Experience: A Comparison of Montessori and Traditional School Environments|journal=American Journal of Education|date=May 2005|volume=111|issue=3|pages=341–371|doi=10.1086/428885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus quality and type of early education may influence entrepreneurial capability.

Research on high-risk settings such as oil platforms, investment banking, medical surgery, aircraft piloting and nuclear power plants has related distrust to failure avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conchie | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Donald | first2 = I. J. | year = 2007 | title = The functions and development of safety-specific trust and distrust | url = | journal = Safety Science | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 92–103 | doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2007.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When non-routine strategies are needed, distrusting persons perform better while when routine strategies are needed trusting persons perform better. This research was extended to entrepreneurial firms by Gudmundsson and Lechner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gudmundsson | first1 = S.V. | last2 = Lechner | first2 = C. | year = 2013 | title = Cognitive Biases, Organization, and Entrepreneurial Firm Survival | url = | journal = European Management Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 278–294 | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2013.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that in entrepreneurial firms the threat of failure is ever present resembling non-routine situations in high-risk settings. They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs were more likely to survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs. The reasons were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure avoidance through sensible task selection and more analysis. Kets de Vries has pointed out that distrusting entrepreneurs are more alert about their external environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kets de Vries | first1 = M. | year = 2003 | title = The entrepreneur on the couch | url = | journal = INSEAD Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 17–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that distrusting entrepreneurs are less likely to discount negative events and are more likely to engage control mechanisms. Similarly, Gudmundsson and Lechner found that distrust leads to higher precaution and therefore increases chances of entrepreneurial firm survival.

Researchers Schoon and Duckworth completed a study in 2012 that could potentially help identify who may become an entrepreneur at an early age. They determined that the best measures to identify a young entrepreneur are family and social status, parental role modeling, entrepreneurial competencies at age 10, academic attainment at age 10, generalized self-efficacy, social skills, entrepreneurial intention and experience of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoon|first1=Ingrid|last2=Duckworth|first2=Kathryn|title=Who becomes an entrepreneur? Early life experiences as predictors of entrepreneurship.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2012|volume=48|issue=6|pages=1719–1726|doi=10.1037/a0029168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic===
Some scholars have constructed an operational definition of a more specific subcategory called "Strategic Entrepreneurship". Closely tied with principles of strategic management, this form of entrepreneurship is "concerned about growth, creating value for customers and subsequently creating wealth for owners".&lt;ref name="Hitt, M. A. 2011"&gt;Hitt, M. A., Ireland, R., Sirmon, D. G., &amp; Trahms, C. A. (2011). ''Strategic Entrepreneurship: Creating Value for Individuals, Organizations, and Society''. Academy of Management Perspectives, 25(2), 57-75. {{doi|10.5465/AMP.2011.61020802}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 article for the Academy of Management provided a three-step, "Input-Process-Output" model of strategic entrepreneurship. The model's three steps entail the collection of different resources, the process of orchestrating them in the necessary manner and the subsequent creation of competitive advantage, value for customers, wealth and other benefits. Through the proper use of strategic management/leadership techniques and the implementation of risk-bearing entrepreneurial thinking, the strategic entrepreneur is therefore able to align resources to create value and wealth.&lt;ref name="Hitt, M. A. 2011"/&gt;

=== Leadership ===
Leadership in entrepreneurship can be defined as "process of social influence in which one person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chemers|first=M.|title=An integrative theory of leadership|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|isbn=978-0-8058-2679-1|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; in "one who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen in an effort to transform innovations into economic goods".&lt;ref name="Shane"/&gt; This refers to not only the act of entrepreneurship as managing or starting a business, but how one manages to do so by these social processes, or leadership skills. Entrepreneurship in itself can be defined as "the process by which individuals, teams, or organizations identify and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities without being immediately constrained by the resources they currently control".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hitt, M. A., Ireland, R. D., Hoskisson, R. E.. (2011). ''Strategic Management''. (9th ed.). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; An entrepreneur typically has a mindset that seeks out potential opportunities during uncertain times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; An entrepreneur must have leadership skills or qualities  to see potential opportunities and act upon them. At the core, an entrepreneur is a decision maker. Such decisions often affect an organization as a whole, which is representative of their leadership amongst the organization.

With the growing global market and increasing technology use throughout all industries, the core of entrepreneurship and the decision-making has become an ongoing process rather than isolated incidents. This becomes [[knowledge management]] which is "identifying and harnessing intellectual assets" for organizations to "build on past experiences and create new mechanisms for exchanging and creating knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, L. H. (2008) Knowledge Management. ''International Encyclopedia of Communication.'' Boston: Blackledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This belief draws upon a leader's past experiences that may prove useful. It is a common mantra for one to learn from their past mistakes, so leaders should take advantage of their failures for their benefit. This is how one may take their experiences as a leader for the use in the core of entrepreneurship-decision making.

=== Global leadership ===
The majority of scholarly research done on these topics have been from North America.&lt;ref&gt;Boyacigiller, N. &amp; Adler, N. J. (1991). The Parochial Dinosaur: The Organizational Sciences in Global Context. ''Academy of Management Review.''&lt;/ref&gt; Words like "leadership" and "entrepreneurship" do not always translate well into other cultures and languages. For example, in North America a leader is often thought to be charismatic, but German culture frowns on such charisma due to the charisma of Nazi leader Adolph Hitler. Other cultures, like some European countries, view the term "leader" negatively, like the French.&lt;ref&gt;Grauman, C. F. (1986). ''Changing Conceptions of Leadership.''&lt;/ref&gt; The participative leadership style that is encouraged in the United States is considered disrespectful in many other parts of the world due to the differences in power distance.&lt;ref&gt;Hofestede, G. (1991). ''Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind.''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Asian and Middle Eastern countries do not have "open door" policies for subordinates and would never informally approach their managers/bosses. For countries like that, an authoritarian approach to management and leadership is more customary.

Despite cultural differences, the successes and failures of entrepreneurs can be traced to how leaders adapt to local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1980). Motivation, Leadership and Organization: Do American Theories Apply Abroad? ''Organizational Dynamics.''&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasingly global business environment a successful leader must be able to adapt and have insight into other cultures. To respond to the environment, corporate visions are becoming transnational in nature, to enable the organization to operate in or provide services/goods for other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, N. J. % Gundersen, A. (2008). ''International Dimensions of Organizational Behavior''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurship training and education ==
Michelacci and Schivardi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/sites/sciencespo.fr.liepp/files/paper_Are_They_All_Like_Bill_Michelacci.pdf|title = Are They All Like Bill, Mark, and Steve? The Education Premium for Entrepreneurs|last = Michelacci|first = Claudio|date = 24 June 2015|journal = EIEF|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a pair of researchers who believe that identifying and comparing the relationships between an entrepreneur's earnings and education level would determine the rate and level of success. Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.

Michelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only "runs" it.

== Resources and financing ==

=== Entrepreneurial resources ===
An entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources. Their economic value is generating activities or services through mobilization by entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Organizing Entrepreneurship|last=Anna Grandori; Laura Gaillard Giordani|first=|last2=|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-0-415-57037-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurial resources can be divided into two fundamental categories: tangible and intangible resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach|last=Charles W. L. Hill; Gareth R. Jones|first=|publisher=South-Western College Pub|isbn=978-0-538-75107-0|location=|pages=|date=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangible resources are material sources such as equipment, building, furniture, land, vehicle, machinery, stock, cash, bond and inventory that has a physical form and can be quantified. On the contrary, intangible resources are nonphysical or more challenging to identify and evaluate, and they possess more value creating capacity such as human resources including skills and experience in a particular field, organizational structure of the company, brand name, reputation, entrepreneurial networks that contribute to promotion and financial support, [[know-how]], [[intellectual property]] including both [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Business Strategy: Concepts and Cases (Strategic Management)|last=R.

=== Bootstrapping ===
At least early on, entrepreneurs often "[[Leveraged buyout|bootstrap-finance]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses|last=Bhide|first=Amar|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0195170313|location=http://www.bhide.net/books/Origin%20and%20Evolution/part1.pdf|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; their start-up rather than seeking external [[investor]]s from the start. One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to "bootstrap" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO in order to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.

One consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as "a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883902605000662|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851–865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|accessdate=29 July 2014|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/trends-stats/know-small-businesses-start-10000-less/|title=Did You Know? Most Small Businesses Start With $10,000 Or Less|last=Quickbooks|first=Writer at|date=1 August 2014|website=Intuit|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that personal savings are most often used to start. In addition, bootstrapping entrepreneurs often incur personal [[credit-card]] debt, but they also can utilize a wide variety of methods. While bootstrapping involves increased personal financial risk for entrepreneurs, the absence of any other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] gives the entrepreneur more freedom to develop the company. Many successful companies, including [[Dell]] Computer and [[Facebook]], started by bootstrapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richtopia.com/effective-leadership/10-successful-companies-started-bootstrapping-case-studies|title=Ten Successful Companies That Started by Bootstrapping|work=Richtopia|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional financing ===
{{no footnotes|section|date=July 2014}}
Many businesses need more capital than can be provided by the owners themselves. In this case, a range of options is available including a wide variety of [[Private equity|private]] and public equity, [[debt]] and [[Grant (money)|grants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourcolorsofmoney.com/what-are-the-four-colors-of-money-for-entrepreneurs/|title=What Are The Four Colors of Money for Entrepreneurs?|last=Gooding|first=Donald|date=1 June 2017|website=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private equity options include:

=== Effect of taxes ===
Entrepreneurs are faced with [[liquidity constraint]]s and often lack the necessary [[credit (finance)|credit]] needed to borrow large amounts of money to finance their venture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meh|first=Cesaire Assah|date=2002|title=Entrepreneurial Risk, Credit Constraints, and the Corporate Income Tax: A Quantitative Exploration|url=|journal=Bank of Canada, Working Papers 2002-21|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, many studies have been done on the effects of taxes on entrepreneurs. The studies fall into two camps: the first camp finds that taxes help and the second argues that taxes hurt entrepreneurship.

Cesaire Assah Meh found that corporate taxes create an incentive to become an entrepreneur to avoid double taxation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Donald Bruce and John Deskins found literature suggesting that a higher corporate tax rate may reduce a state's share of entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruce|first=Donald and John Deskins|date=2012|title=Can state tax policies be used to promote entrepreneurial activity?|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that states with an inheritance or [[estate tax]] tend to have lower entrepreneurship rates when using a tax-based measure.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; However, another study found that states with a more [[Progressive taxation|progressive personal income tax]] have a higher percentage of sole proprietors in their workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asoni|first=Andrea and Tino Sanandaji|date=2012|title=Taxation and the quality of entrepreneurship|url=|journal=J Econ|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, many studies find that the effect of taxes on the probability of becoming an entrepreneur is small. Donald Bruce and Mohammed Mohsin found that it would take a 50 percentage point drop in the top tax rate to produce a one percent change in entrepreneurial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruce|first=Donald and Mohammed Mohsin|date=2006|title=Tax Policy and Entrepreneurship: New Time Series Evidence|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fleet Management Systems Interface (FMS)''' is a standard [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] to vehicle data of commercial vehicles. The six European manufacturers [[Daimler AG]], [[MAN SE|MAN AG]], [[Scania AB|Scania]], [[Volvo]] (including Renault), [[DAF Trucks]] and [[IVECO]] developed the so-called FMS-Standard in 2002 to make manufacturer-independent applications for [[telematics]] possible.

The following data are broadcast at the FMS interface:
* Vehicle improvement (all round)
* Vehicle speed (wheel based)
* Vehicle speed (from tachograph)
* Clutch switch (on/off)
* Brake switch (on/off)
* [[Cruise control]] (on/off)
* [[Power take-off|PTO]] (Status/Mode)
* Accelerator pedal position (0–100%)
* Total fuel used (litres since lifetime)
* Fuel level (0–100%)
* Engine speed
* [[Gross axle weight rating]] (kg)
* Total engine hours (h)
* FMS-Standard software version (supported modes)
* [[Vehicle identification number]] (ASCII)
* Tachograph information
* High-resolution vehicle distance
* Service distance
* Engine coolant temperature

The data are coded according to SAE [[J1939]]. The repetition rate of the data is between 20 ms (e.g. engine speed) and 10 seconds (e.g. vehicle identification number).

With the FMS standard it is now possible to have manufacturer independent applications and evaluations of the data.

The amount of data is dependent on the manufacturer and model of the vehicle and might be different. If some data are not available at the interface they are marked as not available.

According to a note from the [[truck manufacturer]]s, the FMS standard is seen as a worldwide standard. A direct connection to the internal vehicle bus system is not permitted by the truck manufacturers and could lead to the loss of warranty.
Meanwhile, some manufacturers are quite restrictive in their workshops and cut all unknown connections to the internal [[Bus (computing)|bus system]].

According to [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association|ACEA]] ca. 160,000 vehicles were fitted with an FMS standard interface in 2007.
The FMS-Standard was as well the base for the Bus-FMS-Standard for buses and coaches which was published in the year 2004.

== History ==

FPRA was founded in 1938 when Chamber of Commerce executives cut the subject out of their program at a statewide meeting in Jacksonville. John W. Dillin, publicity director of the Miami Beach Chamber of Commerce, had made the trip to Jacksonville especially to participate in the program. On his return to South Florida, he stopped at Silver Springs to talk with Wilton Martin. They discussed forming an organization dealing with publicity and public relations. The owners of the attraction agreed to host those who would be interested. Invitations were extended to six others. Two meetings were held before calling an all-Florida meeting in Tampa where 45 attended. The group voted to form the Florida Association of Publicity Directors and elected Dillin to serve as president.

Executive meetings were held throughout the year and in several locations in the state prior to the first annual meeting in St. Augustine where Dillin had moved to take over a chamber of commerce management. The assembly drew representatives of attractions, chambers of commerce, newspaper and radio stations, advertising and display executives. It also was held simultaneously with the Florida Press Association and the Florida Junior Chamber of Commerce. Although Dillin wanted to develop a clinic for learning to do "publicity and public relations" better, it developed into a Florida promotional program.

In the second year, it was voted to change the name to the Florida Publicity and Public Relations Association, but before the meeting was concluded it was back to FAPD. The organization grew steadily until World War II when many members enlisted and were in service until 1946. Although it took time to refresh its activities, the association began to grow again. Finally, the name "publicity" was eliminated and adopted the "public relations" theme. Clinics were held in "learning to do the job" better, which was the objective in the first place.

University of Florida, University of Miami and Stetson University joined the learning program and written examinations were held at the conclusion of each clinic. After four years, Certificates of Attainment were issued. Chapters were formed throughout the state and the association grew to more than 1,000 members. Some of the universities formed student chapters. Those studying public relations were invited to state conferences and chapter seminars.

Today, there are student chapters at Florida State University, University of Central Florida, Rollins College, Bethune-Cookman College, Stetson University, Florida Southern College, Florida Tech, University of West Florida, as well as a student chapter in Jacksonville.

'''Sir Frank Budge Lowe''' (born August 1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/01709017/officers |title=LOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED - Officers (free information from Companies House) |publisher=Beta.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a pioneer of the [[advertising agency]]. 

==Career==
He first rose to fame running [[Collett Dickenson Pearce]], which he built into one of the best known agencies in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1981, he started Lowe Howard-Spink, which eventually became [[Lowe Worldwide|Lowe &amp; Partners Worldwide]]. In 1979 Lowe arranged sponsorship of the [[Queen's Club Championships]] which became known as the [[Stella Artois]] tournament, an arrangement that lasted almost 30 years. He became founder and president.

Lowe built [[50 Glebe Place]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] between 1985 and 1987.&lt;ref name="CherryPevsner1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bridget Cherry|author2=Nikolaus Pevsner|title=London 3: North West|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AuvCfuvUy-0C|date=1 March 1991|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09652-1|page=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='UKModHouse'&gt;{{cite web|title=Building 9842|url=http://ukmoho.co.uk/html/building/9842.html|publisher=UK Modern House Index|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BellHopper2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tim Bell|author2=David Hopper|title=Right Or Wrong: The Memoirs of Lord Bell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEjYBAAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|isbn=978-1-4729-0935-0|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2001 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] Lowe was knighted for services to charity and advertising, allegedly less than a year after donating £2m to the country's first [[Academy (English school)|City Academy]], [[Capital City Academy]], in North West London.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph: Fifth time lucky for Sir Frank and his model"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/1915794/Sir-Frank-Lowe-weds-model-Pat-Boot-in-fifth-marriage.html|title=Daily Telegraph: Fifth time lucky for Sir Frank and his model|accessdate=2 October 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first1=Tim|last1=Walker|date=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He quit his eponymous agency in 2003, becoming its chairman emeritus, after falling out with parent [[Interpublic]]&lt;ref name="Sir Frank Lowe"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/17/mediaguardiantop100200664|title=Guardian: Sir Frank Lowe|accessdate=2 October 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had acquired Lowe Worldwide in 1990.

After fulfilling a two-year non-compete clause, Lowe founded the [[Red Brick Road]] integrated agency, taking its name from the route that [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] didn't follow in the ''[[The Wizard of Oz (adaptations)|Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="Lowe follows Red Brick Road"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/30/advertising.marketingandpr|title=Guardian: Lowe follows Red Brick Road|accessdate=2 October 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Stephen|last=Brook|date=30 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched by poaching [[Tesco]]'s £50m advertising account from Lowe Worldwide. Other clients include [[Gala Coral Group|Gala Coral]], [[Sky One]], [[Heineken]] and [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]].&lt;ref name="Red Brick Road Clients"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theredbrickroad.co.uk|title=Red Brick Road Clients|accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Lowe announced that he was "stepping back from day-to-day involvement" &lt;ref&gt;[http://adage.com/article/global-news/original-mad-man-frank-lowe-leaves-red-brick-road/141257/ 'Adage: ORIGINAL MAD MAN FRANK LOWE LEAVES RED BRICK ROAD']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lowe was married 5 times. His fourth wife was a US citizen, Dawn Lowe. They were married for 16 years and had a son, Sebastian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-476905/Texas-Dawns-love-legal-eagle.html |title=Texas Dawn's love for her legal eagle &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Lowe married for the fifth time to sixties model [[Pat Booth]].&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph: Fifth time lucky for Sir Frank and his model"/&gt; She died of cancer in 2009, aged 66.

'''Grzegorz Andrzej Ślak''' (born 16 May 1965 in [[:pl:Ostrzeszów|Ostrzeszów]]) - Polish entrepreneur, lawyer (specializing in excise duties), financier.

== Career ==
Ślak started his career at [[:pl:Bank BPH|Bank Przemysłowo-Handlowy]] in [[Rybnik]], where he was involved mainly in financing and restructuring energy, steel and mining-related companies.

In 2002 he became the President of the Management Board of [[:pl:Rafineria Trzebinia|Rafineria Trzebinia]].

As the first person in Poland, he has "built" a facility for producing higher fatty acid methyl esters ('biofuels') and pharmaceutical glycerine, thus becoming "the pioneer of Polish biofuels".{{Fact|date=August 2016}}

In 2005, he "built" the first plant for hydrorefining of purified paraffin in Central and Eastern Europe under license by Exxon Mobil. The plant allowed for use of petroleum processing products (paraffin) in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W Rafinerii Trzebinia pierwsza w Europie Środkowej instalacja hydrorafinacji parafin|url=http://www.pb.pl/1403402,89690,w-rafinerii-trzebinia-pierwsza-w-europie-srodkowej-instalacja-hydrorafinacji-parafin|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he developed a new technology and started to produce a new fuel, trade name "ON BIO 10", consisting of diesel oil and 20% addition of higher fatty acid methyl esters. On this basis, the Minister of Economy adopted the quality standard for this fuel which is still in effect. For this product, Rafineria Trzebinia was awarded the Promotional Emblem “Teraz Polska” in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rafineria Trzebinia zaczęła sprzedawać ON BIO - prasa|url=http://www.pb.pl/1403029,19980,rafineria-trzebinia-zaczela-sprzedawac-on-bio-prasa|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORLEN Południe|url=http://www.rafineria-trzebinia.pl/PL/OFirmie/Strony/Historia-Firmy.aspx|agency=www.rafineria-trzebinia.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiesel w sprzedaży|url=http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/1559892,biodiesel-w-sprzedazy,id,t.html?cookie=1|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, Ślak was accused of reducing the payable excise duties for the unprecedented amount of PLN 760 million in connection with his duties as the President of the Management Board of Rafineria Trzebinia. After two years, tax authorities confirmed accuracy of the settlements, thus accepting correctness of the tax rate applied by Ślak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Życie z prokuratorem na karku|url=http://www.newsweek.pl/grzegorz-slak-zaklada-fundacje-pomagajaca-ofiarom-prokuratury,artykuly,362347,1,z.html|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he became the President of the Management Board of Skotan S.A., leading the company to one of its biggest stock increases on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skotan: nowy prezes zadba o biopaliwa|url=http://www.wnp.pl/wiadomosci/skotan-nowy-prezes-zadba-o-biopaliwa,11642.html|agency=wnp.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he became the President of the Management Board of Bioeton S.A. In this company, he carried out a capital investment which allowed for the takeover of BDK Kyritz GmbH, a German renewable energy company. In 2009, he became the President of the Management Board of BDK Kyritz GmbH in Germany. Ślak restructured the company, which involved restoring its financial liquidity. At that time, the company was in the state of so-called "temporary bankruptcy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grzegorz Ślak pokieruje niemieckim producentem biopaliw|url=http://nafta.wnp.pl/grzegorz-slak-pokieruje-niemieckim-producentem-biopaliw,85746_1_0_0.html|agency=wnp.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 he took up the position of the President of the Management Board of Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A.,  a part of Bartimpex S.A capital group, which produces methyl esters and higher fatty acids (biodiesel), as well as raw and pharmaceutical glycerine. At the time of Ślak's taking up of the position, the company had not been operating due to a lack of contracts. As a result of his restructuring, Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A. generated a 7-digit net profit for the year 2012. At the same time, Ślak carried out an investment in bioethanol dehydrated spirit production plant, thus expanding the company's economic activity. The successful restructuring enabled the company to begin an application process for entering the stock market at the beginning of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mistrz paliw na prostej|url=http://www.forbes.pl/artykuly/sekcje/Strategie/mistrz-paliw-na-prostej,27789,1|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W imię Aleksandra|url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/392188/W-imi-Aleksandra/|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the President of the Management Board and a shareholder of Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A., he has been carrying out works to build a plant for producing algae fuels (third-generation fuels). If successful, it will be the first plant of this sort in Europe.

Since October 2011, Ślak has been simultaneously holding the post of the President of the Management Board of Akwawit-Polmos S.A. (also a part of Bartimpex S.A capital group) - a producer of spirits and vodkas. At the time of Ślak's taking up of the position, the company had fulfilled all the legal requirements to file for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grzegorz Ślak: Akwawit-Polmos liczy na nowy kontrakt|url=http://www.wnp.pl/wiadomosci/grzegorz-slak-akwawit-polmos-liczy-na-nowy-kontrakt,202217.html|agency=wnp.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, his actions resulted in signing agreements with world-scale alcohol producers: one with Brown-Forman (the owner of Jack Daniels and Finlandia brands) for the production of Maximus vodka and another with Diageo (the owner of Johnnie Walker and Baileys) for the production of Smirnoff vodka. As a result of the financial restructuring, the company is planning to enter the stock market in 2016.

As part of the restructuring process, Ślak carried out an investment in Poland's most modern alcohol production line licensed by CFT Packaging S.A. The line is able to produce 100 million bottles a year, which increases the overall productivity of Akwawit-Polmos S.A. to 150 million bottles a year, thus placing the company among the biggest alcohol producers in Central-Eastern Europe.

In 2013, he replaced the deceased [[Aleksander Gudzowaty]] as the President of the Management Board of Bartimpex S.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grzegorz Ślak nowym prezesem spółki Bartimpex {{!}} Zmiany kadrowe {{!}} pulshr.pl|url=http://www.pulshr.pl/zmiany-kadrowe/grzegorz-slak-nowym-prezesem-spolki-bartimpex,13091.html|agency=www.pulshr.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ślak is the President of the Management Board and a shareholder of HGBS Finanse S.A, a fund investing in new technology and "excise business" enterprises.

In his career, he has been or is a member of the following supervisory boards (among others): Orlen Oil S.A, J.W. Construction S.A., Orlen Asfalt S.A, Polonia Warszawa S.A., Euronaft Sp. z o.o.

=== Dispute over the offset agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wygrał z Lockheed Martin, ale liczy na więcej|url=http://www.forbes.pl/wygral-z-lockheed-martin-ale-liczy-na-wiecej,artykuly,183635,1,1.html|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jak polski menedżer wyciągnął 13 mln dol. od amerykańskiego giganta|url=http://www.biztok.pl/biznes/jak-polski-menedzer-wyciagnal-13-mln-dol-od-amerykanskiego-giganta_s17823|last=Polska|first=Grupa Wirtualna|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
In April 2003, the Polish government signed an agreement with the U.S. for purchase of 48 F-16 jets for USD 3.5 million. In exchange, the Americans agreed, among others, to invest in Poland's economy and help Polish enterprises to invest in the American market. They failed to fulfill the latter point. In 2014, carrying out the duties of the President of Bartimpex Management Board, Grzegorz Ślak led the company to reach a settlement with Lockheed Martin under which the Polish company was awarded several million dollars in damages. Bartimpex was the only legal entity in Poland to have been awarded damages for the unfulfilled offset agreement conditions.

=== The Yamal–Europe gas pipeline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PGNiG zapłaciło ponad 100 mln za przejęcie kontroli nad Jamałem|url=http://wiadomosci.radiozet.pl/Wiadomosci/Kraj/PGNiG-zaplacilo-ponad-100-mln-za-przejecie-kontroli-nad-Jamalem-00008522|last=ZET|first=Redakcja Radia|agency=PGNiG zapłaciło ponad 100 mln za przejęcie kontroli nad Jamałem - Wiadomości|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spadkobiercy Gudzowatego oddali kontrolę nad gazem|url=http://www.pb.pl/4038128,41400,spadkobiercy-gudzowatego-oddali-kontrole-nad-gazem|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Grzegorz Ślak initiated the PGNiG takeover of the part of the Yamal–Europe gas pipeline that goes through Poland. The transaction enabled PGNiG to take over 4% of the shares, which gave it advantage over Gazprom (52% to 48%) and guaranteed the Polish party the decisive vote on the most significant matters concerning EuropolGaz, the owner of the pipeline.

== Awards ==
He was awarded the Silver Cross of Merit for ''contributions to the development of oil industry'' pursuant to the Polish President's Decree of 4 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internetowy System Aktów Prawnych|url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WMP20030480724|last=RP|first=Kancelaria Sejmu|agency=isap.sejm.gov.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received "Man of the year 2005" Medal awarded by ''Gazeta Krakowska'' for "professionalism in company management, introducing innovative technologies, effectiveness in winning new markets and supporting culture and sport".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grzegorz Ślak Człowiekiem Roku|url=http://www.neurochirurgia-tarnow.com.pl/download/g_krak22_str12.pdf|agency=Neurochirurgia Tarnów|accessdate=2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community involvement ==
He funded two ultrasound devices which allow for earlier cancer detection for the Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases and Occupational Hypertension of University Teaching Hospital in Wrocław.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lekarze uratowali mu mamę, więc kupił szpitalowi dwa aparaty USG|url=http://www.gazetawroclawska.pl/artykul/1012485,lekarze-uratowali-mu-mame-wiec-kupil-szpitalowi-dwa-aparaty-usg,id,t.html?cookie=1|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He funded a gamma camera used for an effective thyroid examination for the Department of Endocrinology in Zabrze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zdrowie pod obserwacją - Będzin - naszemiasto.pl|url=http://bedzin.naszemiasto.pl/archiwum/zdrowie-pod-obserwacja,610334,art,t,id,tm.html|agency=bedzin.naszemiasto.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He funded a device which facilitates performing cancer surgery in children for the Department of Pediatric Surgery and Urology of Wrocław Medical University.

== Hobbies ==
Ślak is an avid enthusiast of football and motorcycle speedway. In 2004 and 2005, he led the speedway team Unia Tarnów to its first in history title of the winner of Team Speedway Polish Championship.

For many years, he has been connected with Polish speedway rider Tomasz Gollob, who officially handed the 2010 gold medal for winning Individual Speedway World Championship over to Ślak. In 2010, he also wrote a book, entitled ''Why only now?! Gollob as the world champion. A true story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dlaczego dopiero teraz?! Gollob Mistrzem Świata. Historia prawdziwa - Grzegorz Ślak - Merlin.pl|url=http://merlin.pl/Dlaczego-dopiero-teraz-Gollob-Mistrzem-Swiata-Historia-prawdziwa_Whitered/browse/product/1,897358.html|agency=merlin.pl|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he carried out a capital transaction which led to the takeover of Groclin Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wlkp. by the shareholder of J.W. As a result, the club changed its name to Polonia Warszawa and the registered seat to the city of Warsaw. It was the first transaction of this sort and so far one of a kind on the top level of Polish football events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Od 1 sierpnia Grzegorz Ślak prezesem Polonii|url=http://www.sport.pl/sport/1,78991,5463748,Od_1_sierpnia_Grzegorz_Slak_prezesem_Polonii.html|accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He acts as a speedway expert and Grand Prix commentator on Canal+.

It includes tools for [[requirements management]], [[test planning]] and [[functional testing]], [[Software performance testing|performance testing]] (when used with HP Performance Center), developer management (through integration with the most widely used developer environments such as [[Collabnet]], TeamForge and [[Microsoft Visual Studio]]), and defect management.&lt;ref name="Cio.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Darryl K. |last=Taft |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Tasktop-Launches-Enterprise-18-Solution-for-New-HP-ALM-11-500854/ |title=Tasktop Launches Enterprise 18 Solution for new HP ALM 11 |publisher=eWeek |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALM is designed to support key stakeholders responsible for delivering applications as they progress through their lifecycle. It is a combination of a common platform, several key applications and a dashboard targeted at managing the core [[application lifecycle management|lifecycle of applications]], from design through readiness for delivery to operations.&lt;ref name="informationweek.com"/&gt; All of these core lifecycle activities are connected together from a workflow perspective with a common management console, layer of project tracking and planning and built on a common software foundation containing a consistent repository and open integration architecture with a supported SDK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briefingsdirectblog.blogspot.com/2010/11/how-to-automate-alm-conclusions-from.html |title=Dana Gardner’s Briefings Direct: "How to automate ALM." Nov. 2010 |publisher=Briefingsdirectblog.blogspot.com |date=2010-11-26 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALM is intended to provide [[Information Technology]] departments with a centralized application management platform for managing and automating within and across application teams and throughout the complete process of developing an application, within a single workflow.&lt;ref name="Cio.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/641167/HP_Fuses_Dev_Management_and_Testing_Tools |title=IDG NewsService/CIO.com: "HP Fuses Dev Management and Testing Tools."

[[File:Henry Fourdrinier.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Henry Fourdrinier]]
'''Henry Fourdrinier''' (11 February 1766 – 3 September 1854) was a [[British people|British]] paper-making entrepreneur.

He was born in 1766, the son of a paper maker and stationer, and grandson of the engraver [[Paul Fourdrinier]], 1698-1758, sometimes mistakenly called [[Pierre Fourdrinier]]. With his brother, [[Sealy Fourdrinier|Sealy]], he commissioned the development of the [[Fourdrinier machine]], a [[papermaking]] machine that produced continuous rolls of paper. The machine is an industrialised version of the historical hand paper-making method, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of printing and writing materials. 

A [[patent]] was granted on 24 July 1806,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z9k0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA327 ''Repertory of Patent Inventions''. London, 1807]&lt;/ref&gt; for a machine that could make a long continuous web of paper. This had the dual advantage of considerably higher productivity plus production in roll form, for applications such as wallpaper printing. The range of cut paper sizes was also extended as it was not limited by the frame or [[deckle]] size of hand made paper.

[[File:Papermaking machine at a paper mill near Pensacola.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Large Fourdrinier-style paper-making machine. A row of heated drums dry out the paper, which enters the machine as wet pulp.&lt;br&gt;Large rolls are usually sliced into a number of thin rolls, which can feed continuous presses (e.g. newspapers) or be cut into separate sheets.]]

The invention cost £60000, and caused the brothers to go bankrupt. Due to various laws, it was difficult to protect the patent on the machine, and the new system was widely adopted but with no benefit to the inventors. 

In 1814, two machines were made in [[Petergof|Peterhof]], Russia, by order of the Russian emperor on the condition £700 would be paid to Fourdrinier every year for ten years &amp;mdash; but, despite petitioning [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas]], no money was ever paid. In 1839, a petition was brought before parliament, and in 1840, £7000 was paid to Fourdrinier and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fourdrinier, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourdrinier died in 1854, at the age of 88.

==Biography==
Ivo Toman was born in 1966 in Frýdek-Místek. He suffered from [[Tourette's syndrome]]. At the age of 6, he contracted meningitis. Toman was often ridiculed in school due to his handicap. Learning disgusted him and he eventually changed schools. A psychology teacher motivated Toman to learn. After graduating from high school, he went to VŠLD College in [[Zvolen]], where he graduated in 1988.&lt;ref name="jak"&gt;http://www.jak-vydelat.cz/index.php?id=11&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded the International Taxus, which operates in the fields of personal development and psychology. The enterprise began by producing  a nutritional supplement. The firm expanded to Slovakia and Hungary with other products. In 2002, he moved to Prague. He and his wife Martina Kralickova began to develop a teaching English, which in 2004 put into practice in the Czech and foreign markets.

In 2008 he was awarded inclusion in the ''1000 Almanac Leaders of Czech Republic''. In 2009 he won the ''small dolphin'' award from the Czech marketing company, at the ''2009 Marketer of the year'' awards. In 2012 in Bratislava was announced as ''The bestselling author of 2011'' by  the network bookstore Panta Rhei.

== Ancestors ==
Cotta is the name of a family of German publishers, intimately connected with the history of German literature. The Cottas were of noble Italian descent, and at the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the family was settled in [[Eisenach]] in [[Thuringia]].

Johann Georg Cotta (1631–1692), the founder of the publishing house of J. G. Cotta, married in 1659 the widow of the university bookseller, Philipp Braun, in Tübingen, and took over the management of his business, thus establishing the firm which was subsequently associated with Cotta's name. On his death, in 1692, the undertaking passed to his only son, also name Johann Georg; and on his death in 1712, to the latter's eldest son, also named Johann Georg, while the second son, [[Johann Friedrich Cotta (theologian)|Johann Friedrich]], became a distinguished theologian.

Although the eldest son of the third Johann Georg, Christoph Friedrich Cotta (1730–1807), established a printing-house to the court at Stuttgart, the business languished.

== Life ==
It was reserved to the youngest son of Christoph Friedrich, Johann Friedrich, to restore the fortunes of the firm. Born in [[Stuttgart]], he attended the [[Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium|gymnasium of his native place]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Wojak | first =Irmtrud | title =Fritz Bauer 1903–1968: eine Biographie | publisher =C.H.Beck | year =2009 | location =Munich | pages =54 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jP0uMZLuN0wC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Berthold+Auerbach%22+Eberhard-Ludwigs-gymnasium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4Gpnd-kRwM&amp;sig=wNTGk3fgivp04sP2gODohghZN1k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fgJUTZiICIqLhQer_a3UCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg | isbn =978-3-406-58154-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally intended to study theology. He, however, entered the [[university of Tübingen]] as a student of mathematics and law, and after graduating spent a considerable time in Paris, studying French and natural science, and mixing with distinguished literary men. After practising as an advocate in one of the higher courts, Cotta, in compliance with his father's earnest desire, took over the publishing business at Tübingen. He began in December 1787, and laboured incessantly to acquire familiarity with all the details. From 1793 to 1794, [[Orell Füssli]] in Zürich published [[Marianne Ehrmann]]'s ''Die Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen'', the first magazine that was published by a women in Switzerland; her early death stopped the further issues. Because the self-publishing could not handle the success of her former magazine, Marianne and her husband agreed on a takeover by Cotta, but in 1793 occurred irreconcilable conflicts; Cotta founded the journal ''Flora'' with the subscriber base, and Marianne Ehrmann continued the magazine ''Einsiedlerinn aus den Alpen''.&lt;ref name="bürger-ehrmann"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmZCAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Marianne+Ehrmann+Briefe&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Briefe an Marianne Ehrmann: Ein merkwürdiger Beitrag zur Geschichte der letzten Lebensjahre des Dichters|publisher=Industrie-Comptoir, Google books|author=Gottfried August Bürger, Theophil Friedrich Ehrmann|language=German|date=1802|accessdate=2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house connexions rapidly extended; and, in 1794, the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', of which Schiller was to be editor, was planned. Schiller was compelled to withdraw on account of his health; but his friendship with Cotta deepened every year, and was a great advantage to the poet and his family. Cotta awakened in Schiller so warm an attachment that, as [[Heinrich Döring]] tells us in his life of [[Schiller]] (1824), when a bookseller offered him a higher price than Cotta for the copyright of ''[[Wallenstein]]'', the poet firmly declined it, replying “Cotta deals honestly with me, and I with him.” In 1795 Schiller and Cotta founded the ''Horen'', a periodical very important to the student of German literature. The poet intended, by means of this work, to infuse higher ideas into the common lives of men, by giving them a nobler human culture, and “to reunite the divided political world under the banner of truth and beauty.” The ''Horen'' brought Goethe and Schiller into intimate relations with each other and with Cotta; and Goethe, while regretting that he had already promised ''Wilhelm Meister'' to another publisher, contributed the ''Unterhaltung deutscher Ausgewanderten'', the ''Roman Elegies'' and a paper on Literary Sansculottism. Fichte sent essays from the first, and the other brilliant German authors of the time were also represented. In 1798 the ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' appeared at Tübingen, being edited first by Posselt and then by Huber. Soon the editorial office of the newspaper was transferred to Stuttgart, in 1803 to [[Ulm]], and in 1810 to [[Augsburg]]; it is now in [[Munich]].

In 1799 Cotta entered on his political career, being sent to [[Paris]] by the [[Württemberg]] estates as their representative. Here he made friendships which proved very advantageous for the ''Allgemeine'' ''Zeitung''. In 1801 he paid another visit to Paris, also in a political capacity, when he carefully studied [[Napoleon]]'s policy, and treasured up many hints which were useful to him in his literary undertakings.

He still, however, devoted most of his attention to his own business, and, for many years, made all the entries into the ledger with his own hand. He relieved the tedium of almost ceaseless toil by pleasant intercourse with literary men. With Schiller, Huber, and [[Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel]] (1736–1809) he was on terms of the warmest friendship; and he was also intimate with Herder, Schelling, Fichte, Richter, Voss, Hebel, Tieck, Therese Huber, Matthisson, the brothers Humboldt, Johann Müller, Spittler and others, whose works he published in whole or in part. In the correspondence of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] with Varnhagen von Ense we see the familiar relations in which the former stood to the Cotta family. In 1795 he published the ''Politischen Annalen'' and the ''Jahrbücher der Baukunde'', and in 1798 the ''Damenalmanach'', along with some works of less importance. In 1807 he issued the ''Morgenblatt'', to which Schorn's ''Kunstblatt'' and Menzel's ''Literaturblatt'' were afterwards added.

In 1810 he removed to Stuttgart; and from that time till his death he was loaded with honours. State affairs and an honourable commission from the German booksellers took him to the Vienna congress; and in 1815 he was deputy-elect at the Württemberg diet. In 1819 he became representative of the nobility; then he succeeded to the offices of member of committee and (1824) vice-president of the Württemberg second chamber. He was also appointed Prussian Geheimrat, and knight of the order of the Württemberg crown; King William I. of Württemberg having already revived the ancient nobility in his family by granting him the patent of Freiherr (Baron) Cotta von Cottendorf . Meanwhile, such publications as the ''Polytechnische Journal'', the ''Hesperus'', the ''Württembergische Jahrbücher'', the ''Hertha'', the ''Ausland'', and the ''Inland'' issued from the press. In 1828–1829 appeared the famous correspondence between Schiller and Goethe. Cotta was an unfailing friend of young struggling men of talent.

In addition to his high standing as a publisher, he was a man of great practical energy, which flowed into various fields of activity. He was a scientific agriculturist, and promoted many reforms in farming. He was the first Württemberg landholder to abolish serfdom on his estates. In politics he was throughout his life a moderate liberal. In 1824 he set up a steam printing press in Augsburg, and, about the same time, founded a literary institute at Munich. In 1825 he started steamboats, for the first time, on Lake Constance, and introduced them in the following year on the Rhine. In 1828 he was sent to Berlin, on an important commission, by Bavaria and Württemberg, and was there rewarded with orders of distinction at the hands of the three kings. He died, on 29 December 1832 in Stuttgart, leaving a son and a daughter as coheirs.

== Successors ==
His son, Johann Georg, Freiherr Cotta von Cottendorf (1796–1863), succeeded to the management of the business on the death of his father, and was materially assisted by his sister's husband, Freiherr Hermann von Reischach. He greatly extended the connexions of the firm by the purchase, in 1839, of the publishing business of G. J. Göschen in Leipzig, and in 1845 of that of Vogel in Landshut; while, in 1845, “Bible” branches were established at Stuttgart and Munich. He was succeeded by his younger son, Karl, and by his nephew (the son of his sister), Hermann Albert von Reischach. Under their joint partnership, the before-mentioned firms in [[Leipzig]] and Landshut, and an artistic establishment in Munich passed into other hands, leaving on the death of Hermann Albert von Reischach, in 1876, Karl von Cotta the sole representative of the firm, until his death in 1888. In 1889 the firm of J. G. Cotta passed by purchase into the hands of Adolf and Paul Kroner, who took others into partnership. In 1899 the business was converted into a limited liability company.

Cotta's publishing company survives today, although no longer owned by the family, under the name Klett-Cotta.  Its contemporary offerings include German-to-Elvish dictionaries tied into the ''Lord of the Rings'' movies.

==History==
The Federation of Paint and Varnish Production Clubs (FPVPC) published their ''Official Digest - Federation of Paint and Varnish Production Clubs'' (ISSN 0097-2827; volumes 1–31) from 1919 December to 1959. From 1960 to 1965, they went under the name of the Federation of Societies for Paint Technology (FSPT) and their publication became ''Official Digest - Federation of Societies for Paint Technology'' (ISSN 0097-2835; volumes 32–37) to match. From 1966 to 1975 this publication changed to ''Journal of Paint Technology'' (''J. Paint Technol.''; ISSN 0022-3352; CODEN JPTYAX; LCCN 74645020; volumes 38–47). In 1976, they underwent another name change to the Federation of Societies for Coatings Technology (FSCT), so from 1976 to 2003 the journal went under the name ''Journal of Coatings Technology'' (''J. Coating. Tech.''; ISSN 0361-8773; E-ISSN 1935-3804; CODEN JCTEDL; LCCN 76641713; volumes 48–75). Springer was the publisher from 1997 to 2003 (volumes 69–75).

In 2004, this then split into ''JCT Coatings Tech'' (ISSN 1547-0083; CODEN JCCOBW; LCCN 2003215613) and ''JCT Research'' (ISSN 1547-0091; CODEN JRCEB5; LCCN 2003215614). In 2007, the Oil and Colour Chemists' Association ''Surface Coatings International Part B: Coatings Transactions'' (ISSN 1476-4865; E-ISSN 1742-0261; CODEN SCIPDU; LCCN 2001242086) was subsequently merged into ''JCT Research'' and it was renamed as the ''Journal of Coatings Technology and Research'' (J. Coating. Tech. Res.; ISSN 1945-9645; LCCN 2007242238).

This refactoring is likely due at least in part to the FSCT being merged into National Paint and Coatings Association (NPCA) in 2009. In January 2010, the merged NPCA then changed its name to American Coatings Association (ACA).

In US parlance, a '''lemon''' is a [[Automobile|vehicle]] (often new) that turns out to have several manufacturing defects affecting its safety, value or utility.  Any vehicle with such severe issues may be termed a lemon and, by extension, so may any product with flaws too great or severe to serve its purpose.

==The Lemon Law==
The [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]] is a United States federal law enacted in 1975 to protect consumers from deceptive warranty practices. The Act was sponsored by Senator Warren G. Magnuson of Washington with co-sponsors Senator Frank Moss of Utah, and U.S. Representative John E. Moss of California. The purpose of the Act was to make product warranties more easily understood and enforceable, and to provide the Federal Trade Commission with a means of better protecting consumers. The Act does not force a manufacturer to include a warranty with its products but if there is one it must be in writing and comply with the rules of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to the CA Lemon Law {{ISBN|978-0-9915737-0-7}} [http://www.lemonlawspecialists.com/book/#Magnuson-Moss Magnuson Moss Act and relevance to "lemon" vehicles].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word's use to describe a highly flawed item predates its use in describing cars and can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century as a British and American slang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lemon&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The British use is derived from the US use and is less precise or specific: to be "sold a lemon" is little different from "sold a pup".

Its first attribution to mean a problematic car was in a [[Volkswagen]] advertisement created by [[Julian Koenig]] and [[Helmut Krone]] as part of an advertisement campaign managed by William Bernbach, all advertising executives with the firm Doyle Dane Bernbach in 1960, which was a follow-up to their [[Think Small]] advertising campaign for VW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writingfordesigners.com/?p=1731 Writing for Designers. Lemon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.fo/20120907144953/http://www.powerwriting.com/vw-lemon-ad.html Volkswagen's Lemon Ad]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economist [[George Akerlof]] in his 1970 paper "[[The Market for Lemons|The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/akerlof.html George Akerlof (biography)]&lt;/ref&gt; identified the severe lemon problems that may afflict markets characterized by [[asymmetrical information]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Douma and H. Schreuder, Economic Approaches to Organizations, 5th edition, Pearson, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== New vehicles ==
New vehicles may contain flaws or defects in workmanship, caused by design flaws or by an error during the automotive factory build process. These errors can range from parts being installed incorrectly to a tool that was used to build the car not being removed or a batch of materials with structural or chemical flaws.  The idioms "Friday afternoon car" or "Monday morning car", were used to describe new cars that had been delivered with numerous faults or suffered from an excessive number of warranty claims early in their lives – based on the premise that assembly line workers were far more likely to make errors at the times when they were perceived to be least interested in the standard of their workmanship.

Consumer protection legislation typically labels vehicles as "lemons" if the same problem recurs despite multiple repair attempts (such as three times in a row over a short period, where previous attempts have not corrected the problem) or where defects have caused a new vehicle to be out of service for a prolonged period (typically 30 days or longer) for repairs.

Lemon laws primarily serve to force manufacturers to buy back defective vehicles or exchange them. Depending on the jurisdiction, a process similar to [[vehicle title branding]] may also be used to warn subsequent purchasers of the history of a problem vehicle. While this portion of a vehicle's history is usually not retained with the title when exporting it to another jurisdiction, at least one jurisdiction (California) has started compelling manufacturers to brand the titles of any previously reacquired vehicles that they import or export from the jurisdiction.

==Used vehicles==
While [[used car]]s may be plagued with the same problems that beset new vehicles, used vehicles may also have been abused, improperly maintained or poorly repaired, been unprofessionally rebuilt after a collision or tampered with in some manner to conceal high mileage, mechanical defects, corrosion or other damage.

{{anchor|cutandshut}}
One form of lemon is called a '''cut and shut''' or '''clipping''', a form of body collision "repair" based on buying a wrecked car and sawing off the wrecked section to replace it with a matching section from another (similar) car. If improperly repaired, these vehicles may be inherently dangerous; at high speeds, or in an accident, the car may come apart due to the weaknesses of the [[welding|welds]] or pins connecting the two segments of the vehicle or mismatches of segments.&lt;ref name="Autotrader UK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autotrader.co.uk/advice/2010/07/safety-and-security/illegal-cars|title=Illegal cars|accessdate=30 September 2010}}{Spam Link}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Autoweb.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweb.co.uk/article/574|title=CUT AND SHUT ACCIDENT HORRORS - BAN THE ‘FRANKENSTEIN’ CARS|accessdate=30 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920060259/http://www.autoweb.co.uk/article/574|archivedate=20 September 2010|df=}}{dead link}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ''cut and shut'' cars are treated like any car that has had major repair work resulting in what is essentially a new car. They must first be inspected for road-worthiness, be assigned a new [[Vehicle registration plate|registration number]] and pass the standard [[MOT test]]. If this is successful, they will be given a "Q" registration, meaning they are a kit, or composite car, and not an original unit from the manufacturer.

In some states of the USA, the sale of ''cut and shut'' vehicles is illegal.  Cars created using two or more large sections of previous ones are sometimes called "zipper cars".

Improperly repaired collision-damage vehicles also carry the risk of [[unibody]] problems. Unlike heavy [[truck]]s and [[lorry|lorries]], most passenger cars manufactured since 1987 employ unibody construction instead of a separate body and frame.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} This saves weight, but the unibody is prone to bend (it is designed to do so in an impact, to absorb part of the energy of the shock) or suffer damage in severe collisions, causing the vehicle not to handle correctly or causing other mechanical parts to wear prematurely if the damaged unibody vehicle is driven after an accident.

Today, there are vehicle history services that can help a prospective used car buyer by providing a "history report" based on the vehicle's identification number ([[vehicle identification number|VIN]]). These reports will indicate items of public record, such as vehicle title branding, lemon law buybacks and recalls.  They may indicate minor/moderate collision damage or improper vehicle maintenance. An attempt to identify vehicles that have been previously owned by hire car rental agencies, police and emergency services or taxi fleets is also made.  However, consumers should research vehicles carefully, as these reporting services only report the information to which they have access.

Manufacturers have been known to "hide" lemon law buybacks from these reporting services through such unscrupulous methods as holding the buyback vehicle in a dealer's inventory for a short period of time, then funneling it through routine inventory (so-called "dealer only") auctions where the buyback vehicle re-enters the used market as a seemingly legitimate vehicle.  While history reports can provide useful information and highlight trouble areas, consumers are still advised to have a trusted, independent mechanic perform a pre-buy inspection on any used vehicle of which they do not personally know the history.

'''Marko Perković''' (born 27 October 1966) is a [[Croatian people|Croatian]] musician and has been the lead singer of the band [[Thompson (band)|Thompson]] since 1991.

Perković was born in [[Čavoglave]], [[SR Croatia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]] (present-day [[Republic of Croatia]]). He participated in the [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–95), during which he started his career with the patriotic song "Bojna Čavoglave". In 2002 he started his first major tour after the release of the ''[[E, moj narode]]'' album. Since 2005, he has been organizing an unofficial celebration of the [[Victory Day (Croatia)|Victory Day]] in his birthplace of Čavoglave. During his career, he has been accused of promoting extreme nationalism and of glorifying the [[Nazi]]-affiliated [[Ustaše]] of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], for which he has been banned from performing in Switzerland in 2009. The ban was subsequently lifted and he continued having concerts in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/estrada/thompson-odrzao-koncert-u-svicarskoj-vise-ga-ne-optuzuju-da-velica-fasiste-1043421|title=Thompson održao koncert u Švicarskoj, više ga ne optužuju da veliča fašiste|trans-title=Thompson held a concert in Switzerland, they are no longer accusing him of glorifying fascists|date=8 December 2015|work=Večernji list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2016}}
[[File:M. P. Thompson.jpg|thumb|right|Marko Perković in Frankfurt]]
Marko Perković was born in 1966 in [[Čavoglave]] (at the time [[SR Croatia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]) to Marija and Ante. He rarely saw his father, who worked as a [[Gastarbeiter]] in Germany and rarely came home. He finished high school in [[Split (city)|Split]]. In 1991, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, prompting the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. He joined the [[Croatian National Guard]] where he was given the American [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson]] gun, which became the nickname given to him by his battlefield comrades.

It was while he was defending his home village that Perković became inspired to write one of the most popular songs during the war: ''Bojna Čavoglave'' (''Čavoglave Battalion''), which launched his music career. In 1992, Perković held concerts throughout Croatia, and released his first album the same year.{{cn|date=July 2018}} He continued to write songs to raise morale during the war. In 1995 he returned to the [[Croatian Army]] and the 142nd Drniš Brigade, and became one of the first soldiers to enter the captured cities of [[Drniš]] and [[Knin]] during [[Operation Storm]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Career and controversy==
{{Main|Thompson (band)}}
On 15 September 2002, he had his largest concert to date at the [[Stadion Poljud|Poljud Stadium]] in [[Split (city)|Split]] with about 40,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/moje-zdravlje/thompson-zapjevao-pred-40000-ljudi-722896|title=Thompson zapjevao pred 40.000 ljudi|date=16 September 2002|work=Večernji list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he surpassed the 2002 concert at the [[Maksimir Stadium]] in Zagreb on 17 June 2007, with 60,000 people attending. His concert at the stadium was aired live on the state owned [[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT plus]] pay-per-view channel, and several days later on the main national channel as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/s-thompsonom-pjevalo-60000-ljudi-832059|title=S Thompsonom pjevalo 60.000 ljudi|date=18 June 2007|work=Večernji list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
Perković during his career has cited [[Mate Bulić]], [[Nightwish]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[AC/DC]] and [[Dream Theater]] as main influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Reflektor/tabid/92/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4131/Default.aspx Thompson: "God-willing, maybe I'll sing in English"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222001302/http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Reflektor/tabid/92/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4131/Default.aspx |date=2014-02-22 }}, ''[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]'', 17 April 2008; retrieved 24 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
[[File:Thompson Maksimir 17.6.2007 2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Young boy wearing a shirt with a [[Black Legion (Ustaše militia)|Black Legion]], [[Ustaše Militia]] sign at a [[Thompson (band)|Thompson]] concert]]
The lyrics of his songs often feature patriotic sentiments and relate to religion, family, the [[Croatian War of Independence|Croatian War of Independence (1991-95)]], politics and media, but also contain notorious references to war crimes.&lt;ref name="nytimes0707"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicholas|last=Wood|title=Fascist Overtones From Blithely Oblivious Rock Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/world/europe/02croatia.html|quote=On a hot Sunday evening in June, thousands of fans in a packed stadium here in the Croatian capital gave a Nazi salute as the rock star Marko Perkovic shouted a well-known slogan from World War II. At a recent concert in [[Zagreb]], some fans of ... Perkovic wore the black caps of Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet government, known as the Ustaše. Some of the fans were wearing the black caps of Croatia's infamous Nazi puppet Ustaše government, which was responsible for sending tens [sic] of thousands of Serbs, Gypsies and Jews to their deaths in concentration camps.|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2 July 2007|accessdate=2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accused of [[neo-Nazism]], in 2004, the band was prohibited from performing in [[Amsterdam]] by the local authorities, although he held a concert in [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~afa/alert/engels/sl1_2004.html|title=Alert!: Croatian hate music group banned in Netherlands|publisher=Xs4all.nl|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a concert in the Swiss city of [[Lucerne]] was canceled after the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] called for an urgent statement on the issue of Thompson's concert, calling Perković a fascist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anamarija Kronast|url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/67932/ne-zele-fasiste-thompsonu-zabranjen-koncert-i-ulaz-u-svicarsku|title=Ne žele "fašiste": Thompsonu zabranjen koncert i ulaz u Švicarsku|trans-title=They want no "fascists": Thompson's concert banned and entry to Switzerland declined|work=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]]|date=29 September 2009|accessdate=18 April 2012|archivedate=23 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69NYKEuIo?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/67932/ne-zele-fasiste-thompsonu-zabranjen-koncert-i-ulaz-u-svicarsku|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a three-year ban from Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/scena/policija-potvrdila-thompson-tri-godine-ne-smije-svicarsku-clanak-26439|title=Thompsonu zabranjen ulazak u Švicarsku i otkazan koncert, lifestyle, showbiz, glazba|publisher=Vecernji.hr|accessdate=18 April 2012|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Switzerland is a member of the [[Schengen Agreement]], Thompson was prohibited from entering into all [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] countries for a period of three years, confirmed by Michele Cercone, spokesman for the Vice President of the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/zvijezde/thompson-cak-tri-godine-ne-moze-uci-ni-u-europsku-uniju-27551|title=Thompson čak tri godine ne može ući ni u Europsku uniju|work=[[Večernji list]]|date=30 September 2009|language=Croatian|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perković created controversy by allegedly performing "[[Jasenovac i Gradiška Stara]]", a song that openly glorifies the [[Ustaše]] regime and its crimes against humanity during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak.aspx?id=178032|title=Thompson - domoljub ili fašist? Konačan odgovor je... - Vijesti.net|publisher=Index.hr|date=28 December 2003|accessdate=18 April 2012|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]] filed complaints to Croatia's state television channel regarding its broadcast of a singer accused of expressing nostalgia for the [[Ustaše]], although Perković denied any connection with that time period. The complaints were ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876983.html "Wiesenthal Center slams Croatian star nostalgic for pro-Nazi regime"]; accessed 5 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Perković denied writing or even performing the song, stating he is "a musician, not a politician".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/marko_perkovic|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|title=Backgrounder: Marko Perković and Thompson|accessdate=22 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029145525/http://www.adl.org/marko_perkovic/|archivedate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An organizer for a Thompson tour of [[New York City]] in 2007 also defended Perković, claiming the musician did not write the song nor is a copy available on any of his albums.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Many of his fans are known for their [[ultranationalism]], demonstrated by Ustaše uniforms (including black hats associated with the movement), symbols, and banners. At the beginning of the song "Bojna Čavoglave", Perković invokes ''[[za dom - spremni!]]'' (lit. ''"For home (land) – ready!"'')

==Personal life==
Perković's nickname, "Thompson", is actually a nom de guerre deriving from his time as a soldier in the [[Croatian War of Independence|1991-1995 Croatian War of Independence]], during which he carried a [[Thompson submachine gun]]. In the mid-1990s he was in a relationship with Croatian singer [[Danijela Martinović]]. Although never legally married, they had a Catholic marriage ceremony.{{Clarify|date=January 2016}} After their separation, he sought a Church annulment, which was granted by the Ecclesiastical Court in Split in 2005. Thus, he was able to have a church marriage with his wife Sandra, a Croatian-Canadian he met during a concert in Canada. Together they have five children.

He owns a 20% share of the radio station ''[[Narodni radio]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/thompson-kupio-20-narodnog-radija-za-4000-kuna/196676.aspx|title=Thompson kupio 20% Narodnog radija za 4000 kuna|work=Index.hr|date=14 April 2004|language=Croatian|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most successful privately owned Croatian radio station, notable for airing exclusively Croatian songs.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] received Perković in an audience in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/papa-primio-thompsona-dan-prije-mesica.html|title=Papa primio Thompsona dan prije Mesića|trans-title=Thompson received by Pope before Mesić|publisher=Dnevnik.hr|accessdate=18 April 2012|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Convair 990A OD-AFI MEA 2 LHR 20.06.70.jpg|thumb|right|A Middle East Airlines [[Convair 990 Coronado|Convair 990A]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 1970]]
[[File:MEA Boeing 747-200 Marmet.jpg|thumb|A Middle East Airlines [[Boeing 747-200]] in 1984]]
Middle East Airlines was founded on 31 May 1945 by [[Saeb Salam]]  and Fawzi EL-Hoss with operational and technical support from [[BOAC]].  Operations started on 1 January 1946 using three [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide|de Havilland DH.89A Dragon Rapides]] on flights between [[Beirut]] and [[Nicosia]], followed by flights to [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]].  Two [[Douglas DC-3]]s were acquired in mid-1946. [[Pan American World Airways]] acquired a stake and management contract in September 1949.  
    
[[Pan Am]] was replaced when BOAC acquired 49% of MEA's shares in 1955.  A [[Vickers Viscount]] was introduced in October 1955 while an [[Avro York]] cargo aircraft was leased in June 1957. On 15 December 1960 the first of four [[de Havilland Comet]] 4Cs arrived.  After the association with BOAC ended on 16 August 1961, MEA was merged with Air Liban on 7 June 1963, which gave [[Air France]] a 30% holding, since relinquished.  The full title was then Middle East Airlines – Air Liban.  
    
In 1963 MEA also took over [[Lebanese International Airways]].  The fleet was modernised with the addition of three [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]]s, in April 1963; three [[Boeing 720]]Bs, in January 1966; one leased [[Vickers VC10]], in March 1967; and a number of [[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320C]]s, from November 1967.   
    
The current name was adopted in November 1965 when the airline was completely merged with Air Liban.  Although operations were interrupted by the [[Six-Day War|1967 Arab–Israeli war]], and by the [[1968 Israeli raid on Lebanon|Israeli raid on Beirut Airport in 1968]] in-which, the airline lost three Comet 4C's, two Caravelles, a Boeing 707, the Vickers VC10, and the Vickers Viscount,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200102.html|title=mea - 1969 - 0102 - Flight Archive|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEA restarted by acquiring a [[Convair 990]]A from [[American Airlines]], which entered service on 24 June 1969.    
    
A [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-200B]] entered service in June 1975 on the Beirut – [[London]] route, and later on the Beirut-Paris-New York route from April 1983 until mid-1985.  MEA had to adjust its operations to the realities of war in Lebanon between 1975 and 1991 and despite multiple closures of the base at Beirut International Airport, was able to continue operating against all odds.  [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300]]s were acquired in 1993 and 1994, followed by an [[Airbus A320 family|A321-200]] in 1997 and the [[Airbus A330|A330-200]] (which replaced the A310s) in 2003.  

On June 28, 2012, Middle East Airlines joined the [[SkyTeam]] alliance to become its 17th member and the second in the [[Middle East]] following [[Saudia]].  
    
The airline has introduced self check-in kiosks at Beirut's international airport as of July 2010. The airline is also planning on launching the [[Arabesk Airline Alliance]] with six other Arab carriers. Their future plans include floating about 25% of their shares on the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) as part of a long-term plan to fully privatize the airline.    
    
A majority of the airline is owned by the [[central bank of Lebanon]], [[Banque du Liban]], (99.50%) and employs around 5,000 staff group-wide (as of February 2009). In November 2011, the chairman unlawfully  terminated the employment of a pilot who had cancer. This has forced the pilot union to go on strike as of November 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/cm/profile.cfm/cid709899/ Middle East Airlines AirLiban, MEA]. Zawya.com (2010-04-30).

{{prose|date=October 2018}}
*During an interview in March 2007 with MEA, Chairman Mr. Mohamad El-Hout indicated that the airline had three [[Airbus A330]]s and four [[Airbus A319]]s (later converted to A320s) on order and that the airline would start taking delivery of the first aircraft in May 2007, another in 2009, and the last three in 2010.

*On June 27, 2007, MEA announced it would be taking a $60,000,000 loan from the Lebanese bank Fransabank to purchase two [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]]s. The loan would be repaid over a 10-year period.

*In early October 2007, MEA announced a modified livery for its fleet as well as an increase of its A320 order from four to six aircraft.
*In November 2009, MEA placed an order for an [[Airbus A319]] with delivery expected late 2010 to early 2011, but this was later converted to another A320 order.

*In 2012, MEA confirmed an order for five [[Airbus A320neo family|Airbus A320neos]] (later converted to A321neos) and five [[Airbus A320neo family|Airbus A321neos]] along with eight options. All aircraft will be equipped with Wi-Fi, with the first delivery expected in 2019.

==Frequent-flyer program==
In 2011, Middle East Airlines changed its frequent-flyer program to a 4-tier program- Blue Cedar, Silver Cedar, Golden Cedar, and President's Club, respectively- in preparation for joining the [[SkyTeam]] airline alliance. Silver Cedar, Golden Cedar, and President's Club members gain numerous benefits such as access to the Cedar Lounge at [[Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport]], as well as outstation lounges at all MEA destinations. Golden Cedar and President's Club also include guaranteed seat reservation in economy as well as other extra benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mea.com.lb/English/CedarMiles/EarningYourMiles/Pages/TopTiersPrivileges.aspx Earning Frequent Flyer Miles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102120426/http://www.mea.com.lb/English/CedarMiles/EarningYourMiles/Pages/TopTiersPrivileges.aspx |date=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] as one of eight children to William Harvey Cooke and Elizabeth Richmond Marsden, Cooke attended [[Lehigh University]] in 1895 and obtained his degree in [[mechanical engineering]]. After Cooke had completed college and earned his degree from Lehigh University in mechanical engineering, he went into the work force to become a machinist. In 1900 he married Eleanor Bushnell Davis, a granddaughter of the industrialist [[Daniel Bushnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Dealers: Power Politics in the Age of Roosevelt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2pOlssB9fUC&amp;pg=PT326&amp;lpg=PT326&amp;dq=eleanor+bushnell+davis+cooke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZXGHHwj8OG&amp;sig=4EWvv18AHkv27C-aKTvF545yJSM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOlaTmi83bAhVDi1kKHZSiCc8Q6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=eleanor%20bushnell%20davis%20cooke&amp;f=false
|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooke served as the director of the Rural Electrification Administration from May 1935 through March 1937. In March 1937, Cooke resigned and was succeeded by [[John Carmody]]. In 1940 Cooke became a technical consultant for the Office of Production Management, where he led an American technical mission to Brazil. In 1943 headed the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|War Labor Board]] panel to mediate a coal miners' strike. In the year 1946-1947 he was a member of a committee "jump, jump, jump" to survey the patent system. In 1950 President [[Harry S. Truman]] appointed Cooke chairman of the [[Water Resources Policy Commission]]

Cooke was recognized for his work on obtaining inexpensive electricity for residential use, facilitating better labor-management relations, and the conservation of land and water resources. As he wrote in 1913, "We shall never fully realize . . . the dreams of democracy until the principles of scientific management have permeated every nook and cranny of the working world."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Business Week]]'', 18 Apr. 1964, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Scientific management ===
In 1903 Cooke met a [[mechanical engineer]] that would later become very influential in Cooke's work, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick W. Taylor]]. Taylor chose four men to implement his theories of scientific management in the work force; Cooke was one of these men. It was at this time that Cooke and Taylor developed a professional relationship and Taylor's principles influenced Cooke to believe that "the application of scientific management principles to industry would benefit all of society." This belief later led to the creation of Cooke's own scientific consultant firm in 1905.

In 1911, Cooke was appointed director of the [[Public works|Department of Public Works]] by Philadelphia's reform mayor, [[Rudolph Blankenburg]]. It was here that Cooke began to implement Taylor's principles of Scientific Management in order to change what he considered inefficient management practices in several departments. This change saved taxpayers thousands of dollars. This work was later reflected during World War II when he served on several boards. While serving on these boards Cooke was able to improve the storage of military goods. He also reorganized the Quartermaster Corps, and provided more electrical service to shipyards.

Between 1923 and 1925, Cooke administered a survey under Pennsylvania governor [[Gifford Pinchot]]. This survey "emphasized public support for rural electrification and state-directed reorganization of the electric industry."

=== Rural electrification ===
Morris Cooke had been interested in, and began working toward, the idea of [[rural electrification]] beginning in the 1920s. Cooke had been a progressive Republican prior to 1930, but following the election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Cooke shifted his support and became a liberal Democrat. Morris Cooke was selected for several committees by President Roosevelt; these included:
* the Upstream Engineering Conference, 
* the Great Plain Drought Area Committee, and 
* the Mississippi Valley Committee. 
However, Cooke was most influential in his appointment as the director for the [[Rural Electrification Administration]]. This agency had been newly organized by the Roosevelt Administration, and it was set up to finance the construction of several power distribution systems that lay within rural areas. Many of these rural areas had no available electricity, so it became Cooke's duty to work towards rural electrification.

== History ==
Octagon Computer Superstore started in 1982 as an IT products retailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://davaoportal.com/ads/octagon-computer-superstore-davao/|title=Octagon Computer Superstore Branches in Davao City {{!}} Davao Portal|website=davaoportal.com|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They mainly sell computer sets, accessories and components.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It then grew from a being an IT products retailer with a lone store in Manila to a chain of computer retail stores with branches nationwide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.octagon.com.ph/en/content/4-about-us|title=About us - Octagon|website=www.octagon.com.ph|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.libre247.com/store/viewstore/Octagon-Computer-Superstore|title=Discounts from Octagon Computer Superstore|website=www.libre247.com|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990s to 2010, Octagon became the country's reselling partner to various global technological brands such as [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewett-Packard]], [[Logitech]], and [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]]. With high sales from Octagon within that year, the company was given citations such as the Acer's Excellent Major Account Development Award in 1995 and Cisco's Retail Store of the Year in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.octagon.com.ph/en/content/8-awards|title=Awards - Octagon|website=www.octagon.com.ph|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon their development to attain nationwide reach, Octagon Computer Superstore opened their subsidiary store, Micro Valley Computer Center, with several branches in [[Cabanatuan]], [[Davao City|Davao]], [[Dumaguete]] and [[Manila]].

'''''Public Speaking and Influencing Men In Business''''' ({{ISBN|0-7661-6973-1}}) is a [[public speaking]] book written by [[Dale Carnegie]] in 1937 and first published in 1926 as ''Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men'', with several revised editions published later.  Dorothy Carnegie produced 2 separate revised editions:  ''How to Develop Self-Confidence and Influence People by Public Speaking'' (1956), aimed at the general public, and ''The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking'' (1962), as a replacement textbook for the Dale Carnegie Course.  A more recent revised edition is ''Public Speaking for Success'' (2005), revised by Arthur Pell, which restores content that was left out of the Dorothy Carnegie-revised works.

''Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men'', ''Public Speaking and Influencing Men In Business'', and ''The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking'' served as standard textbooks in the Dale Carnegie Course.

The main focus of this book is to present a thorough understanding of the principles of public speaking, as well as guidance into conquering the fears attributed to public speaking.

The association carries out research, and co-ordinates statistics and intelligence on marine and wind power in the UK and its [[Exclusive Economic Zone|waters]]. It also represents its members internationally, and to Government, regional bodies and local authorities in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==History==
A number of [[university|universities]] active in wind energy in the 1970s met under umbrella of the ITDG Wind Panel (Intermediate Technology Development Group). The BWEA was formed from the ITDG Wind Panel along with other interested parties and representatives from industry, to promote [[wind power in the United Kingdom]]. The inaugural meeting of the BWEA took place on 17 November 1978 at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory|Rutherford Laboratory]] with [[Peter Musgrove]] of [[Reading University]] as chairman.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2004 the British Wind Energy Association expanded its remit to include wave and tidal energy, and to use the Association's experience to guide these technologies along the same path to commercialisation.  In December 2009, to reflect this expansion in the industries it represented, members resolved to adopt the new name of RenewableUK.

===Advertising Standards Authority ruling===

In 2008 the then BWEA was found by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) to have overstated the carbon dioxide emissions displaced by wind generation. The BWEA and its members had claimed a value of 860 grams per kilowatt hour but the ASA found this was exaggerated by 100% and ordered the BWEA to reduce the figure to 430 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/windpower/3867232/Promoters-overstated-the-environmental-benefit-of-wind-farms.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Sawer | title=Promoters overstated the environmental benefit of wind farms | date=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14770">'''Shirriff''' is the brand name of several food products first produced by the defunct Shirriff family food products company in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Francis Shirriff founded a food extracts company in the 1880s. The company would go on develop a line of food products including marmalades, dessert toppings and jelly and pudding mixes. The company remained a family business until the 1950s when it was sold to the owner of the Dominion Stores chain. Later, the firm was bought by [[Kelloggs]] of Canada. In 1988 and 1992, Kelloggs sold its interests. Many of the Shirriff brand products are still in production, although now by other companies: [[The J. M. Smucker Company]] and [[Dr. Oetker]]. The company's most well-known product was likely its "Good Morning Marmalade", the best-selling marmalade in Canada.&lt;ref name="david-obit"/&gt; Francis Shirriff was also one of the founders of the Niagara Falls Wine Company, later known as Bright's and Vincor International.

==History==
Francis Adam Shirriff was born in [[Huntingdon, Quebec]], the son of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] emigrant doctor Francis Walker Shirriff and Anna Macnider.&lt;ref name="nfobit"/&gt; He moved to [[Toronto]] in 1872 at the age of 24 and began working in the grocery business.&lt;ref name="nfobit"/&gt; In 1874, Shirriff started the Niagara Falls Wine Company with Thomas G. Bright.&lt;ref name="nfobit"/&gt;

In 1883, Shirriff founded his own business, the Imperial Extract Company, which sold essential oils and flavour extracts,&lt;ref name="david-obit"/&gt; beginning a long career in food production. The company exhibited at the [[Canadian National Exhibition|Toronto Industrial Exhibition]] in 1885. Their exhibit was described by the ''Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal'' as "One of the handsomest exhibits" and "This firm have made a specialty of fruit and flavoring extracts, and are also giving considerable attention to perfumery, of both which they made a handsome display."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Canadian Pharmaceutical Association, Ontario College of Pharmacy |journal=Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal |volume=19 1885–86 |editor-first=E.B. |editor-last=Shuttleworth |year=1885 |issue=3, October 1885|p=32 |title=The Chemical Section at the Industrial Exhibition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWUCAAAAYAAJ&amp; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's address in the 1886 city directory was 48 Colborne Street, listed for essential oils and perfumery.&lt;ref name=tcd1886/&gt;The company won a Bronze Medal for their display at the 1887 show and displayed a new product of lemon juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Canadian Pharmaceutical Association, Ontario College of Pharmacy |journal=Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal |volume=21, 1887-1888 |editor-first=E.B. |editor-last=Shuttleworth |title=The Chemical Section at the Combined Dominion and Industrial Exhibition |page=30 |issue=3, October 1887 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGMCAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright and Shirriff moved to Niagara Falls to concentrate on the wine business,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Brock University |title=Brock University Digital Repository |url=http://dr.library.brocku.ca/handle/10464/2683/browse?value=Niagara+Falls+Wine+Company&amp;type=subject }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Imperial Extract Co. continued its operations in Toronto. In 1889, the company is listed at 49 Front Street East, sharing space with Bright, listed for essential oils, flavouring extracts, and baking powder.&lt;ref name=tcd1889/&gt; Shirriff's sons Colin, Francis, and William joined the business in the following decades.{{sfn|Hood|2012|p=9}} The company moved to 54 Colborne, sharing space with Bright and the Niagara Falls Wine Company.&lt;ref name=tcd1903/&gt;

In 1903, Shiriff first made marmalade.&lt;ref name="gm1956"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Globe and Mail |title=Food Research |date=November 19, 1956 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, it displayed its marmalades at a booth at the Pure Food Show at [[Massey Hall]]. The ''[[Toronto Daily Star]]'' reported: "One of the most daintily dressed booths in the hall is that of Shirriffs marmalades and flavoring essence. The public is invited to sample the delicious shredded orange marmalade served with reception wafers. Numbers of people took advantage of the invitation yesterday afternoon and expressions of approval were frequent. It is absolutely pure, containing nothing but the finest fruit and granulated sugar."&lt;ref name="star-1905"&gt;{{cite news |title=Attractive Exhibits at Pure Food Show |work=Toronto Daily Star |date=April 6, 1905 |p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also showed its jelly powders and flavouring extracts.&lt;ref name="star-1905"/&gt;

By 1909, the company was prosperous enough to build its own factory at 8–12 Matilda Street at Steiner (now Carroll) Street, just north of Queen Street East in Toronto.&lt;ref name=tcd11/&gt; The building, designed by architect Charles Herbert Acton Bond of Bond &amp; Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1669 |title=Bond, Charles Herbert Acton |accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built at a cost of $20,000.{{sfn|Hood|2012|p=9}} The factory housed both the Shirriff production line and the Niagara Falls Wine Company.{{sfn|Hood|2012|p=9}} In 1911, the Shirriffs sold their share of the Niagara Falls Wine Company. Thomas Bright also sold out in 1933.{{sfn|Hood|2012|p=9}}

As a youth, naturalist [[Charles Sauriol]], worked at the Shirriff factory after school and during the summers. Sauriol wrote about his experience:

{{Quote|text=At Shirriffs I learned several things about Seville oranges, also how jelly powders were made.... We ate a lot of jelly at home in those days. Each Friday the employees were given an opportunity to buy five pound damaged tins of marmalade for bargain prices under a dollar, and many the can I brought home. The Shirriffs were very kind to me and Will the senior partner would often stop to chat with me. |source=Charles Sauriol in Toronto Archives, Charles Sauriol Fonds, Box 123286-4, Series 107, File 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Sauriol |title=Boyhood Memories |page=Chapter 6, p/ 2 |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Shirriff Advertisement 1929.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement depicting Shirriff finding source of recipe]]
In the 1920s, Shirriff advertised nationally in newspapers, describing their marmalades as something traditional, artisanal, and above all genuinely Scottish.{{sfn|Hood|2012|p=10}} An advertisement in the Ottawa Citizen of 1929 had the following text:

{{Quote|text=On a trip to Scotland many years ago, Francis A. Shirriff stopped at an old Scottish hostel famed for its good food. A remarkably delicious marmalade was served. Inquiring from the inn-keeper, he found it was made by a master marmalade maker whose name was known throughout all Scotland. His rare old recipe was sought by many, but its secrets were known only to himself. It was a heritage
passed on from father to son. "Surely this is a treat for Canadians to enjoy" - thought Mr. Shirriff, and with that in mind he offered to purchase the recipe. A price was eventually agreed upon and the recipe became his. That is how it came to Canada. This is  why you can now enjoy luscious, full flavoured marmalade, the same as was made in that quaint old Scottish shop many years ago - from that "Rare Old Scotch Recipe|source=Ottawa Citizen&lt;ref name="cit1929"&gt;{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=October 15, 1929 |title=Shirriff's Marmalades display ad |p=17 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O6guAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kNoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3867%2C2854446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

At the time, Shirriff sold three types of marmalade: Seville Orange, Shredded Orange, and Pineapple. Prices ranged from a 12 oz. jar for 25¢ to four-pounds for 55¢.&lt;ref name="cit1929"/&gt;

In 1927, Shirriff introduced the "Flavour Bud", a dissolvable capsule of extract for making jelly. Shiriff introduced the "Lushus" brand of products using the "Flavour Bud."&lt;ref name="gm1956"/&gt; In 1930, Shirriff introduced its "Good Morning" Marmalade, a recipe of three citrus fruits: oranges, grapefruit and lemons.

Francis Shirriff, Sr. died in 1944 at the age of 97.&lt;ref name="nfobit"/&gt; and the company passed to his sons. In 1947, his grandson William David (David), son of William, joined the company. In his youth he had worked at the company, including working in the Shirriff booth at the Canadian National Exhibition.{{sfn|Hood|2012|p=10}} David fought in [[Italy]] during [[World War II]] and, in 1947, entered the family business in a managerial capacity.&lt;ref name="david-obit"/&gt;

By 1953, the company's 70th year, David Shirriff had risen in the business to take charge of the jam division.{{sfn|Hood|2012|p=10}} The Shirriffs decided to sell the company to J. William Horsey, president of the [[Dominion (supermarket)|Dominion]] chain of supermarkets. "His father had died and his uncles were elderly and tired of the business demands so the time seemed right to sell."&lt;ref name="david-obit"/&gt; Horsey asked him to stay on and manage the new company, known as Shirriff-Horsey.&lt;ref name="david-obit"/&gt; In 1956, the company was estimated to have one-third of the marmalade, extracts and jelly powder market in Canada.&lt;ref name="gm1956"/&gt; 

Shirriff-Horsey was merged with [[Salada tea|Salada Tea]] in June 1957. The merger created a large multinational food company. It was described as "an international food organization manufacturing and processing a variety of products in six cities in three countries," including a plant in [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shirriff-Horsey, Salada Tea Merger Creates Huge Company |newspaper=Lakeland Ledger |date=June 30, 1957 |p=2D |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19570630&amp;id=c1pYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HPoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7100,62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the company acquired the "[[Junket (company)|Junket]]" dessert products company and its factory in Little Falls, New York.&lt;ref name="junket"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.junketdesserts.com/history.aspx |title=History |publisher=Redco Foods |accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the company name was changed to Salada Foods.&lt;ref name="junket"/&gt;

For several years, starting in the 1950s, Shirriff Salada gave away coins with depictions of [[National Hockey League]] hockey players on them in their food packages. At first, these coins were made of metal, but the company converted to plastic coins in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="wrr"&gt;{{cite news |work=Waterloo Region Record |first=Ron |last=Stephenson |title=A piece of Leaf heaven |date=April 28, 2014 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are bought and sold today as collector items.&lt;ref name="wrr"/&gt; The company also introduced [[hockey cards]] and baseball player [[trading cards]] in their packages.

In 1965, David Shirriff left the company, thus bringing to an end the Shirriff family's 82-year association with the company.&lt;ref name="david-obit"/&gt; Horsey sold the company to cereal company [[Kellogg's|Kellogg's of Canada]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="junket"/&gt; In 1988, Kellogg Salada sold the Shirriff ice cream toppings, jams and marmalades to the [[United States|American]] J.M. Smucker Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |first=Sandra |last=Coulson |title=Kellogg Salada is selling product brand to U.S. firm |date=January 6, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American assets of Salada and Junket were sold to Redco Foods, Inc.&lt;ref name="junket"/&gt; and the Canadian assets to Unilever Ltd. In 1992, Kellogg sold the remaining Shirriff brands it owned (pie fillings and instant potatoes) to the Germany-based Dr. Oetker Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Evans |title=Shirriff unloaded: Kellogg Canada sells food division |work=National Post |date=March 25, 1992 |p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Shirriff entered the plastics business after leaving Salada Foods. He also bought the Crown Inn, a 1200s-era inn in [[Chiddingfold]], [[England]]. He sold the plastics business in 1992 and retired. He died in 2008 in the Veterans Section of [[Sunnybrook Hospital]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name="david-obit"/&gt; He was survived by Elizabeth, his wife of 60 years, their children Bill, Martha and Judy, his sister Kathryn and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name="david-obit"/&gt; 

The Shirriff factory on Matilda Street still stands, used by other businesses. Shirriff's Good Morning Marmalade is produced by J. M. Smuckers in the United States and marketed as Shirriff's Pure Marmalade.&lt;ref&gt;Per product packaging.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Oetker continues to make Shirriff products at its factory in [[Mississauga]], Ontario, Canada.

In the field of [[management]], '''strategic management''' involves the formulation and implementation of the major [[goal]]s and initiatives taken by an [[organization]]'s top [[managers | management]] on behalf of owners, based on consideration of [[Factors of production |resources]] and an assessment of the internal and external environments in which the organization operates.&lt;ref name="Nag, R.; Hambrick, D.

==Definition==
[[File:Strategic Management Framework.png|thumb|300px|Strategic management processes and activities]]

'''Strategic management''' involves the formulation and implementation of the major goals and initiatives taken by a company's top management on behalf of owners, based on consideration of [[Factors of production|resources]] and an assessment of the internal and external environments in which the organization competes.&lt;ref name="Nag, R.; Hambrick, D. C.; Chen, M.-J 2007 935–955"/&gt; [[Strategy]] is defined as "the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals."&lt;ref name="Chandler, Alfred 1962"&gt;Chandler, Alfred ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the history of industrial enterprise'', Doubleday, New York, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg, Henry 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[California Management Review]] |year=1987 |issue=Fall 1987 |title= Why Organizations Need Strategy |author= Mintzberg, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic management involves the related concepts of [[strategic planning]] and [[strategic thinking]]&lt;ref&gt;Graetz, F., 2002. Strategic thinking versus strategic planning: towards understanding the complementarities. Management decision, 40(5), pp.456-462.&lt;/ref&gt;. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. [[Strategic planning]] may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens ''around'' the strategic thinking or strategy making activity.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

Strategic management is often described as involving two major processes: ''formulation'' and ''implementation'' of strategy. While described sequentially below, in practice the two processes are iterative and each provides input for the other.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"&gt;{{cite book

| title = [[The Strategy Process:Concepts, Contexts, Cases]] | publisher = Prentice Hall
| isbn = 978-0-13-234030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation===
''Formulation'' of strategy involves analyzing the environment in which the organization operates, then making a series of strategic decisions about how the organization will compete. Formulation ends with a series of goals or objectives and measures for the organization to pursue.  
Environmental analysis includes the:
*Remote external environment, including the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental landscape ([[PEST analysis|PESTLE]]);
*Industry environment, such as the competitive behavior of rival organizations, the bargaining power of buyers/customers and suppliers, threats from new entrants to the industry, and the ability of buyers to substitute products ([[Porter five forces analysis|Porter's 5 forces]]); and 
*Internal environment, regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the organization's resources (i.e., its people, processes and IT systems).&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

''Strategic decisions'' are based on insight from the environmental assessment and are responses to strategic questions about how the organization will compete, such as:
*What is the organization's business?
*Who is the target customer for the organization's products and services? 
*Where are the customers and how do they buy? What is considered "value" to the customer?
*Which businesses, products and services should be included or excluded from the portfolio of offerings?
*What is the geographic scope of the business?
*What differentiates the company from its competitors in the eyes of customers and other stakeholders?
*Which skills and capabilities should be developed within the firm?
*What are the important opportunities and risks for the organization?
*How can the firm grow, through both its base business and new business?
*How can the firm generate more [[Shareholder value|value]] for investors?&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drucker1954"&gt;{{cite book

| first = Peter
| authorlink = Peter Drucker
| year = 1954
| title = [[The Practice of Management]] | publisher = Harper &amp; Row
| isbn = 0-06-091316-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The answers to these and many other strategic questions result in the organization's strategy and a series of specific short-term and long-term goals or objectives and related measures.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

===Implementation===
The second major process of strategic management is ''implementation'', which involves decisions regarding how the organization's resources (i.e., people, process and IT systems) will be aligned and mobilized towards the objectives.  Implementation results in how the organization's resources are structured (such as by product or service or geography), leadership arrangements, communication, incentives, and monitoring mechanisms to track progress towards objectives, among others.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

Running the day-to-day operations of the business is often referred to as "operations management" or specific terms for key departments or functions, such as "logistics management" or "marketing management," which take over once strategic management decisions are implemented.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

===Many definitions of strategy===
{{quote box
|quote=Strategy has been practiced whenever an advantage was gained by planning the sequence and timing of the deployment of resources while simultaneously taking into account the probable capabilities and behavior of competition.

|width = 300px
}}

In 1988, [[Henry Mintzberg]] described the many different definitions and perspectives on strategy reflected in both academic research and in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry “Crafting Strategy”, Harvard Business Review, July/August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry and Quinn, J.B. ''The Strategy Process'', Prentice-Hall, Harlow, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He examined the strategic process and concluded it was much more fluid and unpredictable than people had thought. Because of this, he could not point to one process that could be called [[strategic planning]]. Instead Mintzberg concludes that there are five types of strategies:
* Strategy as plan – a directed course of action to achieve an ''intended'' set of goals; similar to the strategic planning concept;
* Strategy as pattern – a consistent pattern of past behavior, with a strategy ''realized'' over time rather than planned or ''intended''. Where the realized pattern was different from the intent, he referred to the strategy as ''emergent'';
* Strategy as position – locating brands, products, or companies within the market, based on the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders; a strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm;
* Strategy as ploy – a specific maneuver intended to outwit a competitor; and
* Strategy as perspective – executing strategy based on a "theory of the business" or natural extension of the mindset or ideological perspective of the organization.

In 1998, Mintzberg developed these five types of management strategy into 10 “schools of thought” and grouped them into three categories. The first group is normative. It consists of the schools of informal design and conception, the formal planning, and analytical positioning. The second group, consisting of six schools, is more concerned with how strategic management is actually done, rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are entrepreneurial, visionary, cognitive, learning/adaptive/emergent, negotiation, corporate culture and business environment. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, a hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or “episodes”.&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, H. Ahlstrand, B. and Lampel, J. ''Strategy Safari : A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Strategic Management'', The Free Press, New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Porter]] defined strategy in 1980 as the "...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals" and the "...combination of the ''ends'' (goals) for which the firm is striving and the ''means'' (policies) by which it is seeking to get there." He continued that: "The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment."&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;

Some complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=R. D.|title=The science of complexity - an alter-native perspective for strategic change processes |journal=Strategic Management Journal|date=1995|volume=16|issue=6 |pages=477–495|doi=10.1002/smj.4250160606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terra|first1=L.

==Historical development==

===Origins===
The strategic management discipline originated in the 1950s and 1960s. Among the numerous early contributors, the most influential were Peter Drucker, Philip Selznick, Alfred Chandler, Igor Ansoff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.francoangeli.it/ricerca/Scheda_libro.aspx?ID=2297&amp;Tipo=Libro|title=Strategia sì, ma non troppo. Guidare l'azienda tra metodo e intuito|last=Camporesi|first=Alberto|publisher=Franco Angeli|year=1989|isbn=9788820430191|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bruce Henderson.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Ghemawat
| first = Pankaj
| title = Competition and Business Strategy in Historical Perspective
| journal = Business History Review
| date = Spring 2002
| ssrn = 264528
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline draws from earlier thinking and texts on '[[strategy]]' dating back thousands of years. Prior to 1960, the term "strategy" was primarily used regarding war and politics, not business.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt; Many companies built [[strategic planning]] functions to develop and execute the formulation and implementation processes during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1994/01/the-fall-and-rise-of-strategic-planning/ar/1 Henry Mintberg-The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning-Harvard Business Review-January 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Drucker]] was a prolific management theorist and author of dozens of management books, with a career spanning five decades. He addressed fundamental strategic questions in a 1954 book ''The Practice of Management'' writing: "... the first responsibility of top management is to ask the question 'what is our business?' and to make sure it is carefully studied and correctly answered." He wrote that the answer was determined by the customer. He recommended eight areas where objectives should be set, such as market standing, innovation, productivity, physical and financial resources, worker performance and attitude, profitability, manager performance and development, and public responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter ''The Practice of Management'', Harper and Row, New York, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, [[Philip Selznick]] initially used the term "distinctive competence" in referring to how the Navy was attempting to differentiate itself from the other services.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt; He also formalized the idea of matching the organization's internal factors with external environmental circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Selznick, Philip ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pP6ndnDdOBcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Leadership in Administration: A Sociological Interpretation]'', Row, Peterson, Evanston Il. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; This core idea was developed further by [[Kenneth R. Andrews]] in 1963 into what we now call [[SWOT analysis]], in which the strengths and weaknesses of the firm are assessed in light of the opportunities and threats in the business environment.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

[[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] recognized the importance of coordinating management activity under an all-encompassing strategy. Interactions between functions were typically handled by managers who relayed information back and forth between departments. Chandler stressed the importance of taking a long term perspective when looking to the future. In his 1962 ground breaking work ''Strategy and Structure'', Chandler showed that a long-term coordinated strategy was necessary to give a company structure, direction and focus. He says it concisely, "[[structure follows strategy]]." Chandler wrote that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals''."&lt;ref name="Chandler, Alfred 1962"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Igor Ansoff]] built on Chandler's work by adding concepts and inventing a vocabulary. He developed a grid that compared strategies for market penetration, product development, market development and [[horizontal integration|horizontal]] and [[vertical integration]] and diversification. He felt that management could use the grid to systematically prepare for the future. In his 1965 classic ''Corporate Strategy'', he developed [[gap analysis]] to clarify the gap between the current reality and the goals and to develop what he called "gap reducing actions".&lt;ref&gt;Ansoff, Igor ''Corporate Strategy'', McGraw Hill, New York, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Ansoff wrote that strategic management had three parts: [[strategic planning]]; the skill of a firm in converting its plans into reality; and the skill of a firm in managing its own internal resistance to change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/13311148 The Economist-Strategic Planning-March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Henderson]], founder of the [[Boston Consulting Group]], wrote about the concept of the [[experience curve]] in 1968, following initial work begun in 1965. The experience curve refers to a hypothesis that unit production costs decline by 20–30% every time cumulative production doubles. This supported the argument for achieving higher market share and [[economies of scale]].&lt;ref name="BCG1968"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Henderson
| first = Bruce
| year = 1970
| title = [[Perspectives on Experience]] | publisher = Boston Consulting Group
| isbn = 0-684-84148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter wrote in 1980 that companies have to make choices about their scope and the type of competitive advantage they seek to achieve, whether lower cost or differentiation. The idea of strategy targeting particular industries and customers (i.e., competitive positions) with a differentiated offering was a departure from the experience-curve influenced strategy paradigm, which was focused on larger scale and lower cost.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Porter
| first = Michael E.
| year = 1980
| title = [[Competitive Strategy]] | publisher = Free Press
| isbn = 0-684-84148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter revised the strategy paradigm again in 1985, writing that superior performance of the processes and activities performed by organizations as part of their [[value chain]] is the foundation of competitive advantage, thereby outlining a process view of strategy.&lt;ref name="Porter1985"/&gt;

===Change in focus from production to marketing===
The direction of strategic research also paralleled a major paradigm shift in how companies competed, specifically a shift from the production focus to market focus.  The prevailing concept in strategy up to the 1950s was to create a [[product (business)|product]] of high technical quality. If you created a product that worked well and was durable, it was assumed you would have no difficulty profiting. This was called the [[production orientation]]. [[Henry Ford]] famously said of the Model T car: "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants, so long as it is black."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Henry Ford|Wikiquote-Henry Ford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Management theorist [[Peter F Drucker]] wrote in 1954 that it was the customer who defined what business the organization was in.&lt;ref name="Drucker1954"/&gt; In 1960 [[Theodore Levitt]] argued that instead of producing products then trying to sell them to the customer, businesses should start with the customer, find out what they wanted, and then produce it for them. The fallacy of the production orientation was also referred to as [[marketing myopia]] in an article of the same name by Levitt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/2004/07/marketing-myopia/ar/1 Theodore Levitt-Marketing Myopia-HBR-1960]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the customer became the driving force behind all strategic business decisions. This [[marketing]] concept, in the decades since its introduction, has been reformulated and repackaged under names including market orientation, customer orientation, customer intimacy, customer focus, customer-driven and market focus.

[[James C. Collins|Jim Collins]] wrote in 1997 that the strategic frame of reference is expanded by focusing on ''why'' a company exists rather than ''what'' it makes.&lt;ref name="jimcollins.com"/&gt; In 2001, he recommended that organizations define themselves based on three key questions:
*What are we passionate about?
*What can we be best in the world at?
*What drives our economic engine?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html Jim Collins-Good to Great-Fast Company Magazine-October 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature of strategy===
In 1985, Professor Ellen Earle-Chaffee summarized what she thought were the main elements of strategic management theory where consensus generally existed as of the 1970s, writing that strategic management:&lt;ref name="Chaffee, E. 1985"/&gt;
* Involves adapting the organization to its business environment;
* Is fluid and complex. Change creates novel combinations of circumstances requiring unstructured non-repetitive responses;
* Affects the entire organization by providing direction;
* Involves both strategy formulation processes and also implementation of the content of the strategy;
* May be planned (intended) and unplanned (emergent);
* Is done at several levels: overall corporate strategy, and individual business strategies; and
* Involves both conceptual and analytical thought processes.

Chaffee further wrote that research up to that point covered three models of strategy, which were not mutually exclusive: 
#Linear strategy: A planned determination of goals, initiatives, and allocation of resources, along the lines of the Chandler definition above. This is most consistent with [[strategic planning]] approaches and may have a long planning horizon. The strategist "deals with" the environment but it is not the central concern.
#Adaptive strategy: In this model, the organization's goals and activities are primarily concerned with adaptation to the environment, analogous to a biological organism. The need for continuous adaption reduces or eliminates the planning window. There is more focus on means (resource mobilization to address the environment) rather than ends (goals). Strategy is less centralized than in the linear model.
#Interpretive strategy: A more recent and less developed model than the linear and adaptive models, interpretive strategy is concerned with "orienting metaphors constructed for the purpose of conceptualizing and guiding individual attitudes or organizational participants." The aim of interpretive strategy is legitimacy or credibility in the mind of stakeholders. It places emphasis on symbols and language to influence the minds of customers, rather than the physical product of the organization.&lt;ref name="Chaffee, E. 1985"/&gt;

The progress of strategy since 1960 can be charted by a variety of frameworks and concepts introduced by management consultants and academics. These reflect an increased focus on cost, competition and customers. These "3 Cs" were illuminated by much more robust empirical analysis at ever-more granular levels of detail, as industries and organizations were disaggregated into business units, activities, processes, and individuals in a search for sources of competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;

===SWOT analysis===
{{Main article|SWOT analysis}}
[[File:SWOT en.svg|thumb|A SWOT analysis, with its four elements in a 2×2 matrix.]]
By the 1960s, the capstone business policy course at the Harvard Business School included the concept of matching the distinctive competence of a company (its internal strengths and weaknesses) with its environment (external opportunities and threats) in the context of its objectives. This framework came to be known by the acronym SWOT and was "a major step forward in bringing explicitly competitive thinking to bear on questions of strategy". [[Kenneth R. Andrews]] helped popularize the framework via a 1963 conference and it remains commonly used in practice.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

===Experience curve===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Experience curve.gif|300px|thumb|Experience curve]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Experience curve}}
The [[experience curve]] was developed by the [[Boston Consulting Group]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"&gt;{{cite book

It has been empirically confirmed by some firms at various points in their history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/Classics/strategy_supply_chain_management_experience_curve_reviewed_the_concept/ BCG Perspectives-The Experience Curve Reviewed-Parts 1-5-1974]&lt;/ref&gt; Costs decline due to a variety of factors, such as the [[learning curve]], substitution of labor for capital (automation), and technological sophistication. Author [[Walter Kiechel]] wrote that it reflected several insights, including:
*A company can always improve its cost structure;
*Competitors have varying cost positions based on their experience;
*Firms could achieve lower costs through higher market share, attaining a competitive advantage; and
*An increased focus on empirical analysis of costs and processes, a concept which author Kiechel refers to as "Greater [[Scientific management|Taylorism]]".
Kiechel wrote in 2010: "The experience curve was, simply, the most important concept in launching the strategy revolution...with the experience curve, the strategy revolution began to insinuate an acute awareness of competition into the corporate consciousness." Prior to the 1960s, the word competition rarely appeared in the most prominent management literature; U.S. companies then faced considerably less competition and did not focus on performance relative to peers. Further, the experience curve provided a basis for the retail sale of business ideas, helping drive the management consulting 
industry.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;

===Corporate strategy and portfolio theory===
{{Main article|Modern portfolio theory|Growth–share matrix}}
[[Image:Folio Plot BCG Matrix Example.png|BCG Matrix|right|thumb|Portfolio growth–share matrix]]

The concept of the corporation as a portfolio of business units, with each plotted graphically based on its market share (a measure of its competitive position relative to its peers) and industry growth rate (a measure of industry attractiveness), was summarized in the [[growth–share matrix]] developed by the Boston Consulting Group around 1970. By 1979, one study estimated that 45% of the Fortune 500 companies were using some variation of the matrix in their strategic planning. This framework helped companies decide where to invest their resources (i.e., in their high market share, high growth businesses) and which businesses to divest (i.e., low market share, low growth businesses.)&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt; [[C. K. Prahalad]] and [[Gary Hamel]] suggested that companies should build portfolios of businesses around shared technical or operating competencies, and should develop structures and processes to enhance their [[Core_competency|core competencies]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/1995/03/corporate-strategy-the-quest-for-parenting-advantage Corporate Strategy: The Quest for Parenting Advantage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter wrote in 1987 that corporate strategy involves two questions: 1) What business should the corporation be in? and 2) How should the corporate office manage its business units? He mentioned four concepts of corporate strategy; the latter three can be used together:&lt;ref name="Porter1987"&gt;[http://people.tamu.edu/~v-buenger/466/Comp_Adv_to_corp_strat.pdf Harvard Business Review-Michael Porter-From Competitive Advantage to Corporate Strategy-May 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Portfolio theory: A strategy based primarily on diversification through acquisition. The corporation shifts resources among the units and monitors the performance of each business unit and its leaders. Each unit generally runs autonomously, with limited interference from the corporate center provided goals are met. 
#Restructuring: The corporate office acquires then actively intervenes in a business where it detects potential, often by replacing management and implementing a new business strategy.
#Transferring skills: Important managerial skills and organizational capability are essentially spread to multiple businesses. The skills must be necessary to competitive advantage.
#Sharing activities: Ability of the combined corporation to leverage centralized functions, such as sales, finance, etc. thereby reducing costs.&lt;ref name="Porter1987"/&gt;

Other techniques were developed to analyze the relationships between elements in a portfolio. The growth-share matrix, a part of [[B.C.G. Analysis]], was followed by [[G.E. multi factoral analysis|G.E. multi factoral model]], developed by General Electric. Companies continued to diversify as conglomerates until the 1980s, when deregulation and a less restrictive anti-trust environment led to the view that a portfolio of operating divisions in different industries was worth more as many independent companies, leading to the breakup of many conglomerates.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;  While the popularity of portfolio theory has waxed and waned, the key dimensions considered (industry attractiveness and competitive position) remain central to strategy.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

===Competitive advantage===
{{Main article|Competitive advantage}}
In 1980, Porter defined the two types of competitive advantage an organization can achieve relative to its rivals: lower cost or [[Product differentiation|differentiation]]. This advantage derives from attribute(s) that allow an organization to outperform its competition, such as superior market position, skills, or resources. In Porter's view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="Porter1985"&gt;{{cite book

===Industry structure and profitability===
[[File:Elements of Industry Structure.svg|thumb|350px|A graphical representation of Porter's Five Forces]]
{{Main article|Porter five forces analysis}}
Porter developed a framework for analyzing the profitability of industries and how those profits are divided among the participants in 1980. In [[Porter 5 forces analysis|five forces analysis]] he identified the forces that shape the industry structure or environment. The framework involves the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, the threat of new entrants, the availability of substitute products, and the competitive rivalry of firms in the industry. These forces affect the organization's ability to raise its prices as well as the costs of inputs (such as raw materials) for its processes.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;

The five forces framework helps describe how a firm can use these forces to obtain a [[sustainable competitive advantage]], either lower cost or differentiation. Companies can maximize their profitability by competing in industries with favorable structure. Competitors can take steps to grow the overall profitability of the industry, or to take profit away from other parts of the industry structure. Porter modified Chandler's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: while organizational structure follows strategy, it in turn follows industry structure.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;

===Generic competitive strategies===
{{Main article|Porter's generic strategies}}
[[Image:Michael Porter's Three Generic Strategies.svg|thumb|left|350px|Michael Porter's Three Generic Strategies]]
Porter wrote in 1980 that strategy target either [[cost leadership]], [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]], or focus.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt; These are known as Porter's three generic strategies and can be applied to any size or form of business. Porter claimed that a company must only choose one of the three or risk that the business would waste precious resources. Porter's [[Porter generic strategies|generic strategies]] detail the interaction between cost minimization strategies, product differentiation strategies, and market focus strategies.

Porter described an industry as having multiple ''segments'' that can be targeted by a firm. The breadth of its targeting refers to the ''competitive scope'' of the business.  Porter defined two types of ''competitive advantage'': lower cost or differentiation relative to its rivals. Achieving competitive advantage results from a firm's ability to cope with the five forces better than its rivals. Porter wrote: "[A]chieving competitive advantage requires a firm to make a choice...about the type of competitive advantage it seeks to attain and the scope within which it will attain it." He also wrote: "The two basic types of competitive advantage [differentiation and lower cost] combined with the scope of activities for which a firm seeks to achieve them lead to three ''generic strategies'' for achieving above average performance in an industry: cost leadership, differentiation and focus. The focus strategy has two variants, cost focus and differentiation focus."&lt;ref name="Porter1985"/&gt;

The concept of choice was a different perspective on strategy, as the 1970s [[paradigm]] was the pursuit of market share (size and scale) influenced by the [[experience curve]]. Companies that pursued the highest market share position to achieve cost advantages fit under Porter's cost leadership generic strategy, but the concept of choice regarding differentiation and focus represented a new perspective.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;

===Value chain===
[[File:Porter Value Chain.png|thumb|350px|right|Michael Porter's Value Chain]]
{{Main article|Value chain}}
Porter's 1985 description of the [[value chain]] refers to the chain of activities (processes or collections of processes) that an organization performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market. These include functions such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, supported by systems and technology infrastructure. By aligning the various activities in its value chain with the organization's strategy in a coherent way, a firm can achieve a competitive advantage. Porter also wrote that strategy is an internally consistent configuration of activities that differentiates a firm from its rivals. A robust competitive position cumulates from many activities which should fit coherently together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy/ar/1 Michael Porter-What is Strategy?-Harvard Business Review-November 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter wrote in 1985: "Competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering and supporting its product. Each of these activities can contribute to a firm's relative cost position and create a basis for differentiation...the value chain disaggregates a firm into its strategically relevant activities in order to understand the behavior of costs and the existing and potential sources of differentiation."&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

===Core competence===
{{Main article|Core competency}}
[[Gary Hamel]] and [[C. K. Prahalad]] described the idea of [[core competency]] in 1990, the idea that each organization has some capability in which it excels and that the business should focus on opportunities in that area, letting others go or [[outsourcing]] them. Further, core competency is difficult to duplicate, as it involves the skills and coordination of people across a variety of functional areas or processes used to deliver value to customers. By outsourcing, companies expanded the concept of the value chain, with some elements within the entity and others without.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G. &amp; Prahalad, C.K. “The Core Competence of the Corporation”, ''Harvard Business Review'', May–June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Core competency is part of a branch of strategy called the ''[[resource-based view]]'' of the firm, which postulates that if activities are strategic as indicated by the value chain, then the organization's capabilities and ability to learn or adapt are also strategic.&lt;ref name="Ghemawat1"/&gt;

===Theory of the business===
[[Peter Drucker]] wrote in 1994 about the "Theory of the Business," which represents the key assumptions underlying a firm's strategy.  These assumptions are in three categories: a) the external environment, including society, market, customer, and technology; b) the mission of the organization; and c) the core competencies needed to accomplish the mission. He continued that a valid theory of the business has four specifications: 1) assumptions about the environment, mission, and core competencies must fit reality; 2) the assumptions in all three areas have to fit one another; 3) the theory of the business must be known and understood throughout the organization; and 4) the theory of the business has to be tested constantly.

He wrote that organizations get into trouble when the assumptions representing the theory of the business no longer fit reality.  He used an example of retail department stores, where their theory of the business assumed that people who could afford to shop in department stores would do so. However, many shoppers abandoned department stores in favor of specialty retailers (often located outside of malls) when time became the primary factor in the shopping destination rather than income.

Drucker described the theory of the business as a "hypothesis" and a "discipline." He advocated building in systematic diagnostics, monitoring and testing of the assumptions comprising the theory of the business to maintain competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |year=1994 |issue=September–October 1994 |title=The Theory of the Business |author=Drucker, Peter F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic thinking==
{{Main article|Strategic thinking}}

[[Strategic thinking]] involves the generation and application of unique business insights to opportunities intended to create competitive advantage for a firm or organization. It involves challenging the assumptions underlying the organization's strategy and value proposition. Mintzberg wrote in 1994 that it is more about synthesis (i.e., "connecting the dots") than analysis (i.e., "finding the dots"). It is about "capturing what the manager learns from all sources (both the soft insights from his or her personal experiences and the experiences of others throughout the organization and the hard data from market research and the like) and then synthesizing that learning into a vision of the direction that the business should pursue." Mintzberg argued that strategic thinking is the critical part of formulating strategy, more so than strategic planning exercises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1994/01/the-fall-and-rise-of-strategic-planning/ar/1 Henry Mintzberg-The Fall and Rise of Strategic Planning-Harvard Business Review-January 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Andre Beaufre]] wrote in 1963 that strategic thinking "is a mental process, at once abstract and rational, which must be capable of synthesizing both psychological and material data.  The strategist must have a great capacity for both analysis and synthesis; analysis is necessary to assemble the data on which he makes his diagnosis, synthesis in order to produce from these data the diagnosis itself--and the diagnosis in fact amounts to a choice between alternative courses of action."&lt;ref name="Beaufre1965"&gt;{{cite book

Will Mulcaster&lt;ref&gt;Mulcaster, W.R. "Three Strategic Frameworks," Business Strategy Series, Vol 10, No1, pp68 – 75, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that while much research and creative thought has been devoted to generating alternative strategies, too little work has been done on what influences the quality of strategic decision making and the effectiveness with which strategies are implemented. For instance, in retrospect it can be seen that the financial crisis of 2008–9 could have been avoided if the banks had paid more attention to the risks associated with their investments, but how should banks change the way they make decisions to improve the quality of their decisions in the future? Mulcaster's Managing Forces framework addresses this issue by identifying 11 forces that should be incorporated into the processes of decision making and strategic implementation. The 11 forces are: Time; Opposing forces; Politics; Perception; Holistic effects; Adding value; Incentives; Learning capabilities; Opportunity cost; Risk and Style.

==Strategic planning==
{{Main article|Strategic planning}}
Strategic planning is a means of administering the formulation and implementation of strategy. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens ''around'' the strategy formation process.&lt;ref name="Mintzberg and Quinn 1996"/&gt;

===Environmental analysis===
Porter wrote in 1980 that formulation of competitive strategy includes consideration of four key elements:
#Company strengths and weaknesses;
#Personal values of the key implementers (i.e., management and the board)
#Industry opportunities and threats; and
#Broader societal expectations.&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;
The first two elements relate to factors internal to the company (i.e., the internal environment), while the latter two relate to factors external to the company (i.e., the external environment).&lt;ref name="Porter1980"/&gt;

There are many analytical frameworks which attempt to organize the strategic planning process. Examples of frameworks that address the four elements described above include:
*External environment: [[PEST analysis]] or [[STEEP analysis]] is a framework used to examine the remote external environmental factors that can affect the organization, such as political, economic, social/demographic, and technological. Common variations include SLEPT, PESTLE, STEEPLE, and STEER analysis, each of which incorporates slightly different emphases.
*Industry environment: The [[Porter five forces analysis|Porter Five Forces Analysis]] framework helps to determine the competitive rivalry and therefore attractiveness of a market. It is used to help determine the portfolio of offerings the organization will provide and in which markets.
*Relationship of internal and external environment: [[SWOT analysis]] is one of the most basic and widely used frameworks, which examines both internal elements of the organization—'''S'''trengths and '''W'''eaknesses—and external elements—'''O'''pportunities and '''T'''hreats. It helps examine the organization's resources in the context of its environment.

===Scenario planning===
A number of strategists use [[scenario planning]] techniques to deal with change. The way [[Peter Schwartz (futurist)|Peter Schwartz]] put it in 1991 is that strategic outcomes cannot be known in advance so the sources of competitive advantage cannot be predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;Scwhartz, Peter ''The Art of the Long View'', Doubleday, New York, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The fast changing business environment is too uncertain for us to find sustainable value in formulas of excellence or competitive advantage. Instead, scenario planning is a technique in which multiple outcomes can be developed, their implications assessed, and their likeliness of occurrence evaluated. According to [[Pierre Wack]], scenario planning is about insight, complexity, and subtlety, not about formal analysis and numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Wack, Pierre “Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead”, ''Harvard Business review'', September October 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some business planners are starting to use a [[complexity theory approach to strategy]]. Complexity can be thought of as chaos with a dash of order.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.strategy-business.com/article/15099?gko=73fbc Between Chaos and Order: What Complexity Theory Can Teach Business]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaos theory]] deals with turbulent systems that rapidly become disordered. Complexity is not quite so unpredictable. It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear.

===Measuring and controlling implementation===
[[File:Generic Strategy Map.png|thumb|Generic Strategy Map illustrating four elements of a balanced scorecard]]
Once the strategy is determined, various goals and measures may be established to chart a course for the organization, measure performance and control implementation of the strategy. Tools such as the [[balanced scorecard]] and [[strategy maps]] help crystallize the strategy, by relating key measures of success and performance to the strategy. These tools measure [[financial]], [[marketing]], [[manufacturing|production]], [[organizational development]], and [[new product development|innovation]] measures to achieve a 'balanced' perspective.  Advances in information technology and data availability enable the gathering of more information about performance, allowing managers to take a much more analytical view of their business than before.

Strategy may also be organized as a series of "initiatives" or "programs", each of which comprises one or more projects. Various monitoring and feedback mechanisms may also be established, such as regular meetings between divisional and corporate management to control implementation.

===Evaluation===

A key component to strategic management which is often overlooked when planning is evaluation. There are many ways to evaluate whether or not strategic priorities and plans have been achieved, one such method is [[Robert E. Stake|Robert Stake]]'s Responsive Evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Bobby Thomas. [https://slr.scholasticahq.com/article/426-using-responsive-evaluation-in-strategic-management Using responsive evaluation in strategic management]. Strategic Leadership Review 4 (2), 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;  [https://submissions.scholasticahq.com/supporting_files/248937/attachment_versions/249177 Responsive evaluation] provides a naturalistic and humanistic approach to program evaluation. In expanding beyond the goal-oriented or pre-ordinate evaluation design, responsive evaluation takes into consideration the program’s background (history), conditions, and transactions among stakeholders. It is largely emergent, the design unfolds as contact is made with stakeholders.

==Limitations==
While strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment, these very elements also mean that certain signals are excluded from consideration or de-emphasized. Mintzberg wrote in 1987: "Strategy is a categorizing scheme by which incoming stimuli can be ordered and dispatched." Since a strategy orients the organization in a particular manner or direction, that direction may not effectively match the environment, initially (if a bad strategy) or over time as circumstances change. As such, Mintzberg continued, "Strategy [once established] is a force that resists change, not encourages it."&lt;ref name="Mintzberg, Henry 1987"/&gt;

Therefore, a critique of strategic management is that it can overly constrain managerial discretion in a dynamic environment. "How can individuals, organizations and societies cope as well as possible with ... issues too complex to be fully understood, given the fact that actions initiated on the basis of inadequate understanding may lead to significant regret?"&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward J. and David Collingridge, "Incrementalism, Intelligent Trial-and-Error, and the Future of Political Decision Theory," in Redner, Harry, ed., ''An Heretical Heir of the Enlightenment: Politics, Policy and Science in the Work of Charles E. Limdblom'', Boulder, C.: Westview Press, 1993, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;  Some theorists insist on an iterative approach, considering in turn objectives, implementation and resources.&lt;ref name=dwm&gt;de Wit and Meyer, Strategy Process, Content and Context, Thomson Learning 2008&lt;/ref&gt; I.e., a "...repetitive learning cycle [rather than] a linear progression towards a clearly defined final destination."&lt;ref&gt;Elcock, Howard, "Strategic Management," in Farnham, D. and S. Horton (eds.), ''Managing the New Public Services'', 2nd Edition, New York: Macmillan, 1996, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies must be able to adjust during implementation because "humans rarely can proceed satisfactorily except by learning from experience; and modest probes, serially modified on the basis of feedback, usually are the best method for such learning."&lt;ref name=wc&gt;Woodhouse and Collingridge, 1993. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Gary Hamel coined the term '''strategic convergence''' to explain the limited scope of the strategies being used by rivals in greatly differing circumstances. He lamented that successful strategies are imitated by firms that do not understand that for a strategy to work, it must account for the specifics of each situation.&lt;ref name="Hamel, Gary 2002"/&gt;
Woodhouse and Collingridge claim that the essence of being “strategic” lies in a capacity for "intelligent trial-and error"&lt;ref name=wc/&gt; rather than strict adherence to finely honed strategic plans. Strategy should be seen as laying out the general path rather than precise steps.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Mark H., ''Creating Public Value: Strategic Management in Government'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Means are as likely to determine ends as ends are to determine means.&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, Charles E., "The Science of Muddling Through," ''Public Administration Review'', Vol. 19 (1959), No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The objectives that an organization might wish to pursue are limited by the range of feasible approaches to implementation. (There will usually be only a small number of approaches that will not only be technically and administratively possible, but also satisfactory to the full range of organizational stakeholders.) In turn, the range of feasible implementation approaches is determined by the availability of resources.

==Strategic themes==
Various strategic approaches used across industries (themes) have arisen over the years.  These include the shift from product-driven demand to customer- or marketing-driven demand (described above), the increased use of self-service approaches to lower cost, changes in the value chain or corporate structure due to globalization (e.g., off-shoring of production and assembly), and the internet.

===Self-service===
One theme in strategic competition has been the trend towards self-service, often enabled by technology, where the customer takes on a role previously performed by a worker to lower the price.&lt;ref name="Porter, Michael E. 1996"/&gt; Examples include:
*[[Automated teller machine]] (ATM) to obtain cash rather via a bank teller;
*Self-service at the gas pump rather than with help from an attendant;
*Retail internet orders input by the customer rather than a retail clerk, such as online book sales;
*Mass-produced ready-to-assemble furniture transported by the customer; 
*Self-checkout at the grocery store; and
*Online banking and bill payment.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary. (2015). In ''Investopedia''. Retrieved from http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onlinebanking.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization and the virtual firm===
One definition of [[globalization]] refers to the integration of economies due to technology and [[supply chain]] process innovation. Companies are no longer required to be vertically integrated (i.e., designing, producing, assembling, and selling their products). In other words, the value chain for a company's product may no longer be entirely within one firm; several entities comprising a virtual firm may exist to fulfill the customer requirement.  For example, some companies have chosen to [[outsource]] production to third parties, retaining only design and sales functions inside their organization.&lt;ref name="Porter, Michael E. 1996"/&gt;

===Internet and information availability===
{{See also|Internet of things}}
The internet has dramatically empowered consumers and enabled buyers and sellers to come together with drastically reduced transaction and intermediary costs, creating much more robust marketplaces for the purchase and sale of goods and services. Examples include online auction sites, internet dating services, and internet book sellers. In many industries, the internet has dramatically altered the competitive landscape. Services that used to be provided within one entity (e.g., a car dealership providing financing and pricing information) are now provided by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatonprogram.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Strategy-and-the-Internet.pdf Michael Porter-Strategy and the Internet-Harvard Business Review-March 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325053521/http://www.eatonprogram.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Strategy-and-the-Internet.pdf |date=2014-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, compared to traditional media like television, the internet has caused a major shift in viewing habits through on demand content which has led to an increasingly fragmented audience.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Author Phillip Evans said in 2013 that networks are challenging traditional hierarchies. Value chains may also be breaking up ("deconstructing") where information aspects can be separated from functional activity. Data that is readily available for free or very low cost makes it harder for information-based, vertically integrated businesses to remain intact. Evans said: "The basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving, by one means or another, from a vertical structure to a horizontal one. Why is that happening? It's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing. The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together, and allows them to separate."  He used Wikipedia as an example of a network that has challenged the traditional encyclopedia business model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_evans_how_data_will_transform_business Phillip Evans-How Data will Transform Business-November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Evans predicts the emergence of a new form of industrial organization called a "stack", analogous to a [[technology stack]], in which competitors rely on a common platform of inputs (services or information), essentially layering the remaining competing parts of their value chains on top of this common platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/interviews/future_strategy_business_unit_strategy_philip_evans_rethinking_strategy_age_digital_disruption/ BCG-Phillip Evans-Rethinking Strategy for an Age of Digital Disruption-March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Sustainability]]===
In the recent decade, sustainability—or ability to successfully sustain a company in a context of rapidly changing environmental, social, health, and economic circumstances—has emerged as crucial aspect of any strategy development. Research focusing on corporations and leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has led to emergence of the concept of "embedded sustainability" – defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and [[Nadya Zhexembayeva]] as "incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium."&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, Chris and Zhexembayeva, Nadya (April 25, 2011) [http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=2927 "Embedded Sustainability: A strategy for market leaders"]. ''The European Financial Review''&lt;/ref&gt; Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value and competitive advantage creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo, C. &amp; Zhexembayeva, N.

In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], who had collaborated with [[Arie de Geus]] at Dutch Shell, popularized de Geus' notion of the "learning organization".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1997/03/the-living-company/ar/ Arie de Geus-The Learning Company-HBR-March 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that gathering and analyzing information is a necessary requirement for business success in the information age. To do this, Senge claimed that an organization would need to be structured such that:&lt;ref&gt;Senge, Peter. ''The Fifth Discipline'', Doubleday, New York, 1990; (also Century, London, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

* People can continuously expand their capacity to learn and be productive.
* New patterns of thinking are nurtured.
* Collective aspirations are encouraged.
* People are encouraged to see the "whole picture" together.

Senge identified five disciplines of a learning organization. They are:

* Personal responsibility, self-reliance, and mastery – We accept that we are the masters of our own destiny. We make decisions and live with the consequences of them. When a problem needs to be fixed, or an opportunity exploited, we take the initiative to learn the required skills to get it done.
* Mental models – We need to explore our personal mental models to understand the subtle effect they have on our behaviour.
* Shared vision – The vision of where we want to be in the future is discussed and communicated to all. It provides guidance and energy for the journey ahead.
* Team learning – We learn together in teams. This involves a shift from "a spirit of advocacy to a spirit of enquiry".
* [[Systems thinking]] – We look at the whole rather than the parts. This is what Senge calls the "Fifth discipline". It is the glue that integrates the other four into a coherent strategy. For an alternative approach to the "learning organization", see Garratt, B. (1987).

[[Geoffrey Moore]] (1991) and R. Frank and P. Cook&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R. and Cook, P. ''The Winner Take All Society'', Free Press, New York, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; also detected a shift in the nature of competition. Markets driven by technical standards or by "network effects" can give the dominant firm a near-monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch17.pdf Network Eﬀects]&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true of networked industries in which [[interoperability]] requires compatibility between users. Examples include [[Internet Explorer]]'s and [[Amazon.com|Amazon's]] early dominance of their respective industries. IE's later decline shows that such dominance may be only temporary.

Moore showed how firms could attain this enviable position by using E.M. Rogers' five stage [[diffusion (business)|adoption process]] and focusing on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for reaching the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between introduction and mass acceptance. (See [[Crossing the Chasm]]). If successful a firm can create a bandwagon effect in which the momentum builds and its product becomes a ''de facto'' standard.

==Strategy as adapting to change==
In 1969, [[Peter Drucker]] coined the phrase '''Age of Discontinuity''' to describe the way change disrupts lives.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter ''The Age of Discontinuity'', Heinemann, London, 1969 (also Harper and Row, New York, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; In an age of continuity attempts to predict the future by extrapolating from the past can be accurate. But according to Drucker, we are now in an age of discontinuity and extrapolating is ineffective. He identifies four sources of discontinuity: new [[technologies]], [[globalization]], [[cultural pluralism]] and knowledge capital.

In 1970, [[Alvin Toffler]] in ''Future Shock'' described a trend towards accelerating rates of change.&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin ''Future Shock'', Bantom Books, New York, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated how social and technical phenomena had shorter lifespans with each generation, and he questioned society's ability to cope with the resulting turmoil and accompanying anxiety. In past eras periods of change were always punctuated with times of stability. This allowed society to assimilate the change before the next change arrived. But these periods of stability had all but disappeared by the late 20th century. In 1980 in ''The Third Wave'', Toffler characterized this shift to relentless change as the defining feature of the third phase of civilization (the first two phases being the agricultural and industrial waves).&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin ''The Third Wave'', Bantom Books, New York, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Derek F. Abell]] (Abell, D. 1978) described "strategic windows" and stressed the importance of the timing (both entrance and exit) of any given strategy. This led some strategic planners to build [[planned obsolescence (business)|planned obsolescence]] into their strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Abell, Derek “Strategic windows”, ''Journal of Marketing'', Vol 42, pg 21–28, July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Noel Tichy]] wrote that because we are all beings of habit we tend to repeat what we are comfortable with.&lt;ref&gt;Tichy, Noel ''Managing Strategic Change: Technical, political, and cultural dynamics'', [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], New York, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that this is a trap that constrains our [[creativity]], prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full [[complexity]] of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and [[corporate culture]].

In 1989, [[Charles Handy]] identified two types of change.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, Charles ''The Age of Unreason'', Hutchinson, London, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; "Strategic drift" is a gradual change that occurs so subtly that it is not noticed until it is too late. By contrast, "transformational change" is sudden and radical. It is typically caused by discontinuities (or [[exogenous]] shocks) in the business environment. The point where a new trend is initiated is called a "strategic inflection point" by [[Andy Grove]]. Inflection points can be subtle or radical.

In 1990, Richard Pascale wrote that relentless change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Pascale, Richard ''Managing on the Edge'', Simon and Schuster, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” by which he means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse to let go of what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.

In 1996, [[Adrian Slywotzky]] showed how changes in the business environment are reflected in [[value migration]]s between industries, between companies, and within companies.&lt;ref&gt;Slywotzky, Adrian ''Value Migration'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that recognizing the patterns behind these value migrations is necessary if we wish to understand the world of chaotic change. In “Profit Patterns” (1999) he described businesses as being in a state of '''strategic anticipation''' as they try to spot emerging patterns. Slywotsky and his team identified 30 patterns that have transformed industry after industry.&lt;ref&gt;Slywotzky, A., Morrison, D., Moser, T., Mundt, K., and Quella, J. ''Profit Patterns'', Time Business (Random House), New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0-8129-3118-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Clayton Christensen]] (1997) took the position that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right since the capabilities of the organization also define its disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton "The Innovator's Dilemma," Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen's thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with '''[[disruptive technology]]'''. He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies '''agnostic marketing''', i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one – not the company, not the customers – can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used without the experience of using it.

In 1999, Constantinos Markides reexamined the nature of strategic planning.&lt;ref&gt;Markides, Constantinos “A dynamic view of strategy” ''Sloan Management Review'', vol 40, spring 1999, pp55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; He described strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and reformation. Strategic management is planned and emergent, dynamic and interactive.

J. Moncrieff (1999) stressed [[strategy dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Moncrieff, J. “Is strategy making a difference?” ''Long Range Planning Review'', vol 32, no2, pp273–276.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned. The unplanned element comes from emergent strategies that result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and from "strategies in action" (ad hoc actions across the organization).

[[David Teece]] pioneered research on resource-based strategic management and the [[dynamic capabilities]] perspective, defined as “the ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments".&lt;ref name="dynamic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Teece|first1= David J.|last2= Pisano|first2= Gary|last3= Shuen|first3= Amy|title= Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|journal= [[Strategic Management Journal]]|volume= 18|issue= 7|pages= 509–533|publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date= August 1997|url= http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charlesw/s591/Bocconi-Duke/Papers/C10/TeecePisanoShuenSMJ.pdf|doi= 10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111124231856/http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charlesw/s591/Bocconi-Duke/Papers/C10/TeecePisanoShuenSMJ.pdf|archivedate= 2011-11-24|df= }}|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::AID-SMJ882&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z
&lt;/ref&gt; His 1997 paper (with Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen) "Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management" was the most cited paper in economics and business for the period from 1995 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archive.sciencewatch.com/nov-dec2005/sw_nov-dec2005_page1.htm|title= Taking Care of Business, 1995–2005|work= ScienceWatch|publisher= [[Thomson Scientific]]|date= November–December 2005|accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Gary Hamel]] discussed '''strategic decay''', the notion that the value of every strategy, no matter how brilliant, decays over time.&lt;ref name="Hamel, Gary 2002"&gt;Hamel, Gary ''Leading the Revolution'', Plume (Penguin Books), New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy as operational excellence==

===Quality===
A large group of theorists felt the area where western business was most lacking was product quality. [[W. Edwards Deming]],&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W.E. ''Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position'', MIT Center for Advanced Engineering, Cambridge Mass., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph M. Juran]],&lt;ref&gt;Juran, J.M. ''Juran on Quality'', Free Press, New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. Kearney]],&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, A.T. ''Total Quality Management: A business process perspective'', Kearney Pree Inc, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip B. Crosby|Philip Crosby]]&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, P. ''Quality is Free'', McGraw Hill, New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Armand Feignbaum]]&lt;ref&gt;Feignbaum, A. ''Total Quality Control'', 3rd edition, McGraw Hill, Maidenhead, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested quality improvement techniques such [[total quality management]] (TQM), [[kaizen|continuous improvement]] (kaizen), [[lean manufacturing]], [[Six Sigma]], and [[return on quality]] (ROQ).

Contrarily, James Heskett (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Heskett, J. ''Managing in the Service Economy'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not sure if this is the right reference --&gt; Earl Sasser (1995), William Davidow,&lt;ref&gt;Davidow, W. and Uttal, B. ''Total Customer Service'', [[Harper Perennial]] Books, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Len Schlesinger,&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, L. and Heskett, J. "Customer Satisfaction is rooted in Employee Satisfaction," ''Harvard Business Review'', November–December 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; A. Paraurgman (1988), Len Berry,&lt;ref&gt;Berry, L. ''On Great Service'', Free Press, New York, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Kingman-Brundage,&lt;ref&gt;Kingman-Brundage, J. “Service Mapping” pp 148–163 In Scheuing, E. and Christopher, W. (eds.), ''The Service Quality Handbook'', Amacon, New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Hart, and Christopher Lovelock (1994), felt that poor customer service was the problem. They gave us [[fishbone diagram]]ming, [[service chart]]ing, [[Total Customer Service]] (TCS), the service profit chain, service gaps analysis, the service encounter, strategic service vision, service mapping, and service teams. Their underlying assumption was that there is no better source of competitive advantage than a continuous stream of delighted customers.

[[Process management]] uses some of the techniques from product quality management and some of the techniques from customer service management. It looks at an activity as a sequential process. The objective is to find inefficiencies and make the process more effective. Although the procedures have a long history, dating back to [[Taylorism]], the scope of their applicability has been greatly widened, leaving no aspect of the firm free from potential process improvements. Because of the broad applicability of process management techniques, they can be used as a basis for competitive advantage.

Carl Sewell,&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, C. and Brown, P. ''Customers for Life'', Doubleday Currency, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick F. Reichheld]],&lt;ref&gt;Reichheld, F. ''The Loyalty Effect'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; C. Gronroos,&lt;ref&gt;Gronroos, C. “From marketing mix to relationship marketing: towards a paradigm shift in marketing”, ''Management Decision'', Vol. 32, No. 2, pp 4–32, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and Earl Sasser&lt;ref&gt;Reichheld, F. and Sasser, E. “Zero defects: Quality comes to services”, ''Harvard Business Review'', September/October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that businesses were spending more on customer acquisition than on retention. They showed how a competitive advantage could be found in ensuring that customers returned again and again. Reicheld broadened the concept to include loyalty from employees, suppliers, distributors and shareholders. They developed techniques for estimating [[customer lifetime value]] (CLV) for assessing long-term relationships. The concepts begat attempts to recast selling and marketing into a long term endeavor that created a sustained relationship (called relationship selling, [[relationship marketing]], and [[customer relationship management]]). Customer relationship management (CRM) software became integral to many firms.

===Reengineering===
[[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] and [[James Champy]] felt that these resources needed to be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, M. and Champy, J. ''Reengineering the Corporation'', Harper Business, New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In a process that they labeled [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]], firms reorganized their assets around whole processes rather than tasks. In this way a team of people saw a project through, from inception to completion. This avoided functional silos where isolated departments seldom talked to each other. It also eliminated waste due to functional overlap and interdepartmental communications.

In 1989 [[Richard Lester]] and the researchers at the MIT Industrial Performance Center identified seven '''best practices''' and concluded that firms must accelerate the shift away from the mass production of low cost standardized products. The seven areas of best practice were:&lt;ref&gt;Lester, R. ''Made in America'', MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity, Boston, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Simultaneous continuous improvement in cost, quality, service, and product innovation
* Breaking down organizational barriers between departments
* Eliminating layers of management creating flatter organizational hierarchies.
* Closer relationships with customers and suppliers
* Intelligent use of new technology
* Global focus
* Improving human resource skills

The search for best practices is also called [[benchmarking]].&lt;ref&gt;Camp, R. ''Benchmarking: The search for industry best practices that lead to superior performance'', American Society for Quality Control, Quality Press, Milwaukee, Wis., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; This involves determining where you need to improve, finding an organization that is exceptional in this area, then studying the company and applying its best practices in your firm.

==Other perspectives on strategy==

===Strategy as problem solving===
Professor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure called a ''kernel''.  The kernel has three parts: 1) A ''diagnosis'' that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A ''guiding policy'' for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent ''actions'' designed to carry out the guiding policy.&lt;ref name="Rumelt2011"&gt;{{cite book

President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] outlined these three elements of strategy in his [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962: 
#Diagnosis: "This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere."
#Guiding Policy: "Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere."
#Action Plans: First among seven numbered steps was the following: "To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkcubanmissilecrisis.html American Rhetoric-President John F. Kennedy-Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation-22 October 1962]&lt;/ref&gt;

Active strategic management required active information gathering and active problem solving. In the early days of Hewlett-Packard (HP), [[Dave Packard]] and [[Bill Hewlett]] devised an active management style that they called ''[[management by walking around]]'' (MBWA). Senior HP managers were seldom at their desks. They spent most of their days visiting employees, customers, and suppliers. This direct contact with key people provided them with a solid grounding from which viable strategies could be crafted. [[Management consultant]]s [[Tom Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman]] had used the term in their 1982 book ''[[In Search of Excellence: Lessons From America's Best-Run Companies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Excellence: Lessons From America's Best-Run Companies |authorlink1=Tom Peters |last1=Peters |first1=Tom |authorlink2=Robert H. Waterman |last2=Waterman |first2=Robert H. |year=1982 |page=289}} {{Google books|knzNIfmU2F0C|Management By Wandering Around|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Japanese managers employ a similar system, which originated at [[Honda]], and is sometimes called the 3 G's ([[Gemba|Genba]], Genbutsu, and Genjitsu, which translate into "actual place", "actual thing", and "actual situation").

===Creative vs analytic approaches===
In 2010, IBM released a study summarizing three conclusions of 1500 CEOs around the world: 1) complexity is escalating, 2) enterprises are not equipped to cope with this complexity, and 3) creativity is now the single most important leadership competency. IBM said that it is needed in all aspects of leadership, including strategic thinking and planning.&lt;ref&gt;IBM, Capitalizing on Complexity: Insights from the Global Chief Executive Office Study, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Max McKeown|McKeown]] argued that over-reliance on any particular approach to strategy is dangerous and that multiple methods can be used to combine the creativity and analytics to create an "approach to shaping the future", that is difficult to copy.&lt;ref&gt;Mckeown, Max, The Strategy Book, FT Prentice Hall, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-strategic management===
A 1938 treatise by [[Chester Barnard]], based on his own experience as a business executive, described the process as informal, intuitive, non-routinized and involving primarily oral, 2-way communications. Bernard says "The process is the sensing of the organization as a whole and the total situation relevant to it. It transcends the capacity of merely intellectual methods, and the techniques of discriminating the factors of the situation. The terms pertinent to it are "feeling", "judgement", "sense", "proportion", "balance", "appropriateness". It is a matter of art rather than science."&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Chester ''The function of the executive'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge Mass, 1938, page 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Mintzberg found that senior managers typically deal with unpredictable situations so they strategize in ''ad hoc'', flexible, dynamic, and implicit ways. He wrote, "The job breeds adaptive information-manipulators who prefer the live concrete situation. The manager works in an environment of stimulus-response, and he develops in his work a clear preference for live action."&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry ''The Nature of Managerial Work'', Harper and Roe, New York, 1973, page 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[John Kotter]] studied the daily activities of 15 executives and concluded that they spent most of their time developing and working a network of relationships that provided general insights and specific details for strategic decisions. They tended to use "mental road maps" rather than systematic planning techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, John ''The general manager'', Free Press, New York, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Isenberg]]'s 1984 study of senior managers found that their decisions were highly intuitive. Executives often sensed what they were going to do before they could explain why.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Daniel "How managers think", ''Harvard Business Review'', November–December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed in 1986 that one of the reasons for this is the complexity of strategic decisions and the resultant information uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Daniel ''Strategic Opportunism: Managing under uncertainty'', Harvard Graduate School of Business, Working paper 9-786-020, Boston, January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuboff claimed that information technology was widening the divide between senior managers (who typically make strategic decisions) and operational level managers (who typically make routine decisions). She alleged that prior to the widespread use of computer systems, managers, even at the most senior level, engaged in both strategic decisions and routine administration, but as computers facilitated (She called it "deskilled") routine processes, these activities were moved further down the hierarchy, leaving senior management free for strategic decision making.

In 1977, [[Abraham Zaleznik]] distinguished leaders from managers. He described leaders as visionaries who inspire, while managers care about process.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleznik, Abraham "Managers and Leaders: Are they different?", ''Harvard Business Review'', May–June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the rise of managers was the main cause of the decline of American business in the 1970s and 1980s. Lack of leadership is most damaging at the level of strategic management where it can paralyze an entire organization.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleznik, Abraham ''The Managerial Mistique'', Harper and Row, New York, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats,&lt;ref&gt;Corner, P. Kinicki, A. and Keats, B. "Integrating organizational and individual information processing perspectives on choice", ''Organizational Science'', vol. 3, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; strategic decision making in organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed a model of parallel strategic decision making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding information, storage and retrieval of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives are based on the knowledge of competing firms, such as their market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf | title = Competitor-oriented Objectives: The Myth of Market Share | author1 = J.

===Strategy as marketing===
The 1980s also saw the widespread acceptance of [[positioning (marketing)|positioning theory]]. Although the theory originated with [[Jack Trout]] in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until [[Al Ries]] and [[Jack Trout]] wrote their classic book ''Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind'' (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating a position in the mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques enabled the practical use of positioning theory. [[Perceptual mapping]] for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. [[Multidimensional scaling (in marketing)|Multidimensional scaling]], [[discriminant analysis (in marketing)|discriminant analysis]], [[factor analysis]] and [[conjoint analysis (in marketing)|conjoint analysis]] are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. [[Preference regression (in marketing)|Preference regression]] can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and [[cluster analysis (in marketing)|cluster analysis]] can identify clusters of positions.

In 1992 Jay Barney saw strategy as assembling the optimum mix of resources, including human, technology and suppliers, and then configuring them in unique and sustainable ways.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. (1991) "Firm Resources and Sustainable Competitive Advantage", ''Journal of Management'', vol 17, no 1, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Not sure if this is the right reference.--&gt;

James Gilmore and Joseph Pine found competitive advantage in [[mass customization]].&lt;ref&gt;Pine, J. and Gilmore, J. "The Four Faces of Mass Customization", ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol 75, No 1, Jan–Feb 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flexible manufacturing]] techniques allowed businesses to individualize products for each customer without losing [[economies of scale]]. This effectively turned the product into a service. They also realized that if a service is mass-customized by creating a "performance" for each individual client, that service would be transformed into an "experience". Their book, ''The Experience Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;Pine, J. and Gilmore, J. (1999) ''The Experience Economy'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the work of [[Bernd Schmitt]] convinced many to see service provision as a form of theatre. This school of thought is sometimes referred to as [[customer experience management]] (CEM).

===Information- and technology-driven strategy===
Many industries with a high information component are being transformed.&lt;ref&gt;Evens, P. and Wurster, T. "Strategy and the New Economics of Information", ''Harvard Business Review'', Sept/Oct 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Encarta demolished [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (whose sales have plummeted 80% since their peak of $650 million in 1990) before it was in turn, eclipsed by collaborative encyclopedias like [[Wikipedia]]. The music industry was similarly disrupted. The technology sector has provided some strategies directly. For example, from the software development industry [[agile software development]] provides a model for shared development processes.

[[Peter Drucker]] conceived of the "knowledge worker" in the 1950s. He described how fewer workers would do physical labor, and more would apply their minds. In 1984, [[John Naisbitt]] theorized that the future would be driven largely by information: companies that managed information well could obtain an advantage, however the profitability of what he called "information float" (information that the company had and others desired) would disappear as inexpensive computers made information more accessible.

[[Daniel Bell]] (1985) examined the sociological consequences of information technology, while Gloria Schuck and [[Shoshana Zuboff]] looked at psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, Gloria "Intelligent Workers: A new pedagogy for the high tech workplace", ''Organizational Dynamics'', Autumn 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Zuboff distinguished between "automating technologies" and "informating technologies".&lt;!-- how?--&gt; She studied the effect that both had on workers, managers and organizational structures. She largely confirmed Drucker's predictions about the importance of flexible decentralized structure, work teams, knowledge sharing and the knowledge worker's central role. Zuboff also detected a new basis for managerial authority, based on knowledge (also predicted by Drucker) which she called "participative management".&lt;ref&gt;Zuboff, Shoshana ''In the Age of the Smart Machine'', Basic Books, New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maturity of planning process===
[[McKinsey &amp; Company]] developed a [[capability maturity model]] in the 1970s to describe the sophistication of planning processes, with strategic management ranked the highest. The four stages include:
#Financial planning, which is primarily about annual budgets and a functional focus, with limited regard for the environment;
#Forecast-based planning, which includes multi-year budgets and more robust capital allocation across business units;
#Externally oriented planning, where a thorough situation analysis and competitive assessment is performed; 
#Strategic management, where widespread [[strategic thinking]] occurs and a well-defined strategic framework is used.&lt;ref name="LOS2010"/&gt;

===PIMS study===
The long-term [[PIMS study]], started in the 1960s and lasting for 19 years, attempted to understand the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies ([[Profit impact of marketing strategy|PIMS]]), particularly the effect of market share. The initial conclusion of the study was unambiguous: the greater a company's market share, the greater their [[rate of profit]]. Market share provides [[economies of scale]]. It also provides [[experience curve]] advantages. The combined effect is increased profits.&lt;ref&gt;Buzzell, R. and Gale, B. ''The PIMS Principles: Linking Strategy to Performance'', Free Press, New York, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of high market share naturally led to an interest in growth strategies. The relative advantages of [[horizontal integration]], [[vertical integration]], diversification, [[Franchising|franchise]]s, [[mergers and acquisitions]], joint ventures and organic growth were discussed. Other research indicated that a low market share strategy could still be very profitable. Schumacher (1973),&lt;ref&gt;[[Schumacher, E.F.]] ''[[Small is Beautiful: a Study of Economics as if People Mattered]]'', {{ISBN|0-06-131778-0}} (also {{ISBN|0-88179-169-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Woo and Cooper (1982),&lt;ref&gt;Woo, C. and Cooper, A. “The surprising case for low market share”, ''Harvard Business Review'', November–December 1982, pg 106–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Levenson (1984),&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, J.C. ''Guerrilla Marketing, Secrets for making big profits from your small business'', Houghton Muffin Co. New York, 1984, {{ISBN|0-618-78591-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later Traverso (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Traverso, D. ''Outsmarting Goliath'', Bloomberg Press, Princeton, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.

==Other influences on business strategy==

===Military strategy===
{{See also|Military strategy}}
In the 1980s business strategists realized that there was a vast [[knowledge base]] stretching back thousands of years that they had barely examined. They turned to [[military strategy]] for guidance. Military strategy books such as ''[[The Art of War]]'' by [[Sun Tzu]], ''[[On War]]'' by [[Carl von Clausewitz|von Clausewitz]], and ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao|The Red Book]]'' by [[Mao Zedong]] became business classics. From Sun Tzu, they learned the tactical side of military strategy and specific tactical prescriptions. From von Clausewitz, they learned the dynamic and unpredictable nature of military action. From Mao, they learned the principles of [[guerrilla warfare]]. Important [[marketing warfare strategies|marketing warfare]] books include ''Business War Games'' by Barrie James, ''Marketing Warfare'' by [[Al Ries]] and [[Jack Trout]] and ''Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun'' by Wess Roberts.

The four types of business warfare theories are:
* [[Offensive marketing warfare strategies]]
* [[Defensive marketing warfare strategies]]
* [[Flanking marketing warfare strategies]]
* [[Guerrilla marketing warfare strategies]]

The marketing warfare literature also examined leadership and motivation, intelligence gathering, types of marketing weapons, logistics and communications.

By the twenty-first century marketing warfare strategies had gone out of favour in favor of non-confrontational approaches. In 1989, Dudley Lynch and Paul L. Kordis published ''Strategy of the Dolphin: Scoring a Win in a Chaotic World''. "The Strategy of the Dolphin" was developed to give guidance as to when to use aggressive strategies and when to use passive strategies. A variety of [[Aggressiveness strategies (business)|aggressiveness strategies]] were developed.

In 1993, J. Moore used a similar metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J. "Predators and Prey", ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol. 71, May–June, pp 75–86, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using military terms, he created an [[ecological theory]] of predators and prey(see [[ecological model of competition]]), a sort of [[Darwinian]] management strategy in which market interactions mimic long term [[ecological stability]].

Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that "[[Bruce Henderson|Henderson's]] central idea was what you might call the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_evans_how_data_will_transform_business/transcript TED-Phillip Evans-How Data will Transform Business-March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traits of successful companies==
Like Peters and Waterman a decade earlier, [[James Collins (management theorist)|James Collins]] and [[Jerry Porras]] spent years conducting empirical research on what makes great companies. Six years of research uncovered a key underlying principle behind the 19 successful companies that they studied: They all encourage and preserve a '''core ideology''' that nurtures the company. Even though strategy and tactics change daily, the companies, nevertheless, were able to maintain a core set of values. These core values encourage employees to build an organization that lasts. In ''Built To Last'' (1994) they claim that short term profit goals, cost cutting, and restructuring will not stimulate dedicated employees to build a great company that will endure.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, James and Porras, Jerry ''Built to Last'', Harper Books, New York, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Collins coined the term "built to flip" to describe the prevailing business attitudes in Silicon Valley. It describes a business culture where technological change inhibits a long term focus. He also popularized the concept of the BHAG ([[Big Hairy Audacious Goal]]).

[[Arie de Geus]] (1997) undertook a similar study and obtained similar results.&lt;ref name="Geus1997"/&gt; He identified four key traits of companies that had prospered for 50 years or more. They are:
* Sensitivity to the business environment – the ability to learn and adjust
* Cohesion and identity – the ability to build a community with personality, vision, and purpose
* Tolerance and decentralization – the ability to build relationships
* Conservative financing

A company with these key characteristics he called a ''living company'' because it is able to perpetuate itself. If a company emphasizes knowledge rather than finance, and sees itself as an ongoing community of human beings, it has the potential to become great and endure for decades. Such an organization is an organic entity capable of learning (he called it a "learning organization") and capable of creating its own processes, goals, and persona.&lt;ref name="Geus1997"&gt;{{cite book

| first = Arie
| year = 1997
| title = [[The Living Company]] | publisher = Harvard Business School Press
| isbn = 978-0-87584-782-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will Mulcaster&lt;ref&gt;Mulcaster, W.R. "Three Strategic Frameworks," Business Strategy Series, Vol 10, No 1, pp 68–75, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that firms engage in a dialogue that centres around these questions:

*Will the proposed competitive advantage create Perceived Differential Value?"
*Will the proposed competitive advantage create something that is different from the competition?"
*Will the difference add value in the eyes of potential customers?" – This question will entail a discussion of the combined effects of price, product features and consumer perceptions.
*Will the product add value for the firm?" – Answering this question will require an examination of cost effectiveness and the pricing strategy.

'''''The Organization Man''''' is a [[bestselling]] book by [[William H. Whyte]], originally published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="whyte1956"&gt;Whyte, William H. (1956). ''The Organization Man.'' Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-671-54330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered one of the most influential books on [[management]] ever written.&lt;ref name="perseus"&gt;Editors Of Perseus Publishing (2003). ''The best business books ever: the 100 most influential management books you'll never have time to read.'' Perseus Books Group, {{ISBN|978-0-7382-0849-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and influence==
While employed by ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'', Whyte did extensive interviews with the [[chief executive officer|CEO]]s of major American corporations such as [[General Electric]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]].&lt;ref name="mills1956"&gt;Mills, C. Wright (December 9, 1956). [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0614FC3B5A137A93CBA91789D95F428585F9 Crawling To the Top.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; A central tenet of the book is that average Americans subscribed to a [[collectivist]] ethic rather than to the prevailing notion of [[rugged individualism]].&lt;ref name="nationalreviewwhycorporateleadersbecame"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williamson|first1=Kevin D.|authorlink=Kevin D. Williamson|title=Why Corporate Leaders Became Progressive Activists|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445705/corporate-leaders-progressive-activists?|accessdate=March 13, 2017|work=National Review|date=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key point made was that people became convinced that organizations and groups could make better decisions than individuals, and thus serving an organization became logically preferable to advancing one's individual creativity.  Whyte felt this was counterfactual and listed a number of examples of how individual work and creativity can produce better outcomes than collectivist processes. He observed that this system led to [[risk-averse]] executives who faced no consequences and could expect jobs for life as long as they made no egregious missteps. He also thought that everyone should have more freedom.

Whyte's book led to deeper examinations of the concept of "commitment" and "loyalty" within corporations.&lt;ref name="randall"&gt;Randall, Donna M. (1987). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/258513 Commitment and the Organization: The Organization Man Revisited.] ''The Academy of Management Review''&lt;/ref&gt;   Whyte's book matched the fiction best seller of the period, ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (novel)|The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit]]'' (1955) by [[Sloan Wilson]] in inspiring criticism that those Americans motivated to win World War II returned to an ostensibly less-meaningful lives.  [[Marxist]] theorist [[Guy Debord]] discusses Whyte's observations in ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967).&lt;ref name="debord1973"&gt;Debord, Guy (1973). ''La Société du spectacle.'' Black &amp; Red&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Umarali Quvvatov''' ({{lang-tg|Умаралӣ Қувватов}};&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; 21 November 1968 — 5 March 2015) was a [[Tajikistan]]i businessman and politician. He was the leader of the opposition [[Group 24]]. He was shot and killed on 5 March 2015 in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].

== Private life ==
Umarali Izatovich Quvvatov was born on 21 November 1968 in the city of [[Dushanbe]]. He was married and had children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrca.eu/index.php/tadjikistan/153-protection-of-refugees/547-turkey-the-leader-of-goup-24-umarali-kuvatov-is-detained |title= Turkey: the leader of "Goup 24" Umarali Kuvatov is detained |publisher=[[Ahrca.eu]] (The Association for Human Rights in Central Asia) |date=20 December 2014 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBE3VyzBDzk |title= ЭКСКЛЮЗИВНАЯ БИОГРАФИЯ УМАРАЛИ КУВВАТОВА (Umarali Kuvatov’s Exclussive Biography, an interview in Russian) |publisher=YouTube |date=7 March 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political positions ==
Kuvvatov was a critic of Tajikistani president [[Emomalii Rahmon]], accusing him of nepotism and corruption.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite web|author=Daren Butler |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/06/us-turkey-tajikistan-idUSKBN0M20M920150306 |title=Vocal critic of Tajik president shot dead in Istanbul |publisher= |date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leader of the opposition [[Group 24]], which he founded after going into exile in 2012.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsasia&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/tajik-opposition-leader-s/1699336.html |title=Vocal critic of Tajik president shot dead in Istanbul |publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] |date= 6 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014 he publicly called on Tajikistanis to gather for a political protest on 10 October. However, no one showed up to the protests after Tajikistani authorities had blocked websites and deployed armored vehicles. The [[Supreme Court of Tajikistan]] ruled that Kuvvatov's Group 24 was an extremist movement and banned publications by it.&lt;ref name=eurasia&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/70436 |title=Tajikistan: What’s Behind Government’s Heavy-Handed Protest Response? |publisher=eurasianet.org |date=14 October 2014 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajik authorities had blocked hundreds of websites after Group 24 used social media to call for an antigovernment protest in Dushanbe on 10 October 2014.&lt;ref name=Gadoev&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan-opposition-quvatov-killing/26885021.html |title= Tajik Opposition Tycoon Quvatov Killed In Istanbul |first= |last= |author= RFE/RL's Tajik Service |authorlink= |date= 6 March 2015|work= |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |location= |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, a court in Dushanbe has sentenced Umedjon Solehov to 17 1/2 years in jail for his being a member of this opposition movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoi.net/local_link/298048/434559_de.html Tajik Activist Sentenced To More Than 17 Years In Jail] by [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL's Tajik Service]] 04 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Eurasianet reported that Kuvvatov was not widely known or liked before the failed protests, but that he became much more known afterwards.&lt;ref name=eurasia/&gt;

==Exile==
In 2012 Kuvvatov went into exile to first [[Russia]] and later the [[United Arab Emirates]] after Tajikistan asked for his extradition.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; He was arrested in [[Dubai]] in September 2012 at the behest of Tajikistan. He was released in September 2013 after obtaining a pardon.&lt;ref name=freedomhouse&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/tajikistan-opposition-leader-kuvvatov-facing-new-dangers#.VPlxVfmG_Ns|title=Tajikistan Opposition Leader Kuvvatov Facing New Dangers|publisher=[[Freedom House]]|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuvvatov went to Turkey, where he was arrested on 20 December 2014 on an alleged visa violation. His extradition was once more sought by Tajikistan, for extremism, economic crimes and hostage-taking.&lt;ref name=newsasia/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedomhouse/&gt; Turkey however refused extradition.&lt;ref name=newsasia/&gt;

== Death ==
According to Turkish media reports, conspirators planned his murder for three months. At first they wanted to poison Kuvvatov at the joint dinner on the night of 5 to 6 March 2015 in Istanbul. Then the killers used weapons and Kuvvatov was shot dead with a single bullet to his head when he got outside trying to reach the nearest hospital.&lt;ref name=newsasia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belsat.eu/en/articles/opposition-activist-dead-three-suspects-detained/ |title= Tajik opposition activist dead.

[[Rahmatullo Zoyirov]], chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Tajikistan]], told [[RFE/RL]]'s Tajik Service that Quvvatov's killing had been pre-planned.&lt;ref name=Nemtsov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan-quvatov-killing-turkey-opposition-nemtsov/26886088.html |title= Slaying Of Tajik Opposition Leader Draws Nemtsov Comparisons |first= |last= |author= RFE/RL's Tajik Service |authorlink= |date=6 March 2015 |work= |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |location= |accessdate=24 March 2015|quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quvvatov's wife, Kumriniso Hafizova, told RFE/RL on 8 March that she, her husband and their two sons had been invited for dinner at the house of Sulaimon Qayumov, a 30-year-old Tajik citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/slain-tajik-opposition-tycoon-to-be-buried-in-istanbul/26889471.html |title= Three Arrested As Tajik Opposition Tycoon Buried In Istanbul |first= |last= |author= RFE/RL's Tajik Service |authorlink= |date= 9 March 2015 |work= |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |location= |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qayumov has been living in Turkey for three months and positioned himself as a Quvvatov sympathizer.&lt;ref name=Gadoev /&gt; After dinner, Quvvatov and his family members felt sick and rushed out for fresh air. When they were outside, an unidentified Tajik-speaking man approached Quvvatov from behind, fired a single shot to his head and immediately fled the scene. The 47-year-old entrepreneur was already dead when medics arrived at the scene and police searched the area for evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belsat.eu/en/articles/tajik-opposition-activist-umarali-kuvvatov-shot-dead-istanbul/ |title= Tajik opposition activist Umarali Kuvvatov shot dead in Istanbul |publisher=[[Belsat TV]]|date=  6 March 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish media also reported that Mr Kuvatov's wife and children had symptoms of poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Tajik opposition leader Kuvatov shot dead in Turkey |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31760810|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have drawn parallels between the murder of Umarali Quvvatov and the late February assassination of Russian opposition leader [[Boris Nemtsov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catoday.org/centrasia/18746-smert-treh-oppozicionerov-menshe-chem-za-mesyac-v-zone-byvshego-soyuza-byt-kritikom-vlasti-opasno-dlya-zhizni.html |title=Смерть троих оппозиционеров меньше чем за месяц: В зоне бывшего Союза быть критиком власти опасно для жизни! |first= |last= |author= Киргизбек Канунов (гражданский активист) |authorlink= |date= 7 March 2015 |work=Центральная Азия |publisher= "Озодагон" (независимое информационное региональное агентство) |location= |language= Russian |trans-title= |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to journalists on 6 March, [[Muhiddin Kabiri]], the leader of the opposition [[Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan]], compared the killing to the recent deaths of Nemtsov and [[Rakhat Aliyev]], the former son-in-law of Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/72416 |title= Tajikistan: Opposition Leader Gunned Down in Istanbul |author=  Chris Rickleton |publisher=[[The Open Society Institute|EurasiaNet.org]]|date= 6 March 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajabi Mirzo, an independent political analyst, described Quvvatov's death as a "shameful and terrible event" that could be compared with Nemtsov's killing. "Nemtsov was killed the day before the announced rally, and Quvatov after the announcement of the [parliamentary] election results," he wrote.&lt;ref name=Nemtsov /&gt;

'''United Kingdom commercial law''' is the [[law]] which regulates the sale and purchase of goods and services, when doing business in the [[United Kingdom]].

==History==
[[File:The Guildhall in the City of London - geograph.org.uk - 681581.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Guildhall, London]] was the administrative centre of London's medieval trade. Its most famous inhabitant, mythologised in the 19th century play, was [[Dick Whittington and His Cat]] who came when he heard that "[[London streets are paved with gold]]".]]

In the case of ''[[Watteau v Fenwick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1893] 1 QB 346&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Coleridge CJ on the Queen's Bench concurred with an opinion by Wills J that a third party could hold personally liable a principal who he did know about when he sold cigars to an agent that was acting outside of its authority. Wills J held that "the principal is liable for all the acts of the agent which are within the authority usually confided to an agent of that character, notwithstanding limitations, as between the principal and the agent, put upon that authority." This decision is heavily criticised and doubted,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. GHL Fridman, 'The Demise of Watteau v Fenwick: Sign-O-Lite Ltd v Metropolitan Life Insurance Co' (1991) 70 Canadian Bar Review 329&lt;/ref&gt; though not entirely overruled in the UK. It is sometimes referred to as "usual authority" (though not in the sense used by Lord Denning MR in ''Hely-Hutchinson'', where it is synonymous with "implied actual authority"). It has been explained as a form of apparent authority, or "inherent agency power".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">The majority of '''writers on business''' in [[China]] are Chinese authors, writing in [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]] for Chinese audiences. Others include western "old China hands" and journalists.

==Chinese authors==
Notable Chinese business authors include academics such as [[Li Yining]], ''Disequilibrium in the Chinese Economy'' (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Biographical dictionary of new Chinese entrepreneurs and business   Page 128 Wenxian Zhang, Ilan Alon - 2009 Li, Yining  b. 1930) As a prominent scholar of economics, Li Yining has made remarkable contributions to the theoretic ... Li Yining has frequently been asked to participate in lectures and seminars across China and abroad."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as media pundits such as businessman Ni Runfeng.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical dictionary of new Chinese entrepreneurs and business   Page 128 Wenxian Zhang, Ilan Alon - 2009 "Ni is a TV business guru in China. Under his leadership, the 36,000-employee company became the number one TV supplier and the leading brand name in ... Despite the setback, Ni is still nicknamed 'General Patton' in Chinese business."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western authors==
Since the [[Chinese economic reform|economic opening of China]], several of the first generation of Western businessmen in China have also written accounts of their experiences:
* [[Tim Clissold]] ''Mr. China: A Memoir'' 2006 2nd.Ed. 2010, on running Jack Perkowski's Asimco.
* [[Jack Perkowski]] ''Managing the Dragon: How I’m Building a Billion Dollar Business in China'' 2008

Others have been written by journalists:
* Jim Mann ''Beijing Jeep'' 1997, former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Beijing Bureau chief describes the early [[Beijing Jeep]] [[Joint venture|JV]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann A Case Study of Western Business in China. Boulder, CO: Westview Press. xix Mann, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[James L. McGregor]] ''One Billion Customers'' 2005 by former ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' China bureau chief.&lt;ref&gt;Business week: Issues 3958-3965 2005 "Like the best China business books, including Jim Mann's Beijing Jeep and Tim Clissold's Mr. China: A Memoir, McGregor's volume is both colorful and cautionary, offering sound prescriptions for Westerners. One Billion Customers begins ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Related is the category of business fiction such as the novel of [[John D. Kuhns]] ''China Fortunes: A Tale of Business in the New World'' 2010&lt;ref&gt;China Fortunes: A Tale of Business in the New World&amp;nbsp;– Page xi  J. D. Kuhns&amp;nbsp;– 2011 "While based on my own experiences, China Fortunes is fiction; the majority of the novel's characters are fictitious, and any resemblance in name, description, or action they may ...
