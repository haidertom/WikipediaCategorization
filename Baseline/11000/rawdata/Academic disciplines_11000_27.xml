      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Anthropology of food''' is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] that connects an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and historical perspective with contemporary social issues in food production and consumption systems. 

Although early anthropological accounts often dealt with cooking and eating as part of ritual or daily life, food was rarely regarded as the central point of academic focus. This changed in the later half of the 20th century, when foundational work by [[Mary Douglas]], [[Marvin Harris]], [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[Jack Goody]], and [[Sidney Mintz]] cemented the study of food as a key insight into modern social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Food and Anthropology|last=Klein and Watson|first=|publisher=]Bloomsbury Academic|year=2016|isbn=9780857855947|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mintz is known as the "Father of food anthropology"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/us/sidney-mintz-father-of-food-anthropology-dies-at-93.html|title=Sidney Mintz, Father of Food Anthropology, dies at 93|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work ''Sweetness and Power (1985),''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History|last=Mintz|first=Sidney|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=0140092331|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which linked British demand for sugar with the creation of empire and exploitative industrial labor conditions. 

Research has traced the material and symbolic importance of food, as well as how they intersect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Food History|last=Pilcher|first=Jeremy|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=9780199729937|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of ongoing themes are food as a form of differentiation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=0-674-21277-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, commensality, and food's role in industrialization and globalizing labor and commodity chains.  

Several related and interdisciplinary academic programs exist in the US and UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.food-culture.org/food-studies-programs/|title=Food Studies Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=food-culture.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (listed under [[Food studies]] institutions).

'''Arthur Argo''' (1935–1981) was a Scottish traditional folk musician, promoter and collector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb231ms3088andgb231ms3124 |title=gb231-ms3088etc - Papers of Arthur Argo and Arthur Barron |publisher=Archives Hub |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the great grandson of [[Gavin Greig]].

Argo came from a family with a rich traditional song heritage. Argo worked alongside [[Hamish Henderson]] collecting field recordings from the North East of [[Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobarandualchais.co.uk/en/ |title=index |publisher=Tobar an Dualchais |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond. Argo, was a promoter of the work of Scottish folk artists and their music. After working as a journalist in the North East, from 1966 he worked for [[BBC Scotland]], from 1973 as a producer with Radio Scotland. He produced the long-running radio series 'Fit Like Folk?', and 'The Reel Blend', a Scottish music series. He was the founder and president of the [[Aberdeen Folksong Club]] and published a series of folk song booklets in the 1960s called 'Chapbook'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/maclean/works/ballad.htm |title=Ballad Of John Maclean |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many musicians such as [[Aly Bain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkfire.org/v6n1.htm |title=FolkFire Articles Archive, v6,n1 |publisher=Folkfire.org |date=1999-02-13 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Dickson]], [[Jean Redpath]] and [[Billy Connolly]] cite Argo as a major influence and stepping stone in their early careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Aidan |url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/right-down-the-line-remembering-gerry-rafferty-1-2032994 |title=Right down the line: Remembering Gerry Rafferty |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2012-01-03 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argo visited the United States twice in the early 1960s and met many of the established and rising stars of the American folk scene including [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">The '''Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities''' ('''ACTC''') is a consortium of private [[liberal arts college]]s in the [[Twin Cities]] ([[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]]) of [[Minnesota]] dedicated to providing cooperative programs, services, and opportunities for their respective students, faculty, staff, and administrators. The ACTC is located in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. The five members of the ACTC are:
*[[Augsburg University]]
*[[Hamline University]]
*[[Macalester College]]
*[[St. Catherine University]]
*[[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]]

The ACTC was officially incorporated in 1975 in order to share and enrich academic offerings for the students of the five institutions. The consortium continues to promote student exchange between its member campuses and to develop and share academic programs. The opportunity for cross-registration makes possible a range and depth of course offerings and majors unavailable at any single institution.

According to the ACTC's official website (see link below), "this partnership combines the benefits of our campuses' small, liberal arts atmospheres with the diverse opportunities of a large university. Students enrolled at one institution are able to experience the strengths and benefits of each school."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11586">The "'''Axis of Evil'''" is a name given to an anomaly in astronomical observations of the  [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB). The anomaly appears to give the plane of the Solar System and hence the location of Earth a greater significance than might be expected by chance. Most scientists believe the anomaly to be a statistical fluke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It’s official: You’re lost in a directionless universe|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/it-s-official-you-re-lost-directionless-universe|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=7 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) radiation signature presents a direct large-scale view of the universe that can be used to identify whether our position or movement has any particular significance.  There has been much publicity about analysis of results from the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck mission]] that show both expected and unexpected [[Cosmic microwave background radiation#CMBR dipole anisotropy|anisotropies]] in the CMB.&lt;ref name=hanson&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1210.6008v1|author1=Anthony Challinor|title=CMB anisotropy science: A review|year=2012|doi=10.1017/S1743921312016663|volume=8|journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union|pages=42–52|bibcode=2013IAUS..288...42C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results appear to run counter to expectations from the [[Copernican Principle]]. The motion of the solar system, and the orientation of the plane of the [[ecliptic]] are aligned with features of the microwave sky, which on conventional thinking are caused by structure at the edge of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;CERN Courier "[http://www.cerncourier.com/main/article/44/10/4/1/CCEsky1_12-04 Does the motion of the solar system affect the microwave sky?]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.

Specifically, with respect to the [[Ecliptic|ecliptic plane]] the "top half" of the CMB is slightly cooler than the "bottom half"; furthermore, the quadrupole and octupole axes are only a few degrees apart, and these axes are aligned with the top/bottom divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/37334-earth-ordinary-cosmological-axis-evil.html|title=The (Cosmological) Axis of Evil|last=Sutter|first=Paul|date=2017-07-29|work=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But when you look at CMB map, you also see that the structure that is observed, is in fact, in a weird way, correlated with the plane of the earth around the sun. Is this Copernicus coming back to haunt us? That's crazy. We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun — the plane of the earth around the sun — the ecliptic. That would say we are truly the center of the universe." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Cosmic microwave background radiation#Low multipoles and other anomalies|Some anomalies]] in the background radiation have been reported which are aligned with the plane of the Solar System, which contradicts the Copernican principle by suggesting that the Solar System's alignment is special.&lt;ref name=mariano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mariano|first1=Antonio|last2=Perivolaropoulos|first2=Leandros|title=CMB maximum temperature asymmetry axis: Alignment with other cosmic asymmetries|journal=Physical Review D|volume=87|issue=4|pages=043511|year=2013|issn=1550-7998|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.87.043511|arxiv = 1211.5915 |bibcode = 2013PhRvD..87d3511M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land and Magueijo in 2005 dubbed this alignment the "axis of evil" owing to the implications for current models of the cosmos,&lt;ref name=LandMagueijo2005&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Land | first = Kate |author2=João Magueijo | first2 = João | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.071301  | title = Examination of Evidence for a Preferred Axis in the Cosmic Radiation Anisotropy  | journal = Physical Review Letters  | volume = 95  | issue = 7  | year = 2005 |arxiv = astro-ph/0502237 |bibcode = 2005PhRvL..95g1301L | pmid=16196772 | page=071301}}&lt;/ref&gt; although several later studies have shown systematic errors in the collection of that data and the way it is processed.&lt;ref name="arXiv:0907.2731v3"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Liu |first=Hao |last2=Li |first2=Ti-Pei |year=2009 |title=Improved CMB Map from WMAP Data |class=astro-ph |eprint=0907.2731v3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arXiv:1006.1270v1"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Sawangwit |first=Utane |last2=Shanks |first2=Tom |year=2010 |title=Lambda-CDM and the WMAP Power Spectrum Beam Profile Sensitivity |class=astro-ph |eprint=1006.1270v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arXiv:1009.2701v1"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Liu |first=Hao  |year=2010 |title=Diagnosing Timing Error in WMAP Data |class=astro-ph |eprint=1009.2701v1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various studies of the CMB anisotropy data either confirm the Copernican principle,&lt;ref name=zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Pengjie|last2=Stebbins|first2=Albert|title=Confirmation of the Copernican Principle at Gpc Radial Scale and above from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect Power Spectrum|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=107|issue=4|pages=041301|year=2011|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.041301|pmid=21866989|bibcode=2011PhRvL.107d1301Z|arxiv = 1009.3967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; model the alignments in a non-homogeneous universe still consistent with the principle,&lt;ref name=buckley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=Robert G.|last2=Schlegel|first2=Eric M.|title=CMB dipoles and other low-order multipoles in the quasispherical Szekeres model|journal=Physical Review D|volume=87|issue=2|pages=023524|year=2013|issn=1550-7998|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.87.023524|bibcode = 2013PhRvD..87b3524B }}&lt;/ref&gt; or attempt to explain them as local phenomena.&lt;ref name=Hansen2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=M|last2=Kim|first2=J|last3=Frejsel|first3=A.M|last4=Ramazanov|first4=S|last5=Naselsky|first5=P|last6=Zhao|first6=W|last7=Burigana|first7=C|title=Can residuals of the solar system foreground explain low multipole anomalies of the CMB?|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|volume=2012|issue=10|year=2012|pages=059|issn=1475-7516|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2012/10/059|arxiv = 1206.6981 |bibcode = 2012JCAP...10..059H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these alternate explanations were discussed by Copi, ''et al.'', who claimed that data from the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck satellite]] could shed significant light on whether the preferred direction and alignments were spurious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Copi|first=Craig J.|last2=Huterer|first2=Dragan|last3=Schwarz|first3=Dominik J.|last4=Starkman|first4=Glenn D.|date=2010|title=Large-angle anomalies in the CMB|arxiv=1004.5602|journal=Advances in Astronomy|volume=2010|pages=1–17|doi=10.1155/2010/847541|issn=1687-7969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Copi|first=Craig J.|last2=Huterer|first2=Dragan|last3=Schwarz|first3=Dominik J.|last4=Starkman|first4=Glenn D.|date=2007-01-08|title=The Uncorrelated Universe: Statistical Anisotropy and the Vanishing Angular Correlation Function in WMAP Years 1-3|arxiv=astro-ph/0605135|journal=Physical Review D|volume=75|issue=2|pages=023507|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.75.023507|issn=1550-7998|bibcode=2007PhRvD..75b3507C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidence is a possible explanation.

The axis was the subject of much of the discussion in the 2014 documentary film ''[[The Principle]]'', and formed the basis of the argument advanced therein.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11242">Much has been written about [[Bach]]'s ensembles (both in size and constituents—both vocal and instrumental) that he used.

In Bach's time {{Interlanguage link multi|Figural music|de|3=Figuralmusik|lt=figural music}} referred to more advanced vocal [[church music]], usually accompanied by instrumental forces, such as [[motet (Bach)|his motets]], [[church cantata (Bach)|church cantata]]s and [[passions (Bach)|passions]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XD0ThbL5luEC&amp;pg=19 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt; The vocal and instrumental forces used by Bach for the performance of such music are to a certain extent documented for all the periods of his life. Information about his secular orchestral and choral music is more limited: it mostly involves his period in Köthen, and his involvement with Leipzig's student orchestra, the [[Collegium Musicum]] performing at [[Café Zimmermann]].

In 1730, Bach wrote a memo (''Entwurff'') to the Leipzig town council regarding musical staffing of the Leipzig churches for which he was responsible.

====Vocal forces====
In regards to vocal forces, Bach wrote:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Bach, Johann Sebastian.  Kurtzer; iedoch höchstnöthiger Entwurff einer wohlbestallten Kirchen Music; nebst einigem unvorgreiflichen Bedencken von dem Verfall derselben.  Leipzig: Johann Sebastian Bach, 23 August 1730.  Retrieved on 17 May 2011 from http://www.bach.de/leben/kirchenmusik.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Zu einer wohlbestellten Kirchen Music gehören Vocalisten und Instrumentalisten. Die Vocalisten werden hiesiges Ohrts von denen Thomas Schülern formiret, und zwar von vier Sorten, als Discantisten, Altisten, Tenoristen, und Baßisten.

Nicolai und der Neüen Kirche müßen die Schüler alle musicalisch seyn. In die Peters-Kirche kömmt der Ausschuß, nemlich die, so keine music verstehen, sondern nur nothdörfftig einen Choral singen können. Zu iedweden musicalischen Chor gehören wenigstens 3 Sopranisten, 3 Altisten, 3 Tenoristen, und eben so viele Baßisten, damit, so etwa einer unpaß wird (wie denn sehr offte geschieht, und besonders bey itziger Jahres Zeit, da die recepte, so von dem Schul Medico in die Apothecke verschrieben werden, es ausweisen müßen) wenigstens eine 2 Chörigte Motette gesungen werden kan. (NB. Wiewohln es noch beßer, wenn der Coetus so beschaffen wäre, dass mann zu ieder Stimme 4 subjecta nehmen, und also ieden Chor mit 16. Persohnen bestellen könte.)|}}

{{Cquote|A well-appointed Church Music requires Vocalists and Instrumentalists. The Vocalists are in this place [Leipzig] made up of the pupils of the Thomas-Schule ([[Thomasschule zu Leipzig]]), being of four kinds, namely, [[Soprano]]s (''Discanten''), [[Alto]]s, [[Tenor]]s, and [[Bass (voice type)]] es. In order that the Choruses of Church Pieces may be performed as is fitting, the Vocalists must in turn be divided into two sorts, namely, Concertists and Ripienists. The Concertists are ordinarily 4 in number; sometimes also 5, 6, 7, even 8; that is, if one wishes to perform music for two choirs [''per choros'']. The Ripienists, too, must be at least 8, namely, two for each part .... The Number of the ''Alumni Thomanae Scholae'' (resident students of the Thomas-Schule) is 55. These 55 are divided into 4 Choirs, for the 4 Churches in which they must perform partly concerted music, partly [[motet]]s, and partly [[chorale]]s. In the 3 Churches, [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig|St. Thomas]], [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig|St. Nicholas]], and the New Church ([[St. Matthew, Leipzig|St. Matthew]]), the pupils all must be musical. [[St. Peter, Leipzig|St. Peter]] receives the remainder, namely those who do not understand music and can only just barely sing a chorale. Every musical Choir should contain at least 3 Sopranos, 3 Altos, 3 Tenors, and as many basses, so that even if one happens to fall ill (as very often happens, particularly at this time of year, as the prescriptions written by the school Physician for the Apothecary must show) at least a double-chorus motet may be sung. (Note: Though it would be still better if the classes were such that one could have 4 singers on each part and thus could perform every chorus with 16 persons). This makes in all 36 persons who must understand ''musicam''.|}}

He also lists in a note dating from about the same year (1730) the minimum requirements for the churches mentioned in the ''Entwurff'':

====Instrumental forces====
Likewise, Bach wrote of the instrumental forces required:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{Cquote|Die Instrumentalisten werden auch in verschiedene Arthen eingetheilet als: Violinisten, Hautboisten, Fleutenisten, Trompetter und Paucker. NB. Zu denen Violisten / gehören auch die die, so die Violen Violoncelli und Violons spielen...Machet demnach der numerus, so Musicam verstehen müßen, 36 Personen aus.

Von deren qualitäten und musicalischen Wißenschafften aber etwas nach der Warheit zu erwehnen, verbietet mir die Bescheidenheit. Jedoch ist zu consideriren, dass Sie theils emeriti, theils auch in keinem solchen / exercitio sind, wie es wohl seyn solte.|}}

{{Cquote|The instrumentalists are also divided into various kinds, namely, violinists (''Violisten''), oboists, flutists, trumpeters, and drummers. Note: The violinists include also [i.e., in addition to the players of the violin] those who play the [[viola]]s, the [[violoncello]]s, and the ''[[Violone|violons]]'') .... The ''instrumental music'' consists of the following parts, namely:

* 2 or even 3 for the                                     ''Violino 1''
* 2 or 3 for the                                          ''Violino 2''

* 1 for the                                               ''Violone''
* 2, or, if the piece requires, 3, for the                ''Hautbois'' (''oboe'')
* 1, or even 2, for the                                   ''Basson'' (''[[bassoon]]'')
* 3 for the                                               ''Trumpets''
* 1 for the                                               ''[[Timpani]]'')
--
''Summa'' 18 persons at least, for the instrumental music

Note: If it happens that the Church piece is composed with [[Flute]]s also (whether they are ''à bec'' [ [[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]]s] or ''Traversieri'' [ [[Transverse flute]]s]), as very often happens for variety's sake, at least 2 more persons are needed.  Making altogether 20 instrumentalists. The number of persons engaged for the Church music is 8, namely, 4 Town pipers (''StadPfeifer''), 3 professional fiddlers (''KunstGeiger''), and one apprentice. Modesty forbids me to speak at all truthfully of their qualities and musical knowledge. Nevertheless it must be remembered that they are partly ''emeriti'' and partly not at all in such ''exercitio'' as they should be.|}}

===21st century===
In the 21st century, several conductors have recorded all or most of Bach's cantatas using choirs with three or four singers per part.{{cn|date=April 2016}} For instance, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] has performed and recorded "Bach ... as he practiced in Leipzig, with three suitable singers per voice group".&lt;ref name="Herreweghe2010"&gt;Ellen Segeren. "Voor Herreweghe gaat de tijd dringen: 'Ik wil alleen nog topmuziek'", pp. 61–64 in {{url|www.luister.nl}}, summer 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Herreweghe sees voices suitable for Bach as "small" voices, voice types with certain characteristics: he names [[Peter Kooij]] and [[Dorothee Mields]] as examples of that voice type.&lt;ref name="Herreweghe2010" /&gt; 

By contrast, a number of 21st-century Bach conductors have instead accepted [[Joshua Rifkin]]'s arguments that most of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s choral music was performed with only [[OVPP|one singer per voice part]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}

The '''Baghdad School''' was a relatively short-lived yet influential school of [[Islamic art]] developed during the late 12th century in the capital [[Baghdad]] of the ruling [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The movement had largely died out by the early 14th century, five decades following the invasion of the [[Mongols]] in 1258 and the downfall of the Abbasids' rule, and would eventually be replaced by stylistic movements from the [[Mongol]] tradition.  The Baghdad School is particularly noted for its distinctive approach to manuscript illustration.  The faces depicted in illustrations were individualized and expressive, with the scenes often highlighting realistic features of everyday life from the period.  This stylistic movement used strong, bright colors, and employed a balanced sense of design and a decorative quality, with illustrations often lacking traditional frames and appearing between lines of text on manuscript pages.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v. "Baghdad school," accessed May 04, 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48804/Baghdad-school.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Baghdad School of art is noted for its manuscript artwork. The school consisted of calligraphers, illustrators, transcribers and translators, who collaborated to produce illuminated manuscripts derived from non-Arabic sources. The characteristic Baghdad School artistic style, which features sprightly characters bearing highly expressive faces and hand gestures (rather than stereotypical people), reached its peak in the first half of the 13th-century, although some examples can be identified at earlier periods.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad School," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., CRC Press, 2003, p. 1259&lt;/ref&gt;  Illustrations in this style represent a skilful blend of Byzantine, Persian and Arab features.&lt;ref&gt;Ekhtiar, M., ''Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' New York, N.Y., [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2011, p. 94; Ipşiroğlu, M.S., ''Painting and Culture of the Mongols,'' Abrams, 1966, p. 37; Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Very few illuminated copies of the [[Quaran|Q'ran]] from this period have survived, but a number of secular manuscripts are still extant.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., [[CRC Press]], 2003, p. 1259.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts are primarily scientific treatises or social commentaries. 

The descriptor, "Baghdad School", was coined by the French [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], Eustache De Lorey, in 1938, when he curated an exhibition of illustrations from ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani]]'' for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Some art historians and curators used the term, ''Mesopotamian School,''&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin,'' n.d.,  p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1930, pp 18-20 or Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars have suggested that the term should be replaced with something broader, such as the Arab School of Miniatures, because its exponents were not just confined to Baghdad and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Osier, P., ''Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and illustrations of ''[[De Materia Medica]]''==

The [[Greeks|Greek]] [[materia medica]], in particular herbals and [[bestiaries]], which described the characteristics and medicinal uses of various plants and animals found in the Mediterranean world, were among the books transcribed.&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;“Preparation of Medicine from Honey: Leaf from an Arabic Translation of the Materia Medica of Dioscorides [Iraq, Baghdad School] (13.152.6)”. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000--. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/13.152.6 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several Arabic translations of [[Dioscorides]]' work, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' have been discovered. [[Dioscorides]]' treatise was considered especially important, and remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;

Of these, a manuscript known as the ''Mashhad Manuscript'', originally believed to be 13th-century  work, has been reassessed and now dated to between 1152 and 1176, providing one of the earliest examples of illustrations in the style of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref&gt;Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has no colophon with date, but it has a 4-page introduction written by Mihran ibn Mansur ibn Miihran, who translated it for Najm ad-din Alpi, the Urtuqid prince, ruler from 1152 to 1176.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of these translations is the translation and work probably by Abdallah ibn al-Fadl.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, M., ''New Accessions of Islamic Art,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257747.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d., p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has a colophon which establishes the date as the month of Rajab 620 A.H./ July-August 1224&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations were considered especially important, and it remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;  [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned Greek physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt; 

Among the illustrated manuscript leaves of the 13th-century [[Dioscorides]]' ''Materia Medica'' is the page entitled, “Physician Preparing an Elixir," also referred to by The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History as “Preparation of Medicine from Honey.”  It is dated 1224 CE and was found in [[Iraq]] or Northern Jazira, possibly [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;  The page depicts an illustration of a bearded physician with a colorful blue headscarf and red clothing seated on an ornamental stool.  He is mixing a yellow pot with a ladle while overlooking a yellow cauldron hanging from a red tripod above a wide blue container.  His other hand is raised up towards his mouth.  A large blue jug lies to the left of the tripod.  Two overhanging trees on either side of the scene bear leaves and two different types of what appear to be colorful fruit or flowers—red on the left and yellow on the right.  The ground below the scene is covered with green grass, however there is no background depicted in the illustration thus reducing the sense of depth. The style of illustration depicted on this manuscript leaf is thus an excellent example of the Baghdad School: the colors are bright and distinctive, the objects depicted in the scene have a balanced, symmetrical design with the trees framing the illustration, and finally, the man’s face appears to be in a state of deep, expressive contemplation.  The scene itself has a realistic and personalized quality to it, depicting a physician in a natural setting as he prepares a medicinal mixture containing honey for his patients, and yet also has ornamental characteristics with its design and choice of colors—another distinctive feature of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

==Transcription and illustration of ''Maqamat''==
The Abbasid artist, [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]], who lived in [[Baghdad]] in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th-centuries), was one of the pre-eminent exponents of the Baghdad school. In 1236-37, he is known to have transcribed and illustrated the book, ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (also known as the ''Assemblies'' or the ''Sessions''), a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative concerns the travels of a middle-aged man as he uses his charm and eloquence to swindle his way across the Arabic world.&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works ==
[[File:Two men talking. An image from Kalila wa Dimna.jpg|thumb|''Two men talking'' from ''Kalila wa Dimna,'' c. 1222]]

Yet other examples of work in the style of the Baghdad School include the illustrations in ''Kalila wa Dimna'' ([[Panchatantra|Fables of Bidpai]]), (1222); a collection of fables by the Hindu, Bidpai translated into Arabic ,&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., CRC Press, 2003, p. 1259; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1930, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rasa'il al-Ikhwan al-Safa'' (The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren) (1287); an example of an illuminated manuscript produced after the Mongol invasion.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]; Brend, B., ''Islamic Art,'' [[Harvard University Press]], 1991, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the 20th-century, al-Waiti's illustrations and the Baghdad School served as an inspiration for [[Iraqi art#Jama’et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|The Baghdad Modern Art Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,'' p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the 1950s by artists, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], members of the group believed that the Mongol invasion of the 13th-century represented a "break in the chain of pictorial Iraqi art"&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted to reassert a national identity and build a distinctive Iraqi identity which referenced heritage and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]], 1991, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; As the leader of the group, Saleem promoted the idea of ''istilham al-turath'' – "seeking inspiration from tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shabout | first=N. | chapter=Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism | title=Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World | url=http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">[[Image:Beamed notes.svg|thumb|right|alt=image with beamed notes|A quaver, a dotted quaver, and a semiquaver, all joined with a primary beam (the semiquaver has a secondary beam)]]

In [[musical notation]], a '''beam''' is a horizontal or diagonal line used to connect multiple consecutive [[Musical note|note]]s (and occasionally rests) to indicate rhythmic grouping. Only [[eighth note]]s (quavers) or [[note value|shorter]] can be beamed. The number of beams is equal to the number of [[note value|flags]] that would be present on an unbeamed note. '''''Beaming''''' refers to the conventions and use of beams. A '''primary beam''' connects a note group unbroken, while a '''secondary beam''' is interrupted or partially broken.

==Grouping==
The span of beams indicates the rhythmic grouping, usually determined by the time signature. Therefore, beams do not usually cross [[bar line]]s or major subdivisions of bars. If notes extend across these divisions, this is indicated with a [[tie (music)|tie]]. It is basically a line that joins notes together. A single eighth note, or any faster note, is always stemmed with flags, while two or more are usually beamed in groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gerou, Tom (1996). ''Essential Dictionary of Music Notation'', p.211. Alfred. {{ISBN|0-88284-730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern practice, beams may span across rests in order to make rhythmic groups clearer.

In [[vocal music]], beams were traditionally used only to connect notes sung to the same syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Westergaard | first = Peter | title = An Introduction to Tonal Theory | page = 24 | date = 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern practice it is more common to use standard beaming rules, while indicating multi-note syllables with [[slur (music)|slur]]s.&lt;ref name=standard-practice&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407014159/http://www.mpa.org/music_notation/standard_practice.pdf | archivedate = 2008-04-07 | url = http://www.mpa.org/music_notation/standard_practice.pdf | title = Standard Music Notation Practice | publisher = Music Publishers' Association of the United States | accessdate = 4 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positioning==
[[File:Exceptional beaming midway beams.png|thumb|Midway beams, though exceptional, can help prevent crowded staves, thus the top staff may be preferable to the bottom two options&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]] (1979). ''Music Notation'', p.89. Crescendo. {{ISBN|0-8008-5453-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Notes joined by a beam usually have all the [[stem (music)|stems]] pointing in the same direction (up or down). The average pitch of the notes is used to determine the direction – if the average pitch is below the middle staff-line, the stems and beams usually go above the notehead, otherwise they go below.&lt;ref name=standard-practice/&gt;

The direction of beams usually follows the general direction of the notes it groups, slanting down if the notes go down, slanting up if the notes go up, and level if the first and last notes are the same.

==Feathered beaming==
[[File:Feathered beams four note run.png|thumb|Feathered beams]]

Feathered beaming shows a gradual change in the speed of notes. It is shown with a primary straight beam and other diagonal secondary beams (that together resemble a feather, hence the name). These secondary beams suggest a gradual acceleration or deceleration from the first note value within the feathered beam to the last. The longest value possible to show being the [[eighth note]] (quaver). When the number of notes played is not of interest, but rather the effect of acceleration or deceleration, an approximate number of headless stems are used. To ensure clarity, sometimes the number of notes within the beam, or the duration of the total beamed notes, is shown above the music, as is done with [[tuplets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.music.indiana.edu/departments/academic/composition/style-guide/#beaming | accessdate = 26 March 2015 | title = Music Notation Style Guide » Beaming | publisher = [[Jacobs School of Music]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">The '''behavioral immune system''' is a phrase coined by the psychological scientist [[Mark Schaller]] to refer to a suite of psychological mechanisms that allow individual organisms to detect the potential presence of disease-causing [[parasite]]s in their immediate environment, and to engage in behaviors that prevent contact with those objects and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1702_2 |last=Schaller |first=M. |year=2006 |title=Parasites, behavioral defenses, and the social psychological mechanisms through which cultures are evoked |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages= 96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sd2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Duncan, L.A. |title=Evolution and the social mind: Evolutionary psychology and social cognition |editor=J.P.

These mechanisms include sensory processes through which cues connoting the presence of parasitic infections are perceived (e.g., the smell of a foul odor, the sight of [[Acne scarring|pox]] or [[pustules]]), as well as [[stimulus–response]] systems through which these sensory cues trigger a cascade of aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions (e.g., arousal of [[disgust]], automatic activation of cognitions that connote the threat of disease, behavioral avoidance).&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oaten |first=M. |author2=Stevenson, R.J. |author3=Case, T.I. |date=March 2009 |title=Disgust as a disease–avoidance mechanism |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=303–21 |doi=10.1037/a0014823 |pmid=19254082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a behavioral immune system has been documented across many animal species, including humans. It is theorized that the mechanisms that comprise the behavioral immune system evolved as a crude first line of defense against disease-causing pathogens.&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;

==Implications for human behavior==
Within the [[psychological sciences]], there is extensive research linking the behavioral immune system to a variety of prejudices—including prejudices against people who aren't actually diseased but are simply characterized by some sort of visual characteristics that deviate from those of a subjectively prototypical human being. The disease–avoidant processes that characterize the behavioral immune system have been shown to contribute to prejudices against [[obese]] individuals, [[elderly]] individuals, and people with physical disfigurements or [[disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J.H. |author2=Faulkner, J. |author3=Schaller, M. |date=June 2003 |title=Evolved disease-avoidance processes and contemporary anti-social behavior: Prejudicial attitudes and avoidance of people with physical disabilities |journal= Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |publisher=Springer Netherlands |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=65–87 |issn=1573-3653 |doi=10.1023/A:1023910408854 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l147k15h81282134/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Crandall, C.S. |year=2007 |title=Pathogen-avoidance mechanisms and the stigmatization of obese people |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=410–4 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/ParkSchallerCrandall2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=L.A. |author2=Schaller, M. |date=October 27, 2009 |title=Prejudicial Attitudes Toward Older Adults May Be Exaggerated When People Feel Vulnerable to Infectious Disease: Evidence and Implications |journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy |publisher=The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=97–115 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122665436/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01188.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the behavioral immune system appears to contribute to [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faulkner |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Park, J.H. |author4= Duncan, L.A.  |year=2004 |title=Evolved Disease–Avoidance Mechanisms and Contemporary Xenophobic Attitudes |journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations |volume=7 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/1368430204046142 |pages=333–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Navarrete |first=C.D. |author2=D. Fessler|author3=S. Eng |year=2007 |title=Elevated ethnocentrism in the first trimester of pregnancy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=60–5 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fessler/pubs/NavarretePregEthnocentr2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One implication is that these prejudices tend to be exaggerated under conditions in which people feel especially vulnerable to the potential transmission of infectious diseases.

Additional lines of research on the behavioral immune system have shown that people engage in more reticent and conservative forms of behavior under conditions in which they feel more vulnerable to disease transmission. For instance, when the potential threat of disease is made salient, people tend to be less extraverted or sociable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797610361706 |last=Mortensen |first=C.R. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4=Neuberg, S.L. |author5=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2010 |title=Infection breeds reticence: The effects of disease salience on self-perceptions of personality and behavioral tendencies |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=440–7 |pmid=20424082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that the behavioral immune system also incorporates mechanisms designed to search out and process (heuristic) signs of disease at the level of basic visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.008 |last=Ackerman |first=J.M. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Mortensen, C.R. |author4=Sasaki, T. |author5=Neuberg, S.L.  |author6=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2009 |title=A pox on the mind: Disjunction of attention and memory in the processing of physical disfigurement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages= 478–85 |url=http://web.mit.edu/joshack/www/Ackerman_Pox-on-the-mind2009.pdf |pmid=19578547 |pmc=2699287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for human culture==
The behavioral immune system also has consequences at a [[cultural]] level of analysis. Under ecological circumstances in which diseases are more prevalent, people also tend to display more reticent and socially restricted forms of behavior, and human cultures are defined by more conservative norms and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fincher |first=C.L. |author2=Thornhill, R. |author3=Murray, D.R. |author4= Schaller, M.  |year=2008 |title=Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=275 |issue=1640 |pages=1279–85 |pmid=18302996 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/FincherThornhillMurraySchaller2008.pdf |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0094 |pmc=2602680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Murray, D.R. |date=July 2008 |title=Pathogens, personality, and culture: Disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=212–21 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2008-08084-014&amp;CFID=5418322&amp;CFTOKEN=19787463 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.212 |pmid=18605861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for immunology==
Some research suggests that the behavioral immune system has implications for the functioning of the physiological [[immune system]] too. One study found that the mere visual perception of diseased-looking people stimulated white blood cells to respond more aggressively to infection (as indicated by the production of the proinflammatory [[cytokine]] [[Interleukin 6]] in response to a bacterial stimulus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Miller, G.E. |author3=Gervais, W.M. |author4=Yager, S. |author5= Chen, E.  |year=2010 |title=Mere visual perception of other people's disease symptoms facilitates a more aggressive immune response |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=649–52 |pmid=20483842 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/SchallerMillerGervaisYagerChen2010.pdf |doi=10.1177/0956797610368064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also indicates that immune-relevant interventions which target pathogen transmission can interrupt behavioral responses. For example, receiving a flu vaccination or washing one's hands can reduce the extent of negative interpersonal and intergroup attitudes elicited by disease cues and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huang|first=J.Y. |author2=Sedlovskaya, A. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4= Bargh, J.A.  |year=2011 |title=Immunizing Against Prejudice: Effects of Disease Protection on Attitudes Toward Out-Groups |journal=Psychological Science |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1550–56 |pmid=22058107 |doi=10.1177/0956797611417261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BioCity Nottingham''' is a bioscience [[science park]] in central [[Nottingham]] in the United Kingdom. It is the UK's largest bioscience innovation and incubation centre.

==History==
In 2002, laboratories and office space were donated to [[Nottingham Trent University]] by BASF. Biocity was founded in September 2003 by the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University (NTU) and the [[East Midlands Development Agency]] (which was based close to BioCity).

Biocity's premises were developed from the building donated by BASF. Phase 1 was completed in March 2004, providing {{convert|36000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of space, then Phase 2 in March 2006 provided {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. When Phase 3 of the development was completed in October 2008, with {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, funding from emda also finished.

===Background===
Nottingham has long been an important centre for bioscience research, principally through work done at the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University and by [[Boots UK|Boots]], Britain's largest retail [[pharmacy]] company, which is based in [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]]/[[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]]. Although Boots no longer engages in drug discovery, [[Ibuprofen]] (iso-butyl-propanoic-phenolic acid) was created by Boots scientists in Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.york.ac.uk/enterprise/cetle/resources/WRCE/Case%20Study%20-%20Boots%20the%20Chemist.pdf Boots ibuprofen project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001172448/http://www.york.ac.uk/enterprise/cetle/resources/WRCE/Case%20Study%20-%20Boots%20the%20Chemist.pdf |date=1 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005 Nottingham was named as a Science City; the other 5 Science Cities were [[Birmingham]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghamsciencecity.co.uk/about-us/ About Us at Birmingham Science City]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol]], [[York]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/values/partnerships/civic/sciencecity.htm Newcastle Science City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002747/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/values/partnerships/civic/sciencecity.htm |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manchester]].

==Structure==
It is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/318420 situated] in former [[BASF]] buildings, which previously were used by Boots as research laboratories.

The [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/948642 site] on ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1899769 Pennyfoot Street]'', between the [[A60 road|A60]] and [[A612 road|A612]], is for bioscience [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]s. The University of Nottingham has the largest collaboration with companies at BioCity, with a few having links with NTU.

There are three buildings –
* Innovation Centre Building
* Stewart Adams Building – named after Dr Stewart Adams OBE, who led the team at Boots (with John Nicholson) that discovered Ibuprofen, a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]], in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3351540/Dr-Stewart-Adams-I-tested-ibuprofen-on-my-hangover.html Dr Stewart Adams]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Laurus Building

In January 2012 BioCity opened a second site, BioCity Scotland, resulting from the acquisition of a former MSD research facility near Glasgow.

A '''biosurvey,''' or biological survey, is a scientific study of [[organism]]s to assess the condition of an [[ecological]] resource, such as a [[water body]].

==Overview==
Biosurveys are used by government agencies responsible for management of public lands, environmental planning and/or environmental [[regulation]] to assess ecological resources, such as [[river]]s, [[stream]]s, [[lake]]s and [[wetland]]s. They involve collection and analysis of animal and/or plant samples which serve as [[bioindicator]]s. The studies may be conducted by professional scientists or volunteer organizations.  They are conducted according to published procedures to ensure consistency in data collection and analysis, and to compare findings to established metrics.

Biosurveys typically use metrics such as [[species]] composition and richness (e.g. number of species, extent of pollution-tolerant species), and ecological factors (number of individuals, proportion of [[predator]]s, presence of disease). Biosurveys may identify [[water pollution|pollution]] problems that are difficult or expensive to detect using [[water pollution#Chemical testing|chemical testing]] procedures.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biosurvey may be used to generate an [[index of biological integrity]] (IBI), a scoring system for an ecological resource.&lt;ref name="Karr"/&gt;

The '''British Rail Research Division''' came into being in 1964 directly under the control of the [[British Railways Board]], moving into purpose-built premises at the [[Railway Technical Centre]] in [[Derby]]. The intention was to improve railway reliability and efficiency, while reducing costs and improving revenue. In so doing it became recognised as a centre of excellence and, in time, was providing consultancy to other railways around the world. While it became famous for the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT), its activities extended into every area of railway operation. The theoretical rigor of its approach to railway engineering superseded the ad hoc methods that had prevailed previously.
[[File:Apt-front.jpg|right|thumb|200px|APT-E at [[Shildon Locomotion Museum|''Locomotion'']], [[Shildon]], [[County Durham]] ]]

==Work==
The Research Division brought together personnel and expertise from all over the country, including the [[LMS Scientific Research Laboratory]]. Their remit was not simply the improvement of existing equipment, or the solution of existing problems, but fundamental research from first principles, into railway operation. The results of its work would go on to inform development by engineers, manufacturers and railways all over the world. For instance, once the initial APT-E experimental project was complete, it passed to the mechanical engineering department to build the APT-P prototype. In time, engineers would be seconded to other countries for varying periods under the trade name "Transmark".

One of the first major projects was the development of profiled/pre-worn wheels which helped counter the tendency of new wheels to [[Hunting oscillation|hunt]]. This led to research into vehicle suspensions, and the creation of the four-wheel [[High Speed Freight Vehicle]] (HSFV1) which proved stable at up to 140mph when tested on the roller rig.

Other work involved looking at the tamping of ballast, properties of subsoils, and rail prestressing. A large part of the network had been converted to continuous welded rail which, during a hot summer, caused many problems with rail buckling. Although there were no injuries, there were a number of derailments. Attention focused on the costs and benefits of tamping the ballast over the sleeper ends.

There were extended studies into [[fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]], and pioneering work in ultrasound crack detection at a time when it was being investigated elsewhere for medical diagnostics. The Research Division was involved in new [[Railway signalling|signalling]] systems, such as [[Solid State Interlocking]] (SSI) and the [[Integrated Electronic Control Centre]] (IECC), and in the design of the overhead lines for the [[West Coast Main Line]].
[[File:LEV1 at Weybourne Station.jpg|thumb|right|The prototype railbus LEV1]]

The Research Division developed two test tracks. The first was on the old [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GNR]] line between Egginton Junction and Derby Friargate (later used only as far as Mickleover) and was used by the Train Control Group. When the Advanced Passenger Train was being developed, a second test track was created on the line between Melton Junction and Edwalton (known as the [[Old Dalby Test Track]]), which was acquired specifically to test this revolutionary train. The Mickleover test track was closed and lifted in the early 1990s but Old Dalby is still in use today and has a bright future.

==End of the line==
In 1986 finance for the division was moved from the board to the operating divisions. Thus emphasis shifted from pure research to problem solving. In 1989, BR Research became a self-contained unit working under contract to British Rail and other customers, and the way was open for privatisation.
   
When British Rail was sold into private ownership, the Research Division (which had become "BR Research Limited") was bought by [[AEA Technology|AEA Technology plc]] in 1996. The resulting business, "AEA Technology Rail", was subsequently sold in 2006 to a venture capital company and became [[DeltaRail Group|DeltaRail Group Limited]]. Transmark, the consultancy arm, was sold to [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]] to become Halcrow Transmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Network Rail launches international arm|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2012/07/09-network-rail-launches-international-arm.html|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Railnews|date=9 July 2012|quote=Transmark, which was the consultancy arm of the BR Research Division, was sold to Halcrow when the railways were privatised in the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A somewhat dated display of material relating to the work of the Division was maintained in the [[Derby Industrial Museum]].

==Legacy==
The Research Division had an uneasy relationship with other parts of BR, and like most of the products of [[Harold Wilson]]'s "[[white heat of technology]]" speech, were killed off in the early 1980s. The basis of the unease was the traditional approach of most of BR compared with theoretical and aerospace approaches adopted by the Research Division. The hiring of graduates rather than training people up internally also caused tensions.

It could be somewhat tactless, or perhaps naive, at times. The APT-E was provided with a single driver position central in the cab, at a time when the unions were resisting the loss of the "second man" (the fireman in steam days). After its first run out to [[Duffield, Derbyshire|Duffield]] the APT-E was "blacked" by the unions for a year. 

Nevertheless, its empirical research into vehicle dynamics has produced today's high speed trains, both freight and passenger, including the [[High Speed Train]], [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]] and worldwide. The concept of a tilting system for the APT became part of the  [[Pendolino]]{{fact|date=December 2017}}, while the products of its signalling and operations control research are used over a significant amount of the British railway system.

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Dance of Death (CCLXIIIIv).jpg|thumb|right|''The Dance of Death'' (1493) by [[Michael Wolgemut]], from the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' of [[Hartmann Schedel]]]]

The '''''Danse Macabre''''' (from the [[French language]]), also called the '''''Dance of Death''''', is an artistic genre of [[allegory]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]] on the universality of [[death]]: no matter one's station in life, the Dance Macabre unites all.

The Danse Macabre consists of the dead or a [[Death (personification)|personification of death]] summoning representatives from all walks of life to dance along to the [[grave]], typically with a [[pope]], [[emperor]], [[monarch|king]], [[child]], and [[laborer]]. They were produced as [[memento mori|mementos mori]], to remind people of the fragility of their lives and how vain were the glories of earthly life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04617a.htm | title=Dance of Death | date=2007-02-20 | work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are postulated from illustrated sermon texts; the earliest recorded visual scheme was a now-lost mural at [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]] in Paris dating from 1424 to 1425.

==Paintings==
The earliest recorded visual example is the lost mural on the south wall of the cemetery of the Holy Innocents in Paris, which was painted in 1424-25 during the regency of [[John, Duke of Bedford]]: with its emphatic inclusion of a dead crowned king at a time when France did not have a crowned king, the mural may well have had a political subtext.&lt;ref&gt;Oosterwijk (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; There were also painted schemes in [[Basel]] (the earliest dating from c.1440); a series of paintings on canvas by [[Bernt Notke]], in [[Lübeck]] (1463); the initial fragment of the original Bernt Notke painting (accomplished at the end of the 15th century) in the [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn|St Nicholas' Church]], [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] ([[Danse Macabre (Notke)|Danse Macabre]]); the painting at the back wall of the chapel of Sv. Marija na Škrilinama in the [[Istria]]n town of Beram (1471), painted by Vincent of [[Kastav]]; the painting in the [[Holy Trinity Church (Hrastovlje)|Holy Trinity Church, Hrastovlje]], Istria by [[John of Kastav]] (1490).  

A notable example was painted on the cemetery walls of the Dominican Abbey in [[Bern]] by [[Niklaus Manuel Deutsch]] in 1516/7.
This work was destroyed when the wall was torn down in 1660, but a 1649 copy by [[Albrecht Kauw]] is extant.
There was also a Dance of Death painted around 1430 and displayed on the walls of Pardon Churchyard at Old [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, with texts by [[John Lydgate]], known as the 'Dauce of (St) Poulys', which was destroyed in 1549.

[[File:Danse Macabre - Guyot Marchand9 (Abbot and Bailiff).jpg|thumb|''La Danse macabre'' ([[Abbot]] and [[Bailiff]]). Paris, [[Guy Marchant]], 1486]]

The deathly [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages|horrors of the 14th century]] such as recurring [[famine]]s, the [[Hundred Years' War]] in [[France]], and, most of all, the [[Black Death]], were culturally assimilated throughout Europe. The omnipresent possibility of sudden and painful death increased the religious desire for [[penance]], but it also evoked a hysterical desire for amusement while still possible; a last dance as cold comfort. The danse macabre combines both desires: in many ways similar to the mediaeval [[mystery play]]s, the dance-with-death allegory was originally a [[didacticism|didactic]] dialogue poem to remind people of the inevitability of death and to advise them strongly to be prepared at all times for death (see ''[[memento mori]]'' and ''[[Ars moriendi]]'').

Short verse dialogues between Death and each of its victims, which could have been performed as plays, can be found in the direct aftermath of the Black Death in [[Germany]] and in [[Spain]]  (where it was known as the ''Totentanz'' and ''la Danza de la Muerte'', respectively). The French term ''danse macabre'' may derive from the Latin ''Chorea Machabæorum'', literally "dance of the Maccabees."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/233217?rskey=m8A5At&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false# OED.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/macabre Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2 Maccabees]], a [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of the [[Bible]], the grim [[martyr]]dom of a [[woman with seven sons|mother and her seven sons]] is described and was a well-known mediaeval subject. It is possible that the Maccabean Martyrs were commemorated in some early French plays or that people just associated the book's vivid descriptions of the martyrdom with the interaction between Death and its prey.

An alternative explanation is that the term entered France via Spain, the {{lang-ar |مقابر}}, ''maqabir'' (cemetery) being the root of the word. Both the dialogues and the evolving paintings were ostensive penitential lessons that even illiterate people (who were the overwhelming majority) could understand.

==Frescoes==
[[Fresco]]es and murals dealing with death had a long tradition and were widespread, e.g. the legend of the Three Living and the Three Dead: on a ride or hunt, three young gentlemen meet three cadavers (sometimes described as their ancestors) who warn them, ''Quod fuimus, estis; quod sumus, vos eritis'' (What we were, you are; what we are, you will be). Numerous mural versions of that legend from the 13th century onwards have survived (for instance, in the [[:de:Heiligen-Geist-Hospital (Wismar)|Hospital Church]] of [[Wismar]] or the residential [[Longthorpe Tower]] outside [[Peterborough]]). Since they showed pictorial sequences of men and corpses covered with shrouds, those paintings are sometimes regarded as cultural precursors of the new genre.

A ''danse macabre'' painting may show a round dance headed by Death or a chain of alternating dead and live dancers. From the highest ranks of the mediaeval hierarchy (usually [[pope]] and [[emperor]]) descending to its lowest (beggar, peasant, and child), each mortal's hand is taken by a skeleton or an extremely decayed body. The famous ''Totentanz'' by Bernt Notke in [[St. Mary's Church, Lübeck]] (destroyed during the Allied [[bombing of Lübeck in World War II]]), presented the dead dancers as very lively and agile, making the impression that they were actually dancing, whereas their living dancing partners looked clumsy and passive. The apparent class distinction in almost all of these paintings is completely neutralized by Death as the ultimate equalizer, so that a sociocritical element is subtly inherent to the whole genre. The ''Totentanz'' of [[Metnitz]], for example, shows how a pope crowned with his [[mitre]] is being led into Hell by the dancing Death.

{{Wide image|Totentanz LübeckR.jpg|2000px|''Lübecker Totentanz'' by [[Bernt Notke]] (around 1463, destroyed in a bombing raid in 1942)|alt=A mural depicting a chain of alternating living and dead dancers}}

Usually, a short dialogue is attached to each victim, in which Death is summoning him (or, more rarely, her) to dance and the summoned is moaning about impending death. In the first printed ''Totentanz'' textbook (Anon.: Vierzeiliger oberdeutscher Totentanz, Heidelberger Blockbuch, approx. 1460), Death addresses, for example, the emperor:
[[File:Bernt Notke Danse Macabre.jpg|thumb|500px|Bernt Notke: ''Surmatants'' (''Totentanz'') in [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn]].]]  
[[File:Totentanz in Hrastovlje.JPG|thumb|The famous Danse Macabre in [[Hrastovlje]] in the [[Holy Trinity Church (Hrastovlje)|Holy Trinity Church]]]]

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Emperor, your sword won't help you out
Sceptre and crown are worthless here
I've taken you by the hand
For you must come to my dance
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

At the lower end of the ''Totentanz'', Death calls, for example, the peasant to dance, who answers:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I had to work very much and very hard
The sweat was running down my skin
I'd like to escape death nonetheless
But here I won't have any luck
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

}}{{anchor|Holbein}}The famous designs by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (1497–1543) for his Dance of Death series were drawn in 1526 while he was in [[Basel]].  They were cut in wood by the accomplished [[Formschneider]] (block cutter) [[Hans Lützelburger]].  William Ivins (quoting W.J. Linton) writes of Lützelburger's work: "'Nothing indeed, by knife or by graver, is of higher quality than this man's doing,' for by common acclaim the originals are technically the most marvelous woodcuts ever made." &lt;ref&gt;Ivins, p.234.&lt;/ref&gt;  These woodcuts soon appeared in proofs with titles in German.  The first book edition, containing forty-one woodcuts, was published at Lyons by the Treschsel brothers in 1538.  The popularity of the work and the currency of its message are underscored by the fact that there were eleven editions before 1562 and over the sixteenth century perhaps as many as a hundred unauthorized editions and imitations.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1947), p.32&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten further designs were added in later editions.

The ''Dance of Death'' (1523–26) refashions the late-medieval [[allegory]] of the ''danse macabre'' as a reformist satire, and one can see the beginnings of a gradual shift from traditional to reformed religion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 96–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  That shift had many permutations however, and in a thoroughly detailed study Natalie Zemon Davis has shown that the contemporary reception and afterlife of Holbein's designs lent themselves to neither purely Catholic or Protestant doctrine, but could be outfitted with different surrounding prefaces and sermons as printers and writers of different political and religious leanings took them up.  Most importantly, it was "The pictures and the Bible quotations above them were the main attractions ... Both Catholics and Protestants wished, through the pictures, to turn men's thoughts to a Christian preparation for death.".&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1538 edition which contained Latin quotations from the Bible above Holbein's designs, and a French quatrain below composed by [[Gilles Corrozet]], actually did not credit Holbein as the artist.  It bore the title: Les simulachres &amp; / HISTORIEES FACES / DE LA MORT, AUTANT ELE/gammēt pourtraictes, que artifi/ciellement imaginées. / A Lyon. / Soubz l'escu de COLOIGNE. / M.D. XXXVIII. ("Images and Illustrated facets of Death, as elegantly depicted as they are artfully conceived.")&lt;ref&gt;See External links to access to this work, including English translation, online.&lt;/ref&gt;  These images and workings of death as captured in the phrase "historiees faces" of the title "are the particular exemplification of the way death works, the individual scenes in which the lessons of mortality are brought home to people of every station." &lt;ref&gt;Gundersheimer, introduction, p.xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his preface to the work Jean de Vauzèle, the Prior of Montrosier, addresses Jehanne de Tourzelle, the Abbess of the Convent at St. Peter at Lyons, and names Holbein's attempts to capture the ever-present, but never directly seen, abstract images of death "simulachres."  He writes: "... simulachres les dis ie vrayement, pour ce que simulachre vient de simuler, &amp; faindre ce que n'est point." ("Simulachre they are most correctly called, for simulachre derives from the verb to simulate and to feign that which is not really there.")  He next employs a trope from the [[memento mori]] (remember we all must die) tradition and a metaphor from printing which well captures the undertakings of Death, the artist, and the printed book before us in which these simulachres of death barge in on the living: "Et pourtant qu'on n'a peu trouver chose plus approchante a la similitude de Mort, que la personne morte, on d'icelle effigie simulachres, &amp; faces de Mort, pour en nos pensees imprimer la memoire de Mort plus au vis, que ne pourroient toutes les rhetoriques descriptiones de orateurs." &lt;ref&gt;As reproduced in Gundersheimer, 1971. p.5. Register Aiii of original.&lt;/ref&gt; ("And yet we cannot discover any one thing more near the likeness of Death than the dead themselves, whence come these simulated effigies and images of Death's affairs, which imprint the memory of Death with more force than all the rhetorical descriptions of the orators ever could.").

[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 37.jpg|right|thumb|Hans Holbein, Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte.  In Lyone Appresso.  Giovan Frellone, M.D. XLIX. (1549)]]

Holbein's series shows the figure of "Death" in many disguises, confronting individuals from all walks of life. None escape Death's skeletal clutches, not even the pious.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 56–58, and Landau &amp; Parshall, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Davis writes, "Holbein's pictures are independent dramas in which Death comes upon his victim in the midst of the latter's own surroundings and activities.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p.101&lt;/ref&gt;  This is perhaps nowhere more strikingly captured than in the wonderful blocks showing the plowman earning his bread by the sweat of his brow only to have his horses speed him to his end by Death.  The Latin from the 1549 Italian edition pictured here reads: "In sudore vultus tui, vesceris pane tuo." ("Through the sweat of thy brow you shall eat your bread"), quoting Genesis 3.19.  The Italian verses below translate: ("Miserable in the sweat of your brow,/ It is necessary that you acquire the bread you need eat,/ But, may it not displease you to come with me,/ If you are desirous of rest.").   Or there is the nice balance in composition Holbein achieves between the heavy-laden traveling salesman insisting that he must still go to market while Death tugs at his sleeve to put down his wares once and for all: "Venite ad me, qui onerati estis." ("Come to me, all ye who [labor and] are heavy laden"), quoting Matthew 11.28.  The Italian here translates: ("Come with me, wretch, who are weighed down,/ Since I am the dame who rules the whole world:/ Come and hear my advice,/ Because I wish to lighten you of this load.").&lt;ref&gt;Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte.

=="Death and the Maiden" and other allusions==
The motif ''[[Death and the Maiden (motif)|Death and the Maiden]]'', is related to, and may have been derived from, the ''Danse Macabre''. It has received numerous treatments in various media—most prominently Schubert's quartet of that name. Further developments of the ''Danse Macabre'' motif include ''[[Death and the King's Horseman]]'', "[[Death and the Senator]]", "[[Death and the Compass]]", and ''Death and the Physician''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">'''EIAJ MTS''' is a multichannel television sound standard created by the [[EIAJ]].

Bilingual and stereo sound television programs started being broadcast in Japan in October 1978 using a system developed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories|NHK Technical Research Labs]]. This system was modified and standardized by the EIAJ in January 1979. 

The original version M TV standard has a monaural FM transmission at 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz. For Japanese multichannel television sound a second channel, or sub-channel, is added to the original signal by using an FM sub-carrier at twice the line frequency (Fh, or 15374&amp;nbsp;Hz). In order to identify the different modes (mono, stereo, or dual sound) a [[pilot tone]] is also added on an AM carrier at 3.5 times the line frequency. The pilot tone frequencies are 982.5&amp;nbsp;Hz for stereo and 922.5&amp;nbsp;Hz for dual sound. Contrary to [[Zweikanalton]] these pilot tones are not coupled to the line frequency but were instead chosen to allow use of filters already employed in the Pocket Bell [[pager]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Numaguchi|first=Yasutaka|title=Present Status of Multichannel-Sound Television Broadcasting in Japan|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|date=December 1979|volume=BC-25|issue=4|pages=128–136|doi=10.1109/TBC.1979.266340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Villages have members, to whom they provide services upon request.  Services offered typically include transportation, light home maintenance and repair, and social activities.  Most Villages do not provide medical services or involved home maintenance, but provide referrals to those who do.

==History==

The first formal Village was founded in the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood of [[Boston]] in 2001.&lt;ref name = "Gross07"&gt;Jane Gross, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/health/14aging.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1368796652-drkDpZ+iqzgT3gQJD6Dc9w A Grass-Roots Effort to Grow Old at Home]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 14, 2007; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ElNasser"&gt;Haya El Nasser, [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-07-26-aging26_ST_N.htm?c.. 'Villages' let elderly grow old at home], ''USA Today'', July 26, 2010; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately one dozen residents of the historic neighborhood wanted "[[aging in place|to remain at home]]" once transportation and household chores became difficult, dangerous, or even impossible. They also wished to avoid becoming dependent on their children, but did not want to move to an old-age facility.  They founded an organization to provide these services to the organization's members, who must live in Beacon Hill or the adjacent Back Bay neighborhood.&lt;ref name = "Gross06"&gt;Jane Gross, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/garden/09care.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Aging at Home: For a Lucky Few, a Wish Come True]" ''The New York Times'', February 9, 2006; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result has been called an "[[intentional community]]"&lt;ref name = "Span"&gt;Paula Span, "[http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/roommates-of-a-certain-age/ Sharing a Table, and Much More]", ''The New York Times'', October 15, 2010; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt; or a "virtual [[retirement community]]".&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"&gt;Barbara Whitaker, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/business/yourmoney/06retire.html?_r=0 These Days, 'Retirement Living' Can Mean Many Things]", ''The New York Times'', February 6, 2005; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization grew slowly, learning from its mistakes.&lt;ref name = "Gross06" /&gt;  After four years in existence, Beacon Hill Village was the subject of an article in ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref name = "Whitaker" /&gt; and the idea spread.  Beacon Hill Village prepared a how-to manual for sale to those who would found other Villages.&lt;ref name = "Gross06" /&gt;  By 2010, there were more than 50 Villages in the United States.&lt;ref name = "ElNasser" /&gt;  As of 2012, there were some 90 Villages in operation in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands, with more than 120 other Villages in the formation process.&lt;ref name = "VtVAbout"&gt;Village to Village Network, "[http://www.vtvnetwork.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=691012&amp;module_id=65139 About VtV Network]"; accessed 2013.05.18.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2018, the idea had spread as far as South Korea and Finland.&lt;ref name = "BGlobe"&gt;Robert Weisman, "[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/07/07/volunteer-movement-becomes-more-vital-for-older-mass-residents/yeCQS3L6ITCfZY4Y55nAyI/story.html For some seniors, a cultural shift and a vital volunteerism]", ''The Boston Globe'', July  7, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Operation==
A Village tends to be formed as a [[non-profit corporation]], with members, directors, and officers.&lt;ref name = "Rutgers"&gt;

Villages are largely funded through membership dues and fees, on the one hand, and donations and grants, on the other.&lt;ref name = "ElNasser" /&gt; Some 90% of American Villages charge dues
,&lt;ref name = "2016Surv"&gt;Carrie L. Graham, Andrew E. Scharlach, Roscoe Nicholson, and Catherine O’Brien, ''[http://socialwelfare.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/MLIA_VillagesSurveyBriefFEB17_FNL.pdf 2016 National Survey of US Villages]'' University of California, Berkeley, Center for the Advanced Study of Aging Services &amp; Mather LifeWays Institute on Aging, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} but some charge no dues.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt;  They provide such services as transportation, grocery delivery, light home repairs, and dog walking, as well as organizing social activities.&lt;ref name = "ElNasser" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "VtVFAQ"&gt;Village to Village Network, "[http://www.vtvnetwork.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=691012&amp;module_id=70769 Frequently Asked Questions]"; accessed 2013.05.18.&lt;/ref&gt; They typically pool the resources of a community in providing services.&lt;ref name = "Span" /&gt;  Most Villages do not provide medical services or involved home maintenance, but provide referrals to those who do.&lt;ref name = "Mandhana"&gt;Niharika Mandhana, [http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/growing-older-in-an-urban-village/ Growing Older in an Urban Village], ''The New York Times'', August 15, 2011. accessed 2013.05.18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Village staff and volunteers might select and screen these outside providers, and can help coordinate members' appointments with them.&lt;ref name = "Evans"&gt;Robin Evans, [http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Senior-villages-that-help-elderly-stay-at-home-3235090.php Senior villages that help elderly stay at home come to West Coast], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Dec. 12, 2007; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Providers so identified may offer their services to Village members at reduced rates.&lt;ref name = "McGlade"&gt;Caitlin McGlade, [http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2010/08/30/for-elderly-at-home-it-takes-a-village.html For elderly at home, it takes a 'village'], ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'', August 30, 2010; accessed 2013.05.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Villages tend to operate on one of three models.  The first, pioneered in the 1990s by Community Without Walls in [[Princeton, N.J.]], has numerous members, each of whom belongs to one of a number of "houses". Annual dues are very low or non-existent, and much of the activity of such a group is social.  Nearly all services are provided by volunteers. Members pay additional dues for further assistance and services needed.  The second form delivers both volunteer and paid help.  Dues are higher (and often subsidized for low-income members), and the level of services (which are typically provided without additional charge) tends to be more comprehensive.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt; This has been termed the "classic village model".&lt;ref name = "Moeller" /&gt;  A third model amounts to being a service exchange.  One member might pick up groceries for a neighbor; a second volunteer might then fix the first's leaky faucet.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt;  Historically, Villages have tended to operate in urban areas, with significant concentrations of both service providers and recipients, but they are spreading.&lt;ref name = "Bernstein"&gt;Nell Bernstein, [http://www.caring.com/blogs/caring-currents/elder-villages-independence-community-seniors Elder Villages Offer Independence Plus Community], Caring.com; updated Oct. 21, 2008; accessed 2013.05.17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many experts believe that the second model, with both paid staff and volunteers, has the most widespread applicability.&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt;  Currently, Villages are largely found in [[middle-class]] and upper-income neighborhoods; the movement has received some criticism for its perceived failure to reach more diverse communities to date.&lt;ref name = "Mandhana" /&gt;  The [[Washington, D.C.]], area, with its large proportion of people who moved from elsewhere and thus do not have a local family network, has a particularly high concentration of Villages;&lt;ref name = "Gleckman" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pianin1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tara Bahrampour, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/through-a-growing-number-of-senior-villages-in-the-dc-area-aging-in-place-becomes-easier/2014/02/06/e51fc660-7fbf-11e3-9556-4a4bf7bcbd84_story.html Through a growing number of senior villages in the D.C. area, aging in place becomes easier], ''The Washington Post'', Feb. 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the District of Columbia Office on Aging has a Web page dedicated to "Senior Villages" and has produced a "how to" guide for establishing a new Village.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Office on Aging, "[http://dcoa.dc.gov/service/senior-villages Senior Villages]"; accessed 2015.10.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of sustainability, with the related issue of growth, has arisen in a number of Villages.  In some, the founders have been surprised at the difficulty they experience in their efforts to expand membership beyond the initial group, which can impair efforts to grow the membership to the point at which a Village can become self-sustaining.  Many people approached by a Village do not feel ready to join, while the people most in need of a Village's services are less likely to hear about them.&lt;ref name = "Mandhana" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pianin1"&gt;Alex Pianin, [http://www.currentnewspapers.com/admin/uploadfiles/NW%2002-27-2013%201.pdf Cleveland Park gym spotlights senior athletes in photo display]", ''The Northwest Current'', Feb. 27, 2013, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Villages may share ideas and experiences through the Village to Village ("VtV") network.&lt;ref name = "VtVFAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mandhana" /&gt;  VtV was established in 2010 by Beacon Hill Village and [[NCB Capital Impact|Capital Impact]] in response to requests from a number of Villages.  At the end of 2014, Capital Impact withdrew from the partnership and in March 2015, the organization, formally organized as a limited liability company, was converted to a corporation, named Village to Village Network, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Village to Village Network [http://vtvnetwork.org/ homepage]; accessed 2015.04.20.&lt;/ref&gt;  It serves as a clearinghouse for inter-Village communications, and provides information to help communities establish and operate their own Villages.&lt;ref name = "VtVFAQ" /&gt;  It further organizes an annual meeting, the National Village Gathering, at which local Village officers and staffers may meet those from other Villages to share information and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Village to Village Network, "[http://www.vtvnetwork.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=691012&amp;module_id=156268 The 2014 National Village Gathering]"; accessed 2014.09.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--this paragraph seems somewhat out of place, if not redundant and maybe self-congratulatory--&gt;The Beacon Hill Village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beacon Hill Village|url=http://www.beaconhillvillage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in Boston began as a community of older adults joining forces to create "programs and services that will enable them to live at home, remaining independent as long as possible."  The ‘Village’ model for aging in place is based on the Beacon Hill Village established in Boston in 2001. The ‘Village’ model is a grassroots, consumer driven, and volunteer first model.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"&gt;McDonough, K. E., &amp; Davitt, J. K. (2011). It takes a village: Community practice, social work, and aging-in-place. Journal of Gerontological Social Work, 54(5), 528-541.&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘Village’ is a self-governed organization of older adults who have identified their desire to age in place.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt; The model relies on informal network of community members.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt; Volunteers are the backbone of the model, while the ‘Village’ staff is responsible for administration including vetting, training, and management of volunteers.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt; Vendors provide home health care and professional home repairs.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt; Volunteers provide transportation, shopping, household chores, gardening, and light home maintenance.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt; The ‘Village’ model relies on the collective abilities of the community to respond to challenges face in the aging process.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt; The ‘Village’ also works to build a shared sense of community through social activities including potluck dinners, book clubs, and educational programs.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt;  {{as of|2010}}, there were over 50 fully operational ‘Villages’ and nearly 149 in the developmental stage.&lt;ref name="McDonough, K. E. 2011"/&gt;  By 2015, the Village to Village Network had 251 member organizations, accounting for approximately 25,000 service-receiving members.&lt;ref&gt;"Village to Village Network Moves Headquarters to St. Louis: Local Executive to Lead International Senior Resource Organization", press release, January 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Spatial Development Perspective''' (ESDP) is a document approved by the Informal Council of Ministers of Spatial Planning of [[European Commission]] in [[Potsdam]] in 1999. It is a legally non-binding document forming a policy framework with 60 policy options for all tiers of [[Administration (business)|administration]] with a planning responsibility. The [[strategic]] aim is to achieve a balanced and [[sustainable]] [[spatial development]] strategy.

== Key concepts ==
With the aim to provide an [[Regional integration|integrated]], multi-sectoral and indicative [[strategy]] for the [[spatial development]], the key ideas of ESDP are: 
* an integrated approach - Not just to look at specific sectors of development activity (e.g. environment, economic development, or transport), but to recognise that they all affect each other; 
* spatial development - a much wider view of the development, vital for integrative approach; 
* strategic aspects - interlinked actions to achieve balanced and sustainable territorial development; 
* indicative views - the responsibility lies with the developed regions and territories to implement the development principals.

== Spatial policy guidelines ==
# Development of a [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] and balanced urban system, and strengthening of the partnership between urban and rural areas, so as to create a new urban-rural relationship.
# Promotion of integrated transport and communication concepts, which support the polycentric development of the EU territory, so that there is gradual progress towards parity of access to infrastructure and knowledge. 
# Wise management of the natural and cultural heritage, which will help conserve regional identities and cultural diversity in the face of globalisation.

[[File:Ingres - Paolo and Francesca.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Francesca da Rimini#In Inferno|Paolo and Francesca]], whom [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']] describes as [[damnation|damned]] for fornication. ([[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], 1819)]]

'''Fornication''' is generally consensual [[sexual intercourse]] between two people not married to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fornication|url=http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?book=Student&amp;va=fornication|work=Student Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=15 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225430/http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?book=Student&amp;va=fornication|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionaries on fornication"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fornication|accessdate = 25 November 2013|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|url =http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fornication}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one of the partners to consensual sexual intercourse is a married person, it may be described as [[adultery]].

For many people, the term carries an overtone of moral or religious disapproval, but the significance of sexual acts to which the term is applied varies between religions, societies and cultures. In modern usage, the term is often replaced with a more [[Value judgment|judgment]]-neutral term like ''[[extramarital sex]]''.

== Etymology and usage ==
In the original [[Greek language|Greek]] version of the New Testament, the Greek term ''porneia'' (πορνεία) (or its variants) is used 25 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_4202.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 4202. πορνεία (porneia) – 25 Occurrences|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712030625/http://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_4202.htm|archivedate=12 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Porneia'' meant prostitution, a usage still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=30 April 2017|title=Πορνεία|url=https://el.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%CE%A0%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%B1&amp;oldid=6378124|journal=Βικιπαίδεια|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 4th century, the [[Vulgate|Latin Vulgate]], a Latin translation of the Greek texts, translated the term as fornicati, fornicatus, fornicata, and fornicatae. The 1611 [[King James Version]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Matthew 5:32]] for usage of the word in English Bibles.&lt;/ref&gt; used the term fornication. Other translations have used terms such as ''whoredom'', ''[[sexual immorality]]'' (e.g., {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:9|ESV}}) or simply ''immorality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/591-the-english-standard-version |title=The English Standard Version |publisher=Christian Courier |accessdate=2 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204075220/https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/591-the-english-standard-version |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/porneia.html |title=The Greek Lexicon |publisher=BibleStudyTools.com |accessdate=4 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223716/http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/porneia.html |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Latin, the term ''fornix'' means arch or [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]. [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|In Ancient Rome, prostitutes]] waited for their customers out of the rain under vaulted ceilings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Gorman|first=James F.|title=ABC of Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzc6vh680FMC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=15 February 2013|year=1998|publisher=U of Pennsylvania P|isbn=978-0-8122-1631-8|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''fornix'' became a euphemism for brothels, and the Latin verb ''fornicare'' referred to a man visiting a brothel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Rome in So Many Words|author=Christopher Francese|page=146|publisher=Hippocrene Books|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gl5T47CvuDsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC|title=The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories|year=1991|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fornix, n. |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |year=2001 |isbn=&lt;!-- 0198611862 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use in English is in the ''[[Cursor Mundi]]'', c. 1300; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) records a figurative use as well: "The forsaking of God for idols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fornication, n.1 |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |year=2001 |isbn=&lt;!-- 0198611862 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fornicated'' as an adjective is still used in botany, meaning "arched" or "bending over" (as in a leaf). [[John Milton]] plays on the double meaning of the word in ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]'' (1642): "[She] gives up her body to a mercenary whordome under those ''fornicated [ar]ches'' which she cals Gods house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fornicated, adj. |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |year=2001 |isbn=&lt;!-- 0198611862 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian views ==
{{See also|Extramarital sex#Religions|Adultery#Abrahamic |Extramarital sex#Christianity|Adultery#Christianity}}

=== Generalities ===
The [[Pauline epistles]] contain multiple condemnations of various forms of extramarital sex. The [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] states "Flee from sexual immorality" and lists adulterers and "those who are sexually immoral"/practicing-fornicators in a list of "wrongdoers who... will not inherit the kingdom of God". {{Bibleref2c|1Cor|6:9|NIV|1 Corinthians 6:9}}{{Bibleref2c|1Co|6:18|NIV|1 Cor 6:18}} First Corinthians and the [[Epistle to the Galatians]] also address ''fornication''.{{Bibleref2c|Galatians|5:19}}{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|7:2|NIV|1 Corinthians 7:2}} The ''Apostolic Decree'' of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] also includes a prohibition of ''fornication''.

Throughout history, most theologians have argued that any and all forms of premarital sex are immoral. An historical example is the medieval English monastic, [[John Baconthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Premarital Sex: the Theological Argument from Peter Lombard to Durand |author=John F. Dedek |journal=[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |date=December 1980 |pages=643–667 |url=http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/41/41.4/41.4.1.pdf |doi=10.1177/004056398004100401 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204221155/http://cdn.theologicalstudies.net/41/41.4/41.4.1.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more contemporary example is the modern-day theologian Lee Gatiss who argues that premarital sex is immoral based on scripture. He states that, from a Biblical perspective, "physical union should not take place outside a "one flesh" (i.e. marriage) union... In [1 Corinthians] chapter 7 Paul addresses the situation of two unmarried Christians who are burning with passion (7:8–9) who should either exercise self-control or be permitted to marry (cf. verses 36–38). The underlying assumptions are the same as those in Deuteronomy 22."&lt;ref name="theologian.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Issue of Pre-Marital Sex |author=Lee Gatiss |publisher=The Theologian |year=2005 |url=http://www.theologian.org.uk/pastoralia/premartialsex.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324021344/http://www.theologian.org.uk/pastoralia/premartialsex.html |archivedate=24 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a minority of theologians have argued in more recent times that premarital sex may not be immoral in some limited circumstances. An example is John Witte, who argues that the Bible itself is silent on the issue of consensual, premarital sex between an engaged couple.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IlWH2jHaj1YC&amp;pg=PA416&amp;lpg=PA416&amp;dq=calvin+premarital+sex#v=onepage&amp;q=calvin%20premarital%20sex&amp;f=false|title=Sex, Marriage, and Family in John Calvin's Geneva: Courtship, Engagement, and Marriage|isbn=978-0-8028-4803-1|author1=Witte|first1=John|year=2005 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Witte claims that the Bible excludes premarital sex from its list of unlawful sexual relations (Leviticus 18) though Leviticus 18 is not the only such list, nor does Leviticus 18 claim to be exhaustive being devoted largely to forms of incest.

Some of the debate arises from the question of which theological approach is being applied. A [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] view of sex interprets porneia, aselgeia and akatharsia in terms of whether the couple are married or non-married. What makes sex moral or immoral is the context of marriage. By contrast, a [[Teleology|teleological]] view interprets porneia, aselgeia and akatharsia in terms of the quality of the relationship (how well it reflects God's glory and Christian notions of a committed, virtuous relationship.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.campbell.edu/faculty/vandergriffk/ethics_sexuality.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150311120239/http://web.campbell.edu/faculty/vandergriffk/ethics_sexuality.html |archivedate=11 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate also turns on the definition of the two Greek words ''moicheia'' (μοιχεία, adultery) and ''porneia'' ([[:el:πορνεία]], with meaning of prostitution, from which the word pornography is derived). The first word is restricted to contexts involving sexual betrayal of a spouse; however, the second word is used as a generic term for illegitimate sexual activity, although many scholars hold that the [[Septuagint]] uses "porneia" to refer specifically to male [[temple prostitution]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Elsewhere in First Corinthians, [[incest]], homosexual intercourse (according to some interpretations)&lt;ref&gt;''arsenokoitēs'' (masc. noun of fem. 1st declension), literally a man who shares a bed with other men (see [[LSJ]] and [[BDAG]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and prostitution are all explicitly forbidden by name.

Paul is preaching about activities based on sexual prohibitions laid out in [[Leviticus]] in the context of achieving holiness. One theory therefore suggests that it is these behaviours, and only these, that are intended by Paul's prohibition in chapter seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koltun-Fromm|first=Naomi|title=Hermeneutics of Holiness: Syriac- Christian and Rabbinic Notions of Holy Community and Sexuality|url=http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/symposiums/11th/papers/FrommHoliness.doc|accessdate=3 August 2013|format=.doc|date=April 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525215607/http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/symposiums/11th/papers/FrommHoliness.doc|archivedate=25 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most mainstream Christian sources believe that porneia encompasses all forms of premarital sex. For instance, in defining ''porneia''/fornication, Kittel and Friedrich's 1977 ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'' states that "The NT is characterized by an unconditional repudiation of all extra-marital and unnatural intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, G (ed): ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament'', Volume VI, pages 579–95&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Friberg's ''Analytical Lexicon to the Greek New Testament'' defines ''porneia'' as being "generally, every kind of extramarital, unlawful or unnatural sexual intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;Friberg, T: ''Analytical Lexicon to the Greek New Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

Lee Gatiss also argues that ''porneia'' encompasses all forms of premarital sex. He states that "the word 'fornication' has gone out of fashion and is not in common use to describe non-marital sex. However, it is an excellent translation for porneia, which basically referred to any kind of sex outside of marriage ... This has been contested ... but the overwhelming weight of scholarship and all the available evidence from the ancient world points firmly in this direction. "Flee sexual immorality (porneia) and pursue self-control" (cf. 1 Thess 4:1–8) was the straightforward message to Christians in a sex-crazed world."&lt;ref name="theologian.org.uk" /&gt;

=== Jesus and the early Church ===
Attitudes towards marriage and sexuality at the time of Jesus stemmed from a blend of Roman and Jewish ideas. For instance, during the lifetime of Jesus, there was a strong social disapproval among Romans of [[polygamy]]. This made its way into Judaism and early Christianity, despite the Old Testament portraying examples of this behaviour among patriarchs and kings.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Church in Wales and Same-Sex Partnerships |date=March 2014 |publisher=The Standing Doctrinal Commission of the Church in Wales |url=http://cinw.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SameSexPartnership_DocComm-English.doc |accessdate=30 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006080935/http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SameSexPartnership_DocComm-English.doc |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish marriage in the time of Jesus was a two-stage process. First, there was a betrothal in which the man claimed the woman to be his only bride. Secondly, there was the marriage contract that specified what the bride and groom's families would give the couple and what the bride would obtain if she divorced. "At the time of Jesus, and in rural areas like Galilee, a young couple might well cohabit before the contract was signed 'in order to get acquainted'. The betrothal was held to be enough of a marriage that a divorce would be needed if the couple split up between betrothal and contract."&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;


The early Church's statements on marital affairs mainly concerned acceptable reasons for divorce and remarriage. Whilst Paul, in his epistles to early believers, emphasised that both celibacy and marriage were good forms of life, after his life the Church felt that celibacy was more virtuous and liberating. This focus came about because the early church was very ascetic, possibly due to the influence of Greek philosophical thought. The focus on celibacy meant that other issues relating to sexual morality for the non-celibate remained under-developed.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]]'s views strongly influenced how later Christians thought about sex. Before becoming a Christian, he had taken a concubine in defiance of his (Christian) mother's anxious warning to him "not to commit fornication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/7/1/2.html|title=The Second Book. Augustine, Saint. 1909–14. The Confessions of St. Augustine. The Harvard Classics.|author=|date=|work=bartleby.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216054532/http://www.bartleby.com/7/1/2.html|archivedate=16 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Though sinful in acting out his erotic desires, Augustine gives himself some credit, writing that "the single desire that dominated my search for delight was simply to love and be loved.""&lt;ref name="sparknotes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/confessionsaug/section2.rhtml|title=SparkNotes: Confessions: Book II|author=|date=|work=sparknotes.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927065025/http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/confessionsaug/section2.rhtml|archivedate=27 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting much later, he believed that the problem was that his love had "no restraint imposed [on it] by the exchange of mind with mind." Hence, pure love was perverted by its misdirection toward lust whereas a Godly relationship should focus on a loving, rational partnership instead.&lt;ref name="sparknotes.com"/&gt;

In his later writings, Augustine was "deeply suspicious of sexual passion" and this has influenced the outlook of all the major Christian denominations down to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Church told to rethink bar on sex before marriage |author=[[Ruth Gledhill]] |date=31 March 2003 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1908115.ece}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine considered fornication to have two definitions: the first was "cleaving to a prostitute" and the second, broader and more precise one was "what men who do not have wives do with women who do not have husbands".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GcVhAGpvTQ0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=augustine%20fornication&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j7vsL4YEfB&amp;sig=OaiBx9wwHZbO3niy6msNsnwNpt8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8tqqzyKvPAhVBQJQKHWasDeQQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=augustine%20fornication&amp;f=false|title=Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia|first1=Allan|last1=Fitzgerald|first2=John C.|last2=Cavadini|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed fornicators were sinful because they corrupted their own selves, their image of God and the temple of God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

=== Mainstream Protestantism ===

==== Lutheranism ====
According to Susan C. Karant-Nunn and Merry E.

On another occasion, Luther wrote, "I... pass over the good or evil which experience offers, and confine myself to such good as Scripture and truth ascribe to marriage. It is no slight boon that in wedlock fornication and unchastity are checked and eliminated. This in itself is so great a good that it alone should be enough to induce men to marry forthwith, and for many reasons... The first reason is that fornication destroys not only the soul but also body, property, honor, and family as well. For we see how a licentious and wicked life not only brings great disgrace but is also a spendthrift life, more costly than wedlock, and that illicit partners necessarily occasion greater suffering for one another than do married folk. Beyond that it consumes the body, corrupts flesh and blood, nature, and physical constitution. Through such a variety of evil consequences God takes a rigid position, as though he would actually drive people away from fornication and into marriage. However, few are thereby convinced or converted."&lt;ref&gt;Luther's Works volume 45:43&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring this matter in more depth when writing on 1 Thessalonians 4:3–5, Luther advises, "All young people should avoid casual sex and preserve their purity. They should resolve to strengthen themselves against lust and sexual passions by reading and meditating on a psalm or some other portion of God's Word... If your sexual appetites continually tempt you, be patient. Resist them as long as necessary, even if it takes more than a year. But above all, keep praying! If you feel that you can't stand it any longer, pray that God will give you a devout spouse with whom you can live in harmony and true love... I have known many people who, because of their crude and shameful fantasies, indulged their passion with unrestrained lust. Because of their insatiable desires, they abandoned self control, and lapsed into terrible immorality. In the end, they had to endure dreadful punishment. Blinded to the realities of married life, some of them took unsuitable mates and ended up in incompatible relationships. They got what they deserved. You must pray diligently and strive to resist the desires of your corrupt nature. Ask God to give you a Rebekah or Isaac instead of a Delilah or Samson-or someone even worse. Finding a devoted, loyal wife or husband isn’t a matter of good luck. It’s not the result of good judgment, as unbelievers think. Rather, a devout spouse is a gift from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wpwHNEQ-O44C&amp;pg=PT106&amp;lpg=PT106&amp;dq=luther%20crude%20and%20shameful%20fantasies%20indulged&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1lY96K6n5b&amp;sig=KIUYVFdTyq-xiqLJ3JmWYanMbqY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7xsXBis3PAhXENpQKHaz-CTEQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=luther%20crude%20and%20shameful%20fantasies%20indulged&amp;f=false|title=Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional|first=Martin|last=Luther|date=26 May 2009|publisher=Zondervan|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther however, in contrast to his Roman Catholic opponents, believed that it was not the Church's business to define marriage law. He understood marriage to be a legal agreement rather than a sacrament.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt; He stated that marriage was instituted by God but its regulation was the business of the State, not the Church. Luther defined marriage as "the God-appointed and legitimate union of man and woman in the hope of having children or at least for the purpose of avoiding fornication and sin and living to the glory of God. The ultimate purpose is to obey God, to find aid and counsel against sin; to call upon God; to seek, love, and educate children for the glory of God; to live with one's wife in the fear of God and to bear the cross..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Luther, Marriage, Church &amp; State |author=Rev.

[[Martin Bucer]] argued that sexual intimacy belonged in marriage and that, in marriage, the man becomes "the head and saviour of the wife and forms one flesh with her in order to avoid fornication and that the wife is the body and help of her husband, again to avoid fornication". Marriage for him, though, not only meant the avoidance of sin and procreation of children but social and emotional bonding resulting in a fellowship.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;{{cite book |title=Marriage and Divorce in the Thought of Martin Bucer |author=H.

Marriage... [is] the context in which sexual intimacy should have its place... Marriage is, after all, the only framework within which sexual desires can be legitimately satisfied."&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au" /&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]], who was raised as a [[Pietist]], considered sex before marriage to be immoral. He argued that sexual desire objectifies the person you crave and, since no [[categorical imperative|logically consistent ethical rule]] allows you to use a person as an object, it is immoral to have sex (outside marriage). Marriage makes the difference because, in marriage, the two people give all of themselves to create a union and, thus, now have rights over each other as each now belongs to the other. As Kant himself puts it, "The sole condition on which we are free to make use of our sexual desires depends upon the right to dispose over the person as a whole – over the welfare and happiness and generally over all the circumstances of that person… each of them... [are obliged] to surrender the whole of their person to the other with a complete right to disposal over it."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I: ''Lectures on Ethics''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

Today, the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]] asserts that premarital sex is sinful. It believes that sexual activity belongs within the marriage relationship only and that the practice of pre-marital sex is in "violation of the will of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Attitude to Birth Control|url=https://lca.box.net/shared/static/ltyczvrxb3ovdrsk2p8s.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2013|pages=1–2|format=PDF|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, pastors of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod undertook a survey on premarital sex among their congregations in 2010. "These Lutheran pastors reported that over 57 percent of the couples they now marry are living together prior to the wedding, and that the rate of cohabitation in their congregations is increasing." Despite this trend, the Synod believes that "Regardless of the reasons given for living together, cohabitation is simply wrong for Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergmann|first=Rev.

The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) takes the view that "Any use of the gift of sex aside from the marriage bond is adultery, whether this is premarital or extramarital ... To engage in premarital or extramarital sex, before or outside of marriage, is to sin in God's sight. That is precisely the point of Hebrews 13:4, a verse often referred to in this kind of discussion. "Marriage" and the marriage bed ... go together and are to be kept pure. Using the "bed" aside from "marriage" is sin that God will judge... The counsel given in 1 Corinthians 7:9 makes the same point. If a person has sexual urges and the sex drive (a good gift from God in itself) expresses itself within a person, that person has a God-pleasing remedy identified: to be married and thus obtain the right to be sexually active. Before or outside of marriage, sinful lust is sinful lust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wels.net/faq/bible-and-premarital-sex/|title=Bible and Premarital sex|author=|date=|work=wels.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020213657/http://wels.net/faq/bible-and-premarital-sex/|archivedate=20 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere on its official site, WELS states that "Even though our unbelieving society embraces living together outside marriage as an acceptable lifestyle, it is still a sinful arrangement. A pastor or congregation will deal patiently with cohabitating people who are seeking spiritual guidance... [and a]... Christian life of sanctification. This is done by firmly yet gently confronting them with their sin... and then guiding them to change their behavior to show their love for Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wels.net/faq/living-together-versus-marriage/|title=Living together versus marriage|author=|date=|work=wels.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020212149/http://wels.net/faq/living-together-versus-marriage/|archivedate=20 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) delivered a detailed document, entitled ''A Social Statement on Human Sexuality'', in 2009. With regard to sex before marriage, the document, declares that "Because this church urges couples to seek the highest social and legal support for their relationships, it does not favor cohabitation arrangements outside marriage. It has a special concern when such arrangements are entered into as an end in themselves. It does, however, acknowledge the social forces at work that encourage such practices. This church also recognizes the pastoral and familial issues that accompany these contemporary social patterns. In cases where a decision is made for cohabitation, regardless of the reasons, this church expects its pastors and members to be clear with the couple regarding the reasons for the position of this church and to support the couple in recognizing their obligation to be open and candid with each other about their plans, expectations, and levels of mutual commitment. Some cohabitation arrangements can be constructed in ways that are neither casual nor intrinsically unstable... This church believes, however, that the deepest human longings for a sense of personal worth, long-term companionship, and profound security, especially given the human propensity to sin, are best served through binding commitment, legal protections, and the public accountability of marriage, especially where the couple is surrounded by the prayers of the congregational community and the promises of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Social Statement on Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust |date=19 August 2009 |publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America |url=http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/SexualitySS.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127040806/http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/SexualitySS.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]'s stance on the issue is ambiguous.

Calvinism has traditionally always asserted that engaging in premarital sex is a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Helm|first=Paul|title=Sex, Marriage, and Family in John Calvin's Geneva, Volume 1: Courtship, Engagement, and Marriage|url=http://www.reformation21.org/shelf-life/sex-marriage-and-family-in-john-calvins-geneva-volume-1-courtship-engagement-and.php|publisher=Reformation21|accessdate=3 August 2013|date=July 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901073828/http://www.reformation21.org/shelf-life/sex-marriage-and-family-in-john-calvins-geneva-volume-1-courtship-engagement-and.php|archivedate=1 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin|Calvin]] himself said little on why he thought engaged couples should not have sex and [[John Witte, Jr.|Witte]] believes his rationale for the prohibition was vague&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helm|first=Paul|title=Sex, Marriage, and Family in John Calvin's Geneva, Volume 1: Courtship, Engagement, and Marriage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlWH2jHaj1YC&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=john+calvin+cohabitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PCD86PPN49&amp;sig=ukCbeDu0Lxc0m-roXFlAh_EC86c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LC0uVPrUH4ad8QWL-oD4CQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20calvin%20cohabitation&amp;f=false|publisher=Reformation21|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did seek to reduce the length of engagements among couples in Geneva to less than six weeks, to reduce the temptation of premarital sex.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; He agreed, though, with Luther that marriage was a legal matter for the state, not a sacramental matter for the church.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

[[John Witte, Jr.]] has written a study on John Calvin and marriage and family life. In it, he notes that, "For Calvin, the Commandment against adultery was equally binding on the unmarried, and equally applicable to both illicit sexual activities per se, and various acts leading to the same. Calvin condemned fornication sternly—sexual intercourse or other illicit acts of sexual touching, seduction, or enticement by non-married parties, including those who were engaged to each other or to others. He decried at length the widespread practice of casual sex, prostitution, concubinage, pre-marital sex, nonmarital cohabitation and other forms of bed hopping that he encountered in modern day Geneva as well as in ancient Bible stories. All these actions openly defied God's commandment against adultery and should be punished by spiritual and criminal sanctions. Calvin preached against fornication constantly... He often led the Consistory in rooting out fornicators and subjecting them to admonition and the ban, and to fines and short imprisonment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Witte Jr. |editor=Herman J.

Raymond A. Mentzer notes that, "Wherever Calvinism took root – Geneva and France, the Low Countries and Rhine Valley, Scotland, England and New England – an element of moral rigor... accompanied it. Churches fashioned in the Calvinist tradition have typically set extremely high standard of behavior and, more particularly, sought to compel a strict morality within the community..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2540632|title=Disciplina nervus ecclesiae: The Calvinist Reform of Morals at Nimes|first=Raymond A.|last=Mentzer|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=18|issue=1|pages=89–116|doi=10.2307/2540632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin, including sexual sin, was not simply considered a private failing; it affected the whole congregation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=n_ipwgt-dtMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=calvinism%20fornication&amp;ots=TxWVTvoKNR&amp;sig=0-vqYgRgnw1Op8w0_fGhVQ1DkAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fornication&amp;f=false|title=Sin and the Calvinists: Morals Control and the Consistory in the Reformed Tradition|first=Raymond A.|last=Mentzer|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Truman State Univ Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; E. William Monter asserts that, "The supposedly repressive dimension of Calvinist morality affected women's lives in ways which were often beneficial... Each year the [Genevan] Consistory judged a half-dozen cases of fornication by engaged couples and as many accusations of illicit sex between masters and servants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3173922|title=Women in Calvinist Geneva (1550–1800)|first=E.

The town soon had a Protestant majority but it still faced an enormous task in cleaning up morals as one of the first Protestant-controlled societies in France. According to Mentzer, one third of excommunications in Nîmes between the 1560s and the 1580s were due to improper sexual behaviour. At this time, proper conduct was considered as much a public matter as a private matter. The struggle against worldly dissoluteness, and the enforcement of respect for the family and the pacification of society were setting Nîmes "on the path towards social reform and, by extension, modernity itself."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

As a result of this new moral rigour, there were remarkably low rates of premarital conceptions and illegitimate births among [[Huguenots]] by the seventeenth century in France compared to the rates among their Roman Catholic opponents, from whom the Reformed sought to distinguish themselves by their moral holiness.{{sfn|Manetsch|2013|p=211}} The low illegitimate birth rate indicates that the Calvinists had internalised the values that condemned premarital sex as immoral.&lt;ref name="Benedict1991"&gt;{{cite book |author=Philip Benedict|title=The Huguenot Population of France, 1600–1685: The Demographic Fate and Customs of a Religious Minority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=py0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA101|date=1 January 1991|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-815-5|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0sLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA98|year=1966|publisher=American Philosophical Society|page=98|chapter=The Huguenot Population of France|issn=0065-9746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting case is that of Pierre Palma Cayet, who scandalously wrote a book in which he provided a scriptural defence of brothels, prostitution and fornication, which led to him being deposed as a Huguenot pastor. Shortly afterwards, in 1595, he re-converted to Roman Catholicism. He was readily accepted back into that church as a priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZH9Rkw4Yl8EC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;lpg=PA375&amp;dq=castellion%20fornication&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4lfGKi_s_Z&amp;sig=DNxJ3wbuKThyHquuxeVxuSnMXsM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd6Zbepc_PAhVEjpQKHQZQDvAQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%20fornication&amp;f=false|title=Theodore Beza and the Quest for Peace in France: 1572 – 1598|first=Scott M.|last=Manetsch|date=1 January 2000|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar Nicholas Must, "Marriage was, in the equations of Huguenot ministers... a means to avoid promiscuity and lechery. As a result of this, many sermons that dealt with marriage were also an opportunity to announce the dangers of illicit sex while, at the same time, offering a relatively positive appraisal of conjugal sex. For instance, Jean Mestrezat declares simply that marriage is the recommended solution for illicit sexuality, since God hates all impurities, especially paillardise [sexual immorality]... In another sermon, [Pastor Jean] Daillé provides a close hermeneutical reading of paillardise in a sermon on 1 Corinthians 10:8 when he states that it includes "all the species of this sin, that is to say all the faults of this nature, which are committed by any person, whether married or not, simple fornication as well as adultery"."&lt;ref name="macsphere.mcmaster.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/13992/1/fulltext.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010125748/https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/13992/1/fulltext.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the Huguenot, “simple fornication” is a "grave sin".&lt;ref name="macsphere.mcmaster.ca"/&gt;

Today, [[United Protestant Church of France|French Calvinists]] maintain very high ethical standards and feel themselves to be different from their French Roman Catholic neighbours, in terms of their attitudes and higher standards of behaviour, including sexual behaviour. Indeed, French Reformed Christians "are widely regarded as having particularly high standards of honesty and integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keeping the Huguenot tradition alive |author=Mary Dejevsky |date=1 September 1996 |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/keeping-the-huguenot-tradition-alive-1361451.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815181255/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/keeping-the-huguenot-tradition-alive-1361451.html |archivedate=15 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even one of France's most liberal Reformed Calvinist churches,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[L'Oratoire du Louvre]] in Paris, today still condemns premarital sex, including casual sex and sex with prostitutes in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/faq/sexualite-et-foi.php|title=Sexuality and faith|author=Marc Pernot, pasteur|publisher=[[L'Oratoire du Louvre]]|accessdate=17 September 2016|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920143847/https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/faq/sexualite-et-foi.php|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/faq/j-ai-du-mal-a-trouver-la-paix-apres-une-aventure-avec-un-homme-qui-ne-m-aimait-pas.php|title=Have I done wrong to find peace after an adventure with a man who doesn't love me?|author=Marc Pernot, pasteur|publisher=[[L'Oratoire du Louvre]]|accessdate=17 September 2016|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920144451/https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/faq/j-ai-du-mal-a-trouver-la-paix-apres-une-aventure-avec-un-homme-qui-ne-m-aimait-pas.php|archivedate=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous Swiss Huguenot theologian, [[Karl Barth]], discussed sexual morality in his magnum opus, ''[[Church Dogmatics]]''. He stated that "Coitus without coexistence is demonic"&lt;ref name="Barth, K: Church Dogmatics"&gt;Barth, K: ''Church Dogmatics''&lt;/ref&gt; ("demonic", in Christianity, simply meaning any sphere that does not submit to God.) Barth goes on to state that "the physical sexuality of man should form an integral part of his total humanity as male or female, and that the completion of the sexual relation should be integrated into the total encounter of man and woman. All right or wrong and therefore salvation or perdition in this matter depends on whether it is viewed in isolation and abstraction or within this whole... If it is not, if physical sexuality and sex relations have their own right and authority in which man and woman and their encounter may be controlled and fulfilled, then it is a demonic business. Naturally, the command of God will always resist any such idea of sovereign physical sexuality."&lt;ref name="Barth, K: Church Dogmatics" /&gt; For Barth, to engage in sex outside marriage is not only rebellious but dehumanising as it puts humans on the level of animals, driven by passion and a search for self-gratification.

Furthermore, for Barth, "A wedding is only the regulative confirmation and legitimation of a marriage before and by society. It does not constitute a marriage."&lt;ref name="Barth, K: Church Dogmatics" /&gt; Sex within marriage can be sinful as well unless it affirms the coexistence of the couple. This opens the door to a more holistic understanding of sex.

However, a few modern Swiss Reformed theologians, such as Michel Cornuz, take the teleological view that premarital sex is permissible if the sexual activities take a form which respects the partner and helps the relationship grow in intimacy. These theologians hold that it is when a relationship is exploitive that it is sinful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=2846&amp;Itemid= |title=La sexualité avant le mariage, est-ce un péché?|publisher=Questiondieu.com|language=fr|date=1 October 2007|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=1914&amp;Itemid=|publisher=Questiondieu.com|title=Sexualité, relations avant ou après mariage ... qu'en dit la Bible?|language=fr|date=12 September 2004|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Hence, engaging in sex with prostitutes is always sinful as it is an exploitive relationship and does not allow the participants to grow in dignity.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=4354&amp;Itemid=|publisher=Questiondieu.com|title=Est-ce que coucher avec une prostituée est un péché?|language=French|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=2 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702012915/http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=4354&amp;Itemid=|archivedate=2 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change has come about within the last two generations in Switzerland. Prior to that, the cultural norm was that the couple would not engage in sex before marriage. Hence, the modern Reformed theologians have endeavoured to meet the challenge of applying Christian teaching to this massive cultural change in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="questiondieu.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=1945&amp;Itemid=|publisher=Questiondieu.com|title=Est-ce important de rester vierge jusqu'au mariage?|language=fr|date=26 March 2005|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, Cornuz and his colleagues feel that one should always be true to one's individual conscience, so if the person feels sex before marriage is sinful, that person should listen to his or her conscience and abstain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vierge pour le mariage?|url=http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=1302&amp;Itemid=|publisher=Questiondieu.com|accessdate=3 August 2013|language=fr|date=12 July 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130730044756/http://www.questiondieu.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=viewlink&amp;link_id=1302&amp;Itemid=|archivedate=30 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key thing is that it is up to the couple themselves to decide if engaging in premarital sex or remaining virgins is the best way for them to reflect the love of God in their relationship.&lt;ref

According to Mentzer, during the first fifty years of the Scottish Reformation, "more than two-thirds of the cases brought before the Consistory involved illicit sex... everything else paled before the apparent obsession of Scots Calvinists with sex".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This contrasted strikingly with the data from Germany, the Netherlands and France. For the parish of Saint Andrews, fornication accounted for 47.4% of all cases heard between 1573 and 1600. 986 were charged with fornication (sexual intercourse between two single persons) and 813 with "fornication antenuptial" (sexual intercourse between two people who were engaged to each other but not yet married).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Between 1595 and 1597, the fornication levels in Saint Andrews plummeted. "The only... explanation for the relative absence of sexual offences, improbably though it may seem, is that a... genuine "reformation of manners" took place in the burgh."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Mentzer and Graham argue that this focus on sex may actually be due to the Kirk's early weakness. "Since there is strong sentiment in Western societies today that governments should stay out of the private lives of citizens, the church courts today seem nosy or even voyeuristic to our modern eyes. But this was no all-powerful Big Brother peering into bedroom windows. Rather the Kirk's obsession with sex was more a sign of its weakness than its strength... The need to discourage illicit sexuality was accepted by nearly all powers... even when they could agree on little else."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Only when ministers and presbyters gradually gained a stronger position were they able to gradually turn their focus to other disciplinary breaches surrounding the Sabbath, superstitious practices, neighborly disputes and so forth.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Scottish Calvinists today remain deeply opposed to any kind of sex outside marriage. In 2008, the Scottish health minister, [[Shona Robison]] noted, "There are deeply-held views on moral issues and cultural and lifestyle issues... The Highlands in general ... have a strong Calvinistic streak, a prudish thing that sees sex as something that happens behind closed doors and drawn curtains. As a consequence of this and because of lack of a scene for gay people, both straight and gay people are being driven out into these isolated areas to have [casual] sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=31 October 2008 |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/calvinist-attitudes-blamed-for-surge-in-outdoor-sex-1.826614 |title=Calvinist attitudes blamed for surge in outdoor sex |work=Herald Scotland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709013718/http://www.heraldscotland.com/calvinist-attitudes-blamed-for-surge-in-outdoor-sex-1.826614 |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Presbyterian Church, "like other Christian bodies, has viewed marriage as a prerequisite to sexual intercourse and considered sex outside marriage a sin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1991-04-22/news/2802948_1_church-of-john-calvin-view-sexual-relations-human-sexuality |title=Presbyterian Sex Report Attacks Church's Attitudes |date=April 1991 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140204160440/http://articles.mcall.com/1991-04-22/news/2802948_1_church-of-john-calvin-view-sexual-relations-human-sexuality |archivedate=4 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent conservative American Calvinist theologian, [[R. C. Sproul]], opposes premarital sex on the grounds that the marriage covenant is an essential legal safeguard, protecting both members of the couple from each other's sinfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=22 September 2014 |url=http://www.ligonier.org/blog/marriage-just-piece-paper/ |title=Is Marriage "Just a Piece of Paper"? |work=Ligonier Ministries |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922120245/http://www.ligonier.org/blog/marriage-just-piece-paper/ |archivedate=22 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Excerpted from {{cite book |author= R.

==== Methodism ====
The American Methodist theologian and pastor, [[Ben Witherington III]], believes that "virginity in a woman was highly valued before marriage [in Biblical cultures]... In early Jewish law if you had sex with a woman you were considered married to her or you had shamed her. See the story of Mary and Joseph. Porneia can refer to all sorts of sexual sin including deflowering a virgin... there was no dating or physical intimacy prior to an arranged marriage in the vast majority of cases. The notion of dating doesn't exist in Jesus and Paul's world. Second, honor and shame cultures placed a high value on sexual purity. Notice how prostitutes were stigmatized. Women were mainly blamed for sexual immorality. Finally Jesus gave his disciples two choices in Mt. 19—fidelity in heterosexual marriage or being a eunuch! This means no sex outside marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Premarital Sex a Sin?

The position of the [[United Methodist Church]] in the United States on the issue is as follows: "Although all persons are sexual beings whether or not they are married, sexual relations are only clearly affirmed in the marriage bond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does The United Methodist Church believe that premarital sex is OK?|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1322|publisher=United Methodist Church|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140811222306/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1322|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uniting Church in Australia]] is still formulating its views on the subject. It recognises the changes in marriage practice and lifestyle that have resonated throughout society and that the UCA is perceived by the public of being more accepting of the realities of humanity than many other denominations.&lt;ref name="Bos 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bos |first=Robert |title=Views of marriage in the UCA: Report on a consultation process (PDF) |url=http://assembly.uca.org.au/marriage/item/download/659_c2660aea3da95ad27c2d0d7af966ccec |accessdate=1 August 2014 |date=2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706051911/http://assembly.uca.org.au/marriage/item/download/659_c2660aea3da95ad27c2d0d7af966ccec |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowling|first=Heather|title=Sex, Marriage and All That Stuff)|url=http://unitingchurchwa.org.au/blog/2012/02/sex-marriage-and-all-that-stuff/|accessdate=1 August 2014|date=2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811005706/http://unitingchurchwa.org.au/blog/2012/02/sex-marriage-and-all-that-stuff/|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report noted that scripture is not really about marriage as understood in contemporary western societies and, in fact, has very little to say about it. In the report, the church also acknowledged that many unmarried people had sex but neither condemned nor endorsed it, instead noting that there were many different views within the church.&lt;ref name="Bos 2013" /&gt;

[[Stanley Hauerwas]] argues that questions about sex before marriage need to be reframed in terms of the narrative of the church. He asks individuals to consider if it is a pure or licentious lifestyle that will best prepare the Christian to live out and serve in the narrative of the church. Doctor Hauerwas goes on to conclude, "For the issue is not whether X or Y form of sexual activity is right or wrong, as if such activity could be separated from a whole way of life... The issue is not whether someone is chaste in the sense of not engaging in genital activity, but whether we have lived in a manner that allows us to bring a history with us that contributes to the common history we may be called upon to develop with one another. Chastity, we forget, is not a state but a form of the virtue of faithfulness that is necessary for a role in the community... what the young properly demand is an account of life and the initiation into a community that makes intelligible why their interest in sex should be subordinated to other interests. What they, and we, demand is the lure of an adventure that captures the imagination sufficiently that conquest means more than the sexual possession of another. I have tried to suggest that marriage and singleness for Christians should represent just such an adventure, and if it does not, no amount of ethics or rules will be sufficient to correct the situation."&lt;ref&gt;Hauerwas, S: ''A Community of Character: Toward a Constructive Christian Social Ethic''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Mennonites ===
[[Mennonites]] believe that sex outside marriage is sinful. The Mennonite ''Confession of Faith'' states "According to Scripture, right sexual union takes place only within the marriage relationship. Scripture places sexual intimacy within God's good created order. Sexual union is reserved for the marriage bond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Church|first1=published by arrangement with the General Board of the General Conference Mennonite|last2=Board|first2=the Mennonite Church General|title=Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective.|date=1995|publisher=Herald Press|location=Scottdale, Pa.|isbn=0-8361-9043-2|url=http://www.mennolink.org/doc/cof/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003102107/http://www.mennolink.org/doc/cof/|archivedate=3 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quakers]] are essentially non-judgemental about sex and relationships outside marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/quakers_1.shtml BBC – Religions – Christianity: Quakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306204617/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/quakers_1.shtml |date=6 March 2018 }}. 3 July 2009.

=== Anglicanism ===
The official resolutions of the Anglican Church are produced by the bishops in attendance at the Lambeth Conferences, which are held every ten years. The 1988 [[Lambeth Conference]] made this declaration in its ''Resolution on Marriage and Family'': "Noting the gap between traditional Christian teaching on pre-marital sex, and the life-styles being adopted by many people today, both within and outside the Church: (a) calls on provinces and dioceses to adopt a caring and pastoral attitude to such people; (b) reaffirms the traditional biblical teaching that sexual intercourse is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship; (c) in response to the International Conference of Young Anglicans in Belfast, urges provinces and dioceses to plan with young people programmes to explore issues such as pre-marital sex in the light of traditional Christian values" (Resolution 34).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-34.cfm|title=Lambeth Conference Archives – 1988 – Resolution 34|author=|date=|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308224155/http://lambethconference.org/resolutions/1988/1988-34.cfm|archivedate=8 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent resolution was made at the 1998 Lambeth Conference. This sitting of the Conference resolved, "In view of the teaching of Scripture, [the Anglican Church] upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage" (Resolution I.10). This Resolution also commended a report on human sexuality entitled ''Called to Full Humanity'' which stated that, "The Holy Scriptures and Christian tradition teach that human sexuality is intended by God to find its rightful and full expression between a man and a woman in the covenant of marriage, established by God in creation, and affirmed by our Lord Jesus Christ. Holy Matrimony is, by intention and divine purpose, to be a lifelong, monogamous and unconditional commitment between a woman and a man. The Lambeth Conference 1978 and 1998 both affirmed 'marriage to be sacred, instituted by God and blessed by our Lord Jesus Christ'. The New Testament and Christian history identify singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like ways of living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1998/1998-1-10.cfm|title=Lambeth Conference Archives – 1998 – Resolution I.10|author=|date=|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713215909/http://www.lambethconference.org/resolutions/1998/1998-1-10.cfm|archivedate=13 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Episcopal Church only approves "of sex between men and women who are married. In 1979, the U.S. church's governing body voted down a resolution to approve other sexual activity."&lt;ref name=articles.latimes.com&gt;{{cite news|title=Episcopal Unit Supports Non-Marital Sex|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-30/news/mn-1666_1_episcopal-church|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=30 January 1987|agency=Associated Press|location=Newark, New Jersey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130803150215/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-30/news/mn-1666_1_episcopal-church|archivedate=3 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the English reformers had taken a stern view of adultery and fornication, which Homily 11 of the First Book of Homilies (1547) defined to include "all unlawfull use of those parts, which bee ordeyned for generation".&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

Prior to the ''[[Marriage Act 1753]]'' (commonly known as the Hardwicke Act), British couples could live together and have sex after their [[betrothal]] or "the spousals". Theologian Adrian Thatcher claims that, before the Act was introduced, in the United Kingdom the betrothal was a formal, preliminary stage of marriage involving vows. During this stage, the marriage would become permanent and indissoluble if sexual intercourse occurred or when final vows were taken, whichever came first. Either of these would render "the conditional promise unconditional".&lt;ref name="pravmir.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/article_750.html|title=Living Together before Marriage – the Theological and Pastoral Opportunities|author=|date=|work=pravmir.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930031012/http://www.pravmir.com/article_750.html|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, having sex would automatically turn the betrothal into a finalized, indissoluble marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adrianthatcher.org/data/resources/living%20together%20ct.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Betrothal vows were given in the future tense, hence sexual intercourse "activated" them, signalling the beginning of the binding marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/hardwickes-marriage-act-1754/|title=Hardwicke's Marriage Act 1754 and Clandestine Marriages|author=|date=4 June 2015|work=intriguing-history.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816055317/http://www.intriguing-history.com/hardwickes-marriage-act-1754/|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Trent in the Roman Catholic Church and the above-mentioned Marriage Act in the United Kingdom eliminated the tradition of the betrothal stage of marriage. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches, betrothal still exists but it has been combined into the wedding ceremony, rather than remaining as its own separate stage of the marriage process.

Thatcher notes that, today, "Non-nuptial cohabitation is unlikely ever to be thought consistent with Christian faith if only because God wills only what is best for us, and there [are] good reasons for thinking that these arrangements are not the best for us." He outlines some of the damage he believes is caused by cohabitation outside marriage in his paper, supported by empirical data.&lt;ref name="pravmir.com"/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, whilst the State defined who was married, it was the Anglican Church that was given the responsibility to police this law for the State.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt; Today, Britain remains abnormal among European nations in having Church weddings whereas most other nations on that continent insist on civil registrations leaving it up to the couple if they choose to have a religious ceremony as well.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

The 1984 English Anglican booklet ''Forward to Marriage'' showed a tolerance of premarital sex but strongly endorsed marriage as "a necessary commitment for a long-term relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anglican church tolerant on premarital sex issue|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19840114&amp;id=xfxNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rIsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6595,1598815|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=14 January 1984|agency=Associated Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the American Bishop John Shelby Spong's Newark Diocese had commissioned a report that concluded that the "Episcopal Church should recognize and bless committed non-marital sexual relationships between homosexuals, young adults, the divorced and widowed..." The report aimed "to ignite a new debate on sexual ethics among leaders of the nation's 3 million Episcopalians in the hope that they will amend church doctrine to embrace all believers... Spong, an advocate of the recommendations... said his views are a minority position in the church."&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com" /&gt;

Also in 1987, the General Synod of the Church of England asserted "(1) that sexual intercourse is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship, (2) that fornication and adultery are sins against this ideal, and are to be met by a call to repentance and the exercise of compassion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Simon Sarmiento |title=What Rowan Williams wrote about homosexuality in 1988 |date=6 August 2011 |publisher=Thinking Anglicans |url=http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/005115.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714221347/http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/005115.html |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 [[National Church Life Survey]] in Australia found that Australian Anglicans were more liberal about premarital sex than churchgoers from other denominations but more conservative than the general [non-church going] population. The survey noted a divide between Anglicans who wanted to support sexually active unmarried couples in their churches and others who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anglicans in Australia|author=Thomas R.

Among those who attended church on a weekly basis, the percentage of those who thought pre-marital sex was always or almost always wrong rose to 67%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |author=Philip Hughes |author2=Lachlan Fraser |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0y9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89|title=Life, Ethics and Faith in Australian Society: Facts and Figures |publisher=Christian Research Association |year=2014 |page=89 |isbn=978-1-875223-77-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 survey by the ''[[Church Times]]'' in England found that less than half of the 5,000 readers questioned said it was wrong for men and women to have sex before they married. Over 25% also said it was acceptable for a couple to live together without ever intending to marry.&lt;ref name="rethink"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1908115.ece|title=Church told to rethink bar on sex before marriage|author=Ruth Gledhill|date=31 March 2003|work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 report, ''Cohabitation: A Christian Reflection'', produced by the Diocese of Southwark, found that the Church's traditional teaching that sex before marriage is wrong has been inherited from a different form of society than that which exists today. However, the report then cited research that illustrates the problems that accompany cohabitation, particularly with regard to raising children. It concluded that marriage is "a much more satisfactory social convention than cohabitation", but says that the Church has failed to present marriage in a way that captures the imagination of young people and that the Church needed to rise to the challenge and rediscover its confidence in marriage.&lt;ref name="rethink" /&gt; The report noted that Paul gave a "cautious welcome" to marriage, but that there was also a "militant apostolic view" that favoured celibacy, which "was seen as more noble than marriage" by many early Christians. The report also noted that "the strict sexual codes of the earliest Christian communities helped to give them a separate identity distinct from the sexual hedonism of the pagan world."&lt;ref name="rethink" /&gt;

The report ultimately rejected the possibility that cohabitation with no intention to marry is acceptable for members of the Christian Church.&lt;ref name="rethink" /&gt;

In a 2004 interview, the [[Anglican Primate of Australia]], Archbishop [[Peter Carnley]], noted that heterosexual de facto relationships and a disinclination to commit were more serious worries for him than the same-sex marriage movement. When asked if he thought sexual morality was subjective, he disagreed, stating "I think it's possible to say, for example, that it is objectively quite clear that promiscuity is a bad thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 February 2004 |title=Archbishop Peter Carnley suggests 'lifelong friendships' over gay marriage |publisher=ABC Australia |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1053387.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731062100/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1053387.htm |archivedate=31 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[N. T. Wright]] noted that, in popular discourse, there has been a "supposed modern and scientific discovery of a personal 'identity' characterised by sexual preference, which then generates a set of 'rights'... Without entering into discussion of the scientific evidence, it must be said that the Christian notion of personal identity has never before been supposed to be rooted in desires of whatever sort. Indeed, desires are routinely brought under the constraints of 'being in Christ'. This quite new notion of an 'identity' found not only within oneself but within one's emotional and physical desires needs to be articulated on the basis of scripture and tradition, and this to my mind has not been done... The church has never acknowledged that powerful sexual instincts, which almost all human beings have, generate a prima facie 'right' that these instincts receive physical expression. All are called to chastity and, within that, some are called to celibacy; but a call to celibacy is not the same thing as discovering that one has a weak or negligible sexual drive. The call to the self-control of chastity is for all: for the heterosexually inclined who, whether married or not, are regularly and powerfully attracted to many different potential partners, just as much as for those with different instincts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunioninstitute.com/2009/07/rowan%E2%80%99s-reflections-unpacking-the-archbishop%E2%80%99s-statement/|title=Rowan's Reflections: Unpacking the Archbishop's Statement|author=|date=|work=The Anglican Communion Institute, Inc.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010113146/http://www.anglicancommunioninstitute.com/2009/07/rowan%E2%80%99s-reflections-unpacking-the-archbishop%E2%80%99s-statement/|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another occasion, Wright stated, "We need to remind ourselves that the entire biblical sexual ethic is deeply counter-intuitive. All human beings some of the time, and some human beings most of the time, have deep heartfelt longings for kinds of sexual intimacy or gratification (multiple partners, pornography, whatever) which do not reflect the creator's best intentions for his human creatures, intentions through which new wisdom and flourishing will come to birth. Sexual restraint is mandatory for all, difficult for most, extremely challenging for some. God is gracious and merciful but this never means that his creational standards don't really matter after all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preachingtoday.com/illustrations/2015/february/7022315.html|title=N.T.

I always find it difficult to condense sexual ethics into a soundbite... All I can say is where the Church stands – it's not a question of what Rowan Williams's view is... the biblical view of sexual relations is consistently within the pattern of absolute mutual commitment, reflecting God's commitment to his people. And the assumption of the Bible is that that commitment is heterosexual.

The Kinsey Institute comments that "Prior to the 1950s, the religious influences forming sexual constructs [in Britain] came almost exclusively from "the official church" of England, and "unofficially" from the other Christian denominations. In recent decades, the picture has become more complex. Since midcentury, the Church of England's approach to social morality and sexuality has fluctuated between two poles, the traditionalists and the modernists, or the "permission givers" and the "orthodox moral directors". With the national religious scene resembling the circular approach of the politicians to sexual knowledge and attitudes, the sociosexual control and influence appears to bounce back and forth between church and state according to a mutually cooperative formula... This doctrinal "pendulum" is confusing for the majority of the population who are not experts at moral and theological niceties and subtleties. The people themselves are part of the system of confusion: While expecting clear and definite moral messages from both establishment and Church, they reserve the right to judge the validity of those messages, even when they are biblically based."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuum Complete International Encyclopaedia of Sexuality: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ccies/uk.php|publisher=Kinsey Institute|accessdate=6 June 2014|date=2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223110445/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ccies/uk.php|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 British Social Attitudes survey found that members of the Church of England have become more accepting of pre-marital sex over the past 30 years. In 1983, 31% of British Anglicans surveyed thought that pre-marital sex was "always" or "mostly" wrong whereas, in 2012, only 10% thought this was the case. Likewise, in 1989, 78% of Anglicans surveyed thought that people should marry before having children. In 2012, this had declined to 54%.&lt;ref name="churchtimes.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ed Thornton |date=13 September 2013 |url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2013/13-september/news/uk/christians-more-liberal,-survey-finds |title=Christians more liberal, survey finds |newspaper=Church Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402200654/http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2013/13-september/news/uk/christians-more-liberal,-survey-finds |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholicism ===
[[Catholicism]] equates premarital sex with fornication and ties it with breaking the [[Ten Commandments|sixth commandment]] ("[[Thou shalt not commit adultery]]") in its [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses and the generation and education of children. Moreover, it is a grave scandal when there is corruption of the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church – The sixth commandment |publisher=Vatican.va |date=29 October 1951 |accessdate=2 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813092321/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm |archivedate=13 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book, [[James F. Keenan]] reports studies by some academics. A study by Bernard Hoose states that claims to a continuous teaching by the Church on matters of sexuality, life and death and crime and punishment are "simply not true". After examining seven medieval text about homosexuality, Mark Jordan argues that, "far from being consistent, any attempt to make a connection among the texts proved impossible". He calls the tradition's teaching of the Church "incoherent". Karl-Wilhelm Merks considers that [[Sacred tradition|tradition]] itself is "not the truth guarantor of any particular teaching." Keenan, however, says that studies of "manualists" such as [[John T. Noonan Jr.]] has demonstrated that, "despite claims to the contrary, manualists were co-operators in the necessary historical development of the moral tradition." Noonan, according to Keenan, has provided a new way of viewing at "areas where the Church not only changed, but shamefully did not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James F.

The Catholic Church did not pro-actively condemn men for pre-marital sex until the twelfth century. The Third [[Council of Aachen]] had previously noted that it was almost unheard of for a man to remain a virgin until his wedding but males remained largely immune to punishment whereas females were heavily penalized for sexual misdemeanours.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=SiGe-Zf0nTIC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=third%20council%20aachen%20sex&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R3dUT_JNV8&amp;sig=b-VsUhEKhLhZkDFfwhXnmdl9dIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZxuXO2avPAhWGF5QKHRTaCV4Q6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=third%20council%20aachen%20sex&amp;f=false|title=Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe|first=James A.|last=Brundage|date=15 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Church's disapproval of nonmarital sex, fornication continued to be commonplace in the early medieval period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In the twelfth century, the Paris-based "Reform Church" movement was a Catholic faction that attempted to refocus society's moral compass with a particular emphasis on sex and marriage. The movement sent priests to Wales where it was, up until that time, the norm for Christians to live together prior to marriage.&lt;ref name="walesonline"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/gerald-wales-patriotic-welshman-arrogant-1848276 |title=Gerald of Wales: Patriotic Welshman or arrogant agent of English imperialism? |work=Wales Online |date=3 October 2002 |accessdate=14 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021051317/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/gerald-wales-patriotic-welshman-arrogant-1848276 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until this period, marriage was considered a private contract between two people. They would make a pledge to each other and, from that moment on, they were considered married. This pledge could take place anywhere; it did not have to occur in a church and neither the church nor the state were involved. It was during the twelfth century that the Catholic Church took control of the process of marriage. From that point on, to be legally recognised, a marriage had to take place in a church with a formal service conducted by a priest. Hence all marriage and sexual activity now came under the control of the Church.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

At the time of the Reformation, the Catholic Church "officially advocated celibacy for the religious, and prohibited marriage, but allowed fornication and concubinage".&lt;ref name="Manschreck2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clyde L.

The [[Council of Trent]] (which began in 1545 in reaction to the [[Protestant Reformation]]) formally ratified the Catholic view that marriage was a sacrament and set strict guidelines around what constituted a legitimate marriage in Catholic eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15030c.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |article=Council of Trent |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811181949/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15030c.htm |archivedate=11 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 British Social Attitudes survey showed that only one in ten British Catholics and Anglicans thought that pre-marital sex was wrong (however, of those who attended Church on a weekly basis, only 23% thought it was permissible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/2013/british-social-attitudes-survey-2012/|title=British Social Attitudes Survey, 2012|author=|date=|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095044/http://www.brin.ac.uk/news/2013/british-social-attitudes-survey-2012/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1994 study of French Catholics showed that 83% preferred to listen to their consciences rather than to the official position of the Catholic Church when making major decisions in their lives, leading to 75% of Catholics, by 2003, to say that cohabitation outside marriage is a personal matter and 13% to say whether it is right or not depends on circumstances.&lt;ref name="HargreavesKelsay2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Alec G.

A 2004 survey showed vastly different attitudes among Catholics in different nations. For instance, in Germany, 76% of Catholics agreed or strongly agreed that cohabitation before marriage was acceptable. In Spain, that number was 72%, in the Czech Republic it was 66% and in France it was 62%. At the other end of the spectrum, only 32% of Australian Catholics thought it was acceptable, followed by 39% in the Philippines and 43% in the United States.&lt;ref name="catholicsforchoice.org" /&gt;

The same survey sought to show the number of Catholics who believed that premarital sex is "not wrong at all" or "wrong only sometimes". In the Czech Republic, 84% of Catholics believed this, in France it was 83% and in Germany it was 80%. At the other end of the scale, in the Philippines it was 21%, in Ireland it was 51% and in Australia and the United States it was 64%.&lt;ref name="catholicsforchoice.org" /&gt; The survey also claimed that 40% of Catholic women in the United States have cohabited outside marriage.&lt;ref name="catholicsforchoice.org" /&gt;

The 2013 British Social Attitudes survey showed that Catholics have become even more accepting than Anglicans of having children outside wedlock: in 1989, 73% of British Catholics thought people should marry before having children; whereas, by 2012, just 43% thought so.&lt;ref name="churchtimes.co.uk" /&gt;

=== Evangelicalism ===
In his book ''Forbidden Fruit: Sex &amp; Religion in the Lives of American Teenagers'', sociologist [[Mark Regnerus]] notes that "Evangelical Christian teens are more likely to have lost their virginity earlier than mainline Protestants. They start having sex on average at age 16.3 and are more likely than other religious groups to have had three or more sexual partners by age 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilmour|first=Maggie|title=Let's face it, sex happens|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2010/05/07/f-vp-gilmour.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 survey found 56% of unmarried evangelical Christians between the ages of 18 and 29 were never sexually active. Unlike previous studies, this survey did not rely on respondents simply identifying themselves as "evangelical" but also had to attend a Protestant church at least once a month, believe that they will go to heaven when they die because they have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior, strongly agree that the Bible is the written word of God and is accurate in all that it teaches, that their personal commitment to Jesus Christ is still important to their lives today, that eternal salvation is possible only through Jesus Christ, and that they personally have a responsibility to tell others about their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nae.net/most-unmarried-evangelical-millennials-have-never-had-sex/|title=Most Unmarried Evangelical Millennials Have Never Had Sex – National Association of Evangelicals|date=2012-11-29|work=National Association of Evangelicals|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017041846/https://www.nae.net/most-unmarried-evangelical-millennials-have-never-had-sex/|archivedate=17 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey also found higher religiosity, as measured by frequency of Bible reading, was correlated with a lower rate of non-marital sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nae.net/more-frequent-bible-readers-less-likely-to-have-sex-outside-marriage/|title=More Frequent Bible Readers Less Likely to Have Sex Outside Marriage – National Association of Evangelicals|date=2012-12-06|work=National Association of Evangelicals|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017042010/https://www.nae.net/more-frequent-bible-readers-less-likely-to-have-sex-outside-marriage/|archivedate=17 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== American Baptists ====
The [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptist]] pastor and assistant professor, Jennifer Knust, believes that the Bible is contradictory on the subject of premarital sex and that some Bible texts, notably the [[Book of Ruth]], present it as a source of God's blessing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Prothero |date=16 February 2011 |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2011/the-bible%E2%80%99s-contradictions-about-sex/ |title=The Bible's Contradictions About Sex |work=BU Today |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006090401/http://www.bu.edu/today/2011/the-bible%E2%80%99s-contradictions-about-sex/ |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV Media |author=Terry Gross |work=Fresh Air |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/133245874/unprotected-texts-the-bible-on-sex-and-marriage |title='Unprotected Texts': The Bible on Sex And Marriage |date=10 March 2011 |publisher=NPR |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815174625/http://www.npr.org/2011/03/10/133245874/unprotected-texts-the-bible-on-sex-and-marriage |archivedate=15 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Southern Baptist convention ====
A 2013 study of 151 newly married young adults at nine Southern Baptist churches in Texas found that over 70% of respondents reported having had premarital vaginal or oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosenbaum JE, Weathersbee B |title=True love waits: do Southern Baptists?

''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that the New Testament teaches that sex outside marriage is a sin of [[adultery]] if either sexual participant is married, otherwise the sin of [[Porneia|fornication]] if both sexual participants are unmarried.

The Southern Baptists' Ethics and Religious Liberties Commission also condemns premarital sex on the grounds of their interpretation of the Bible.&lt;ref name="erlc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erlc.com/article/cohabitation-confusion-what-does-the-bible-say |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120158/http://erlc.com/article/cohabitation-confusion-what-does-the-bible-say |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling that marriage is a "divine institution"&lt;ref name="erlc.com" /&gt; the Southern Baptist position is closer to that of Roman Catholic sacramentalism than that of Luther and Calvin who maintained marriage was a legal agreement and the business of the State.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

==== Pentecostals ====
In Australia, Pentecostals are increasingly opposed to the concept of premarital sex. In 1993, 62% of Australian Pentecostals felt that sex before marriage was wrong. By 2009, that figure had jumped to 78%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
Hindu texts present a range of views on sex. The hymn 4.5.5 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' calls adultery as ''pāpa'' (evil, sin).&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2|pages=7 with footnote 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Indologist Wendy Doniger, the Vedic texts, including the ''Rigveda'', the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' and the [[Upanishads]], also acknowledge the existence of male lovers and female lovers as a basic fact of human life, followed by the recommendation that one should avoid such extra marital sex during certain ritual occasions ([[yajna]]).&lt;ref name="Harlan161"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=Lindsey Harlan and Paul B.

Mandagadde Rama Jois translates verse 4.134 of ''[[Manusmriti]]'' as declaring adultery to be a heinous offense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandagadde Rama Jois|title=Ancient Indian Law: Eternal Values in Manu Smriti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_PKqWOJlegC&amp;pg=PA85 |year=2015|publisher=Universal Law Publishing|isbn=978-81-7534-259-0|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prescribes severe punishments.&lt;ref name=rocher2012p296/&gt; The verse 8.362 of ''Manusmriti'' exempts the rules on adultery for women who earn their own livelihood or are wives of traveling performances, where the woman enters into sexual liaisons on her own volition or with the encouragement of the husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|title=Manu's Code of Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnHo02RtONMC |year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-517146-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Sense of Adharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6bsOfvySvMC |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-802448-4|pages=170–172 with footnote 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manusmriti'', states Doniger offers two views on adultery. It recommends a new married couple to remain sexually faithful to each other for life. It also accepts that adulterous relationships happen, children are born from such relationships and then proceeds to reason that the child belongs to the legal husband of the pregnant woman, and not to the biological father.&lt;ref name="Harlan163"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=Lindsey Harlan and Paul B.

According to Ramanathan and Weerakoon, in Hinduism, the sexual matters are left to the judgment of those involved and not a matter to be imposed through law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathryn S. K. Hall|author2=Cynthia A.

For example, states Ariel Glucklich, the sexual liaison is taught as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, working against his enemies and facilitating his successes. It also explains the many signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into a sexual relationship outside of marriage, and when she does not want to commit adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Sense of Adharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6bsOfvySvMC |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-802448-4|pages=170–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Hindu texts present a more complex model of behavior and mythology where gods commit adultery for various reasons. For example, states Wendy Doniger, [[Krishna]] commits adultery and the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' justifies it as something to be expected when Vishnu took a human form, just like sages become uncontrolled.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2|pages=288–291 with footnotes 83, 89, 101–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tracy Coleman, Radha and other gopis are indeed lovers of Krishna, but this is ''prema'' or "selfless, true love" and not carnal craving. In Hindu texts, this relationship between gopis and Krishna involves secret nightly rendezvous. Some texts state it to be divine adultery, others as a symbolism of spiritual dedication and religious value.&lt;ref name="Bose2018p117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tracy Coleman|editor=Mandakranta Bose|title=The Oxford History of Hinduism: The Goddess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_tdDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-107968-9|pages=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
The Torah explicitly forbids adultery. All women were expected to be virgins upon marriage. In the case they were found not to be by a betrothed husband, the punishment was death&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:20–21|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the man to whom she married was not the man to whom she lost her virginity. Also if a man and a virgin had sex prior to marriage, then they were forced to marry.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 22:13–29&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote two sources, "The Torah does not outlaw it—as it does many other types of sexual relationships—and the child of such a union is not considered a ''[[mamzer]]'' (illegitimate). Nonetheless, marital sex is considered ideal, and premarital sex is traditionally not approved of. The negative attitude toward premarital sex, to a large degree, reflects the overwhelmingly positive attitude toward sex within marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jewish Views on Premarital Sex |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/life/Sex_and_Sexuality/Premarital_Sex.shtml |publisher=My Jewish Learning |accessdate=6 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234610/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/life/Sex_and_Sexuality/Premarital_Sex.shtml |archivedate=6 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "The only limits placed on sexual activities in the Torah are prohibitions against adultery and incest. In Biblical times, a man was not prohibited from having sexual relations with a woman, as long as it led to marriage. The Bible never explicitly states a woman and man may not have sexual intercourse prior to marriage; therefore, no sanction was imposed for premarital sex, but it was considered a violation of custom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premarital Sex|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/premarital_sex.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=6 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424045758/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/premarital_sex.html|archivedate=24 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sixth century, [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] formulated legislation that was to become the basis of Western marriage law for the next millennia. Under his laws, cohabiting couples were no longer recognised as married and their children were regarded as illegitimate, with the same status as the children of prostitutes. However, the status of illegitimate children could be updated if the parents later married.&lt;ref name="churchinwales.org.uk"/&gt;

=== Britain ===
In the 1170s, "it was common practice for ordinary couples to cohabit before marriage and for cousins to marry one another"&lt;ref name="walesonline" /&gt; and there was very little stigma around bastards at any social level in medieval England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ius.edu/RVEST/RoyalBastards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109045747/http://homepages.ius.edu/RVEST/RoyalBastards.htm |archivedate=9 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[William the Conqueror]]'s right to succeed to the throne of Normandy was never questioned on the grounds he was a bastard nor, in his conflict with [[Harold Godwinson]] over who should rule England, was this issue raised as an argument against him. However, attitudes shifted a few generations later when bastards were no longer able to claim the English throne.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Medieval Lives – Birth, Marriage and Death: Episode Two (A Good Marriage)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03cv0lm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 August 2014|date=16 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019195730/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03cv0lm|archivedate=19 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ascendancy of the [[Puritan]]s, an Act for suppressing the detestable sins of Incest, Adultery and Fornication was passed by the [[English Council of State]] in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May 1650: An Act for suppressing the detestable sins of Incest, Adultery and Fornication.|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp387-389|publisher=[[British History Online]]|accessdate=15 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907001122/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp387-389|archivedate=7 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] in 1660, this statute was not renewed, and prosecution of the mere act of fornication itself was abandoned. However, notorious and open lewdness, when carried to the extent of exciting public scandal, continued to be an indictable offence at common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Fornication|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the passing of the [[Marriage Act 1753]], laws against bastard children became more strict during the 1730s and 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Origins of the Old Poor Law |publisher=The Workhouse |url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/poorlaws/oldpoorlaw.shtml |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133822/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/poorlaws/oldpoorlaw.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Victorian era, however, the English working class continued to have a different set of sexual mores from the upper-middle and upper classes. Premarital intercourse was considered acceptable for the working class but only after an extended period of courtship and occurred infrequently even then. The couple were expected to marry, though. Disgrace only arose if the female became pregnant and the couple did not marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Promises Broken: Courtship, Class, and Gender in Victorian England |author=Ginger Suzanne Frost |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1995 |page=98 |isbn=978-0-8139-1610-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bqj-uL8CiLsC&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Victorian England: An Introduction |author=Christine Roth |publisher=University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh |url=http://www.english.uwosh.edu/roth/VictorianEngland.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316094022/http://www.english.uwosh.edu/roth/VictorianEngland.htm |archivedate=16 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America ===
Ethical issues arising from sexual relations between consenting heterosexuals who have reached the [[age of consent]] have generally been viewed as matters of private [[morality]], and so, have not generally been prosecuted as [[criminal offense]]s in the [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Thompson, ''The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science'', Vol. 49, No. 4 (Nov.–Dec. 1958), pp. 350–356&lt;/ref&gt; This legal position was inherited by the United States from the United Kingdom. Later, some jurisdictions, a total of 16 in the southern and eastern United States, as well as the states of [[Wisconsin]]&lt;ref&gt;Jim Thompson, ''The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science'', Vol. 49, No. 4 (Nov.–Dec. 1958), pp. 350–356, 353&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter7/76-7-S104.html?v=C76-7-S104_1800010118000101|title=Utah Code, Title 76, Chapter 07, Part 1, Section 104.

Most of these laws either were repealed, were not enforced, or were struck down by the courts in several states as being odious to their state constitutions. See also ''[[State v. Saunders]]'', [[Court decision|381 A.2d 333]] (N.J. 1977), ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]'', [[Court decision|607 S.E.2d 367]] (Va. 2005).

Some acts may be prohibited under criminal laws defining the offense of [[sodomy]], rather than the laws defining the offense of fornication. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) rendered the states' remaining laws related to sodomy unenforceable. ''Lawrence v. Texas'' is also presumed by many to invalidate laws prohibiting fornication: the decision declared sodomy laws unconstitutional, saying that they interfered with private, consensual, non-commercial intimate relations between unrelated adults, and therefore were odious to the rights of liberty and privacy, such rights being retained by the people of the United States.

=== Australia ===
A 2003 survey reported that most non-religious Australians thought that premarital sex was acceptable. It showed that there was a correlation between liberalism, education levels, lack of religious beliefs and a permissive attitude to premarital sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rissel |first=CE |last2=Richters |first2=J |last3=Grulich |first3=AE |last4=de Visser |first4=RO |last5=Smith |first5=AM |title=Sex in Australia: attitudes towards sex in a representative sample of adults |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health |year=2003 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=118–123 |pmid=14696701 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-842x.2003.tb00798.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014. Recent research on free will: Conceptualizations, beliefs, and processes. In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 50, pp. 1-52). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek [[Stoicism|stoics]] (for example, [[Chrysippus]]), and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these centuries.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]
[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:

Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

====Related philosophical issues====

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====
{{Main|Predeterminism}}
{{See also|Predestination}}

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H. James Birx"|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, &amp; Culture |title=Predeterminism |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications|doi=10.4135/9781412963961.n191 |pages=1035–36|chapter=Evolution, Chemical |isbn=9781412941648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Predeterminism |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/predeterminism |accessdate=20 December 2012 |date=April 2010 |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T.

(1740).

[[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "There is a sharp difference between moral judgments and judgments of fact.... Moral judgments ... must be ''a priori'' judgments."&lt;ref name=Paton&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;

The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect.

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson. A., (1994). ''Free Will and Determinism (FAD) scale''. Unpublished manuscript, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that people consider acts more "free" when they involve a person opposing external forces, planning, or making random actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T.F., R.F. Baumeister, F.D. Fincham, T.E. Joiner, N.M. Lambert, A.R. Mele, and D.M. Tice. 2008. Guilty, free, and wise. Belief in free will promotes learning from negative emotions.

Randomness is too important to trust to chance. Presented at the 2007 Summer Institute in Informed Patient Choice, Dartmouth Medical School, NH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wagenaar | first1 = W.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass-to-metal seal]]s have been around for many years, with one of the most common uses being lamp bulb seals. A more recent invention is '''glass-ceramic-to-metal seals'''.

==Properties==
''Glass-ceramics'' are polycrystalline [[ceramic]] materials prepared by the controlled crystallization of suitable glasses, normally [[silicate]]s. Depending on the starting glass composition and the heat-treatment schedule adopted, glass-ceramics can be prepared with tailored [[thermal expansion]] characteristics. This makes them ideal for sealing to a variety of different metals, ranging from low expansion [[Tungsten|tungsten (W)]] or [[Molybdenum|molybdenum (Mo)]] to high expansion [[stainless steel]]s and [[nickel]]-based [[superalloys]].

Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals offer superior properties over their glass equivalents including more [[refractory]] behaviour, in addition to their ability to seal successfully to many different metals and alloys. They have been used in electrical feed-through seals for such applications as [[vacuum]] interrupter envelopes and pyrotechnic [[actuator]]s, in addition to many applications where a higher temperature capability than is possible with [[glass-to-metal seal]]s is required, including solid [[oxide]] [[fuel cell]]s.

==Process==
In the formation of a glass-ceramic-to-metal seal, the parts to be joined are first heated, normally under [[Inert gas|inert]] atmosphere, in order to melt the glass and allow it to wet and flow into the metal parts, in much the same way as when preparing a more conventional [[glass-to-metal seal]]. The temperature is then normally reduced into a temperature regime where many microscopic nuclei are formed in the glass. The temperature is then raised again into a regime where the major [[crystallinity|crystalline]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s can form and grow to create the polycrystalline ceramic material with thermal expansion characteristics matched to that of the particular metal parts.

== Examples ==
The white opaque "glue" between the panel and the funnel of a colour TV [[cathode ray tube]] is a
devitrified [[solder glass]] based on the system {{chem|PbO}}-{{chem|ZnO}}-{{chem|B|2|O|3}}. While
this is a glass-ceramic-to-glass seal, the basic patent of S.A. Claypoole considers
glass-ceramic-to-metal seals as well.

'''Grazing marsh''' is a [[British Isles]] term for flat, marshy grassland in [[polder]]s.  It consists of large grass fields separated by fresh or [[brackish]] ditches, and is often important for its wildlife.

==History==

Grazing marshes were created from [[medieval]] times by building [[dike (construction)|sea wall]]s (earth banks) across tidal [[mudflat]]s and [[salt marsh]] to make polders (though the term "polder" is little used in Britain). Polders in Britain are mostly drained by gravity, rather than active pumping. The original tidal drainage channels were augmented by new ditches, and [[flap valve]]s in the sea walls let water drain out at low [[tide]] and prevent the sea or tidal river from entering at high tide.  Constructing polders in this way is called ''inning'' or ''reclaiming'' from the sea.

Grazing marshes have been made in most lowland [[Estuary|estuaries]] in Britain, often leaving only the river channel and the lowest part of the estuary tidal. In a few cases (such as [[Newtown, Isle of Wight|Newtown]] Harbour on the [[Isle of Wight]], and [[Pagham Harbour]] in [[West Sussex]]) the sea walls have been breached, and the estuaries have returned to a tidal state.  Grazing marshes have also been made on low-lying open coasts.

Many grazing marshes were inned in stages, and the old sea walls (called ''counter walls'') may be found marooned far from the current sea wall.  Land levels on either side of a counter wall often differ by several metres. Paradoxically, the lower side is the land inned earlier, because sediment continued to build up on the side that remained tidal.

==Wildlife==

Wintering [[wildfowl]] are characteristic of grazing marshes, often including large flocks of [[Eurasian wigeon]], [[brent goose]], [[white-fronted goose]] and [[Bewick's swan]].  Many of these birds are hunted by predators such as [[peregrine falcon|peregrine]] and [[marsh harrier]].

In summer, [[Wader|waders]] such as [[common redshank]], [[Eurasian curlew]] and [[northern lapwing]] breed.

The ditches often have a range of salinity, depending on how close to the sea wall they are.  The more saline ditches host specialist brackish-water plants and animals.  These include, for example, the rare brackish amphipod ''[[Gammarus]] insensibilis'' and sea club-rush (''Bolboschoenus maritimus'').  Fresher ditches may support rare animals, such as the great silver water beetle (''Hydrophilus piceus'') and the [[great raft spider]] (''Dolomedes plantarius''), and a wide range of pondweeds (''[[Potamogeton]]'' and relatives).

The grassland vegetation usually has a fairly small number of species, but those present are often scarce elsewhere, such as [[Sea Arrowgrass|sea arrowgrass]] (''Triglochin maritimum''), divided sedge (''Carex divisa'') and strawberry clover ''Trifolium fragiferum''.

==Conservation==

Many grazing marshes have been converted into [[arable land]], often using pumped drainage to lower the water levels enough to grow crops.  The low ditch levels and agricultural runoff combine to remove much of the aquatic wildlife, although the arable fields may still be used by some wintering wildfowl.

Some areas of grazing marsh and other polder land have been used to recreate tidal habitats by a process of [[managed retreat]].

Many of the larger areas of grazing marsh bear nature conservation designations, including [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], [[Special Protection Area]], [[Special Area of Conservation]] and [[Ramsar Site]].

The '''IT baseline protection''' (in German ''IT-Grundschutz'') approach from the German [[Federal Office for Information Security]] (FSI) is a methodology to identify and implement computer security measures in an organization. The aim is the achievement of an adequate and appropriate level of security for IT systems. To reach this goal the FSI recommends "well-proven technical, organizational, personnel, and infrastructural safeguards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IT-Grundschutz|url=https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html|work=bsi.bund.de|publisher=BSI|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and federal agencies show their systematic approach to secure their IT systems (e.g. [[Information Security Management System]]) by obtaining an ''ISO/IEC 27001 Certificate on the basis of IT-Grundschutz''.

== Overview baseline security ==
The term baseline security signifies standard security measures for typical IT systems. It is used in various contexts with somewhat different meanings. For example:
* [[Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer]]: Software tool focused on Microsoft operating system and services security
* [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Security/Baseline_Security/securebasebook.html Cisco security baseline]: Vendor recommendation focused on network and network device security controls
* [http://www.nortel.com/corporate/news/collateral/ntj3_baseline_04.pdf Nortel baseline security]: Set of requirements and best practices with a focus on network operators
* ISO/IEC 13335-3 defines a baseline approach to risk management. This standard has been replaced by [[ISO/IEC 27005]], but the baseline approach was not taken over yet into the 2700x series.
* There are numerous internal baseline security policies for organizations,&lt;ref name="purdue-university"&gt;{{cite web 
  | url=http://www.ag.purdue.edu/biochem/department/Documents/Baseline%20Security%20Policy%20and%20End%20User%20Agreement.pdf
  | title=Department Baseline Security Policy and End User Agreement
  | publisher=Purdue University
  | accessdate=17 December 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kent-police" /&gt;
* The German FSI has a comprehensive baseline security standard, that is compliant with the [[ISO/IEC 27000-series]]&lt;ref name="iso27000-gs" /&gt;

== FSI IT baseline protection ==
The foundation of an IT baseline protection concept is initially not a detailed risk analysis. It proceeds from overall hazards. Consequently, sophisticated classification according to damage extent and probability of occurrence is ignored. Three protection needs categories are established. With their help, the protection needs of the object under investigation can be determined. Based on these, appropriate personnel, technical, organizational and infrastructural security measures are selected from the [[IT Baseline Protection Catalogs]].

The [[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|Federal Office for Security in Information Technology]]'s IT Baseline Protection Catalogs offer a "cookbook recipe" for a normal level of protection. Besides probability of occurrence and potential damage extents, implementation costs are also considered. By using the Baseline Protection Catalogs, costly security analyses requiring expert knowledge are dispensed with, since overall hazards are worked with in the beginning. It is possible for the relative layman to identify measures to be taken and to implement them in cooperation with professionals.

The FSI grants a baseline protection certificate as confirmation for the successful implementation of baseline protection. In stages 1 and 2, this is based on self declaration. In stage 3, an independent, FSI-licensed [[auditor]] completes an audit. Certification process internationalization has been possible since 2006. [[ISO/IEC 27001]] certification can occur simultaneously with IT baseline protection certification. (The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is the successor of [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]]). This process is based on the new [[FSI security standards]]. This process carries a development price which has prevailed for some time. Corporations having themselves certified under the [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]] standard are obliged to carry out a [[risk assessment]]. To make it more comfortable, most deviate from the [[IT baseline protection#Protection needs determination|protection needs analysis]] pursuant to the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. The advantage is not only conformity with the strict [[Federal Office for Information Security|FSI]], but also attainment of [[BS7799|BS 7799-2]] certification. Beyond this, the FSI offers a few help aids like the policy template and the [[GSTOOL]].

One [[data protection]] component is available, which was produced in cooperation with the German [[Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information]] and the state data protection authorities and integrated into the IT Baseline Protection Catalog.  This component is not considered, however, in the certification process.

== Baseline protection process ==
The following steps are taken pursuant to the baseline protection process during [[IT baseline protection#IT structure analysis|structure analysis]] and [[IT baseline protection#Protection needs determination|protection needs analysis]]:
* The IT network is defined.
* IT structure analysis is carried out.
* Protection needs determination is carried out.
* A baseline security check is carried out.
* IT baseline protection measures are implemented.

Creation occurs in the following steps:
* IT [[IT baseline protection#IT structure analysis|structure analysis]] (survey)
* Assessment of  [[protection need]]s
* Selection of actions
* Running comparison of nominal and actual.

=== IT structure analysis ===
An IT network includes the totality of [[infrastructure|infrastructur]]al, organizational, personnel, and technical components serving the fulfillment of a task in a particular [[electronic data processing|information processing]] application area. An IT network can thereby encompass the entire IT character of an institution or individual division, which is partitioned by organizational structures as, for example, a departmental network, or as shared [[Application software|IT applications]], for example, a personnel information system. It is necessary to analyze and document the information technological structure in question to generate an IT security concept and especially to apply the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. Due to today's usually heavily networked IT systems, a [[network topology plan]] offers a starting point for the analysis. The following aspects must be taken into consideration:
* The available [[infrastructure]],
* The organizational and personnel framework for the IT network,
* Networked and non-networked [[Information technology|IT systems]] employed in the IT network.
* The communications connections between IT systems and externally,
* IT applications run within the IT network.

=== Protection needs determination ===
The purpose of the protection needs determination is to investigate what protection is sufficient and appropriate for the information and information technology in use.
In this connection, the damage to each application and the processed information, which could result from a breach of confidentiality, integrity or availability, is considered. Important in this context is a realistic assessment of the possible follow-on damages. A division into the three protection needs categories "low to medium", "high" and "very high" has proved itself  of value. "Public", "internal" and "secret" are often used for confidentiality.

=== Modelling ===
Heavily networked IT systems typically characterize information technology in government and business these days. As a rule, therefore, it is advantageous to consider the entire IT system and not just individual systems within the scope of an IT security analysis and concept. To be able to manage this task, it makes sense to logically partition the entire IT system into parts and to separately consider each part or even an IT network. Detailed documentation about its structure is prerequisite for the use of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs on an IT network. This can be achieved, for example, via the IT structure analysis described above. The IT Baseline Protection Catalogs' components must ultimately be mapped onto the components of the IT network in question in a modelling step.

=== Baseline security check ===
The baseline security check is an organisational instrument offering a quick overview of the prevailing IT security level. With the help of interviews, the status quo of an existing IT network (as modelled by IT baseline protection) relative to the number of security measures implemented from the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs are investigated. The result is a catalog in which the implementation status "dispensable", "yes", "partly", or "no" is entered for each relevant measure. By identifying not yet, or only partially, implemented measures, improvement options for the security of the information technology in question are highlighted.

The baseline security check gives information about measures, which are still missing (nominal vs. actual comparison). From this follows what remains to be done to achieve baseline protection through security. Not all measures suggested by this baseline check need to be implemented. Peculiarities are to be taken into account!  It could be that several more or less unimportant applications are running on a server, which have lesser protection needs. In their totality, however, these applications are to be provided with a higher level of protection. This is called the ([[cumulation effect]]).

The applications running on a server determine its need for protection. In this connection, it is to be noted that several IT applications can run on an IT system. When this occurs, the application with the greatest need for protection determines the IT systems protection category.

Conversely, it is conceivable that an IT application with great protection needs does not automatically transfer this to the IT system. This may happen because the IT system is configured redundantly, or because only an inconsequential part is running on it. This is called the ([[distribution effect]]). This is the case, for example, with clusters.

The baseline security check maps baseline protection measures. This level suffices for low to medium protection needs. This comprises about 80% of all IT systems according to FSI estimates. For systems with high to very high protection needs, risk analysis-based information security concepts, like for example [[ISO/IEC 27000-series]] standards, are usually used.

== IT Baseline Protection Catalog and standards ==
During its 2005 restructuring and expansion of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs, the FSI separated methodology from the IT Baseline Protection Catalog. The [[BSI 100-1]], [[BSI 100-2]], and [[BSI 100-3]] standards contain information about construction of an [[information security management system]] (ISMS), the methodology or basic protection approach, and the creation of a security analysis for elevated and very elevated protection needs building on a completed baseline protection investigation.

[[BSI 100-4]], the "Emergency management" standard, is currently in preparation. It contains elements from [[BS 25999]], [[ITIL]] Service Continuity Management combined with the relevant IT Baseline Protection Catalog components, and essential aspects for appropriate  [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuity Management]] (BCM). Implementing these standards renders [[certification]] is possible pursuant to [[BS 25999]]-2. The FSI has submitted the FSI 100-4 standards design for online commentary under.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsi.de/literat/bsi_standard/bsi-standard_100-4_v090.pdf ''Entwurf BSI 100-4''] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSI brings its standards into line with international norms like the [[ISO/IEC 27001]] this way.

'''Institute of Philology of the Siberian Branch of the RAS''' ({{lang-ru|Институт филологии СО РАН}}) is a research institute based in [[Akademgorodok]] of [[Novosibirsk]], [[Russia]].

==History==
In 1966, the Institute of History, Philology, and Philosophy was created in Novosibirsk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scfh.ru/en/papers/new-siberian-archaeology/ Science First Hand. New Siberian Archaeology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Institute of Philology was founded in 1990 as part of the United Institute of History, Philology and Philosophy of the Siberian Branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soran1957.ru/?p=auto&amp;id=o0020074&amp;ch=vitem Объединенный институт истории, филологии и философии. СО РАН.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the institute became an independent organization of the SB RAS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ras.ru/presidium/documents/directions.aspx?ID=03367a27-95c9-4c9a-8b59-bed692a11af3 О реорганизации и переименовании институтов Сибирского отделения РАН (представление Отделения).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1767">The '''laminar sublayer''', also called the '''viscous sublayer''', is the region of a mainly-[[turbulence|turbulent]] flow that is near a [[No-slip condition|no-slip boundary]] and in which the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]]. As such, it is a type of [[boundary layer]]. The existence of the laminar sublayer can be understood in that the flow velocity decreases towards the no-slip boundary. Because of this, the [[Reynolds number]] decreases until at some point the flow crosses the threshold from turbulent to laminar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imc.pcz.czest.pl/instytut/pl/3/3.8/materialy/afm_bl/afm_bl4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid...&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The laminar sublayer is important for river-bed [[ecology]]: below the laminar-turbulent interface, the flow is stratified, but above it, it rapidly becomes well-mixed. This threshold can be important in providing homes and feeding grounds for [[benthic]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid...&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the roughness due to the bed sediment or other factors are smaller or larger than this sublayer has an important bearing in [[hydraulics]] and [[sediment transport]]. Flow is defined as [[hydraulically rough flow|hydraulically rough]] if the roughness elements are larger than the laminar sublayer (thereby perturbing the flow), and as [[hydraulically smooth flow|hydraulically smooth]] if they are smaller than the laminar sublayer (and therefore ignorable by the main body of the flow).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13893">A '''[[master's degree]] in [[Financial Economics]]''' provides a rigorous understanding of [[theory|theoretical]] [[finance]] and the [[economics|economic]] framework upon which that theory is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfe.economics.utoronto.ca/about.html | title=U of T : Economics : Master of Financial Economics Program (MFE) | publisher=Mfe.economics.utoronto.ca | date= | accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree is [[postgraduate]], and usually incorporates a [[thesis]] or research component. Programs may be offered jointly by the [[business school]] and the [[economics]] department.

The nature of the degree differs by university. Generally, the degree is largely theoretical, and prepares graduates for [[research]] positions, for [[doctoral]] study in [[economics]], or for roles in [[applied economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.slu.edu/programs-of-study/graduate-business-programs/ms-in-applied-financial-economics/ MS in Applied Financial Economics], John Cook School of Business, Saint Louis University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birkbeck"/&gt; Some are positioned as [[professional degree]]s, preparing graduates for [[career]]s in investment banking and finance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ysu.edu/gen/class/Graduate_Program_m51.html |title=Economics Department, College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, Youngstown State University|publisher=As.ysu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://le.ac.uk/courses/financial-economics-msc Financial Economics MSc], University of Leicester&lt;/ref&gt;
and are comparable to the [[Master of Science in Finance]], though with an increased weighting towards economic theory. In some cases, programs are substantially quantitative&lt;ref name="okstate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spears.okstate.edu/finance/degrees/msqfe |title=MS in Quantitative Financial Economics |publisher=Spears.okstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are largely akin to a [[Master of Quantitative Finance]].

Closely related degrees include the "Master of Finance and Economics" &lt;ref name="Queen Mary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/msc/financeandeconomics/ |title=MSc (Econ) Finance and Economics &amp;#124; School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary, University of London |publisher=Econ.qmul.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[Master of Economics]] with a specialization in Finance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessandeconomics.mq.edu.au/postgraduate_coursework_programs/2011_programs_of_study/MASTER_OF_ECONOMICS_with_a_specialisation_in_FINANCIAL_ECONOMICS_2011.pdf Master of Economics with a specialisation in Financial Economics], [[Macquarie University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently,{{When|date=November 2014}} undergraduate degrees in the discipline are offered.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: [http://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/126/financial-economics Kent]; [http://www.city.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/financial-economics City London]; [http://undergradbusiness.ucr.edu/major/financial_economics.html UC Riverside]; [http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/economics/undergraduate Leicester]; [http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/undergraduate/load/overview Toronto]; [http://www.umbc.edu/economics/BS_1.html UMBC].&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree is gaining in recognition: [[University of Oxford|Oxford's]] Financial Economics MSc &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/degrees/mfe/Documents/MFE%20Programme%20Specification%20(updated%20September%202010).pdf MSc in Financial Economics], [[Oxford University]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the fourth ranked worldwide amongst ''all'' Masters in Finance programs (Pre-experience).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-finance-pre-experience-2012 FT Rankings: Masters in Finance Pre-experience 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Note though that Financial Economics programs are not necessarily comparable with generalist programs in finance.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Masters in Financial Economics are usually one to one and a half years in duration, and typically include a [[thesis]] or research component. The programs require a [[bachelor's degree]] prior to admission, but do not (usually) require an undergraduate [[Academic major|major]] in finance or economics; a typical requirement is exposure to ([[Multivariable Calculus|multivariable]]) [[calculus]], [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[differential equations]]. Many programs include a review of these topics as an [[University and college admission|admission-]] or preliminary course.&lt;ref name="Birkbeck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;[http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/disciplines/economics/postgraduate/psmaths/ Manchester's "Pre-Session" Mathematics &amp; Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127195449/http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/disciplines/economics/postgraduate/psmaths/ |date=2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDC"&gt;[https://www.idc.ac.il/en/schools/rris/graduate/Documents/mafe-brochure.pdf MA in Financial Economics, IDC Herzliya]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/graduate/courseDetails/4282 Mathematics and Statistics for MA and MFE Students], University of Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[curriculum]] is distributed between theory, applications, and modelling, with the emphasis on each differing by university and program, as above.

* The theory component centres on [[decision making]] under [[uncertainty]] in the context of the [[financial markets]], and the resultant [[economic model|economic]] and [[financial model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719120650/http://mit.econ.au.dk/vip_htm/akoch/outlineEC5010.pdf Outline for ‘Financial Economics’], [[Royal Holloway]], [[University of London]]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree essentially explores how [[homo economicus|rational investors]] would apply [[decision theory]] to the problem of [[investment]].  Investment under "[[certainty]]" is initially considered ([[Fisher separation theorem]], [[The Theory of Investment Value|"theory of investment value"]], [[Modigliani-Miller theorem]]). [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|"Choice under uncertainty"]] is then introduced, and the twin assumptions of [[rational pricing|rationality]] and [[efficient markets|market efficiency]] lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] and the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]], and to the [[Black Scholes]] theory for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]].  Where the program emphasizes economics, the curriculum is extended:  it explores phenomena where these assumptions do not hold ([[Noise trader|noise trading]], [[market microstructure]], [[Behavioral economics#Behavioral finance|behavioural finance]]) and it discusses models which are further generalised ([[arbitrage pricing theory]], [[Mathematical finance#Derivatives pricing: the Q world|continuous time finance]] / [[Martingale pricing]]) or extended ([[Fama–French three-factor model|Multi-factor models]], [[Short-rate model|models of the short rate]], [[Intertemporal CAPM]], [[Black–Litterman model]]). Coursework here is often titled "[[Asset pricing]]" and "Corporate finance theory". Economics focused programs (often) separately cover [[microeconomics]] and /or [[decision theory]] as foundational topics.

* Application of the economic principles includes [[asset allocation]] and [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]], and covers specific [[financial instrument]]s — such as [[fixed income]], [[equities]], [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] — and their [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]]. The aim here is twofold: firstly, to complement the theory; secondly, providing graduates with practical market knowledge. In the economics-focused degrees, this coverage may (will) be of secondary importance, while in the professional degrees it is a major component, and often includes separate [[course work]] in (practical) [[corporate finance]], [[Investment management|portfolio management]] and [[financial risk management]]. [[Macroeconomics]] is also usually included; often though, as opposed to covering macroeconomic theory in general, the topics are applied and / or finance related with a focus on [[Economic forecasting|modelling and forecasting]] the relationships between [[asset class]]es and their [[Expectation (epistemic)|expected]] [[Return (finance)|returns]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.ucc.ie/modules/descriptions/EC.html#EC6001 Macroeconomics for Financial Markets], [[University College Cork]]; [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/degrees/mfe/Documents/MFE%20Programme%20Specification%20(updated%20September%202010).pdf MSc in Financial Economics], [[Oxford University]]; [http://business.cf.ac.uk/degree-programmes/economics/msc-financial-economics MSc in Financial Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229194557/http://business.cf.ac.uk/degree-programmes/economics/msc-financial-economics |date=2012-02-29 }}, [[Cardiff University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* The modelling curriculum [[wikt:complement|complements]] both of the above.   The theory is augmented via the study of [[econometrics]], [[time series|financial time series]] and [[statistical model]]ling,  with a focus on the [[empirical]] and statistical [[Economics#Empirical investigation|testing of economic theory]],&lt;ref name="Birkbeck"&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/pg/economics/TMSECFIN.html Birkbeck Financial Economics (MSc)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/ecofin/economics/coursesandprogrammes/postgraduate/Masters/Pages/MComFinancialEconomics.aspx|title=MCom (Financial Economics), University of Johannesburg|publisher=uj.ac.za |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on developing and documenting new econometric models.  Students are taught to model using [[statistical packages]] such as [[SAS (software)|SAS]] and [[EViews]]. The applications are reinforced through the [[Financial modeling#Quantitative finance|computer based implementation of the more complex problems]] (often including [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|numeric methods for option pricing]], [[Value at risk]], [[Portfolio optimization|constructing efficient portfolios]] and [[Yield curve construction|yield curve modeling]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.ac.uk/economics/finance/modules.html |title=City University, London - Modules: MSc Financial Economics |publisher=city.ac.uk|accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, though, the focus is typically on the ''concept'' as opposed to the [[mathematical model|modelling]], ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'', and may therefore be limited to the [[spreadsheet]] environment: [[Computational finance]] is the domain of specialized degrees, although some Financial Economics programs&lt;ref name="okstate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Queen Mary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/financialeconomics/ |title=Financial Economics MSc - University of Glasgow |publisher=gla.ac.uk |date=2018-01-25 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; do emphasize mathematical modelling and programming.

==Comparison with other qualifications==
There is some overlap with programs in [[financial engineering]], [[computational finance]] and [[mathematical finance]]; see [[Master of Quantitative Finance]] (MQF). These degrees aim to train practitioners and [[quantitative analyst|"quants"]] — i.e. [[Expert|specialist]]s in [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[fixed income]] and [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]] — as opposed to [[economist]]s, and their curricula are therefore weighted toward [[stochastic calculus]], [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]], [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|simulation techniques]] and programming, and are quantitative (well) beyond the level of the Financial Economics degree. Entrance requirements are similarly more mathematical.  On the other hand, coverage of financial and economic theory, and econometrics, while significant, is comparatively secondary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/senate/archives/resolutions_archives/resolutions/09-10/financial_economics_res.html Resolution to Establish a Program Leading to the Master of Science In Financial Economics], [[Columbia University]] Senate&lt;/ref&gt;  As mentioned, some Financial Economics programs are substantially quantitative; these differ little from the MQF.

The overlap with general finance degrees, such as a [[Master of Science in Finance]] (MSF) or an [[Master in Business Administration#Content|M.B.A. in finance]], is further limited, particularly where the Financial Economics program is theory oriented. These degrees are focused on [[Managerial finance|financial management]], [[corporate finance]] and [[investment management]], and are practice oriented with limited exposure to the underlying economic theory. Note though, that since these courses train graduates in the ''use'' of the models developed in Financial Economics, the theory is (sometimes) covered in the context of a (basic) understanding of model assumptions. Similar comments apply to professional certifications such as the [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) designation.  Note also that the [[Master of Finance]] (M.Fin.) and [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] Finance, as opposed to the ''MSF'', have a significant theory component (as well as quantitative component),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bcf.princeton.edu/master-in-finance/|title=Master in Finance - Bendheim Center for Finance - Princeton University |publisher=Princeton.edu |date=2018-01-25 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and largely overlap with the master's in Financial Economics.

Mount Allison University was the first university in the [[British Empire]] to award a baccalaureate to a woman ([[Grace Annie Lockhart]], B.Sc, 1875). Mount Allison graduates have been awarded a total of 55 [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sackvilletribunepost.com/news/local/katherine-reiss-named-mount-allison-universitys-55th-rhodes-scholar-263924/}}&lt;/ref&gt; American chemist [[James B.

Sumner - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/sumner-bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Allison also has one of the largest endowments per student in Canada.

== History ==
Mount Allison University is a United Church-affiliated (but secular) primarily undergraduate liberal arts university, established at [[Sackville, New Brunswick]] on January 19, 1843. The university was named after Charles Frederick Allison, in honour of his gift of land and money.&lt;ref name="Pound 2005"&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins were steeped in the [[Methodist]] faith and it was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members.&lt;ref name=University/&gt; The university was chartered on April 14, 1849.&lt;ref name="Pound 2005"/&gt;

There is an amusing anecdote about the family of the founder of the school, [[Methodist]] merchant, [[Charles Frederick Allison]]. Charles Allison's grandfather had emigrated from [[Ireland]] to Canada in the late 18th century because of the after effects of a dinner with the local government tax collector. Wanting to impress the man, the family had set the table with their one valuable possession: silver spoons. After entertaining their guest, the Allisons were informed by the tax collector that if they could afford silver spoons, then they could certainly afford to pay more taxes. The Allisons left [[Ireland]] shortly thereafter. The offending spoons are now on display in the university library.

In June 1839, Charles Allison was encouraged by Wesleyan Methodist Minister Rev. John Bass Strong that a school of elementary and higher learning be built. Allison offered to purchase a site in Sackville to erect a suitable building for an academy and to contribute operating funds of £100 a year for 10 years. This offer was accepted and the Wesleyan Academy for boys subsequently opened in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Reid, "ALLISON, CHARLES FREDERICK," in EN:UNDEF:public_citation_publication, vol. 8, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed January 27, 2015, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/allison_charles_frederick_8E.html.[https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/tlctd10.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, a girls' institution (later known as the "Ladies College") was opened to complement the boys' academy. In 1858 an Act of the New Brunswick Legislature authorized the trustees to establish a degree-conferring institution at Sackville, under the name of the Mount Allison Wesleyan College.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/32699/32699-h/32699-h.htm The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History, by Various 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1862, the degree-granting [[Mount Allison College]] was organized. The first two students, [[Howard Sprague]] and [[Josiah Wood]], graduated in May 1863. Mount Allison was the first university in the [[British Empire]] to confer a bachelor's degree to a woman ([[Grace Annie Lockhart]], B.Sc. 1875).&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University. {{cite web |url=http://www.mta.ca/Prospective/About/Mount_A_essentials/History_and_facts/History_and_facts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132525/http://www.mta.ca/Prospective/About/Mount_A_essentials/History_and_facts/History_and_facts/ |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first university in Canada to grant a Bachelor of Arts to a woman(Harriet Starr Stewart).&lt;ref&gt;Semple, N. (1996). ''The Lord's Dominion: The History of Canadian Methodism.'' McGill-Queen's Press, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly a century, Mount Allison functioned as three distinct, mutually enriching parts: the College proper, the Boys' Academy, and the Ladies College. The corporate name was changed to University of Mount Allison College in 1886.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"/&gt;

The university's affiliation was transferred to the [[United Church of Canada]] following church union in 1925. Original components of the university included: the Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy for Boys (1840–1958), the Ladies' College (1854–1958), and Mount Allison College. Mount Allison College was established in 1862 with degree-granting powers on behalf of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Music at Mount Allison University |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mount-allison-university-emc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SackvilleFoundersMonument.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Sackville founders monument commemorates [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]]'s incorporation and its founding peoples. It was installed on the campus of Mount Allison University in 2003.]]

The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name="University"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=University |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |edition=online |first1=P. |last1=Anisef |first2=P. |last2=Axelrod |first3=J. |last3=Lennard |date=July 20, 2015 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/university/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, Mount Allison University had three faculties: Arts, Theology, and Engineering. It awarded the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc), [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD), and [[Master of Arts]]. It had 246 male students and 73 female students, as well as 28 academic staff, all male.&lt;ref&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure of the School for Girls in 1946 and the Boy's Academy in 1953 coincided with a period of expansion and provided much-needed space for the growing university. In 1958, a period of construction and acquisition of buildings began, easing the strain of overcrowding at the institution. At this time the university board and administration decided to reaffirm the traditional aims of Mount Allison in providing a high-quality undergraduate [[liberal arts]] education, along with continuing to offer professional programs in already-established fields. As such, the university decided not to compete for new professional programs and generally avoided post-graduate course development.

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.&lt;ref name=University/&gt; Mount Allison University was established by the Mount Allison University Act, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.ca/governance/regents/MTA_act_1993.htm Mount Allison University Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230235004/http://mta.ca/governance/regents/MTA_act_1993.htm |date=2010-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Allison University's Arms and Badge were registered with the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] on November 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1201|title=Mount Allison University [Civil Institution]|first=The Office of the Secretary to the Governor|last=General|website=archive.gg.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
The mission statement of Mount Allison University promotes "the creation and dissemination of knowledge in a community of higher learning, centred on the undergraduate student and delivered in an intimate and harmonious environment". Mount Allison currently offers bachelor's degrees in Arts, Science, Commerce, Fine Arts, and Music, as well as master's degrees in biology and chemistry and biochemistry, and certificates in bilingualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.ca/apply/|title=Mount Allison University - Steps to apply|website=www.mta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bachelor's degree in Science with a major in Aviation has been developed in conjunction with the [[Moncton Flight College]].

Mount Allison has one of the best records of [[Rhodes Scholars]] per capita in Canada — 55 all together, and 14 in the past 16 years.

In 2014, 76 per cent of the student body received an entrance scholarship.

The University's enrolment is approximately 2,300 students.

== Architecture ==

Mount Allison’s architecture is one of the campus’s defining features.

In most cases, the present campus is much newer than the age of the institution, which was founded in the mid-19th century. At that time, the original Mount Allison buildings were wooden clapboarded structures all painted white. Succumbing to fires or demolition, these earlier buildings have been replaced with brick or stone structures, although a unique and significant instance of early Mount Allison wooden architecture survives at the centre of campus: the President’s Cottage of 1857.

Noted architectural historian, John Leroux, who is working with visual artist Thaddeus Holownia on a book about the University’s architecture, calls the campus "one of the finest in Canada" &lt;ref name="mta.ca"&gt;The Record. {{cite web |url=http://www.mta.ca/therecord/fall15/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222161707/http://www.mta.ca/therecord/fall15/index.html |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and says some of the most beautiful buildings built in New Brunswick in the last 100 years are located at Mount Allison.

In particular, Leroux names the Mount Allison chapel as one of the most significant buildings in the province, saying, "It is exquisite. It is nearly a perfect building." &lt;ref name="mta.ca"/&gt; The Chapel is a masterwork of the Ontario-based architecture firm of Brown, Brisley and Brown, who designed numerous new buildings and transformed the site configuration of Mount Allison in the mid- to late-1960s and early 1970s into the landscape it is today. Paramount of their scheme was the creation of the central courtyard with the Chapel as a focus at one end, and the Library’s gateway colonnade overlooking the town and Convocation Hall at the other. Among the other Brown, Brisley and Brown buildings completed at Mount Allison between 1964 and 1980 are: the Gairdner Fine Arts building, the Marjorie Young Bell Conservatory of Music, the Barclay Chemistry Building, Edwards House, Thornton House, the Ralph Pickard Bell Library, and the Harold Crabtree building.

[[File:Owens Art Gallery, Mount A.jpg|thumb|right|Owens Art Gallery]] Other significant buildings are the Owens Art Gallery, the oldest University art gallery in Canada, which opened in 1895, and Hammond House, the only registered National Historic Site in the Town of Sackville. Both were designed by noted Toronto architect Edmund Burke. The Queen Anne Revival-style Hammond House was originally built for Canadian artist and head of the Fine Arts department John Hammond in 1896. It now serves as the President’s residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.ca/Community/News/2013/August/National_Historic_Site_reopens_at_Mount_Allison/|title=Mount Allison University - National Historic Site reopens at Mount Allison|website=www.mta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several campus buildings were designed by architect Andrew R. Cobb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1618|title=Cobb, Andrew Randall - Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada|website=www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the Memorial Library (1926–27; demol. 2011), Flemington Building (1930–31), and Centennial Hall (1883–84, but redesigned by Cobb in 1933 after the original was gutted by fire).

The Memorial Library (renamed University Centre in 1970) was constructed in the Tudor-inspired Gothic Revival style. The library also included a set of plaques, now located on the ground floor atrium of the Wallace McCain Student Centre, which are listed in the Canadian Forces' National Inventory of Canadian Military Memorials – № 13002-004.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Inventory of Canadian Military Memorials|id=8237|title=Mount Allison University: Memorial 13002-004 Sackville, NB|access-date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaques list the names of Allisonians who lost their lives at war. Every year since 1927, the names of each of the fallen are read aloud during the University’s annual Remembrance Day service.

The Wallace McCain Student Centre, originally constructed as a men’s residence (Trueman House) in 1945 and designed by Halifax architect C.A. Fowler, was gutted and repurposed in 2008, keeping the exterior form and stone walls intact.

The newest building on campus is the Purdy Crawford Centre for the Arts, which opened in 2014. Housing the Department of Fine Arts and the drama program, the building features art studios, a large atrium, and the 100-seat Motyer-Fancy Theatre. Designed by the internationally honoured Canadian architecture firm Zeidler Partnership, it was featured in Canadian Architect magazine in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Architect. https://www.canadianarchitect.com/features/making-a-scene/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Housing ==
[[File:Cambellhallroom1.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the single rooms at Campbell Hall]]

Mount Allison has housing facilities available for approximately 50 percent of its student population. More than 85 percent of first-year students choose to live in residence. On-campus accommodations are guaranteed to all first-year students who meet admission and deposit deadlines. All rooms come with high speed wired as well as wireless Internet, as well as cable, phone, and mini fridge.

All buildings are co-ed with wing to wing or integrated bathrooms. Sixty percent of rooms are either single or ensuite style and 40 percent are double accommodation. Campbell Hall, winner of CBIP Award for incorporation of environment features, offers large single rooms with ensuite bathrooms. In addition, Mount Allison also offers senior students a chance to live in one of two small residences (Carriage – six rooms, Anchorage – 11 rooms.)

The following residences are open for new and returning students:
* Campbell Hall
* Harper Hall
* Windsor Hall
* Bigelow House
* Bennett House
* Hunton House
* Thornton House
* Edwards House

== Social life ==

Social life at Mount Allison tends to focus on extracurricular activities: 140 clubs and societies and over 30 varsity, club, and intramural sports teams.&lt;ref name="aucc.ca"/&gt;

Mount Allison students also socialize at places like Gracie's, The Pond (campus pub), Ducky's, Joey's, and the Bridge Street Café.

Mount Allison's campus paper, ''The Argosy'', is an independent publication produced weekly. The publication dates from 1872,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argosy.ca/about-argosy ]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the oldest student publications in the country. The campus and community radio station, [[CHMA-FM|CHMA]] 106.9 FM, is owned and operated by the members of Attic Broadcasting Company Ltd., a non-profit organization with its offices on the university campus.

[[File:MTAConvocationHall.jpg|thumb|220px|Springtime in Sackville – a view of Convocation Hall from the swan pond, Mount Allison University.]]

[[Tintamarre theatre company]] was founded at Mount Allison by Professor Alex Fancy and produces a bilingual collective show each year, staged at the Motyer-Fancy Theatre and later presented at junior and senior high schools throughout the Maritime provinces. A performing arts series is held at Convocation Hall (one of the largest concert halls east of Montreal) during the school year, and the annual President's Speakers Series &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.ca/pss|title=Mount Allison University - President's Speakers Series|website=www.mta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; brings nationally and internationally renowned speakers to campus each year.

Fine Art students run START Gallery within Struts Gallery, a CARFAC artist-run center.

== Student government ==

The Mount Allison Students’ Union (MASU) represents all full- and part-time students at Mount Allison. It operates as a membership-based non-profit corporation, and was incorporated in 1980 under the New Brunswick Companies Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masu.ca/who/about|title=About the MASU|website=masu.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics ==
{{Main|Mount Allison Mounties}}

The school's team name in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS) is the [[Mount Allison Mounties]]. The football team has appeared in the [[Vanier Cup]] national college football championship game twice (1984 &amp; 1991). The Mount Allison football team also made playoff appearances in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014. The team won the 2013 AUS championship, but lost to the Laval Rouge et Or in the [[Uteck Bowl]] (the national college football semi final) and in 2014, losing to McMaster in the Mitchell Bowl.

Mount Allison is also home to a CIS-level women's hockey team, as well as swim, badminton, and soccer teams. Basketball and volleyball teams compete against colleges and other smaller universities.

Mount Allison is the winner of the first ever [[Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association|ACAA]] men's rugby championship in 2007 and remained undefeated through 2010, resulting in four consecutive championships.&lt;ref name="ACAA Homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acaa.ca/page.php?page=43&amp;menu=9&amp;gen=m&amp;sport=rugby |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164131/http://www.acaa.ca/page.php?page=43&amp;menu=9&amp;gen=m&amp;sport=rugby |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both 2008 and 2009 the men's and women's Mounties remained undefeated throughout the regular season and became ACAA champions.&lt;ref name="ACAA Homepage"/&gt; The university women's hockey team plays at the [[Tantramar Civic Centre]].

In 2005, he began working with Zeki, who is a professor of [[Neurobiology]] at [[University College London]] (and founder of Neuroesthetics) to study what goes on in the brains of artists. They used [[neuroimaging]] and studied the [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes of artists such as the [[painting|painters]] of the [[paleolithic]] [[Chauvet Cave]] art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, he wrote and presented the paper 'Neuroarthistory: making more sense of art' which, according to [[The Art Book]] "explored the ways in which our ever-expanding knowledge of the brain invites art historians to reconsider the interaction between the senses and cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7359">'''Neurophenomenology''' refers to a scientific research program aimed to address the [[hard problem of consciousness]] in a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] way.&lt;ref&gt;D. Rudrauf, A. Lutz, D. Cosmelli, J.-P. Lachaux, M. Le Van Quyen. [http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~lutz/VarelaHommage_Biological_research_2003.pdf "From autopoiesis to neurophenomenology: Francisco Varela's exploration of the biophysics of being"], Biol Res 36: 21-59, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It combines [[neuroscience]] with [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] in order to study [[experience]], [[mind]], and [[consciousness]] with an emphasis on the [[embodied cognition|embodied]] condition of the human mind.&lt;ref name= "Gallagher"&gt;Gallagher, S. 2009. Neurophenomenology. In T. Bayne, A. Cleeremans and P. Wilken (eds.), ''Oxford Companion to Consciousness'' (470-472). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The field is very much linked to fields such as [[neuropsychology]], [[neuroanthropology]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] (also known as biopsychology) and the study of [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology in psychology]].

The label was coined by [[Charles Laughlin|C. Laughlin]], J. McManus and E. d'Aquili in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;C. Laughlin, J. McManus and E. d'Aquili: ''Brain, Symbol and Experience: Toward a Neurophenomenology of Consciousness'' (New York: Columbia University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was appropriated and given a distinctive understanding by the cognitive neuroscientist [[Francisco Varela]] in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. 1996.  Neurophenomenology: A methodological remedy for the hard problem''.  Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 3: 330-49.&lt;/ref&gt; whose work has inspired many philosophers and neuroscientists to continue with this new direction of research.

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] is a philosophical method of inquiry of everyday experience. The focus in phenomenology is on the examination of different phenomena (from Greek, ''phainomenon'', "that which shows itself") ''as they appear to consciousness'', i.e. in a first-person perspective. Thus, phenomenology is a discipline particularly useful to understand how is it that appearances present themselves to us, and how is it that we attribute meaning to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:'' Phenomenology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= G&amp;Z&gt;Gallagher, S. and Zahavi, D. 2008. ''The Phenomenological Mind''. London: Routledge, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuroscience]] is the scientific study of the brain, and deals with the third-person aspects of consciousness{{cn|date=September 2016}}. Some scientists studying consciousness believe that the exclusive utilization of either first- or third-person methods will not provide answers to the difficult questions of consciousness.

Historically, [[Edmund Husserl]] is regarded as the philosopher whose work made phenomenology a coherent philosophical discipline with a concrete methodology in the study of consciousness, namely the [[epoche]]. Husserl, who was a former student of [[Franz Brentano]], thought that in the study of mind it was extremely important to acknowledge that consciousness is characterized by [[intentionality]], a concept often explained as "aboutness"; consciousness is always consciousness ''of'' something. A particular emphasis on the phenomenology of [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] was developed by philosopher [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in the mid-20th century.

Naturally, phenomenology and neuroscience find a convergence of common interests. However, primarily because of ontological disagreements between phenomenology and [[philosophy of mind]], the dialogue between these two disciplines is still a very controversial subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/chalmersdeb3dft.htm Husserl himself was very critical towards any attempt to "naturalizing" philosophy, and his phenomenology was founded upon a criticism of [[empiricism]], "[[psychologism]]", and "anthropologism" as contradictory standpoints in philosophy and logic. Debate Between D. Chalmers and D. Dennett: The Fantasy of First-Person Science]&lt;/ref&gt; The influential critique of the ontological assumptions of computationalist and representationalist cognitive science, as well as [[artificial intelligence]], made by philosopher [[Hubert Dreyfus]] has marked new directions for integration of neurosciences with an embodied ontology. The work of Dreyfus has influenced cognitive scientists and neuroscientists to study phenomenology and [[embodied cognitive science]] and/or [[enactivism]]. One of such cases is neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]], whose [[neurodynamics|neurodynamical]] analysis has a marked Merleau-Pontyian approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.class.uh.edu/cogsci/dreyfus.html Hubert Dreyfus 'Intelligence Without Representation: Merleau-Ponty's Critique of Mental Representation']&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent trends on the matter appear to reject Dreyfus's interpretation of Husserl while at the same time maintaining a high interest in the integration of Husserlian phenomenology into the sciences of mind, as demonstrated by Evan Thompson's recent work.&lt;ref&gt;"Evan Thompson.

:''This article is about the philosophical argument; for normal conditions in the sense of standards see the corresponding articles, e.g. [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]].''

'''Normal conditions''' are a restriction on [[Philosophy|philosophical]] arguments, especially in [[epistemology]], in order to avoid objections perceived as digressive. As a reply to objections to an explanation of a [[phenomenon]], e.g. a [[hypothesis]] or a [[theory]], it is said, argument X holds [only] under normal conditions. In some cases, the concept of normal conditions tends to be rather blurred and the reply '''under normal conditions''' can tend to extend to everything that contradicts an argument. In cases, when the argument of normal conditions comes too often, according to the principle of [[Occam's Razor]] another explanation X' has to be found.

The '''normalized difference vegetation index''' ('''NDVI''') is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze [[remote sensing]] measurements, typically, but not necessarily, from a [[artificial satellite|space platform]], and assess whether the target being observed contains live green vegetation or not.

The exploration of outer space started in earnest with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957. This was the first man-made [[satellite]] orbiting the [[Earth]]. Subsequent successful launches, both in the Soviet Union (e.g., the Sputnik and [[Cosmos (satellite)|Cosmos]] programs), and in the U.S. (e.g., the [[Explorer program]]), quickly led to the design and operation of dedicated [[Weather satellite|meteorological satellites]]. These are orbiting platforms embarking instruments specially designed to observe the Earth's atmosphere and surface with a view to improve [[weather forecasting]]. Starting in 1960, the [[TIROS]] series of satellites embarked television cameras and radiometers. This was later (1964 onwards) followed by the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus]] satellites and the family of [[Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer]] instruments on board the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) platforms. The latter measures the reflectance of the planet in red and near-infrared bands, as well as in the thermal infrared. In parallel, NASA developed the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS), which became the precursor to the [[Landsat program]]. These early sensors had minimal spectral resolution, but tended to include bands in the red and near-infrared, which are useful to distinguish vegetation and clouds, amongst other targets.

With the launch of the first ERTS satellite – which was soon to be renamed [[Landsat 1]] – on July 23, 1972 with its MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) NASA funded a number of investigations to determine its capabilities for Earth remote sensing.  One of those early studies was directed toward examining the spring vegetation green-up and subsequent summer and fall dry-down (the so-called “vernal advancement and retrogradation”) throughout the north to south expanse of the [[Great Plains]] region of the central U.S.  This region covered a wide range of latitudes from the southern tip of [[Texas]] to the U.S.-Canada border, which resulted in a wide range of solar zenith angles at the time of the satellite observations.

The researchers for this Great Plains study (PhD student Donald Deering and his advisor Dr. Robert Hass) found that their ability to correlate, or quantify, the biophysical characteristics of the rangeland vegetation of this region from the satellite spectral signals was confounded by these differences in solar zenith angle across this strong latitudinal gradient.  With the assistance of a resident mathematician (Dr. John Schell), they studied solutions to this dilemma and subsequently developed the ratio of the difference of the red and infrared radiances over their sum as a means to adjust for or “normalize” the effects of the solar zenith angle.  Originally, they called this ratio the “Vegetation Index” (and another variant, the square-root transformation of the difference-sum ratio, the “Transformed Vegetation Index”); but as several other remote sensing researchers were identifying the simple red/infrared ratio and other spectral ratios as the “vegetation index,” they eventually began to identify the difference/sum ratio formulation as the normalized difference vegetation index.  The earliest reported use of NDVI in the Great Plains study was in 1973 by Rouse et al.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, J.W, Haas, R.H., Scheel, J.A., and Deering, D.W. (1974) 'Monitoring Vegetation Systems in the Great Plains with ERTS.' ''Proceedings, 3rd Earth Resource Technology Satellite (ERTS) Symposium'', vol. 1, p. 48-62. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740022592.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (Dr. John Rouse was the Director of the Remote Sensing Center of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] where the Great Plains study was conducted).  However, they were preceded in formulating a normalized difference spectral index by Kriegler et al. in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Kriegler, F.J., Malila, W.A., Nalepka, R.F., and Richardson, W. (1969) 'Preprocessing transformations and their effects on multispectral recognition.' ''Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment,'' p. 97-131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the launch of ERTS-1 (Landsat-1), Compton Tucker of NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] produced a series of early scientific journal articles describing uses of the NDVI.

Thus, NDVI was one of the most successful of many attempts to simply and quickly identify vegetated areas and their "condition," and it remains the most well-known and used index to detect live green plant canopies in multispectral remote sensing data. Once the feasibility to detect vegetation had been demonstrated, users tended to also use the NDVI to quantify the photosynthetic capacity of plant canopies. This, however, can be a rather more complex undertaking if not done properly, as is discussed below.

==Rationale==
[[Image:Par action spectrum.gif|thumb|Typical PAR action spectrum, shown beside absorption spectra for chlorophyll-A, chlorophyll-B, and carotenoids]]
Live green plants absorb solar radiation in the [[photosynthetically active radiation]] (PAR) spectral region, which they use as a source of energy in the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Leaf cells have also evolved to re-emit solar radiation in the near-infrared spectral region (which carries approximately half of the total incoming solar energy), because the photon energy at wavelengths longer than about 700 nanometers is too large to synthesize organic molecules. A strong absorption at these wavelengths would only result in overheating the plant and possibly damaging the tissues. Hence, live green plants appear relatively dark in the PAR and relatively bright in the near-infrared.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, David M. (1980) ''Biophysical Ecology'', Springer-Verlag, New York, 611 p.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, clouds and snow tend to be rather bright in the red (as well as other visible wavelengths) and quite dark in the near-infrared.
The pigment in plant leaves, chlorophyll, strongly absorbs visible light (from 0.4 to 0.7&amp;nbsp;µm) for use in photosynthesis. The cell structure of the leaves, on the other hand, strongly reflects near-infrared light (from 0.7 to 1.1&amp;nbsp;µm). The more leaves a plant has, the more these wavelengths of light are affected, respectively.
Since early instruments of Earth Observation, such as [[NASA]]'s ERTS and [[NOAA]]'s AVHRR, acquired data in visible and near-infrared, it was natural to exploit the strong differences in plant reflectance to determine their spatial distribution in these satellite images.

The NDVI is calculated from these individual measurements as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NDVI}=\frac{(\mbox{NIR}-\mbox{Red})}{(\mbox{NIR}+\mbox{Red})}&lt;/math&gt;

where red and NIR stand for the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the red (visible) and near-infrared regions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|title=Measuring Vegetation}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spectral reflectances are themselves ratios of the reflected over the incoming radiation in each spectral band individually, hence they take on values between 0.0 and 1.0. By design, the NDVI itself thus varies between -1.0 and +1.0.  It should be noted that NDVI is functionally, but not linearly, equivalent to the simple infrared/red ratio (NIR/VIS).  The advantage of NDVI over a simple infrared/red ratio is therefore generally limited to any possible linearity of its functional relationship with vegetation properties (e.g. biomass).  The simple ratio (unlike NDVI) is always positive, which may have practical advantages, but it also has a mathematically infinite range (0 to infinity), which can be a practical disadvantage as compared to NDVI.  Also in this regard, note that the VIS term in the numerator of NDVI only scales the result, thereby creating negative values. NDVI is functionally ''and linearly'' equivalent to the ratio NIR / (NIR+VIS), which ranges from 0 to 1 and is thus never negative nor limitless in range.&lt;ref&gt;Crippen, R.E. (1990)  'Calculating the vegetation index faster,'  ''Remote Sensing of Environment'', '''34''',  71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the most important concept in the understanding of the NDVI algebraic formula is that, despite its name, it is a transformation of a spectral ratio (NIR/VIS), and it has no functional relationship to a spectral difference (NIR-VIS).

In general, if there is much more reflected radiation in near-infrared wavelengths than in visible wavelengths, then the vegetation in that pixel is likely to be dense and may contain some type of forest. Subsequent work has shown that the NDVI is directly related to the photosynthetic capacity and hence energy absorption of plant canopies.&lt;ref&gt;Sellers, P. J. (1985) 'Canopy reflectance, photosynthesis, and transpiration',  ''International Journal of Remote Sensing'', '''6''', 1335-1372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myneni, R. B., F. G. Hall, P.J. Sellers, and A.L. Marshak (1995) 'The interpretation of spectral vegetation indexes', ''IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing'', '''33''', 481-486.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the index admits to go from -1 to 1, even in more densely populated [[Urban area|urban areas]] the value of normal NDVI is positive, although closer to zero. Negative values are more likely to be disturbed in the atmosphere and some specific [[Material|materials]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sistemas.uepg.br/producao/pro-reitorias/propesp/pesquisa/pibic/arquivos/bolsista/relatorio_final/relatorio/16005703@uepg.br/2017/relatorio_final.pdf|title=Urban Climate: surface temperature and NDVI an analysis of influences in Ponta Grossa-PR|last=Kubaski|first=Kauan Mateus|date=|website=|publisher=[[State University of Ponta Grossa|UEPG]] (Pro-rector of Research and Post-graduation-PROPESP)|language=pt-br|archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/72Kk9SpH6|archive-date=September 10, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance and limitations==
[[File:NDVI 2017-09-10.png|left|thumb|The surrounding fields and water bodies like the dam to the northeast help to mask with high values in [[Ponta Grossa]], [[southern Brazil]]]]
It can be seen from its mathematical definition that the NDVI of an area containing a dense vegetation canopy will tend to positive values (say 0.3 to 0.8) while clouds and snow fields will be characterized by negative values of this index. Other targets on Earth visible from space include

* free standing water (e.g., oceans, seas, lakes and rivers) which have a rather low reflectance in both spectral bands (at least away from shores) and thus result in very low positive or even slightly negative NDVI values,
* soils which generally exhibit a near-infrared spectral reflectance somewhat larger than the red, and thus tend to also generate rather small positive NDVI values (say 0.1 to 0.2).

In addition to the simplicity of the algorithm and its capacity to broadly distinguish vegetated areas from other surface types, the NDVI also has the advantage of compressing the size of the data to be manipulated by a factor 2 (or more), since it replaces the two spectral bands by a single new field (eventually coded on 8 bits instead of the 10 or more bits of the original data).

The NDVI has been widely used in applications for which it was not originally designed. Using the NDVI for quantitative assessments (as opposed to qualitative surveys as indicated above) raises a number of issues that may seriously limit the actual usefulness of this index if they are not properly addressed.{{cn|date=July 2016}} The following subsections review some of these issues.

* Mathematically, the sum and the difference of the two spectral channels contain the same information as the original data, but the difference alone (or the normalized difference) carries only part of the initial information. Whether the missing information is relevant or valuable is for the user to judge, but it is important to understand that an NDVI product carries only a fraction of the information available in the original spectral reflectance data.
*[[File:NDVI.jpg|thumb|Generated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the satellite images]]Users of NDVI have tended to estimate a large number of vegetation properties from the value of this index. Typical examples include the [[Leaf Area Index]], [[biomass]], chlorophyll concentration in leaves, plant productivity, fractional vegetation cover, accumulated rainfall, etc. Such relations are often derived by correlating space-derived NDVI values with ground-measured values of these variables. This approach raises further issues related to the spatial scale associated with the measurements, as satellite sensors always measure radiation quantities for areas substantially larger than those sampled by field instruments. Furthermore, it is of course illogical to claim that all these relations hold at once, because that would imply that all of these environmental properties would be directly and unequivocally related between themselves.
* The reflectance measurements should be relative to the same area and be acquired simultaneously. This may not be easy to achieve with instruments that acquire different spectral channels through different cameras or focal planes. Mis-registration of the spectral images may lead to substantial errors and unusable results.

Also, the calculation of the NDVI value turns out to be sensitive to a number of perturbing factors including

* Atmospheric effects: The actual composition of the atmosphere (in particular with respect to water vapor and aerosols) can significantly affect the measurements made in space. Hence, the latter may be misinterpreted if these effects are not properly taken into account (as is the case when the NDVI is calculated directly on the basis of raw measurements).
* Clouds: Deep (optically thick) clouds may be quite noticeable in satellite imagery and yield characteristic NDVI values that ease their screening. However, thin clouds (such as the ubiquitous cirrus), or small clouds with typical linear dimensions smaller than the diameter of the area actually sampled by the sensors, can significantly contaminate the measurements. Similarly, cloud shadows in areas that appear clear can affect NDVI values and lead to misinterpretations.  These considerations are minimized by forming composite images from daily or near-daily images.&lt;ref&gt;Holben, B. N. (1986)'Characteristics of Maximum-Value Composite Images from Temporal AVHRR Data','' International Journal of Remote Sensing'', '''7(11)''',  1417-1434.&lt;/ref&gt;  Composite NDVI images have led to a large number of new vegetation applications where the NDVI or photosynthetic capacity varies over time.
* Soil effects: Soils tend to darken when wet, so that their reflectance is a direct function of water content. If the spectral response to moistening is not exactly the same in the two spectral bands, the NDVI of an area can appear to change as a result of soil moisture changes (precipitation or evaporation) and not because of vegetation changes.
* Anisotropic effects: All surfaces (whether natural or man-made) reflect light differently in different directions, and this form of anisotropy is generally spectrally dependent, even if the general tendency may be similar in these two spectral bands. As a result, the value of NDVI may depend on the particular anisotropy of the target and on the angular geometry of illumination and observation at the time of the measurements, and hence on the position of the target of interest within the swath of the instrument or the time of passage of the satellite over the site. This is particularly crucial in analyzing AVHRR data since the orbit of the NOAA platforms tended to drift in time. At the same time, the use of composite NDVI images minimizes these considerations and has led to global time series NDVI data sets spanning more than 25 years.
* Spectral effects: Since each sensor has its own characteristics and performances, in particular with respect to the position, width and shape of the spectral bands, a single formula like NDVI yields different results when applied to the measurements acquired by different instruments.

For these reasons, the NDVI should be used with great caution. In any quantitative application that necessitates a given level of accuracy, all the perturbing factors that could result in errors or uncertainties of that order of magnitude should be explicitly taken into account; this may require extensive processing based on ancillary data and other sources of information.  More recent versions of NDVI datasets have attempted to account for these complicating factors through processing.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

A number of derivatives and alternatives to NDVI have been proposed in the scientific literature to address these limitations, including the Perpendicular Vegetation Index,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, A. J. and C. L. Wiegand (1977) 'Distinguishing vegetation from soil background information', ''Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing'', '''43''', 1541-1552.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index]],&lt;ref&gt;Huete, A. R. (1988)'A soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)', ''Remote Sensing of Environment'', '''25''', 53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Y. J. and D. Tanre (1992) 'Atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI) for EOS-MODIS', in  'Proc. IEEE Int. Geosci. and Remote Sensing Symp. '92'', IEEE, New York, 261-270.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Environment Monitoring Index.&lt;ref&gt;Pinty, B. and M. M. Verstraete (1992) 'GEMI: A non-linear index to monitor global vegetation from satellites', ''Vegetatio'', '''101''', 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these attempted to include intrinsic correction(s) for one or more perturbing factors. It is not until the mid-1990s, however, that a new generation of algorithms were proposed to estimate directly the biogeophysical variables of interest (e.g., the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation or [[FAPAR]]), taking advantage of the enhanced performance and characteristics of modern sensors (in particular their multispectral and multiangular capabilities) to take all the perturbing factors into account.  In spite of many possible perturbing factors upon the NDVI, it remains a valuable quantitative vegetation monitoring tool when the photosynthetic capacity of the land surface needs to be studied at the appropriate spatial scale for various phenomena.

'''Nutritional anthropology''' is the interplay between [[human biology]], [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==General economics and nutrition==
===General economic summary===
Most scholars construe economy as involving the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services within and between societies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} A key concept in a broad study of economies (versus a particular econometric study of commodities and stock markets) is social relations. For instance, many [[economic anthropology|economic anthropologists]] state that the [[:wikt:reciprocal|reciprocal]] gift exchange, competitive gift exchange, and impersonal market exchange are all reflective of dominant paradigms of social relations within a given society.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The main forms of economy extant around most of the world today, in terms of a simple production, distribution, consumption model, are subsistence based and market economies. Subsistence refers to production and consumption on a small-scale of the household or community, while a market-based economy implies a much broader scale of production, distribution, and consumption. A [[market economy]] also entails the exchange of goods for currency, versus bartering commodities or being under continuing reciprocal gift exchange obligations. This is not to say that market economies do not coexist with subsistence economies and other forms, but that one type usually dominates within a given society. However, a broad array of scholarship exists, stating that market economies are rapidly increasing in importance on a global scale, even in societies that have traditionally relied much more heavily on [[subsistence production]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This economic shift has nutritional implications that this entry will explore further.

===Modes of production and nutrition===
The most important step in understanding the links between economics and nutrition is to understand major modes of production that societies have used to produce the goods (and services) they have needed throughout human history; these modes are foraging, shifting cultivation, pastoralism, agriculture, and industrialism (Park 2006).
 
Foraging, also known as [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]], is a subsistence strategy in which a group of people gathers wild plants and hunts wild animals in order to obtain food. This strategy was the sole mode of existence for human beings for the vast majority of human history (inclusive of the archeological and fossil record) and continued to be practiced by a few groups at least into the middle part of the 20th century. This mode of production is generally associated with small, nomadic groups of no more than fifty, also known as bands. The vast majority of foraging societies do not acknowledge exclusive ownership of land or other major resources, though they do acknowledge primary use rights for groups and people may individually possess small objects or tools such as a bow or cutting tools. Because foraging usually involves frequent movement and taking food naturally available rather than altering landscapes for production, many scholars state the foraging has a minimal negative environmental impact compared to other modes of production. Though foragers are generally limited in absolute amount of food available in a given area, foraging groups such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung]] in the [[Kalahari Desert]] have often been cited as having a more diverse diet and spending less time per week procuring food than societies that practice other modes of production such as intensive agriculture. &lt;br /&gt;
 
[[Shifting cultivation]] is a mode of production involving the low intensity production of plant-based foods; this mode is also known as horticulture or ‘slash and burn agriculture’ in some texts. Horticultural societies are generally situated in semi-sedentary villages of a few hundred that clear a field and burn the cleared vegetation in order to use the ashes to nourish the soil (hence the phrase slash and burn). Next, the group plants a crop or crops in this clearing and uses it for cultivation for several years. At the end of this period, the entire village relocates and starts the process anew, leaving the old clearing fallow for a period of decades in order to allow regeneration through the regrowth of wild vegetation. These food items can be supplemented through the raising of livestock, hunting wild game, and in many cases with the gathering of wild plants (Miller 2005; Park 2006). Though periodic movement precludes absolute permanent ownership of land, some horticultural societies fiercely defend current territories and practice violence against neighboring groups. For instance, [[Napoleon Chagnon]] (1997) depicts the [[Yanamamo]] of [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]] as the “Fierce People”, though others have been highly critical of Chagnon’s account of this society. Horticulture can also produce a broad diet, and in some cases more food per unit of land area than foraging. Though populations of horticulturalists tend to have greater density than those of foragers, they are generally less dense than those which practice other modes of production. If practiced on a small scale, over a large area, with long fallow periods, horticulture has less negative environmental impact than agriculture or industrialism, but more than foraging (Miller 2005). Generally, horticulture coincides with a subsistence type of economy in terms of production, distribution.
 
[[Pastoralism]], defined as reliance on products from livestock coupled with a seasonal nomadic herding tradition, is similar to horticulture in that it is extensive in its use of land area. Social groups in pastoral societies tend to have similar numbers and population density to horticultural societies. Pastoral societies often trade animal products with agricultural societies for plant based foods to augment their diet. Frequent movement often means that pastoralism has a similar environmental impact to horticulture, though instances of overgrazing, and consequent land degradation (see later subsection under Globalization and Nutrition), have been sited in some cases. Pastoralism generally entails a greater reliance on meat or other animal products, such as milk or blood, than other modes of production. This mode of production has a similar use rights profile to shifting cultivation. Traditionally, pastoralism has coincided with a subsistence based economy, but in the last several decades, some pastoralist societies, such as [[Mongolia]], have herded animals and practiced nomadic living patterns but have produced livestock primarily for market exchange.
 
[[Agriculture]], sometimes referred to as intensive agriculture, involves clearing and using the same plot of land for an extended period, sometimes several generations; it also involves the use of plows and [[draft animals]] in the preparation of land for planting and the cultivation of crops. Agriculture often supports much higher population densities than other modes of production (except industrialism) and agricultural societies can range in population from a few thousand into the millions. Though agriculture produces more food per unit of land area than the previously mentioned modes, the tendency of agricultural societies to focus on relatively few crops has often meant that these societies have much less diverse diets than foraging and horticultural societies. There is some archaeological and fossil evidence that populations in transition from foraging to agriculture have tended to suffer reduced stature, reduced musculature, and to exhibit other markers of malnutrition. Research has suggested that agriculture paradoxically allows a higher, but less healthy population for a given area. The advent of agriculture has marked that advent of social stratification in many parts of the world, with marked differentials in access to resources between segments of the same society. This mode of production also is more likely to entail permanent individual or family ownership of particular tracts of land than previously mentioned modes of production. Agriculture has co-occurred with both subsistence and market economies, often with a single society exhibiting some degree of both types of economies and has a more negative impact on the environment than the aforementioned modes of production.
 
[[Industrialism]] combines agriculture with mechanized industrial production of goods through the use of [[fossil fuels]]. Additionally, industrial societies use mechanized equipment in order to prepare land for planting, harvest crops, and distribute food to locations distant from where the original crops were planted. Industrialism shows similar trends to agriculture in terms of population density, and environmental impact, except to a much greater degree. Dietary diversity can be highly variable under an industrial mode of production and can depend on access to foods produced for local subsistence on the one hand, or to income level and purchasing power visa vie foods available in food markets (Leatherman and Goodman 2005). Dietary diversity and nutritional health often correlate with the degree of social stratification within an industrial society and sometimes between societies. With the exception of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] model states, industrial societies are heavily based on the concept of private property rights and the accumulation of profit through “free enterprise”.
 
The general trend for many societies over the past several millennia has been toward agriculture, and in the past two centuries, toward industrialism. Though these two modes of production are by no means superior to other modes in every respect, the fact that societies that practice them tend to have larger populations, higher population densities, and a more complex social structure has correlated with the geographic expansion of agricultural and industrial societies at the expense of societies emphasizing other modes of production. Concurrent with this trend toward intensified agricultural and industrial production has been the rise of the social and economic paradigm of capitalism, which entails the production and sale of goods and services in the market place in order to produce a profit. These trends have had profound implications for nutritional status for human beings on a global scale. In order to discern how broader economic and environmental trends affect a community’s food systems, food security, and nutritional status, it is important to summarize one of the most significant economic and ecological phenomena today, [[globalization]]. The next section will treat the linkages between economic and ideological trends over the last several centuries and environmental and political economic factors affecting access to food and nutritional status.

==Globalization and nutrition==
===General summary of globalization===
Though the scope and dimensions of globalization as most people currently construe it are of fairly recent origin, the broader phenomenon of global interconnections through cultural diffusion and trade is several centuries old. Starting in the late Fifteenth century, European powers expanded beyond the European sub-continent to found colonies in the Americas, East Asia, South Asia, Australia and Oceania. This expansion has had a profound impact in terms of wealth creation in Europe and extraction elsewhere, cultural changes in most of the world’s societies, and biological phenomena such as the introduction of several infectious diseases into the [[Western Hemisphere]], which caused tremendous disruption and population reduction for indigenous societies there. These events, far from occurring coincidentally, have had synergistic relationships, in one vivid example, the decimation of [[Amerindian]] populations through infectious disease often preceding and facilitating subsequent conquest by European powers. Such conquests in turn have often had significantly negative impacts on internal cohesion, ability of populations to attain adequate resources for their own subsistence and traditional social obligations, and local environments for colonized societies. In order to understand the effects of globalization on nutritional status and food security, it is important to understand the historical circumstances that have led to contemporary globalization, and that still manifest themselves in political, social, material, and physical/health differentials between (and within) the different peoples of the world today.
 
“The Rise of the Merchant, Industrialist, and Capital Controller,” written by Richard Robbins in 2005, uses a hypothetical scenario of the reader as a “merchant adventurer” to detail economic world history starting in 1400. In 1400, China was arguably the most cosmopolitan and technologically complex society in the world. It was a center of trade, along with the Middle East, East Africa, and ports on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Western Europe, while playing a part in this network, did not dominate it by any means; one could argue for European marginalization in fact. This circumstance began to change when the Europeans “discovered” the Americas, setting in motion a process that would disrupt many societies and devastate indigenous populations of the Western Hemisphere. The dominant economic paradigm of this period was [[mercantilism]], whereby European merchants began to achieve power in world markets and in relation to European governing aristocracies. Robbins cites example of government protections that facilitated mercantilism in the form of exclusive proprietary rights to trading companies and armies used to protect trade by force if necessary. He details instances of government protection such as the example of how Great Britain destroyed India's textile industry and turned that society into an importer of textiles is especially illustrative. In dealing with [[imperialism]], capitalism, and the rise of corporations, Robins further details the manner in which the “West” transformed various regions/peoples from proactive participants on global trade networks into sources of raw materials and consumers of European or [[North American]] exports. This history of world trade is important to the consideration of current issues of disparity of power and wealth.
 
There are many critiques the policies of the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in the promotion of high intensity capital investment in developing nations (e.g. Weller et al. 2001; Fort et al. 2004). Disparities within nations and growing poverty rates in many nations also provide compelling evidence of the idea that the rewards of [[economic globalization]] are uneven at best. There is a great deal of literature about globalization and increases in health disparities both between and within countries.
 
Finally, there is [[Amartya Sen]] with ''[[Development as Freedom]]'' (1999); here Sen disagrees about whether or not the world’s poor are getting poorer, but also maintains that this criterion is not the most important. He argues that relative disparities and power differentials are the most important problems of globalization. Sen states that the increasing interconnection of the Worlds societies can have positive benefits, but that the disparities and opportunities for exploitation must be mitigated to the greatest extent possible, if they can not be eliminated outright. Sen provides groundwork for a nuanced middle ground between unabashed proponents and opponents of globalization. 
 
Far from being universally decried, the recent accelerated expansion of western capitalism, geographically, politically, and ideologically, has been lauded in many quarters. International and bilateral agencies such as the World Bank, IMF, and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) have utilized free market capitalist theories extensively in development programs in many corners of the globe whose state aims are to promote economic growth for communities and nation-states and to alleviate poverty. Likewise prominent individuals such as former [[U.S. Federal Reserve Board]] Chair [[Alan Greenspan]] and U.S. based journalist [[Thomas Friedman]] have held forth extensively about the possibilities of economic and social improvement in developed and developing nations alike, mainly through increased access to appropriate education, sophisticated communications and transportation technology, and a paradigm of social and economic “flexibility”, where individuals and communities who can best adapt to rapid changes in the role of governments and the particular economic base of a given location would be in the best position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by economic, political, and cultural globalization. This free market ideology is also predominant in the policies and procedures of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and many transnational corporations (TNC’s), most of which are headquartered in developed nations. The rise of Capitalism and the free market society have indeed increased and exacerbated food insecurity in the world's poor due to the structure and function of a Capitalist society where only those who can afford to buy food to feed themselves are the only ones with access to a secure and adequate food supply. Food is no longer a human right to life and health due to the Capitalist approach to commodifying food in the free market society that as a result of globalization has spread all over the world. Transnational corporations and trade organizations such as NAFTA facilitate this approach of commodifying our world's food supply by enforcing laws and regulations which further deepen the inequality of wealth and unequal distribution of common goods such as food between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Health, Wealth and the Environment: the Impacts of the CUSTA, GATT and NAFTA on Canadian Food Security|journal=Toronto Food Policy Council Discussion Paper Series|date=August 1994|issue=Discussion Paper #2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to the “western” economic model, most early social scholarship about economics stressed the predominance of reciprocity as a primary driving force in traditional non-Western societies. [[Marcel Mauss]] referred to the gift as a “total social phenomenon”, fraught with ritual and socio political as well as material significance. Though some objects, such as armbands or shell necklaces in the kula ring that runs through several island groups off the coast of [[Papua New Guinea]], might induce some form of prestige based competition, the terms of exchange are significantly different than a monetary transaction under a modern capitalist system. While [[Appadurai]] actually describes ritual objects as a type of commodity, he couches them as such under significantly different terms than the market-based types of commodity normally treated by economists. Annette Wiener criticizes earlier works in anthropology and sociology that depicted “simple” societies utilizing a simple version of reciprocity. Whatever the theoretical stance of social scholars on non-western traditional economies, there is a consensus that such essentials as food and water tended to be shared more freely than other types of goods or services. This dynamic tends to change with the introduction of a market-based economy into a society, with food coming to be increasingly treated as a commodity, rather than a social good or an essential component of health and survival.

Regardless of one’s overall perspective on the costs and benefits of economic globalization, there are several examples in social scholarship of groups of people suffering a decline in nutritional statues subsequent to the introduction of a capitalist market-based economy into an area that has previously practiced an economy based more on subsistence production and reciprocity. Although some people’s food security may improve with access to more steady income, many people in communities that have heretofore practiced a [[subsistence economy]] may experienced greater food insecurity and nutritional status due to insufficient income to replace the foods no longer produced by a household. Whether the growth of food insecurity and socioeconomic disparities in many parts of the world in recent decades is an inherent part of globalization or a temporary “growing pain” until economic development attains its full efficacy is a matter of debate, but there are many empirical examples of communities being dissociated from traditional means of food production and not being able to find sufficient wages in a new market economy to achieve a balanced and calorically sufficient diet. Several factors affecting food security and nutritional status range on a continuum from more physical phenomena such as land degradation and land expropriation, to more culturally and socio-politically driven things such as cash cropping, dietary delocalization, and commoditization of food; one important caveat is that all of these trends are interconnected and fall under a broad category of socio-cultural and economic disruptions and dislocations under the current paradigm of globalization.

===Land degradation===
Though Blakie and Brookfield acknowledge the problematic aspects of defining [[land degradation]], with definitional variation depending in large part on the scholar or stakeholder in question, they do outline a general idea of reduced soil fertility and reduced ability of a given area of land to provide for people’s subsistence needs, as compared to earlier periods in human history on that same land area. [[Paul Farmer]] discusses the effects of land degradation in central [[Haiti]] on local people’s ability to produce sufficient food for their families within the environs of their own communities. Farmer links malnutrition in a Haitian village with vulnerability to infectious diseases, including [[tuberculosis]] and [[HIV/AIDS]], both in terms of chance of infection and severity of symptoms for those infected. While the extremely low percentage of the U.S. population involved in agriculture strongly suggests that direct access to arable land is not an absolute necessity for food security and nutritional health, land degradation in many developing nations is accelerating the rate of rural to urban migration at a more accelerated rate than most major cities are equipped to handle. Leatherman and Goodman also allude to land degradation co-occurring with decreases in food security and nutritional status in some communities in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Quintana Roo]]. Walter Edgar discusses the correlation between land degradation and economic disruption, as well as nutritional hardship, in the U.S. state of [[South Carolina]] in the decades following the [[Reconstruction Period]]. Coupled with land expropriation, land degradation has the effect of thrusting unprepared subsistence producers or other peasant farmers into a fast-paced and complex market economy heavily influence by policy makers who are far removed from the concerns and worldview of small scale farmers in developing countries.

===Land expropriation===
Occurring for a variety of reasons, land expropriation, or the disruption of traditional ownership of land by more powerful interests such as local elites, governments, or transnational corporations, can also markedly affect nutritional status. Robbins details examples in Mexico of peasants facing land expropriation in the face of agribusiness consolidation under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA); in many cases, these subsistence producers are forced either to migrate to cities or work sporadically as agricultural labors. Since most if not all food must be purchased under these circumstances, the food security and nutritional status of these newer additions to the pool of poor unskilled labor often declines. Another common impetus for expropriation is non-agricultural “economic development”, often in the form of tourism. In one Example, Donald MacLeod details curtailment of subsistence activities, mainly fishing and cultivation, in areas of the [[Canary Islands]] in the face of pressures from tourism interests wishing to monopolize the “pristine” beauty of locations catering to Germans and other tourists from EU nations. Ironically, local people see relatively little monetary benefit from the rise in tourism, as many vacations are planned by German tour companies (linked with all inclusive German owned resorts in the Canary Islands) and are paid for before tourists ever arrive at their vacation destination. Leatherman and Goodman and Daltabuit point to circumscription of land available for traditional milpa horticultural production in communities in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo in the face of growing demands for land for resorts by tourism interests, under the auspices of the Mexican national government. One expropriation scenario with a long history is cash cropping, where crops grown for revenue from exports are prioritized over crops grown for local consumption.

===Cash cropping===
In ''[[Sweetness and Power]]'', written by [[Sidney Mintz]] in 1985, details examples of mono-cropping, or planting massive areas with one cash crop, in several Caribbean Islands, including Cuba. He states that Cuba went from being an economically diverse place with many small scale subsistence producers to a mono-crop plantation system dependent on cash from its sugar crop and substantial food imports for the later centuries of the Spanish Colonial Period. He describes Cuba as an example of growing impoverishment and malnutrition concurrent with increasing concentration of land and other resources in fewer hands. Gross and Underwood illustrate the mid Twentieth Century example of the advent of sisal production in [[Northeastern Brazil]]. These authors detail a vicious cycle of the unfulfilled promises of [[sisal]] production for smallholders; because owners of sisal processing machines did not think small farms worth their time, small holders could not process and sell their sisal and were often forced to work as laborers on large farms. Sisal is cited as being particularly insidious because it is hard to eradicate once introduced and makes subsequent subsistence production virtually impossible. This article treats a common situation of households prioritizing working males in food allocation, exposing growing children to malnutrition, particularly under nutrition and micronutrient deficiency, and all of its attendant ills. Edgar discusses how exclusive planting of cotton in the Southeastern United States during the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries caused substantial land degradation, lead to a great deal of land expropriation from small scale farmers, and occurred in a context of widespread malnutrition. Especially in Today’s complex, accelerated version of globalization, cash cropping is intimately linked with the delocalization of diets and the commoditization of food and has profound, though varied, implications for food security and nutritional status.

===Delocalization and commoditization===
In “Diet and Delocalization: Dietary Challenges since 1750”, Pelto and Pelto trace the concurrent historical development of global capitalism and dietary delocalization, a process in which increasing portions of diet for a household or community come from an increasing distance away from that same community. Nutritional scholars explicitly state that delocalization does not necessarily entail increased food insecurity and malnutrition, but that access to an adequate diet becomes increasingly removed from local control and increasingly contingent on access to hard cash or some other non-food precious resource. Leatherman and Goodman discuss the ironic result of their study in Quintana Roo that both the groups with the best and worst food security and nutritional status worked in service industries related to tourism, with the median group being a milpa community. They differentiate between those with stable employment and income who have access to a wide variety of foods on a regular basis and those with sporadic employment who struggle for caloric sufficiency within the household and have low dietary diversity. The main import of these examples is not that delocalization is universally negative, but that it tends to increase disparities of food security and nutritional status within and between social groups, with some segments suffering marked degradation of both.
 
Closely linked with delocalization is food commoditization, or the treatment of food primarily as a market commodity, rather than prioritizing other uses, such as sustenance, human rights entitlement, or social relations. Dewey describes the deleterious effects of food commoditization for rural communities in Central America, to include reductions in food security and nutritional status. Much of tourism literature details marked increases in the commoditization of food subsequent to the introduction of tourism as a form of market based economic development. Dewey and Robbins also state that when food is primarily seen as a commodity by powerful interests, not only does such an ideology increase delocalization, but also land degradation and expropriation as elite land owners or transnational corporations cause massive social and ecological disruptions in the process of mono-cropping food crops over broad swaths of land in order to reap maximum profits from overseas sales. Indeed, delocalization and commoditization have significant potential to diminish food security and nutritional status in poor communities over broad areas of the world.

===Dietary health===
In terms of food security and dietary diversity, which are defined as reliable access to a caloric sufficiency and access to a wide variety of macro and micro nutrients in order to maintain nutritive balance, respectively, the commoditization of food plays a key role in diminishing the control local populations have over their own subsistence production. Delocalization of food systems, which Pelto and Pelto&lt;ref name= Pelto&gt;Pelto and Pelto (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; define as taking production of food out of a local subsistence context and tying it to geographically broader market systems, can precipitate marked cultural and nutritional disruption. Likewise commoditization of food systems, defined as a paradigm shift from one of subsistence or social significances shift toward one which treats food primarily as a market commodity,&lt;ref name= Dewey&gt;Dewey (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; can affect dietary health as well as collective identity. Commoditization tends to shift food security and dietary diversity away from integrated kinship or other reciprocal distribution networks toward being an issue of who can best compete in a free market to achieve these ends; indeed, commoditization has often been linked to breakdowns in food entitlements, which are defined as cultural or social norms that ensure food access for all members of a given social group.&lt;ref name= leather&gt;Leatherman and Goodman (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= messer&gt;Messer et al. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The deleterious effects of mild to moderate [[malnutrition]] (MMM) not only pertain to caloric insufficiency (often closely associated with food insecurity) but also to poor dietary diversity; in particular, curtailed access to protein, complex carbohydrates, zinc, iron, and other micronutrients.&lt;ref name= leather/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crooks (1998) pp.339-355&lt;/ref&gt; The ways in which undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency interact with other health effects are [[myriad]]. The most obvious manifestation of MMM, stunting is defined as height and or weight below the standard range for a particular age group. However, far from being a mere difference in height and weight, stunting was correlated with a wide variety of health effects.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) pp.237-251&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related to stunting, level of physical activity closely articulates with nutritional status and affects childhood development. Chronically malnourished infants and toddlers showed decreased physical activity compared to supplemented groups or those who are adequately nourished.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) pp.249-251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1984) pp.172-173&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps, the most critical facets of human development correlated to nutrition levels are behavior and cognition; development in these two areas could have profound effects on life chances for individuals and populations. In comparing a group of southern Mexican children subject to MMM and a group in the same region who received dietary supplements, Chavez et al.&lt;ref name= Chavez&gt;Chavez et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; show a relation between MMM and poorer school performance; unsupplemented children showed poorer participation, greater degree of in-class distraction, more sleeping in class, and poorer performance on standardized tests. In addition, malnourished children showed poorer scores on [[intelligence quotient]] (I.Q.) tests than their supplemented counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) pp.248-249&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Of all the aspects of human existence, [[sexual reproduction]] may have the most detailed articulation with malnutrition. In populations subject to MMM, menarche occurs later (15.5 years) than in adequately nourished populations; an early average [[menopause]] (40.5 years) makes for a relatively short reproductive period for women in the study area for Chavez et al.&lt;ref name= Chavez236&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) pp.236, 239&lt;/ref&gt; Because of longer postpartum periods of [[amenorrhea]], birth spacing was an average of 27 months, versus 19 months.&lt;ref name= Chavez236/&gt; Though longer birth spacing can help control population growth, the evidence that Chavez et al.&lt;ref name= Chavez/&gt; present suggest a curtailing of reproductive choice and adaptability due to malnutrition. This study also linked maternal MMM with higher infant and young child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez et al. (2000) p.236&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of MMM crucial to life chances is work capacity; MMM shows a cyclical pattern of decreasing work capacity and its rewards, further exacerbating the problem. Allen&lt;ref name= Allen/&gt; found a correlation between reduced VO2 max rates among MMM populations and decreased muscular strength and endurance in the performance of strenuous manual labor. Although personal motivation can have a strong positive impact on individual work performance, better muscular development associated with a history of adequate nutrition increases overall work capacity, irrespective of effort. Among [[Jamaica]]n cane cutters, those within normal size range cut more cane than those who showed stunting. One cultural variation in this trend was found among MMM [[Guatemala]]n workers who put forth work effort comparable to better nourished counterparts, but were likely to engage in resting behavior than in recreational or social activity during off hours.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1984) p.173&lt;/ref&gt; In wage economies where workers get paid in proportion to productive output, reduced work capacity can translate to reduced food security, increasing the risk of MMM.
 
Additionally, malnutrition and [[infectious disease]] have a synergistic relationship that can lead to spiraling health deterioration. According to Allen,&lt;ref name= Allen&gt;Allen (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; the incidence of infectious disease does not vary significantly between MMM and adequately nourished populations, but the duration and severity of disease episodes is greater for MMM populations.&lt;ref name= Allen/&gt; A key reason for this disparity is that infectious disease often results in poor food intake and nutrient absorption. Not only do sick people generally eat little, but what they do eat is often of minimal benefit due to nausea and diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1984) p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from MMM due to under-nutrition or micro-nutrient deficiency, over-nutrition, defined as the consumption of too many calories for one’s body size and physical activity level,&lt;ref name= Crooks&gt;Crooks (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; is also becoming an increasingly significant problem for much of the World. [[Overnutrition]] has been associated with obesity, which the USDA&lt;ref name= USDA&gt;USDA (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and McEwen and Seeman&lt;ref name= McEwen&gt;McEwen and Seeman (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; correlate with increased risk of type II [[diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and stroke. Overnutrition is also often associated with the co-occurrence of caloric sufficiency (or over-sufficiency) and micronutrient deficiency, as is often the case where processed foods that are high in calories, but low in most nutrients, increase in dietary prominence.&lt;ref name= Crooks/&gt;&lt;ref name= USDA/&gt;&lt;ref name= Evans&gt;Evans (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Leatherman and Goodman&lt;ref name= leather/&gt; and Guest and Jones&lt;ref name= guest&gt;Guest and Jones (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the growing coincidence of stunting and other symptoms of MMM and obesity within developing nations, sometimes within the same community. This trend can be linked to changing economies and food practices in much of the World under contemporary economic globalization.

'''Optical engineering''' is the field of study that focuses on applications of [[optics]]. Optical engineers design components of [[optical instrument]]s such as [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[microscope]]s, [[telescope]]s, and other equipment that utilizes the properties of [[light]]. Other devices include optical sensors and measurement systems, [[laser]]s, [[fiber optic communication]] systems, [[optical disc]] systems (e.g. [[CD]], [[DVD]]), etc. 

Because optical engineers want to design and build devices that make light do something useful, they must understand and apply the science of optics in substantial detail, in order to know what is physically possible to achieve ([[physics]] and [[chemistry]]). However, they also must know what is practical in terms of available technology, materials, costs, design methods, etc.  As with other fields of engineering, [[computer]]s are important to many (perhaps most) optical engineers. They are used with instruments, for simulation, in design, and for many other applications. Engineers often use general computer tools such as [[spreadsheet]]s and [[programming language]]s, and they make frequent use of specialized optical software designed specifically for their field.

Optical engineering [[metrology]] uses optical methods to measure micro-vibrations with instruments like the laser speckle interferometer or to measure the properties of the various masses with instruments measuring [[refraction]].

An '''overview''' in [[policy debate]] is part of a [[structure of policy debate|speech]] which is flagged as not responding to the line-by-line arguments on the [[flow (policy debate)|flow]]. An overview may be "global" if presented at the beginning of a speech or "local" if presented at the beginning of a position.

Overviews typically list the order a debater's speech will be given in. For instance, On-Case, Co-op Disadvantage, Spending Disadvantage, Weapon Disadvantage would be an expected overview.

Debaters will usually inform the [[judge (policy debate)|judge]] where they will be giving an overview before they start a speech because it can make it harder to flow the speech. A small minority of judges dislike this practice and will start speech time when a debater starts giving this order.

Many judges dislike overviews because, since many are scripted before the round begins, they tend to be non-responsive or repetitive and are often long. However, most judges and coaches support the practice for arguments which cannot be placed anywhere on the line-by-line or that need to be flagged for their importance.

The above is also informally known as a "road map"

Another form of an overview is of specifically in the section of the speech(i.e. [[Topicality (policy debate)|Topicality]], [[Kritik]], Disadvantage, Counter-Plan, etc). This is commonly announced before the debater's speech and will signpost an overview.

The overview usually consists of star/main arguments being made and more than likely tend to contain extended evidence or authors. This practice is used to elaborate an argument and/or bring it back up in order for the judge to be aware of the main arguments being made by a team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3167">[[File:Scepkin1903Sava142ob.jpg|thumb|right|Sava's book, 1.142]]
'''Sava's book''' ({{lang-bg|Савина книга}}, ''Savina kniga''; {{lang-ru|Саввина книга}}, ''Savvina kniga'') is a 129-folio [[Early Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old_Church_Slavonic#Canon|canon]] [[evangeliary]], written in the eleventh century.

The original 126 [[parchment]] folios are of Bulgarian provenance, being bound into a larger codex with later additions of the [[Russian Church Slavonic]] recension. The codex is named the priest Sav(v)a, who inscribed his name on two of the original folios. There is no other historical record of Sava, and it is therefore believed that he was one of the manuscript's copyists.

The early history of Sava's book is unknown. What can be ascertained is that the codex was in the Seredkino monastery near [[Pskov]] until at least the 17th century. Afterwards it was moved to the manuscript collection of the Moscow Synodal Printing House, where it was found in 1866 by the Russian Slavist [[Izmail Sreznevsky]], who gave the codex its modern-day appellation and was the first one to publish it (Saint Petersburg, 1868). Today it is kept in the Central State Archive of Old Documents (CGADA) in Moscow.

The first critical edition of the manuscript was published by V. N. Ščepkin (''Savvina kniga'', Saint Petersburg 1903), photographically reprinted in Graz in 1959. Ščepkin was the first to perform a paleolinguistic analysis of the manuscript (''Razsuždenie o jazyke Savvinoj knigy'', 1899), and he ascertained that it was copied from a [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] original. His 1903 edition led N. Karinski to propound several new readings and to fix some wrong solutions (''Perečenь važnejših netočnostei poslednego izdanija Savvinoj knigi'', Izv., XIX, 3, 206-216). Paleographic and linguistic analysis shows that the copyist wrote [[yer]]s where he did not pronounce them any more, and that behind ''č'', ''ž'' and ''š'' he wrote ''ъ'' instead of ''ь'', which indicates that the aforementioned consonants were pronounced "hard" in the scribe's mother tongue, or, more likely, that other than the preserved softness in the preceding consonant the two yers had merged. There is abundant evidence for the loss of epenthetic ''l'', and, instead of [[Ya (Cyrillic)|iotified a]] ({{Slavonic|ꙗ}}), [[yat]] ({{Slavonic|Ѣ}}) is often written.

'''Scientific pitch notation''' (or '''SPN''', also known as ''American Standard Pitch Notation'' ('''ASPN''') and ''International Pitch Notation'' ('''IPN'''))&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flutopedia.com/octave_notation.htm International Pitch Notation]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2018}} is a method of specifying musical [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] by combining a musical [[Note (music)|note]] name (with [[accidental (music)|accidental]] if needed) and a number identifying the pitch's [[octave]].

Although scientific pitch ''notation'' (SPN) was originally designed as a companion to "[[scientific pitch]]" (see below), the two are not synonymous, and should not be confused. [[Scientific pitch|Scientific ''pitch'']] is a [[Pitch standard|pitch ''standard'']]—a system which defines the specific [[frequencies]] of particular pitches (see below). SPN concerns only how pitch names are ''notated'', that is, how they are designated in printed and written text, and does not inherently specify actual frequencies. Thus, the use of SPN to distinguish octaves does not depend on the pitch standard used.

==Nomenclature==
The notation makes use of the traditional tone names (A to G) which are followed by numbers showing which [[octave]] they're part of.
&lt;br&gt;
The system begins at a frequency of 16.352 [[Hertz|Hz]], which is assigned the value '''C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''. 
&lt;br&gt;
The octave 0 of the scientific pitch notation is traditionally called [[sub-contra octave]], and the tone marked C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in SPN is written as '',,C'' or ''C,,'' or ''CCC'' in traditional systems. Octave 0 of SPN marks the low end of what humans can actually perceive, with the average person being able to hear frequencies  no lower than 20 Hz.
&lt;br&gt;
The octave number increases by 1 upon an ascension from B to C. Thus, ''A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' refers to the first A ''above'' C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and [[middle C]] (the [[small octave]]'s C or simply ''c'')  is denoted as ''C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' in SPN.

==Use==
Scientific pitch notation is often used to specify the range of an instrument. It provides an unambiguous means of identifying a note in terms of textual notation rather than frequency, while at the same time avoiding the [[transposition convention]]s that are used in writing the music for instruments such as the [[clarinet]] and [[guitar]]. It is also easily translated into staff notation, as needed. While in describing musical pitches, [[enharmonic]] spellings can give rise to anomalies where C{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a lower frequency than B{{music|sharp}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; such paradoxes do not arise in a scientific context.

Scientific pitch notation avoids possible confusion between various derivatives of Helmholtz notation which use similar symbols to refer to different notes. For example, "c" in Helmholtz notation refers to the C below middle C, whereas "c" in [[ABC Notation]] refers to middle C itself. With scientific pitch notation, middle C is ''always'' '''C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''', and '''C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''' is never any note but middle C. This notation system also avoids the "fussiness" of having to visually distinguish between four and five primes, as well as the typographic issues involved in producing acceptable subscripts or substitutes for them. '''C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;''' is much easier to quickly distinguish visually from '''C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;''', than is, for example, {{nowrap|'''c′′′′'''}} from {{nowrap|'''c′′′′′'''}}, and the use of simple integers makes subscripts unnecessary altogether.

Although pitch notation is intended to describe sounds audibly perceptible as pitches, it can also be used to specify the frequency of non-pitch phenomena. Notes below E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or higher than E{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; are outside most humans' [[hearing range]], although notes slightly outside the hearing range on the low end may still be indirectly perceptible as pitches due to their overtones falling within the hearing range. For an example of truly inaudible frequencies, when the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] observed the waves of pressure fronts propagating away from a black hole, their one oscillation every 10 million years was described by [[NASA]] as corresponding to the B{{music|b}} fifty-seven octaves below middle C (or B{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;−53&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/09sep_blackholesounds/ Black Hole Sound Waves] “Sound waves 57 octaves lower than middle-C are rumbling away from a supermassive black hole in the Perseus cluster”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar systems==
There are pitch-octave notation conventions that appear similar to scientific pitch notation but are based on an alternative octave convention that differs from scientific pitch notation usually by one octave. For example, some [[MIDI]] software uses "C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;" to represent middle C (MIDI note 60).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Guérin |title=MIDI Power! |ISBN=1-929685-66-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This convention is probably related to a similar convention in sample-based trackers, where C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the basic pitch at which a sample plays (8287.12 Hz in [[MOD (file format)|MOD]]), forcing the musician to treat samples at any other pitch as [[transposing instrument]]s when using them in songs. Alternately, both [[Yamaha]] and the software [[MaxMSP]] define middle C as C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Using scientific pitch notation consistently, the MIDI NoteOn message assigns MIDI note 0 to C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; (five octaves below C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or Middle C; lowest note on the two largest organs of the world; about one octave below the human hearing threshold: its overtones, however, are audible), MIDI note 21 to A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the bottom key of an 88-key piano), MIDI note 60 to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Middle C), MIDI note 69 to A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (A440), MIDI note 108 to C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (the top key of an 88-key piano), and MIDI note 127 to G&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (beyond the piano; one octave above the highest note on some keyboard glockenspiels; some notes above the highest-pitched organ pipes).

This creates a linear pitch space in which an octave spans 12 [[semitone]]s, where each semitone is the distance between adjacent keys of the piano keyboard. Distance in this space corresponds to musical pitch distance in an equal-tempered scale; 2 semitones being a whole step, 1 semitone being a half step. An equal-tempered semitone can also be subdivided further into 100 cents. Each cent is {{frac|1|100}} semitone or {{frac|1|1200}} octave. This measure of pitch allows the expression of ''[[microtones]]'' not found on standard piano keyboards.

===Meantone temperament===
The notation is sometimes used in the context of [[meantone temperament]], and does not always assume [[equal temperament]] nor the standard concert A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of 440&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]; this is particularly the case in connection with earlier music.

The standard proposed to the Acoustical Society of America&lt;ref name="JASA"/&gt; explicitly states a logarithmic scale for frequency, which excludes meantone temperament, and the base frequency it uses gives A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; a frequency of exactly 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. However, when dealing with earlier music that did not use equal temperament, it is understandably easier to simply refer to notes by their closest modern equivalent, as opposed to specifying the difference using cents every time.

==Table of note frequencies==

[[File:Piano Frequencies.svg|frame|alt=Piano Keyboard|An 88-key piano, with the octaves numbered and [[C (musical note)#Middle C|Middle C]] (cyan) and [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]] (yellow) highlighted.]]

The table below gives notation for pitches based on standard [[piano key frequencies]], in other words, [[A440 (pitch standard)|standard concert pitch]] and [[twelve-tone equal temperament]]). When a piano is tuned to [[just intonation]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the same key on the keyboard, but a slightly different frequency.

Mathematically, given the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of semitones above middle C, the fundamental frequency in hertz is given by &lt;math&gt;440 \cdot 2^{(n-9)/12}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[twelfth root of two]]). Given the MIDI NoteOn number &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, the frequency of the note is normally &lt;math&gt;440 \cdot 2^{(m-69)/12}&lt;/math&gt; Hz, using standard tuning.

==Scientific pitch versus scientific pitch ''notation''==
[[Scientific pitch]] (q.v.) is an absolute pitch ''standard'', first proposed in 1713 by French physicist [[Joseph Sauveur]]. It was defined so that all [[C (music)|Cs]] are integer powers of 2, with [[middle C]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) at 256&amp;nbsp;[[hertz]]. As already noted, it is not dependent upon, nor a part of scientific pitch ''notation'' described here. To avoid the confusion in names, scientific pitch is sometimes also called "Verdi tuning" or "philosophical pitch".

The current international pitch standard, using A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as exactly 440&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], had been informally adopted by the music industry as far back as 1926, and [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]] became the official international pitch standard in 1955. SPN is routinely used to designate pitch in this system, and A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may be tuned to other frequencies under different tuning standards as well, and SPN octave designations still apply (ISO&amp;nbsp;16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = ISO 16:1975 Acoustics – Standard tuning frequency (Standard musical pitch) | publisher = International Organization for Standardization | year = 1975 | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=3601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

With changes in [[concert pitch]] and the widespread adoption of [[A440 (pitch standard)|A 440]] as a musical standard, new scientific frequency tables were published by the [[Acoustical Society of America]] in 1939, and adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in 1955. C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which was exactly 16&amp;nbsp;Hz under the scientific pitch standard, is now 16.352&amp;nbsp;Hz under the current international standard system.&lt;ref name="JASA"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Robert W.|last=Young|authorlink=Robert W.

Sieve elements are specialized cells that are important for the function of phloem, which is highly organized tissue that transports organic compounds made during photosynthesis. Sieve elements are the major conducting cells in phloem. Conducting cells aid in transport of molecules especially for long-distance signaling. In [[plant anatomy]], there are two main types of sieve elements which are sieve cells and sieve tube members. Sieve cells are specialized cells in the phloem tissue of flowering plants. Companion cells and Sieve cells originate from [[meristem]]s, which are tissues that actively divide throughout a plant's lifetime. They are similar to the development of [[xylem]], a water conducting cells in plants whose main function is also transportation in the plant vascular system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e06/06d.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807064315/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e06/06d.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-08-07|title=Botany online: Supporting Tissues - Vascular Tissues - Phloem|date=2007-08-07|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sieve elements' major function includes transporting sugars over long distance through plants by acting as a channel. Sieve elements elongate cells containing sieve areas on their walls. Pores on sieve areas allow for [[cytoplasmic]] connections to neighboring cells, which allows for the movement of photosynthetic material and other organic molecules necessary for tissue function. Structurally, they are elongated and parallel to the organ or tissue that they are located in. Sieve elements typically lack a nucleus and contain none to a very small number of ribosomes.&lt;ref name="Lamoureux 1975 1–31"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-8658-2_1|title=Phloem Transport|last=Lamoureux|first=Charles H.|date=1975|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9781468486605|series=NATO Advanced Study Institutes Series|pages=1–31|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-8658-2_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two types of sieve elements, sieve tube members and sieve cells, have different structure. Sieve tube members are shorter and wider with greater area for nutrient transport while sieve cells tend to be longer and narrower with smaller area for nutrient transport. Although the function of both of these kinds of sieve elements is the same, sieve cells are found in gymnosperms, non-flowering vascular plants, while sieve tube members are found in angiosperms, flowering vascular plants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Discovery ==

Sieve elements were first discovered by the forest botanist [[Theodor Hartig]] in 1837. Since this discovery, the structure and physiology of phloem tissue has been emphasized more as there has been greater focus on its specialized components such as the sieve cells. Phloem was introduced by [[Carl Nägeli]] in 1858 after the discovery of sieve elements. Since then, multiple studies have been conducted on how sieve elements function in phloem in terms of working as a transport mechanism.&lt;ref name="Lamoureux 1975 1–31" /&gt; An example of analysis of phloem through sieve elements was conducted in the study of [[Arabidopsis]] leaves. By studying the phloem of the leaves in vivo through [[laser microscopy]] and the usage of fluorescent markers (placed in both companion cells and sieve elements), the network of companion cells with the compact sieve tubes was highlighted. The markers for sieve elements and companion cells was used to study the network and organization of phloem cells.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Sieve Tube Members ==

There are two categories of sieve elements and these are sieve cells and sieve tube members.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/webb/Bot410/410Labs/LabsHTML-99/SecPhloem/LabSecPhloem-99.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912193059/http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/webb/Bot410/410Labs/LabsHTML-99/SecPhloem/LabSecPhloem-99.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-12|title=Secondary Phloem|date=2007-09-12|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main functions of sieve tube members include maintaining cells and transporting necessary molecules with the help of companion cells.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-01|title=The rendez-vous of mobile sieve-element and abundant companion-cell proteins|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526617301437|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|language=en|volume=43|pages=108–112|doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2018.04.008|issn=1369-5266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sieve tube members are living cells (which do not contain a nucleus) that are responsible for transporting [[carbohydrate]]s throughout the plant.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torode|first=Thomas A.|last2=O’Neill|first2=Rachel|last3=Marcus|first3=Susan E.|last4=Cornuault|first4=Valérie|last5=Pose|first5=Sara|last6=Lauder|first6=Rebecca P.|last7=Kračun|first7=Stjepan K.|last8=Rydahl|first8=Maja Gro|last9=Andersen|first9=Mathias C.

This allows for supply and maintenance of the plant cells and for signaling between distant organs within the plant.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Sieve tubes members do not have [[ribosome]]s or a nucleus and thus need companion cells to help them function as transport molecules. Companion cells provide Sieve tube members with proteins necessary for signaling and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in order to help them transfer molecules between different parts of the plant. It is the companion cells that helps transport carbohydrates from outside the cells into the sieve tube elements.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-01|title=Sieve-element differentiation and phloem sap contamination|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526617301541|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|language=en|volume=43|pages=43–49|doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2017.12.008|issn=1369-5266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companion cells also allow for bidirectional flow.&lt;ref name="Lamoureux 1975 1–31" /&gt;

While sieve tube members are responsible for a lot of the signaling necessary for the plant's organs, only some proteins are active within the sieve tubes. This is due to the fact that sieve tube members do not have ribosomes to synthesize protein as this makes it harder to determine which active proteins are specifically related to the sieve tube elements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Sieve tube member.png|thumb|297x297px|Sieve tube members form a sieve tube which have sieve plates between them to transport nutrients. The companion cells shown contain a nucleus which can synthesize additional protein for cell signaling. The bidirectional flow of nutrients is shown with the double arrow.]]
Sieve tube members and companion cells are connected through [[plasmodesmata]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Plasmodesmata consists of channels between cell walls of adjacent plant cells for transport and cell to cell recognition. Structurally, the walls of sieve tubes tend to be dispersed with plasmodesmata grouped together and it is these areas of the tube walls and plasmodesmata that develop into sieve plates over time. Sieve tube members tend to be found largely in [[angiosperm]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are very long and have horizontal end walls containing sieve plates. Sieve plates contain sieve pores which can regulate the size of the openings in the plates with changes in the surroundings of the plants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Kuan-Ju|last2=Danila|first2=Florence R.|last3=Cho|first3=Yueh|last4=Faulkner|first4=Christine|date=2018-03-25|title=Peeking at a plant through the holes in the wall - exploring the roles of plasmodesmata|url=https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.15130|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=218|issue=4|pages=1310–1314|doi=10.1111/nph.15130|issn=0028-646X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sieve plates are very large which means that there is a greater surface area for material transport.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sieve tube members are arranged from end to end in a longitudinal manner in order to form sieve tubes. Formed through these vertical connections between multiple sieve tube members, sieve tubes are directly responsible for the transport through the minimum resistance surrounding their walls.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By having the assistance of these pores that constitute a majority of the structure of sieve plates, the diameter of the sieve tubes can be regulated. This regulation is necessary for the sieve tubes to respond to changes in the environment and conditions within the organism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Sieve cells ==

Sieve cells are long, conducting cells in the phloem that do not form sieve tubes. The major difference between sieve cells and sieve tube members is the lack of sieve plates in sieve cells.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; They have a very narrow diameter and tend to be longer in length than sieve tube elements as they are generally associated with albuminous cells.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cayla|first=Thibaud|last2=Batailler|first2=Brigitte|last3=Le Hir|first3=Rozenn|last4=Revers|first4=Frédéric|last5=Anstead|first5=James A.|last6=Thompson|first6=Gary A.|last7=Grandjean|first7=Olivier|last8=Dinant|first8=Sylvie|date=2015-02-25|title=Live Imaging of Companion Cells and Sieve Elements in Arabidopsis Leaves|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0118122|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4340910|pmid=25714357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to how Sieve Tube members are associated with companion cells, sieve cells are flanked with albuminous cells in order to aid in transporting organic material. Albuminous cells have long, unspecialized areas with ends that overlap with those of other sieve cells and contain nutrients and store food in order to nourish tissues.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They enable the sieve cells to be connected to parenchyma, functional tissue in the organs, which helps to stabilize the tissue and transport nutrients. Sieve cells are also associated with [[gymnosperm]]s because they lack the companion cell and sieve member complexes that angiosperms have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33333455|title=Biology|last=1946-2004.|first=Campbell, Neil A.,|date=1996|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co|isbn=0805319409|edition= 4th |location=Menlo Park, Calif.|oclc=33333455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sieve cells are very uniform and have an even distribution across of sieve areas. Their narrow pores are necessary in their function in most seedless vascular plants and gymnosperms which lack sieve-tube members and only have sieve cells to transport molecules.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While sieve cells have smaller sieve areas, they are still distributed across several cells to still effectively transport material to various tissue within the plant.&lt;ref name="Lamoureux 1975 1–31" /&gt;

Sieve cell associated albuminous cells work between phloem and [[parenchyma]]. They connect parenchyma with mature sieve cells to help participate in transport of cells. There can be many of these albuminous cells that belong to one sieve cell, depending on the function of the tissue or organ.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sieve pores are very common in the areas that have overlapping sieve cells. Callose levels are measure in order to observe the activity of sieve cells. Callose acts as a block to the sieve pores that are present in both of these sieve elements. A lack callose suggests that the sieve elements are more active and therefore can regulate their pores more actively in response to environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evert|first=Ray F.|last2=Derr|first2=William F.|date=1964|title=Callose Substance in Sieve Elements|jstor=2440286|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=51|issue=5|pages=552–559|doi=10.2307/2440286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further Applications/Agriculture ==

Because the plant vascular system is vital in growth and development of plant cells and the organs within the plant, the role of sieve elements in the transport of necessary carbohydrates and [[macromolecule]]s is largely expanded. This can be applied to agriculture to observe the way resources are distributed to various parts of the plant. Plasmodesmata connect companion cells to sieve elements and parenchyma cells can connect the sieve tubes to various tissues within the plant. This system between the plasmodesmata, companion cells, and sieve tubes allow for the delivery of necessary metabolites. The yield of agricultural product could potentially be increased to maximize the delivery system of these specialized cells within the phloem in a way that diffusion can be maximized. It has been discovered that the angiosperm phloem can use the sieve tubes as a way to transport various forms of RNA to sink tissues which can help alter transcriptional activity. Sink tissues are tissues that are in the process of growth and need nutrients. Having Sieve elements transport additional nutrients to sink tissues can speed up the growth process, which can affect plant growth and development. Overtime, rapid growth has the potential of leading to a greater agricultural output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ham|first=B.-K.|last2=Lucas|first2=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4255">The use of '''space mirrors as an anti-global warming measure''' is a proposed technology for climate change mitigation by deflection of sunlight.  It was one of a series of proposals for controlling [[global warming]] made to the [[United States]] government in 2001.

At the "Response Options to Rapid or Severe Climate Change" round-table meeting organized by the President's [[U.S. Climate Change Technology Program|Climate Change Technology Program]] in September 2001 to gather ideas for averting climate change, one of the proposals was to station one or more wire-mesh "mirrors" in orbit to deflect sunlight back into space or to filter it. The idea was proposed by [[Lowell Wood]], a senior staff scientist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], who calculated that deflecting 1% of sunlight would restore climatic stability, and that that would require either a single mirror {{convert|600000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} in area or several smaller ones. Wood had been researching the idea for more than ten years but considered it so infeasible that it should only be a back-up plan for solving the global warming problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2005-06/how-earth-scale-engineering-can-save-planet "How Earth-Scale Engineering Can Save the Planet,"] ''[[Popular Science]]'' June 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the US government was recommending that research on sunlight deflection, including space mirrors, be continued as "insurance" and that the next [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|United Nations Report on Climate Change]] advocate such a strategy.&lt;ref name=Adam&gt;David Adam, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/27/usnews.frontpagenews "US answer to global warming: smoke and giant space mirrors,"] ''[[The Guardian]]'' January 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2007/01/26/USGReview_pp6_7.pdf U.S. Government Review of the Second Order Draft of WGIII Contribution "Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change,"] pdf at ''The Guardian''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s website: "Modifying solar radiance may be an important strategy if mitigation of emissions fails for one reason or another."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the space mirror, suggested sunlight-reducing techniques included launching thousands of highly reflective balloons and pumping sulphate droplets into the upper atmosphere to emulate volcanic emissions.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;&lt;ref name=TRev&gt;Mark Williams, [http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/18175/ "Cooling the Planet,"] ''[[Technology Review]]'' February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Space mirrors were first considered in the 1980s as a way to cool the climate of [[Venus (planet)|Venus]]. [[James Early]], also at Livermore, in 1989 proposed using a "space shade" 2,000 kilometers in diameter orbiting at [[Lagrangian point|Lagrangian Point L1]]. He estimated the cost at between one and ten trillion [[US dollars]] and suggested manufacturing it on the moon using moon rock.&lt;ref name=TRev/&gt; 

Using space mirrors as a [[space sunshade]] to reduce the impact of sunlight falls into the category of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]]: deliberately modifying the earth's climate. At a conference on the topic organized by [[Daniel P. Schrag|Daniel Schrag]] of [[Harvard University]]  and [[David Keith (scientist)|David Keith]] of the [[University of Calgary]] in November 2007, the consensus was that it was worth studying such ideas further despite their high cost, the doubtful feasibility of some including the space mirror, and the risk of their distracting attention from [[Emissions_reduction|reduction]] of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Martin LaMonica, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9819173-54.html "'Geoengineering': Space mirror over Greenland?,"] [[CNET.com]] - Greentech News November 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eli Kintisch]], [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2007/11/giving-climate-change-kick "Giving Climate Change a Kick,"] ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:52706main hstorion lg.jpg|thumb|This image shows the wind from the star LL Orionis generating a [[bow shock]] (the bright arc) as it collides with material in the surrounding [[Orion Nebula]].]]
A '''stellar wind''' is a flow of gas ejected from the [[stellar atmosphere|upper atmosphere]] of a [[star]].  It is distinguished from the [[bipolar outflow]]s characteristic of young stars by being less [[collimated]], although stellar winds are not generally spherically symmetric.

Different [[stellar classification|types]] of stars have different types of stellar winds. 

Post-[[main sequence|main-sequence]] [[star]]s nearing the ends of their lives often eject large quantities of mass in massive (&lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \dot{M} &gt; 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; solar masses per year), slow (v = 10&amp;nbsp;km/s) winds.  These include [[red giant]]s and [[Red supergiant|supergiants]], and [[asymptotic giant branch]] stars.  These winds are understood to be driven by [[radiation pressure]] on [[Cosmic dust|dust]] condensing in the upper atmosphere of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38738913|title=Introduction to stellar winds|last=1941-|first=Lamers, Henny J.

Massive stars of [[stellar classification|types]] [[O star|O]] and [[B V star|B]] have stellar winds with lower mass loss rates (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \dot{M} &lt; 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; solar masses per year) but very high velocities (v &gt; 1–2000&amp;nbsp;km/s).  Such winds are driven by radiation pressure on the resonance absorption lines of heavy elements such as carbon and nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| bibcode=1975ApJ...195..157C| last=Castor| first=J.| last2=Abbott|first2=D.

J.| volume=195| pages=157–174| doi=10.1086/153315}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These high-energy stellar winds blow [[stellar wind bubble]]s.

[[File:The long goodbye.jpg|thumb|In [[planetary nebula]] [[NGC 6565]], a cloud of gas was ejected from the star after strong stellar winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The long goodbye|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1530a/|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[G-type main-sequence star|G-type stars]] like the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[Sun]] have a wind driven by their hot, magnetized [[corona]]. The Sun's wind is called the [[solar wind]].  These winds consist mostly of high-energy [[electrons]] and [[proton]]s (about 1 [[electron volt|keV]]) that are able to escape the star's [[gravity]] because of the high [[temperature]] of the [[corona]].

Stellar winds from main-sequence stars do not strongly influence the evolution of lower mass stars such as the Sun. However, for more massive stars such as O stars, the mass loss can result in a star shedding as much as 50% of its mass whilst on the main sequence: this clearly has a significant impact on the later stages of evolution. The influence can even be seen for intermediate mass stars, which will become [[white dwarf]]s at the ends of their lives rather than exploding as [[supernova]]e only because they lost enough mass in their winds.

[[File:Tail lift deploy.png|right|thumb|Four stages of deployment on an [[ambulance]] tail lift]]
[[File:Tail lift control.png|right|thumb|Control for a tail lift]]
A '''tail lift''' (term used in the UK, also called a "liftgate" in North America) is a mechanical device permanently installed on the rear of a work truck, [[van]], or [[truck|lorry]], and is designed to facilitate the materials handling of goods from ground level or a loading dock to the level of the vehicle bed, or vice versa. 

The majority of tail lifts are hydraulic or pneumatic in operation, although they can be mechanical, and are controlled by an operator using an electric [[relay|relay switch]].

Using a tail lift can make it unnecessary to use machinery such as a [[forklift truck]] to load heavy items on to a vehicle.  A tail lift can also bridge the difference in height between a loading dock and the vehicle load bed.

Tail lifts are available for many sizes of vehicle, from standard vans to articulated lorries, and standard models can lift anywhere up to 2500kg.&lt;ref name=hiab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiab.com/en/global/products/Tail-lifts/|title=Zepro Tail lifts product history|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Tail lifts are most often categorized by design type. Tail lift design types include Parallel Arm, Railgate, Column, Cantilever, Tuckunder, and Slider.&lt;ref name=hiab/&gt;

=== Parallel Arm ===
Parallel Arm lifts support lower lifting capacities and are commonly installed on pickup trucks and service truck bodies. The parallel "arms" attach to both sides of the lifting platform and guide the platform out and away from the liftgate mainframe. Parallel Arm designs can either feature two hydraulic cylinders applying force directly to the lifting platform or a single hydraulic cylinder using some version of a cable-pulley system.

=== Railgate ===
Railgate lifts are very similar in design to Column Lifts but (generally) support lower lifting capacities. Railgate lifts get their name from the "outrails" which install directly to the vehicle body and serve as the guides for the liftgate platform. Platforms on railgates are larger than those of parallel arm lifts and, like column lifts, fix at a 90° angle from the outrails and lift completely vertically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.truck-n-trailer.com/tuck-away-lift-gate-vs-the-rail-lift-gate/|title=TUCK AWAY LIFT GATE VS THE RAIL LIFT GATE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Column ===
Column lifts are "beefier" versions of railgates, supporting some of the highest lifting capacities of any type of hydraulic lift. Like Railgate lifts, Column Lifts feature "tracks" that install directly onto the vehicle body. From the tracks a folding platform extends and lifts completely vertically.  

Column lifts have the advantage of being able to lift to a higher level than the load bed, also known as "above bed travel," and are therefore preferable for vehicles with bed heights lower than standard dock height. 

The disadvantages of column lifts include that the platform is only usually able to operate at a 90° angle from the track, meaning that on uneven surfaces, the lift will not meet the ground properly.

=== Cantilever ===
[[Cantilever]] lifts work by a set of rams attached to the [[chassis]] of the vehicle.  These rams are on hinges, allowing them to change angle as they expand or contract.  By using the rams in sequence, the working platform can either be tilted, or raised and lowered.

Cantilever lifts have the advantage of being able to tilt, which means they can often form a ramp arrangement, which may be more appropriate for some applications.  It also means that it can be easier to load or unload on uneven ground.

=== Tuckunder ===

On Tuckunder lifts, the lifting platform may be folded and stored underneath the load bed of the vehicle, leaving the option of it not being used when at a loading dock, and giving access and egress for operators without the need to operate the lift. Common tuckunder designs are either single- or dual-cylinder, with dual-cylinder designs supporting higher lifting capacities.   

The Maxon company claims to have invented the first tuckunder lift in 1957 under the brand name Tuk-A-Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxonlift.co.uk/about.php|title=THE PIONEER OF THE LIFTGATE INDUSTRY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slider ===
Slider Lift designs, like tuckunders, are characterized by folding and storing directly underneath the vehicle bed. However, slider designs feature lifting platforms that "slide" out from underneath the vehicle bed (instead of lowering and unfolding). Slider lift designs support some of the highest lifting capacities of any type of hydraulic lift.

==Liftgate==

In North America, "liftgate" is the commonly used term for a hydraulic lift installed at the rear of a vehicle that can be used to mechanically load or unload cargo.  

In the automobile industry, "liftgate" is also used to refer to the automatic rear door of a van, mini van, or cross over (SUV) type vehicle. This opening system is also sometimes called a "rear hatch."

{{For2|information on the description of the [[Medieval Warm Period]] and [[Little Ice Age]] in various IPCC reports|[[MWP and LIA in IPCC reports]]}}

The '''temperature record of the past 1,000 years''' or longer is reconstructed using data from [[Proxy (climate)|climate proxy]] records in conjunction with the modern [[instrumental temperature record]] which only covers the last 150 years at a global scale. Large-scale reconstructions covering part or all of the [[1st millennium]] and [[2nd millennium]] have shown that recent temperatures are exceptional: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of 2007 concluded that "Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were ''very likely'' higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and ''likely'' the highest in at least the past 1,300 years." The curve shown in graphs of these reconstructions is widely known as the [[hockey stick graph]] because of the sharp increase in temperatures during the last century. As of 2010 this broad pattern was supported by [[List of large scale temperature reconstructions of the last 2,000 years|more than two dozen reconstructions]], using various statistical methods and combinations of proxy records, with variations in how flat the pre-20th-century "shaft" appears. Sparseness of proxy records results in considerable uncertainty for earlier periods.&lt;ref name="Frank 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Esper|Zorita|Wilson|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2000 Year Temperature Comparison.png|thumb|The temperature record of the past 2000 years from several different proxy methods]]

Individual proxy records, such as tree ring widths and densities used in [[dendroclimatology]], are calibrated against the instrumental record for the period of overlap. Networks of such records are used to reconstruct past temperatures for regions: tree ring proxies have been used to reconstruct [[Northern Hemisphere]] extratropical temperatures (within the tropics trees do not form rings) but are confined to land areas and are scarce in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] which is largely ocean. Wider coverage is provided by multiproxy reconstructions, incorporating proxies such as lake sediments, ice cores and corals which are found in different regions, and using statistical methods to relate these sparser proxies to the greater numbers of tree ring records. The "Composite Plus Scaling" (CPS) method is widely used for large-scale multiproxy reconstructions of hemispheric or global average temperatures; this is complemented by Climate Field Reconstruction (CFR) methods which show how climate patterns have developed over large spatial areas, making the reconstruction useful for investigating natural variability and long-term oscillations as well as for comparisons with patterns produced by climate models.

During the 1,900 years before the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, it is likely that the next warmest period was from 950 to 1100, with peaks at different times in different regions. This has been called the [[Medieval Warm Period]], and some evidence suggests widespread cooler conditions during a period around the 17th century known as the [[Little Ice Age]]. In the [[hockey stick controversy]], contrarians have asserted that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than at present, and have disputed the data and methods of climate reconstructions.

== General techniques and accuracy ==

By far the best observed period is from 1850 to the present day, with coverage improving over time. Over this period the [[Instrumental temperature record|recent instrumental record]], mainly based on direct [[thermometer]] readings, has approximately global coverage. It shows a general warming in global temperatures.

Before this time various proxies must be used. These proxies are less accurate than direct thermometer measurements, have lower temporal resolution, and have less spatial coverage. Their only advantage is that they enable a longer record to be reconstructed. Since the direct temperature record is more accurate than the proxies (indeed, it is needed to calibrate them) it is used when available: i.e., from 1850 onwards.

===Quantitative methods using proxy data===
{{Main article| Proxy (climate)}}

As there are few instrumental records before 1850, temperatures before then must be reconstructed based on [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] methods.  One such method, based on principles of [[dendroclimatology]], uses the width and other characteristics of tree rings to infer temperature. The [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of snow, corals, and [[stalactites]] can also be used to infer temperature.  Other techniques which have been used include examining records of the time of crop harvests, the treeline in various locations, and other historical records to make inferences about the temperature. These proxy reconstructions are indirect inferences of temperature and thus tend to have greater uncertainty than instrumental data.

Most proxy records have to be calibrated against local temperature records during their period of overlap, to estimate the relationship between temperature and the proxy. The longer history of the proxy is then used to reconstruct temperature from earlier periods.

Proxy records must be averaged in some fashion if a global or hemispheric record is desired. The "Composite Plus Scaling" (CPS) method is widely used for large-scale multiproxy reconstructions of hemispheric or global average temperatures. This is complemented by Climate Field Reconstruction (CFR) methods which show how climate patterns have developed over large spatial areas.

Considerable care must be taken in the averaging process; for example, if a certain region has a large number of tree ring records, a simple average of all the data would strongly over-weight that region, and statistical techniques are used to avoid such over-weighting. In the {{harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1998}} and {{harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1999}} CFR reconstructions, [[principal components analysis]] was used to combine some of these regional records before they were globally combined.  An important distinction is between so-called 'multi-proxy' reconstructions, which attempt to obtain a global temperature reconstruction by using multiple proxy records distributed over the globe and more regional reconstructions. Usually, the various proxy records are combined arithmetically, in some weighted average. More recently, Osborn and Briffa used a simpler technique, counting the proportion of records that are positive, negative or neutral in any time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Osborn|Briffa|2006}};

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces a result in general agreement with
the conventional multi-proxy studies.

The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] cited 14 reconstructions, 10 of which covered 1,000 years or longer, to support its conclusion that "Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IPCC|2007}}, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-a-palaeoclimatic.html A: Palaeoclimatic Perspective]; see also {{Harvnb|Jansen et al.|2007}}, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-6.html Sec. 6.6.1.1 What Do Reconstructions Based on Palaeoclimatic Proxies Show?].
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualitative reconstruction using historical records===

It is also possible to use historical data such as times of grape harvests, sea-ice-free periods in harbours and diary entries of frost or heatwaves to produce indications of when it was warm or cold in particular regions. These records are harder to calibrate, are often only available sparsely through time, may be available only from developed regions, and are unlikely to come with good error estimates. These historical observations of the same time period show periods of both warming and cooling.

===Limitations ===

The apparent differences between the quantitative and qualitative approaches are not fully reconciled. The reconstructions mentioned above rely on various assumptions to generate their results. If these assumptions do not hold, the reconstructions would be unreliable. For quantitative reconstructions, the most fundamental assumptions are that proxy records vary with temperature and that non-temperature factors do not confound the results. In the historical records temperature fluctuations may be regional rather than hemispheric in scale.

In a letter to '''Nature''' {{Harvtxt|Bradley|Hughes|Mann|2006}} pointed at the original title of their 1998 article: ''Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the past millennium: inferences, uncertainties, and limitations''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached and that the uncertainties were the point of the article.

==Development and controversy==
{{main article|Hockey stick graph|Hockey stick controversy}}

In the 1960s, [[Hubert Lamb]] generalised from [[historical climatology|historical documents]] and temperature records of central England to propose that the North Atlantic region had seen a [[Medieval Warm Period]] from around 900 to 1300, followed by [[Little Ice Age]]. This was the basis of a "schematic diagram" featured in the [[IPCC First Assessment Report]] beside cautions that the medieval warming might not have been global. The use of [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] indicators to get quantitative estimates of the [[temperature record]] of past centuries developed sporadically from the 1930s onwards, and {{harvnb|Bradley|Jones|1993}} introduced the "Composite Plus Scaling" (CPS) method used by most later large-scale reconstructions.&lt;ref name="Fingerprints (1990s-2000s)"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2011c|loc=[http://www.aip.org/history/climate/20ctrend.htm#S5 Fingerprints (1990s-2000s)]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Briffa|Osborn|Lough|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their study was featured in the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]], which included its graph of decadal average hemispheric temperatures back to 1400. There was increasing political dispute over the implications of the science, and over proposed ratification of the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]].

In 1998 [[Michael E. Mann]], [[Raymond S. Bradley]] and [[Malcolm K. Hughes]] developed new statistical techniques to produce {{harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1998}} (MBH98), the first [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]]-based climate field reconstruction (CFR). This showed global patterns of annual surface temperature, and included a graph of average hemispheric temperatures back to 1400 with shading emphasising that uncertainties (to two [[standard error]] limits) were much greater in earlier centuries.&lt;ref name="Wahl 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Wahl|Ammann|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was disputed by the fossil fuel funded [[George C. Marshall Institute]] and [[Willie Soon]] and [[Sallie Baliunas]], who said that the reconstruction only went back to 1400 to avoid showing the Medieval Warm Period.

{{harvnb|Jones|Briffa|Barnett|Tett|1998}} independently produced a CPS reconstruction extending back for a thousand years, and {{harvnb|Mann|Bradley|Hughes|1999}} (MBH99) used the MBH98 methodology to extend their study back to 1000.&lt;ref name="Weart HS"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2011c|loc=[http://www.aip.org/history/climate/20ctrend.htm#S6 The Hockey Stick and Beyond]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TAR 2.3.2.2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Folland et al.|2001}}, [http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/069.htm#fig220 2.3.2.2 Multi-proxy synthesis of recent temperature change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604072514/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2F069.htm |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''''hockey stick''''' was coined by the climatologist [[Jerry Mahlman]], to describe the pattern this showed, envisaging a graph that is relatively flat to 1900 as forming an [[Ice hockey stick]]'s "shaft", followed by a sharp increase corresponding to the "blade".&lt;ref name="Monastersky"&gt;{{cite news |title=Climate Science on Trial |author=Richard Monastersky |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Climate-Science-on-Trial/34665 |newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=September 5, 2003 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Harvnb|BBC News, 16 July|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the MBH99 graph was featured prominently in the 2001 [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] (TAR), which also drew on Jones et al. 1998 and three other reconstructions to support the conclusion that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1990s was likely to have been the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year during the past 1,000 years. The graph was featured in publicity, and became a focus of dispute for those opposed to the strengthening [[scientific consensus]] that late 20th century warmth was exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/hockey-stick-graph-ipcc-report "Part three: Hockey stick graph took pride of place in IPCC report, despite doubts"].&lt;/ref&gt; When the IPCC TAR was still in draft, [[Fred Singer]] held a press event saying "We don't accept this" with  [[Wibjörn Karlén]] who alleged that MBH99 showed neither a Medieval Warm Period nor a Little Ice Age, an inaccurate claim echoed soon afterwards by [[John Lawrence Daly]].

In 2003, as lobbying over the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] intensified, Soon and Baliunas published a paper claiming greater medieval warmth, and on this basis the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] chief of staff [[Philip Cooney]] deleted references to climate reconstructions from the first [[Environmental Protection Agency]] ''Report on the Environment''. The paper was quickly dismissed by scientists in the [[Soon and Baliunas controversy]], but on July 28, Republican [[Jim Inhofe]] spoke in the Senate speech citing Soon and Baliunas to claim "that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people".&lt;ref name="revkin August 5, 2003"&gt;{{Citation

They were given extensive publicity, and met Inhofe as well as making a presentation sponsored by the [[George C. Marshall Institute]] and the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]. In 2004 [[Hans von Storch]] published criticism of the statistical techniques as tending to underplay variations in earlier parts of the graph, though this was disputed and he later accepted that the effect was very small.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2007/05/the_decay_of_the_hockey_stick.html The Decay of the Hockey Stick], Nature "Climate Feedback" blog post by von Storch. "...we do not think that McIntyre has substantially contributed in the published peer-reviewed literature to the debate about the statistical merits of the MBH and related method." (comment by von Storch &amp; Zorita, May 7, 2007 07:35 PM, in response to multiple comments on their failure to acknowledge McIntyre and McKitrick's contributions)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 McIntyre and McKitrick published criticisms of the [[principal components analysis]] methodology as used in MBH98 and MBH99. Their analysis was subsequently disputed by published papers including {{harvnb|Huybers|2005}} and {{harvnb|Wahl|Ammann|2007}} which pointed to errors in the McIntyre and McKitrick methodology. In June 2005 Rep. [[Joe Barton]] launched what [[Sherwood Boehlert]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|House Science Committee]], called a "misguided and illegitimate investigation" into the data, methods and personal information of Mann, Bradley and Hughes. At Boehlert's request a panel of scientists convened by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] was set up, which reported in 2006 supporting Mann's findings with some qualifications, including agreeing that there were some statistical failings but these had little effect on the result.&lt;ref name="Part four guardian"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearce|2010_pt4}}&lt;!-- Pt. 4 --&gt;, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/hockey-stick-michael-mann-steve-mcintyre "Part four: Climate change debate overheated after sceptics grasped 'hockey stick'"].&lt;/ref&gt; Barton and [[Ed Whitfield|U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield]] requested [[Edward Wegman]] to set up a team of statisticians to investigate. The [[Wegman Report]] supported McIntyre and McKitrick's view that there were statistical failings, but did not quantify whether there was any significant effect. It included an extensive network analysis which has been discredited by expert opinion and found to have issues of plagiarism. Arguments against the MBH studies were reintroduced as part of the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]], but dismissed by eight independent investigations.

The test in science is whether findings can be replicated using different data and methods. [[List of large scale temperature reconstructions of the last 2,000 years|More than two dozen reconstructions]], using various statistical methods and combinations of proxy records, have supported the broad consensus shown in the original 1998 hockey-stick graph, with variations in how flat the pre-20th century "shaft" appears.&lt;ref name="Frank 2010"/&gt; The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] cited 14 reconstructions, 10 of which covered 1,000 years or longer, to support its strengthened conclusion that it was likely that Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the 20th century were the highest in at least the past 1,300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jansen et al.|2007}}, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-6.html Section 6.6: The Last 2,000 Years].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Rottenhammer - Allegory of the Arts - WGA20147.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Rottenhammer]], ''Allegory of the Arts'' (second half of the 16th century). [[Gemäldegalerie]], Berlin.]]

'''The arts''' refers to the [[Aesthetics|theory]] and [[Art|physical expression]] of [[creativity]] found in human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s. Major constituents of the arts include [[literature]] (including [[drama]], [[poetry]], and [[prose]]), [[performing arts]] (among them [[dance]], [[music]], and [[theatre]]), and [[visual arts]] (including [[architecture]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[sculpting]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g., [[cinematography]]) or artwork with  the written word (e.g., [[comics]]). From prehistoric [[cave paintings]] to modern day [[films]], art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Definitions==
In its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is "good" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines "the arts" as "painting, sculpture, music, theatre, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20arts|title=Definition of The Arts|work=Merriam-Webster|language=en|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Congress]], in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined "the arts" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/361_r8.html|title=Congressional definition of "the arts"|last=Van Camp|first=Julie|date=22 November 2006|website=PHIL 361I: Philosophy of Art|publisher=California State University, Long Beach|language=en|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The term 'the arts' includes, but is not limited to, music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, architecture and allied fields, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic and craft arts, industrial design, costume and fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, film, video, tape and sound recording, the arts related to the presentation, performance, execution, and exhibition of such major art forms, all those traditional arts practiced by the diverse peoples of this country. (sic) and the study and application of the arts to the human environment.}}

==History==
{{main article|History of art}}

In [[Ancient Greece]], all art and craft was referred to by the same word, ''[[techne]]''. Thus, there was no distinction among the arts. [[Ancient Greek]] art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt). In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. [[Eastern art]] has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of [[Indian art|India]], [[Tibetan art|Tibet]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]]. Religious [[Islamic art|Islamic]] art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the ''[[Artes Liberales]]'' (liberal arts) were taught in [[Medieval university|universities]] as part of the [[Trivium (education)|Trivium]], an introductory curriculum involving [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], and [[Logic#Informal_reasoning_and_dialectic|logic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford dictionary of English etymology|last=Onions|first=C.

&lt;/ref&gt; were practised and developed in guild environments. The modern distinction between "artistic" and "non-artistic" skills did not develop until the [[Renaissance]]. In modern [[academia]], the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the [[humanities]]. Some subjects in the humanities are [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and [[logic]].

The arts have also been classified as seven: [[painting]], [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[performing]] and [[Film|cinema]].
Some view literature, painting, sculpture, and music as the main four arts, of which the others are derivative; [[drama]] is literature with [[acting]], [[dance]] is music expressed through [[Motion (physics)|motion]], and [[song]] is music with literature and [[Human voice|voice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Esthetics_Main.html|title=Esthetics|last=Rowlands|first=Joseph|last2=Landauer|first2=Jeff|date=2001|website=Importance of Philosophy|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] on top of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]]]]

Architecture is the [[art]] and [[science]] of [[design]]ing [[building]]s and [[structure]]s. The word ''architecture'' comes from the Greek ''arkhitekton'', "master builder, director of works," from ''αρχι-'' (arkhi) "chief" + ''τεκτων'' (tekton) "builder, carpenter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=architect (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of [[town planning]], [[urban design]], and [[landscape architecture]] to the microlevel of creating [[furniture]]. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and [[cost]] for the [[Construction|builder]], as well as function and [[aesthetics]] for the [[Consumer|user]].

[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

In modern usage, architecture is the [[art]] and [[discipline]] of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or [[system]]. The term can be used to connote the ''implied architecture'' of abstract things such as [[music]] or [[mathematics]], the ''apparent architecture'' of natural things, such as [[geology|geological]] formations or the [[structural biology|structure of biological cells]], or explicitly ''planned architectures'' of human-made things such as [[software]], [[computers]], [[Enterprise architecture|enterprises]], and [[database]]s, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a ''subjective [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'' from a human perspective (that of the ''user'' in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] or components of some kind of [[structure]] or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing [[aesthetics]]. This distinguishes it from [[applied science]] or [[engineering]], which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.

In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a [[hospital]] or a [[stadium]], to the apparently simpler, such as planning [[residential]] houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political [[symbol]]s, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.

=== Ceramics ===
{{Main article|Ceramic art}}

Ceramic art is art made from [[ceramic]] materials (including [[clay]]), which may take forms such as [[pottery]], [[tile]], [[figurine]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[tableware]]. While some ceramic products are considered [[fine art]], some are considered to be [[Decorative arts|decorative]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], or [[Applied arts|applied]] art objects. Ceramics may also be considered [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] in [[archaeology]].Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery." In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce [[studio pottery]]. In modern ceramic engineering usage, "ceramics" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes [[glass]] and [[mosaic]] made from glass ''[[tessera]]e.''

===Conceptual art===
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}

Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/conceptual-art|title=Conceptual art|publisher=Tate|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practise the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].

===Drawing===
{{Main article|Drawing}}

Drawing is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[Pen|pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil|colour pencils]], [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An [[artist]] who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''drafter'', ''draftswoman'', or ''draughtsman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/draftsman|title=The definition of draftsman|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as [[illustration]]s, [[comics]] and [[animation]].

===Painting===
{{Main article|Painting}}

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]

Painting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. [[Drawing]], [[gesture]] (as in [[gestural painting]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[narrative|narration]] (as in [[narrative art]]), or [[abstraction]] (as in [[abstract art]]), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=Lincoln|title=The Music of Painting|journal=The American Scholar|date=Summer 2014|volume=83|issue=3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a [[still life]] or [[landscape art|landscape painting]]), [[Photorealism|photographic]], abstract, narrative, [[symbol]]istic (as in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist art]]), [[emotion|emotive]] (as in [[Expressionism]]), or [[Politics|political]] in nature (as in [[Artivism]]).

Modern painters have extended the practice considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. Collage is not painting in the strict sense since it includes other materials. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]], [[wood]] or strands of hair for their [[Texture (painting)|artwork texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Elito Circa]], [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]].

===Photography===
{{Main article|Fine art photography}}

Photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to [[photojournalism]], which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.

===Sculpture===
{{Main article|Sculpture}}

'''Sculpture''' is the branch of the [[visual arts]] that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the [[plastic arts]]. Durable sculptural processes originally used [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in [[stone]], [[metal]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood]] and other materials; but since [[modernism]], shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by [[welding]] or modelling, or [[Molding (process)|moulded]], or [[Casting|cast]].

==Literary arts==
{{Main article|Language|Literature}}
{{Listen|filename=Sonnet18.ogg|title=Sonnet 18|description= '''''[[Sonnet 18]]''''' by [[William Shakespeare]] part of the Fair Youth [[Sonnet sequence|sequence]] of [[sonnet]]s.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Literature is literally "acquaintance with letters" as in the first sense given in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The noun "literature" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''littera'' meaning "an individual written character ([[Letter (alphabet)|letter]])." The term has generally come to identify a collection of [[writing]]s, which in Western culture are mainly [[prose]] (both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]), [[drama]] and [[poetry]]. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be [[oral literature|oral]] as well, and include such [[genre]]s as [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[legend]], [[Mythology|myth]], [[ballad]], other forms of oral [[poetry]], and as [[Folklore|folktale]]. [[Comics]], the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the "[[ninth art]]" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading bande dessinée : critical approaches to French-language comic strip|last=Miller|first=Ann|year=2007|isbn=9781841501772|oclc=939254581|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==
{{Main article|Performing arts}}

Performing arts comprise [[dance]], [[music]], [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[mime]], and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford companion to philosophy|last=Honderich|first=Ted|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|isbn=9780199264797|oclc=180031201|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called ''performers'', including [[actor]]s, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;with tools such as [[costume]] and [[Theatrical makeup|stage makeup]].

===Music===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:MozartExcerptK331.svg|thumb|A musical score by [[Mozart]]. {{audio|MozartExcerptK331.mid|Play}}]]

Music is an art form whose [[Media (arts)|medium]] is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs melody and harmony), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]]. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric pieces]]. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within "the arts," music may be classified as a [[performing art]], a [[fine art]], and [[auditory art]].

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}

Theatre or theater (from Greek ''theatron'' (''θέατρον)''; from ''theasthai'', "behold")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=theater&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=theater (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle – indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]] and [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]].

===Dance===
[[File:Ballroom dance exhibition.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[ballroom]] dance exhibition]]
{{Main article|Dance}}

[[Dance]] (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', of unknown origin)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dance&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=dance (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally refers to human [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of expression or presented in a [[social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. ''Dance'' is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s (e.g. [[Bee Dance language|bee dance]], [[Courtship display|mating dance]]), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (e.g. ''the leaves danced in the wind''), and certain [[dance (music)|musical forms]] or [[music|genres]]. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. In [[sport]]s, [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are dance disciplines while [[Martial arts]] "[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]" are often compared to dances.

==Multidisciplinary artistic works==
Areas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as [[film]], [[opera]] and [[Performance Art|performance art]]. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for "works", because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional [[opera]], the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music). [[File:Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute.png|thumb|left|Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute]]The composer [[Richard Wagner]] recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' ("The Ring of the Nibelung"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("synthesis of the arts"), sometimes referred to as "Music Drama" in [[English language|English]], emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical [[ballet]] is another form which emerged in the 17th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.

Other works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as [[Performance Art|performance art]]. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. [[John Cage]] is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition ''[[Living Room Music]]'' composed in 1940 is a "quartet" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.

==Other arts==
There is no clear line between art and [[culture]].  Cultural fields like [[gastronomy]] are sometimes considered as arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/new-face-french-gastronomy/ |title=The New Face of French Gastronomy - Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied arts===
{{Main article|Applied arts}}
The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;"applied art" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. www.oxfordreference.com. Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/applied-art |title=Applied art &amp;#124; Define Applied art at |publisher=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "applied art" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.

===Video games===
{{See also|Video games as an art form}}
A debate exists in the fine arts and [[video game culture]]s over whether video games can be counted as an art form.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=12 December 2012|title=An Art World for Artgames|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/viewArticle/119|last=Parker|first=Felan|journal=Loading...|language=en|volume=7|issue=11|issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators – not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets.

Within social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.&lt;ref name="video-games-and-arts"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=Video Games Playing: A substitute for cultural consumptions?|last1=Borowiecki|first1=Karol J.|last2=Prieto-Rodriguez|first2=Juan|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=239–258|doi=10.1007/s10824-014-9229-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.676.2381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a "work of art" when applying of a grant.{{fact|date=October 2018}} In 2012, the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] presented an exhibit, ''The Art of the Video Game''.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames" /&gt; Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.

'''Underglaze''' is a method of decorating [[pottery]] in which painted decoration is applied to the surface before it is covered with a transparent [[ceramic glaze]] and fired in a kiln. Because the glaze subsequently covers it, such decoration is completely durable, and it also allows the production of pottery with a surface that has a uniform sheen. Underglaze decoration uses [[pigments]] derived from [[oxides]] which fuse with the [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] when the piece is fired in a [[kiln]].  It is also a cheaper method, as only a single firing is needed, whereas [[overglaze decoration]] requires a second firing at a lower temperature. 

However, because the main or [[glost firing]] is at a higher temperature than used in overglaze decoration, the range of available colours is more limited, and was especially so for [[porcelain]] in historical times, as the firing temperature required for the porcelain body is especially high. Early porcelain was largely restricted to underglaze blue, and a range of browns and reds. Other colours turned black in a high-temperature firing.

Examples of oxides that do not lose their colour during a glost firing are the cobalt blue made famous by Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] [[blue and white porcelain]] and the cobalt and turquoise blues, pale purple, sage green, and [[Armenian bole|bole red]] characteristic of [[İznik pottery]].  The painting styles used are covered at (among other articles): [[china painting]], [[blue and white pottery]], [[tin-glazed pottery]], [[maiolica]], Egyptian [[faience]], [[Delftware]].  In modern times a wider range of underglaze colours are available.

An [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]] at the [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site|Tongguan kiln Site]] proved that the technology of underglazed color figure arose in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties periods]] and originated from [[Tongguan Subdistrict|Tonguan]], [[Changsha]].&lt;ref name="Hunandaily"&gt;[http://hnrb.voc.com.cn/hnrb_epaper/html/2014-05/07/content_820950.htm?div=-1 Hunan Daily (2014-05-07)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder''''' is a 1998 book by [[Richard Dawkins]], in which the author discusses the relationship between science and [[the arts]] from the perspective of a scientist.

Dawkins addresses the misperception that science and art are at odds. Driven by the responses to his books ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' and ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' wherein readers resented his naturalistic world view, seeing it as depriving life of meaning, Dawkins felt the need to explain that, as a scientist, he saw the world as full of [[Wonder (emotion)|wonder]]s and a source of pleasure. This pleasure was not in spite of, but rather because he does not assume as cause the inexplicable actions of a [[deity]] but rather the understandable laws of nature.

His starting point is [[John Keats]]' well-known, light-hearted accusation that [[Isaac Newton]] destroyed the poetry of the [[rainbow]] by 'reducing it to the prismatic colours.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He then proposed a toast to 'Newton's health, and confusion to mathematics' to the amusement of all.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins's agenda is to show the reader that science does not destroy, but rather discovers poetry in the patterns of nature.

==Summary==
===Preface===
It is of little concern whether or not science can prove that the ultimate fate of the [[cosmos]] lacks [[meaning of life|purpose]]: we live our lives regardless at a "human" level, according to ambitions and [[perception]]s which come more naturally. Therefore, science should not be feared as a sort of cosmological wet blanket. In fact, those in search of beauty or poetry in their [[cosmology]] need not turn to the [[paranormal]] or even necessarily restrict themselves to the mysterious: science itself, the business of unravelling mysteries, is beautiful and poetic.  (The rest of the preface sketches an outline of the book, makes acknowledgements, etc.)

===The anaesthetic of familiarity===

====Opening lines====
"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively outnumbers the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?"

====Summary====
The first chapter describes several ways in which the universe appears beautiful and poetic when viewed scientifically.  However, it first introduces an additional reason to embrace science.  [[space-time|Time and space]] are vast, so the [[probability]] that the reader came to be alive here and now, as opposed to another time or place, was slim. More important, the probability that the reader came to be alive at all were even slimmer: the correct structure of [[atom]]s had to align in the universe.
Given how special these circumstances are, the "noble" thing to do is employ the allotted several decades of human life towards understanding that universe. Rather than simply feeling connected with nature, one should rise above this "[[anaesthetic]] of familiarity" and ''observe'' the universe scientifically.

===Drawing room of dukes===
This chapter describes a third reason to embrace science (the first two being beauty and duty): improving one's performance in [[the arts]]. Science is often presented publicly in a translated format, "dumbed down" to fit the language and existing ideas of non-scientists. This offers a disservice to the public, who are capable of appreciating the beauty of the universe as deeply as a scientist can. The successful communication of unadulterated science enhances, not confuses, the arts; after all, poets (Dawkins' synonym for artists—see page 24) and scientists are motivated by a similar spirit of wonder. We should therefore battle the [[stereotype]] that science is difficult, uncool, and not useful for the common person.

===Barcodes in the stars===
Studying a phenomenon, such as a flower, cannot detract from its beauty.
First, some scientists, such as [[Feynman]], are able to appreciate the [[aesthetics]] of the flower while engaged in their study. Second, the mysteries which science unfolds lead to new and more exciting mysteries; for example, [[botany]]'s findings might lead us to wonder about the workings of a [[fly]]'s [[consciousness]].
This effect of multiplying mysteries should satisfy even those who think that scientific understanding is at odds with [[aesthetics]], e.g. people who agree with Einstein that "the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious".
(For evidence, the rest of this chapter discusses the fascinating science and beautiful new mysteries which followed in the wake of Newton's "unweaving" of the rainbow, q.e. his explanation of the [[prism (optics)|prism]]atic effects of moist air.)

===Barcodes on the air===
This chapter offers more evidence that science is fun and poetic, by exploring [[sound wave]]s, [[bird vocalization|birdsong]], and low-[[frequency]] phenomena such as [[pendula]] and periodic [[mass extinction]]s.

===Barcodes at the bar===
A fourth reason to embrace science is that it can help deliver justice in a court of law, via [[DNA fingerprinting]] or even via simple statistical reasoning.
Everyone should learn the scientist's art of probability assessment, to make better decisions.

===Hoodwink'd with faery fancy===
This chapter explores what Dawkins considers to be fallacies in [[astrology]], religion, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Extraterrestrial hypothesis|extraterrestrial visitations]]. Credulity and [[David Hume|Hume]]'s criterion are also discussed.

===Unweaving the uncanny===
Amazing coincidences are much more common than we may think, and sometimes, when over-interpreted, they lead to faulty conclusions. [[Statistical significance test]]s can help determine which patterns are meaningful.

===Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance===
Unlike "magisterial poetry" (where metaphors and pretty language are used to describe the familiar), "pupillary poetry" uses poetic imagery to assist a scientist's thinking about the exotic (e.g. consider "being" an [[electron]] temporarily). Although it is useful, some authors take pupillary poetry too far, and, "[[drunk]] on metaphor", they produce "bad science"; i.e. postulate faulty theories. This is powered by humanity's natural tendency to look for representations.

===The selfish cooperator===
[[Gene]]s compete with each other, but this occurs within the context of collaboration, as is shown with examples involving [[mitochondria]], bacteria, and [[termite]]s. Two types of collaboration are co-adaptation (tailoring simultaneously the different parts of an organism, such as flower colour and flower markings), and co-evolution (two species changing together; e.g. [[predator]] and [[prey]] running speeds may increase together in a sort of [[arms race]]).

===The genetic Book of the Dead===
The body of any organism provides clues about its [[habitat]]. The genes allow one to reconstruct a picture of the range of ways of life that the species has experienced; in this sense DNA would act as a [[palimpsest]]ic "[[Digital data|digital]] [[archive]]" if only its language of encoding history could be fully understood. Finally, the curious genetics of [[cuckoo]]s is discussed.

===Reweaving the world===
The brain is akin to a powerful computer, which creates a sort of [[virtual reality]] to model economically the environment. [[Neural]] [[circuitry]] is discussed, and a comparison is made between brains and genes: albeit over different time scales, both record the environment's past to help the [[organism]] make the optimal actions in the (predicted) future.

===The balloon of the mind===
The simultaneous explosions in [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software of the 20th century are together an example of what Dawkins calls "self-feeding co-evolution".
A similar event occurred over a longer time scale (millions of years) when the minds and brains of our ancestors simultaneously improved very rapidly. Five possible triggers of this improvement were: language, map reading, [[ballistics]], [[meme]]s, and [[metaphor]]s/[[analogies]].

====Conclusion====
The final two paragraphs of ''The balloon of the mind'' conclude by saying that human beings are the only animal with a sense of purpose in life, and that that purpose should be to construct a comprehensive [[Scientific modelling|model]] of how the universe works.

==Petwhac==

The book coins an [[acronym]]ical term, ''Petwhac'' ''(Population of Events That Would Have Appeared Coincidental)''. This is defined as all those events that may be considered to be a 'coincidence' if studied casually, but are both possible and statistically probable.

A way to get an idea of how to use the petwhac is as follows. Say you see a friend from school you have not seen for years when you are on holiday (an unlikely event); before saying it is fate or coincidence, think what is in the petwhac (meeting any friend from the same time period at least, friends of your brothers, sisters or parents, old flames, neighbours, teachers, someone who worked in the local chip-shop... the list is probably endless, and all would seem coincidental). In short: the bigger the petwhac, the stronger case you have to avoid ascribing something to [[destiny|fate]] or coincidence.

Dawkins offers several examples of petwhacs in the book, two of which are the bedside clock of a woman ([[Richard Feynman]]'s wife) stopping exactly when she died, and a psychic who stops the watches of his television audience.

The first is explained by the fact that the clock had a mechanical defect which made it stop when tilted off the horizontal, which is what a nurse did to read the time of death in poor lighting conditions. The matter of the watches, in Dawkins' own words, is explained thus —

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If somebody's watch stopped three weeks after the spell was cast, even the most credulous would prefer to put it down to chance. We need to decide how large a delay would have been judged by the audience as sufficiently simultaneous with the psychic's announcement to impress. About five minutes is certainly safe, especially since he can keep talking to each caller for a few minutes before the next call ceases to seem roughly simultaneous. There are about 100,000 five-minute periods in a year. The probability that any given watch, say mine, will stop in a designated five-minute period is about 1 in 100,000. Low odds, but there are 10 million people watching the show. If only half of them are wearing watches, we could expect about 25 of those watches to stop in any given minute. If only a quarter of these ring into the studio, that is 6 calls, more than enough to dumbfound a naïve audience. Especially when you add in the calls from people whose watches stopped the day before, people whose watches didn't stop but whose grandfather clocks did, people who died of heart attacks and their bereaved relatives phoned in to say that their 'ticker' gave out, and so on.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dawkins defends his choice of the word "population" by writing "Population may seem an odd word, but it is the correct statistical term.", adding "I won't keep using capital letters because they stand so unattractively on the page."

'''Wildness''', in its literal sense, is the quality of being [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[Domestication|untamed]]. Beyond this, it has been defined as a quality produced in [[nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; as that which emerges from a forest,&lt;ref&gt;Micoud 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a level of achievement in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "a quality of interactive processing between organism and nature where the realities of base natures are met, allowing the construction of durable systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cookson |first=L. J. |title=A definition for wildness |journal=Ecopsychology |year=2011 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=187–193 |doi=10.1089/eco.2011.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wilderness]] is a place where wildness occurs.

== Cultural perceptions of wildness ==
People have explored the contrast of wildness versus tameness throughout recorded history. The earliest great work of literature, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], tells a story of a wild man [[Enkidu]] in opposition to [[Gilgamesh]] who personifies civilization. In the story, Enkidu is defeated by Gilgamesh and becomes civilized. Cultures vary in their perception of the separation of humans from nature, with [[western civilization]] drawing a sharp contrast between the two while the traditions of many [[indigenous peoples]] have always seen humans as part of nature. The perception of man's place in nature and civilization has also changed over time. In western civilization, for example, [[Darwinism]] and environmentalism have renewed the perception of humans as part of nature, rather than separate from it.
 
Wildness is often mentioned in the writings of naturalists, such as [[John Muir]] and [[David Brower]], where it is admired for its freshness and otherness. [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote the famous phrase, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” Some artists and photographers such as [[Eliot Porter]] explore wildness in the themes of their works. The benefits of reconnecting with nature by seeing the achievements of wildness is an area being investigated by [[ecopsychology]].

Attempts to identify the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are artificial (man-made). Ambiguities about the distinction between the natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.

Another view of wildness is that it is a social construct (Callicott 1994), and that humans cannot be considered innately ‘unnatural’. As wildness is claimed to be a quality that builds from animals and ecosystems, it often fails to be considered within reductionist theories for nature.

Meanwhile, an [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective sees wildness as "(the degree of) subjection to [[natural selection]] pressures", many of which emerge independently from the [[biosphere]].  Thus [[modern civilization]] - contrasted with all [[human]]ity – can be seen as an 'unnatural' force (lacking wildness) as it strongly insulates its population from many natural selection mechanisms, including [[interspecific competition]] such as predation and disease, as well as some [[intraspecific]] phenomena.

== Wildness in animals ==

The importance of maintaining wildness in animals is recognized in the management of [[Wilderness areas]]. Feeding wild animals in national parks for example, is usually discouraged because the animals may lose the skills they need to fend for themselves. Human interventions may also upset continued [[natural selection]] pressures upon the population, producing a version of [[domestication]] within wildlife (Peterson et al. 2005).

Tameness implies a reduction in wildness, where animals become more easily handled by humans. Some animals are easier to tame than others, and are amenable to domestication.

===Rating scales for mouse wildness===
In a clinical setting, ''wildness'' has been used as a scale to rate the ease with which various strains of laboratory mice can be captured and handled ([http://phenome.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=projects/doc&amp;sym=Wahlsten2&amp;doc=protocol Wahlsten et al. 2003]):

|}

In this sense, "wildness" may be interpreted as "tendency to respond with anxiety to handling".  That there is no ''necessary'' connection between this factor and the state of wildness ''per se'', given that some animals in the wild may be handled with little or no cause of anxiety. However, this factor does clearly indicate an animal's resistance to being handled.

===Degrees of domestication===
{{main|Domestication}}
A [[Categorization|classification]] system can be set out showing the spectrum from wild to domesticated animal states:
* '''Wild''': These species experience their full life cycles without deliberate human intervention.
* '''Raised at [[zoo]]s or [[botanical garden]]s''' (captive): These species are nurtured and sometimes bred under human control, but remain as a group essentially indistinguishable in appearance or behaviour from their wild counterparts. (Zoos and botanical gardens sometimes exhibit domesticated or feral animals and plants such as [[camel]]s, [[Mustang (horse)|mustang]]s, and some [[orchids]].)
* '''Raised commercially''' (captive or semidomesticated): These species are [[ranch]]ed or [[farm]]ed in large numbers for food, commodities, or the pet trade, but as a group they are not substantially altered in appearance or behavior.  Examples include the [[elephant]], [[ostrich]], [[deer]], [[alligator]], [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], [[pearl]] [[oyster]], and [[ball python]]. (These species are sometimes referred to as ''partially domesticated''.)
* '''Domesticated''': These species or varieties are bred and raised under human control for many generations and are substantially altered as a group in appearance or behaviour. Examples include the [[domestic canary|canary]], [[pigeon]]s, the [[budgerigar]], the [[peach-faced lovebird]], [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[llama]]s, [[guinea pig]]s and laboratory [[mouse|mice]].

This classification system does not account for several complicating factors: [[genetically modified]] organisms, [[feral]] populations, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control.  Examples include [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]].  Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a [[liger]] is a hybrid of two wild animals, a [[mule]] is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a [[beefalo]] is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.

== Wildness in human psychology ==
{{main|Ecopsychology}}

The basic idea of ecopsychology is that while the human mind is shaped by the modern social world, it can be readily inspired and comforted by the wider natural world, because that is the arena in which it originally evolved. Mental health or unhealth cannot be understood in the narrow context of only intrapsychic phenomena or social relations. One also has to include the relationship of humans to other species and ecosystems. These relations have a deep evolutionary history; reach a natural affinity within the structure of their brains and they have deep psychic significance in the present time, in spite of urbanization. Humans are dependent on healthy nature not only for their physical sustenance, but for mental health, too.

== Wildness in political philosophy ==
{{main|State of nature}}

The concept of a state of nature was first posited by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. Hobbes described the concept in the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'', meaning "the war of all against all." In this state any person has a [[natural right]] to do anything to preserve their own liberty or safety. Famously, he believed that such a condition would lead to a "war of every man against every man" and make life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

Hobbes's view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized persons and simply imagining them living outside of the society they were raised in. He affirmed instead that people were born neither good nor bad; men knew neither vice nor virtue since they had almost no dealings with each other. Their bad habits are the products of [[civilization]] specifically social hierarchies, [[property]], and markets. Another criticism put forth by [[Karl Marx]] is his concept of [[species-being]], or the unique potential of humans for dynamic, creative, and cooperative relations between each other. For Marx and others in his line of [[critical theory]], [[Social alienation|alienated]] and [[reification (Marxism)|abstracted]] social relations prevent the fulfillment of this potential (see [[anomie]]).

[[David Hume]]'s view brings together and challenges the theories of Rousseau and Hobbes. He posits that in the natural state we are born wicked and evil because of, for instance, the cry of the baby that demands attention. Like Rousseau, he believes that society shapes us, but that we are born evil and it is up to society to shape us into who we become.

[[Thoreau]] made many statements on wildness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute Freedom and Wildness, as contrasted with a Freedom and Culture merely civil, — to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.  — "Walking"

I long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me.  — Journal, 22 June 1853

As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented.  — Walden

What we call wildness is a civilization other than our own.  — Journal, 16 February 1859

In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

We need the tonic of wildness — to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hearing the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close o the ground.  — Walden

It is in vain to dream of a wildness distant from ourselves. There is none such.  — Journal, 30 August 1856

The most alive is the wildest.  — "Walking"

Whatever has not come under the sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent men are wild — not tamed and broken by society.  — Journal, 3 September 1851

Trench says a wild man is a willed man. Well, then, a man of will who does what he wills or wishes, a man of hope and of the future tense, for not only the obstinate is willed, but far more the constant and persevering. The obstinate man, properly speaking, is one who will not. The perseverance of the saints is positive willedness, not a mere passive willingness. The fates are wild, for they will; and the Almighty is wild above all, as fate is.  — Journal, 27 June 1853&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7633">{{IC|date=April 2015}}The {{nihongo|'''Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics'''|基礎物理学研究所|kiso butsurigaku kenkyūsho}} is a research institute in the field of [[theoretical physics]], attached to [[Kyoto University]] in [[Japan]]. It was inaugurated in 1952.
While the center is often referred to as "YITP", this can be confusing as YITP also stands for the [[C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics]] at [[Stony Brook University]] in [[the United States]].

==Early history==
In 1949, [[Japan]]ese [[theoretical physicist]] [[Hideki Yukawa]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. He became the first Japanese citizen to receive the [[Nobel Prize]]. To commemorate this historic event, the president of [[Kyoto University]] immediately proposed to create a memorial hall on campus for Yukawa. In 1950, the Science Council of Japan unanimously resolved a request to the central government to allocate a special funding for the promotion of research in theoretical physics. Enthusiastic discussions among Japanese physicists followed in support for the idea of creating a new institution, similar to the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] or the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

Yukawa Hall was inaugurated in 1952 and in 1953, it became the Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (RIFP). Hideki Yukawa was appointed as the first director of the institute. He led the institute until his retirement in 1970.

==Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (1953-1990)==
Research Institute for Fundamental Physics was a new type of national research center for [[theoretical physics]] with its facilities open for research collaborations by the community of theoretical physicists in [[Japan]]. The institute adopted a new system for its operation. Although it formally belongs to [[Kyoto University]], its basic policy has been decided by the representatives of physicists elected from all over the country with institute's own academic staff. One of the unique roles played by the institute was to provide a forum for physicists on problems at the forefront of research in theoretical physics. Many physicists participated in the organization of topical workshops and international conferences at RIFP and stayed to work in collaboration with others. These traditions are still carried by the Yukawa Institute.

The institute started with four academic staff including Yukawa. The institute grew gradually; it had 13 academic positions in 1961. The research activity extended over areas of theoretical physics. Those areas were [[condensed matter theory]], [[field theory (physics)|field theory]], nuclear theory, [[particle physics|particle theory]], [[statistical mechanics]], and nuclear and relativistic [[astrophysics]]. In 1980 it added two more academic positions for new research areas: non-equilibrium statistical physics and non-linear physics. During this period, one visiting professor position was created to invite distinguished foreign physicists.

==Unification with the RITP in Hiroshima (1990)==
The new English name, the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, was adopted after the unification of two institutions: the Research Institute for Theoretical Physics (RITP) of [[Hiroshima University]] and Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (RIFP).

RITP of Hiroshima University was founded in 1944 by Yoshitaka Mimura for the research of mathematical foundations of theoretical physics. On August 6, 1945, it lost two faculty members and a supporting staff, together with all its facilities, by the blast of the [[atomic bomb]] exploded over Hiroshima.

RITP was re-established in 1948 in Takehara, a quiet suburban town of Hiroshima near the water, and stayed there until it was dissolved by the unification in 1990.

A major expansion of the institute took place in 1990 when Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (RIFP) was joined by all academic staff members of the Research Institute for Theoretical Physics (RITP) of Hiroshima University. At the time of the unification, RITP had ten academic staffs and its research area had expanded to include [[cosmology]], [[general relativity]], [[field theory (physics)|field theory]], and [[particle physics|particle theory]].

==Present YITP==
By the expansion of 1990, the size of the institute almost doubled in terms of the number of its own academic staffs. Unfortunately Yukawa Hall had no extra office or library space to accommodate the new members of the institute and the library assets from RITP. Temporary settings for new offices and library was arranged in the Uji campus of Kyoto University which is located about 20&amp;nbsp;km south of Yukawa Hall. Thus, Yukawa Institute became distributed over two distantly located buildings, Yukawa Hall on the Kitashirakawa campus and the Uji Research Center on the Uji campus.

In 1995, the completion of the new building of the Yukawa Institute, constructed next to Yukawa Hall, ended this inconvenient situation of having two geographically separated facilities of the institute. The Uji Research Center was closed at this time. The new building now houses the offices of all 22 academic staffs as well as those for visitors, postdoctoral fellows, students and supporting staffs in addition to the new large library and computing facilities. Yukawa Hall is still used for research conferences and workshops organized by the Yukawa Institute besides use for its administrative offices, including Director's, and for the editorial office of the ''[[Progress of Theoretical Physics]]'', a journal of theoretical physics founded by Yukawa in 1946.

==Activity of YITP==
YITP has been playing a major role in leading the research in theoretical physics and also providing research and collaborative facilities in Japan.

Every year, YITP host a number of workshops on various topics in fundamental physics, and accommodate domestic visitors from various institutions as well as those from foreign countries.

The activity of YITP covers a wide range of fields in contemporary theoretical physics: [[string theory]], [[quantum field theory]], [[gravity]], [[cosmology]], [[particle physics]], [[astrophysics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[statistical physics]], [[condensed matter physics]] and [[biophysics]]. YITP also encourage activities in creating a new interdisciplinary field of research at the forefront of modern theoretical physics.
