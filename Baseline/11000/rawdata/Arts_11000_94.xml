'''198 Contemporary Arts and Learning''', also known as the '''198 Gallery''' or '''198''', is an art space and gallery in [[Railton Road]], [[Brixton]], London.&lt;ref name="De Souza2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Souza|first1=Pauline|editor1-last=Donnell|editor1-first=Alison|title=Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134700257|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VfdpdZ9DwH0C&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=%22198%20Gallery%22&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22198%20Gallery%22&amp;f=false|chapter=198 Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation, originally named Roots Community, was founded in 1988 by John 'Noel' Morgan and Zoe Lindsay-Thomas.&lt;ref name="Davis2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Lucy|last2=Bayode|first2=Folami|editor1-last=Atkinson|editor1-first=Dennis|editor2-last=Dash|editor2-first=Paul|title=Social and Critical Practice in Art Education|date=2005|publisher=Trentham Books|isbn=9781858563114|pages=81–90|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rOKmJsHYT0YC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22198%22%20railton%20road&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q=%22198%22%20railton%20road&amp;f=false|chapter=The 198 Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay-Thomas was a minicab driver and Morgan was manager of the Vargus Social Club in Landor Road. The organisation eventually changed its name to 198 Gallery, after its location on [[Railton Road]].

198's initial remit was to promote the work of contemporary African, Caribbean and Asian artists whose work represented the diversity of British society. 198 later expanded their policy to include artists from outside the UK.

==Exhibitions==
During the course of its 28-year existence, 198 Contemporary Arts and learning has hosted projects and solo exhibitions showcasing the work of over four hundred British and international artists, including: [[Keith Piper (artist)|Keith Piper]], [[Eva Sajovic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In/Visible Cities at 198 CAL - 19 November 2015|url=http://www.198.org.uk/node/253|website=198 Contemporary Arts and Learning|accessdate=21 August 2016|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hew Locke]], [[Brian Griffiths (artist)|Brian Griffiths]], Fernando Palma Rodriguez,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mechatronic Circus Schools Exhibition - 6 December 2000 to 16 June 2001|url=http://www.198.org.uk/artistic-programmes/archives/mechatronic-circus-schools-exhibition|website=198 Contemporary Arts and Learning|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quilla Constance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PUKIJAM, Jennifer Allen aka Quilla Constance - 26 March 2015 to 8 May 2015|url=http://www.198.org.uk/artistic-programmes/upcoming-exhibition-4|website=198 Contemporary Arts and Learning|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barby Asante, [[Delaine Le Bas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Gypsyland, Delaine Le Bas - 21 June 2014 to 20 August 2014|url=http://www.198.org.uk/artistic-programmes/touring-exhibition|website=198 Contemporary Arts and Learning|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Godfried Donkor]]

'''2017 in film''' is an overview of events, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies, festivals, and a list of films released and notable deaths.

==Evaluation of the year==
[[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' observed that for 2017, "the most important event in the world of movies was the revelation, in the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]'' and ''The New Yorker'', of [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|sexual abuse]] by [[Harvey Weinstein]], and the [[Weinstein effect|resulting liberation of the long-stifled voices of the people who had been abused by him or other powerful figures]] in the movie business, and, for that matter, in other arts and industries, too." He emphasizes that in effect, "[w]hat's missing from the year-end list, and from the era in movies, isn't only the unmade work by these filmmakers but the artistry and the careers of cast and crew members who would have been in their unrealized films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Brody|title=The Best Movies of 2017|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2017-in-review/the-best-movies-of-2017|website=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=7 January 2018|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23797">The following is a partial '''list of unproduced Alfred Hitchcock projects''', in roughly chronological order. During a career that spanned more than half a century, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] [[Alfred Hitchcock filmography|directed over fifty films]], and worked on a number of others which never made it beyond the [[pre-production]] stage.

== ''Number 13'' (1922) ==
{{Main|Number 13 (film)}}
This was to be Hitchcock's directorial debut, after working in the art department on twelve films previously, but budgetary problems canceled the production after only a few scenes were shot. Studio records indicate that its title was to be ''Mrs. Peabody''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== ''Forbidden Territory'' (1933–1934) ==
British thriller writer [[Dennis Wheatley]] had been a guest on the set of many of the early Hitchcock movies, and when ''The Forbidden Territory'' was published in January 1933, he presented the director with a copy.  Hitchcock so enjoyed the book that he wanted to make a film of it, but he was just in the process of moving to Gaumont-British studios to work for Michael Balcon; he asked Wheatley to hold onto the rights until he could persuade his new employer to purchase them.   When the time came, however, Balcon wasn't interested and instead insisted that Hitchcock direct the musical ''[[Waltzes from Vienna]]''.   Hitchcock then approached Richard Wainwright, a distinguished producer who had been head of UFA films in Germany, and had recently relocated to Britain.   Wainwright was keen to pick up a promising subject for his first British film, and immediately bought the rights.  Although there was a verbal understanding that Hitchcock was to direct, Balcon refused to release him, and instead began production of ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''.  Wainwright, committed to studio space, technicians and actors, had no alternative but to proceed without him, and placed [[Forbidden Territory|the film]] into the hands of American director Phil Rosen. In 1936, at Hitchcock's instigation, Wheatley wrote a screenplay ''The Bombing of London'', but the controversial project could find no backer and was shelved.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== ''Greenmantle'' (1939–1942) ==
Hitchcock very much wanted to direct a follow-up to ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and he felt that ''[[Greenmantle]]'' by [[John Buchan]] was a superior book. He proposed that the film would star [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]], but the rights from the Buchan estate proved too expensive.&lt;ref name="ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com"&gt;[http://ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com/dubi/2008/03/films-hitchco-1.html] from Ordinary Least Square&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unnamed ''Titanic'' project (1939) ==
Hitchcock remarked in a British film journal interview just before leaving for Hollywood that he hoped to make a film about the tragic loss of RMS ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', as the inherent drama of the ocean liner's sinking appealed to him.  He went on to make ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' instead.

== ''Escape'' (1940) ==
Hitchcock desperately wanted to direct [[Norma Shearer]], [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], and [[Conrad Veidt]] in one of the first [[World War II]] dramas, ''[[Escape (1940 film)|Escape]]''. Hitchcock, a long-time admirer of Shearer's acting, had sought for years to find a suitable project for her. However, Hitchcock was shut out of the project when the novel ''Escape'' by Ethel Vance (pen name of [[Grace Zaring Stone]]) was purchased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Hitchcock knew he could never work for the notorious MGM studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]], who selected [[Mervyn LeRoy]] to produce [[Escape (1940 film)|the film]], which indeed starred Shearer and was released in late 1940. Years later, Hitchcock made the statement about the lack of true Hollywood leading ladies with the quote, "Where are the Norma Shearers?"

== Unmade Nazi documentary (1945) ==
{{Main|German Concentration Camps Factual Survey}}
In 1945, Hitchcock was brought in as a supervising director for a [[documentary film]] about Nazi crimes and Nazi [[Internment|concentration camps]]. The film was originally to include segments produced by military film units from the United Kingdom, United States, France, and the Soviet Union. [[Cold War]] developments meant that the USSR segment was withdrawn, and the film remained uncompleted, with some footage kept in the collection of the [[Imperial War Museum]]. 

However, a reconstruction of the film was aired as ''Memory of the Camps'' in 1984–1985 in the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States version was shown on the PBS series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' on May 7, 1985. In October 2014, a new documentary about the unfinished film, ''Night Will Fall'', premiered at the [[BFI London Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="BBC1945"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29249780 |title=Documentary tells of abandoned Hitchcock Nazi film |access-date=18 September 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Hamlet'' (late 1940s) ==
In the late 1940s, Hitchcock had plans to make a modernized version of the Shakespeare story. Hitchcock's Shakespearean vision was of a "psychological melodrama" (set in contemporary England, and starring Cary Grant in the title role[[Prince Hamlet|)]]. The project was scrapped when Hitchcock's studio caught wind of a potential lawsuit from a professor who had already written a modern-day version of Hamlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hitchcock's notebooks: an authorized and illustrated look inside the creative mind of Alfred Hitchcock|last = Aulier|first = Dan|publisher = Spike|year = 1999|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Bramble Bush'' (1951–1953) ==
''The Bramble Bush'' would have been an adaptation of a 1948 novel by [[David Duncan (writer)|David Duncan]] about a disaffected [[Communism|Communist]] agitator who, on the run from the police, is forced to adopt the identity of a murder suspect. The story would be adapted to take place in [[Mexico]] and [[San Francisco]]. 

The project, originally to come after ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953) as a [[Transatlantic Pictures]] production to be released by [[Warner Bros.]], had a high budget which made it a difficult project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf5l0qtZabMC&amp;pg=PA456&amp;lpg=PA456&amp;dq=david+duncan+the+bramble+bush&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U8psC0NI4c&amp;sig=3EM1D6BRMmJQou9rE3kkGA1GlmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxC-TIfDDoyqsAPSpqD7DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20duncan%20the%20bramble%20bush&amp;f=false Patrick McGilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light'' (2002) via Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock did not feel that any of the scripts lifted the movie beyond an ordinary chase story, and Warner Brothers allowed him to kill the project and move on to ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954). 

The theme of the hero assuming a dangerous new identity would become the kernel of the script for ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959). [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s  film ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]'' (1975) tells a similar story, but is not based on Duncan's book.&lt;ref name="ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com"/&gt; The 1960 film ''[[The Bramble Bush]]'', starring [[Richard Burton]] and [[Barbara Rush]], and released by Warner Bros., was based on a Charles Mergendahl novel, and had no relation to Duncan's book.

== ''Flamingo Feather'' (1956) ==
This was to be a big-budget adaptation of [[Laurens van der Post]]'s novel of political intrigue in [[Southern Africa]]. [[James Stewart]] was expected to take the lead role of an adventurer who discovers a concentration camp for Communist agents; Hitchcock wanted [[Grace Kelly]] to play the love interest. 

After a disappointing research trip to [[South Africa]] where he concluded that he would have difficulty filming, especially on a budget &amp;ndash; and with confusion of the story's politics and the impracticability of casting Kelly, Hitchcock deferred the project and instead cast Stewart in ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' ([[1956 in film|1956]]). Hitchcock travelled to Livingstone at The Victoria Falls and was a guest of Harry Sossen one of the prominent inhabitants of this pioneer town. Hitchcock and Sossen were photographed together at the newly opened Livingstone Airport and the event was recorded in the local papers. Sossen was also in communication with Laurens van der Post who gave him a signed copy of the book ''Flamingo Feather'' during a visit to the Falls (staying at the [[Victoria Falls Hotel]]). Sossen's daughter Marion is in possession of the book today and a number of letters between her father and van der Post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/books/beginnings/9908/making.of.psycho Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ''Psycho''] from CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''No Bail for the Judge'' (1958–1961) ==
''No Bail for the Judge''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2007/43/hitchcock-thriller-no-bail-judge/ No Bail for the Judge] from sensesofcinema.com&lt;/ref&gt; was to be an adaptation of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel by [[Henry Cecil Leon|Henry Cecil]] about a London [[barrister]] who, with the assistance of a gentleman thief, has to defend her father, a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge, when he is accused of murdering a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. In a change of pace from his usual blonde actresses, [[Audrey Hepburn]] would have played the barrister, with [[Laurence Harvey]] as the thief, and [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as the Hepburn character's father. Some sources, including ''Writing with Hitchcock'' author Steven DeRosa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writingwithhitchcock/nobailforthejudge.html No Bail for the Judge]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from writingwithhitchcock.com&lt;/ref&gt; say that Hitchcock's interest in the novel started in the summer of 1954 while filming ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', and that Hitchcock hoped to have [[John Michael Hayes]] write the screenplay. Hepburn was an admirer of Hitchcock's work and had long wanted to appear in one of his films.

[[Samuel A. Taylor]], scenarist for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', wrote the screenplay after [[Ernest Lehman]] rejected it. The Taylor screenplay included a scene, not in the original novel, where the heroine disguises herself as a prostitute and has to fend off a [[rape|rapist]]. Hepburn left the film, partly because of the near-rape scene, but primarily due to a pregnancy. (Hepburn suffered a miscarriage during the filming of the 1960 film ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' and then gave birth to son Sean Ferrer in July 1960.) Laurence Harvey still ended up working with Hitchcock in 1959, however, on an episode that Hitchcock directed of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.

Without Hepburn, the project didn't have the same appeal for Hitchcock. Changes in British law concerning prostitution and entrapment&amp;nbsp;— changes that took place after the novel was published&amp;nbsp;— made some aspects of the screenplay implausible. Hitchcock told [[Paramount Pictures]] it was better to write off $200,000 already spent on the film's development than to spend another $3 million for a film he no longer cared for. In the fall of 1959, a Paramount publicity brochure titled "Success in the Sixties!" had touted ''No Bail for the Judge'' as an upcoming feature film starring Hepburn, to be filmed in [[Technicolor]] and [[VistaVision]].

== ''The Wreck of the Mary Deare'' (1959) ==
The [[Hammond Innes]] [[The Wreck of the Mary Deare|novel]] was optioned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] with the intention of having Hitchcock direct and [[Gary Cooper]] star. Hitchcock had long wanted to work with Cooper, but after developing the script with Ernest Lehman for several weeks, they concluded that it couldn't be done without turning the movie into "a boring courtroom drama". 

Hitchcock and Lehman made an appearance before MGM executives telling the story of ''[[North by Northwest]]'', and said that MGM would get two films out of Hitchcock under his contract with MGM. However, eventually Hitchcock abandoned the idea of ''Mary Deare'' and went ahead with ''North by Northwest'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2003), pg. 543, 548-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Blind Man'' (1960) ==
Following ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', Hitchcock re-united with Ernest Lehman for an original screenplay idea: A blind pianist, Jimmy Shearing (a role for [[James Stewart]]), regains his sight after receiving the eyes of a dead man. Watching a [[American frontier|Wild West]] show at [[Disneyland]] with his family, Shearing would have visions of being shot and would come to realize that the dead man was in fact murdered and the image of the murderer is still imprinted on the retina of his eyes. The story would end with a chase around the ocean liner [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']]. [[Walt Disney]] reputedly barred Hitchcock from shooting at [[Disneyland]] after seeing ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Stewart left the project, Lehman argued with Hitchcock, and the script was never shot.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gore ''The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999, p.36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Village of Stars'' (1962) ==
Hitchcock bought the rights to the 1960 novel ''Village of Stars'' by [[Arthur David Beaty|David Beaty]] (written under the pen name Paul Stanton) after ''The Blind Man'' project was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gore, ''The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made'' (New York: [[St. Martin's Press]], 1999), pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The book follows a [[Royal Air Force]] [[V bomber]] crew given an order to drop a nuclear bomb, only to have the order aborted. Unfortunately, the bomb is resisting attempts to defuse it and the plane can only stay in flight for a limited time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stanton (David Beaty) ''Village of Stars'', London: Michael Joseph, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Trap for a Solitary Man'' (1963) ==
''Trap for a Solitary Man'' was scheduled to be directed by Hitchcock in widescreen by [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Spoto, ''The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock'' (Boston: Little, Brown, 1983 {{ISBN|0-316-80723-0}}), pg. 445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Gottlieb, "Unknown Hitchcock: the Unrealized Projects;" featured in ''Hitchcock: Past and Future'' (London: Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0-415-27525-3}}), pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The story, based on the French play ''Piege Pour un Homme Seul'' by M. Robert Thomas, follows a young married couple on holiday in the Alps. The wife disappears, and after a prolonged search the police bring back someone they claim to be her; she even says she is the man's wife, but the man has never seen her before. The play was later adapted three times as [[television film]]s: ''[[Honeymoon With a Stranger]]'' ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], 1969), ''[[One of My Wives Is Missing]]'' (ABC, 1976) and ''[[Vanishing Act (1986 film)|Vanishing Act]]'' ([[CBS]], 1986).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064438/movieconnections Internet Movie Database]&lt;/ref&gt;  It had previously been broadly adapted (without attribution) as the 1958 [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British-Pathé]] feature ''[[Chase a Crooked Shadow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/ccorcos/lawctr/TOPTENMOVIES.htm "Top Ten Law-Related Movies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Mary Rose'' (1964) ==
Hitchcock had long desired to turn [[J. M. Barrie]]'s 1920 play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' into a film. In 1964, after working together on ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', Hitchcock asked [[Jay Presson Allen]] to adapt the play into a screenplay. Hitchcock would later tell interviewers that his contract with [[Universal Pictures]] allowed him to make any film, so long as the budget was under $3 million, and so long as it was not ''Mary Rose''. Whether or not this was actually true, [[Lew Wasserman]] was not keen on the project, though Hitchcock never gave up hope of one day filming it.&lt;ref name="Francois Truffaut 1985"&gt;François Truffaut, Hitchcock Revisited (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Three Hostages'' (1964) ==
In 1964, Hitchcock re-read another [[Richard Hannay]] novel by John Buchan, ''[[The Three Hostages]]'', with a mind to adapting it. As with ''Greenmantle'' a quarter of a century earlier, the rights were elusive. But also the story was dated, very much rooted in the 1930s, and the plot involved a villain whose blind mother [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the hero. Hitchcock, in interviews, said that he felt that the portrayal of hypnosis did not work on film, and that films that attempted this portrayal, in Hitchcock's opinion, turned out poorly.&lt;ref&gt;François Truffaut ''Hitchcock Revisited'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Frenzy'' (a.k.a. ''Kaleidoscope'') (1964–1967) ==
Although Hitchcock made a film called ''[[Frenzy]]'' in 1972, that film's title and some plot points came from an idea Hitchcock had a few years earlier for a [[prequel]] to ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stevenderosa.com/writingwithhitchcock/frenzy.html Frenzy] from stevenderosa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock approached many writers including [[Samuel A. Taylor|Samuel Taylor]], [[Alec Coppel]], and ''Psycho'' writer [[Robert Bloch]], but in the end engaged an old friend, [[Benn Levy]] to flesh out his sketchy idea.

The story (inspired by English serial killers [[Neville Heath]] and [[John George Haigh]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barber |first1=Nicholas |title=Why Hitchcock’s Kaleidoscope was too shocking to be made |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180620-why-hitchcocks-kaleidoscope-was-too-shocking-to-be-made |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 June 2018 |language=en |date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; would have revolved around a young, handsome bodybuilder  who lures young women to their deaths, a version of the character known as 'Merry Widow Murderer' in ''Shadow of a Doubt''. The [[New York City Police Department|New York police]] set a trap for him, with a policewoman posing as a potential victim. The script was based around three [[set piece|crescendos]] dictated by Hitchcock: the first was a murder by a waterfall; the second murder would take place on a mothballed warship; and the finale, which would take place at an oil refinery with brightly colored drums.

Hitchcock showed his script to his friend [[François Truffaut]]. Though Truffaut admired the script, he felt uneasy about its relentless sex and violence. Unlike ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', these elements would not be hidden behind the respectable veneer of [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] and psychological [[suspense]], and the killer would be the main character, the hero, the eyes of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock'' by [[Donald Spoto]] (1983, {{ISBN|0-316-80723-0}}; 1999 paperback reprint {{ISBN|0-306-80932-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal vetoed the film, despite Hitchcock's assurances that he would make the film for under $1 million with a cast of unknowns, although [[David Hemmings]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Michael Caine]] had all been suggested as leads. The film&amp;nbsp;— alternatively known as ''Frenzy'' or the more "sixties"-esque ''Kaleidoscope''&amp;nbsp;— was not made.

Test footage from this project can be viewed here [https://www.flickr.com/photos/49597617@N02/4629223639/] and is included in the 1999 TV documentaries ''Dial H For Hitchcock: The Genius Behind the Showman'' ([[Starz Encore|Encore]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=35173 1999 Universal TV press release]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Reputations: Alfred Hitchcock'' ([[A&amp;E Networks|A&amp;E]]/[[BBC Two]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The silent eloquence of the Master of Suspense," ''The Independent'', 6 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''R.R.R.R.'' (1965) ==
Hitchcock approached Italian comedy-thriller writers [[Agenore Incrocci]] and [[Furio Scarpelli]] ([[Age &amp; Scarpelli]]), writers of ''[[Big Deal on Madonna Street]]'', to write a screenplay around an original idea Hitchcock had carried in his head since the late 1930s. A [[New York City]] hotel is run by an Italian immigrant who is unaware that his family are using the hotel as cover for crimes, including the theft of a valuable coin from a guest of the hotel. (R.R.R.R. is the highest value of coin.)

The Italian screenwriters struggled with the story, and were not helped by the language barrier.  Universal Pictures were not keen on the idea and persuaded Hitchcock to move on to something else.&lt;ref name="Francois Truffaut 1985"/&gt;

== ''The Short Night'' (1976–1979) ==
{{Main|The Short Night}}
Hitchcock's last, unfinished project was ''[[The Short Night]]'', an adaptation of the spy thriller of the same name by [[Ronald Kirkbride]]. A British double agent (loosely based on [[George Blake]]) escapes from prison and flees to [[Moscow]] via [[Finland]], where his wife and children are waiting. An American agent &amp;ndash; whose brother was one of the traitor's victims &amp;ndash; heads to Finland to intercept him but ends up falling for the wife. It was Hitchcock's third attempt &amp;ndash; after ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' &amp;ndash; to produce a "realistic [[James Bond|Bond]] film". [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Sean Connery]] were possible male leads. [[Liv Ullmann]] was asked to play the double agent's wife. [[Catherine Deneuve]] was also asked to star.  [[Walter Matthau]] was considered for the villain role.  [[Ed Lauter]] was also discussed for a role as one of Matthau's prison mates.  

The first writer assigned to the picture, [[James Costigan]], quarreled with the director, who asked for him to be paid off. Then [[Ernest Lehman]] agreed to work on the script. Lehman felt the story should focus on the American spy, and left out the double agent's jailbreak. Lehman left the film too, and Hitchcock asked old friend [[Norman Lloyd]] to help him write a long [[Film treatment|treatment]]. Lloyd, like Universal, was concerned that Hitchcock's failing health meant that the movie might not get made. When Hitchcock suggested moving straight on to the screenplay, Lloyd objected, saying they were unprepared. Hitchcock reacted angrily, fired Lloyd, and worked on the treatment alone.

After a while, Hitchcock accepted that he needed another writer to work with him, and Universal suggested [[David Freeman (screenwriter)|David Freeman]]. Freeman helped Hitchcock complete the treatment and wrote the screenplay. He wrote about his experiences in the 1999 book ''The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock'', which includes his completed screenplay. The circumstances surrounding Hitchcock's retirement were given by producer [[Hilton A. Green]] during the documentary ''Plotting "Family Plot"''. According to Green, during [[pre-production]] for ''The Short Night'' Hitchcock met Green to tell him that his poor health would prevent him from making the film that was to be the follow-up to ''[[Family Plot]]''. After trying to talk Hitchcock out of his decision, Green agreed to Hitchcock's request to bring the news of his decision to retire to studio head [[Lew Wasserman]], a long-time friend of Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0455182|Plotting "Family Plot"}}. [[Hilton A. Green|Hilton Green]] tells the story about the circumstances that led to Hitchock's retirement, beginning at approximately 44 minutes and 12 seconds into the documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Basket of Fruit''''' (c.1599) is a [[still life]] painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]] (1571–1610), which hangs in the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] (Ambrosian Library), [[Milan]].

It shows a wicker basket perched on the edge of a ledge. The basket contains a selection of summer fruit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... a good-sized, light-red peach attached to a stem with wormholes in the leaf resembling damage by oriental fruit moth (Orthosia hibisci). Beneath it is a single bicolored apple, shown from a stem perspective with two insect entry holes, probably codling moth, one of which shows secondary rot at the edge; one blushed yellow pear with insect predations resembling damage by leaf roller (Archips argyospita); four figs, two white and two purple—the purple ones dead ripe and splitting along the sides, plus a large fig leaf with a prominent fungal scorch lesion resembling anthracnose (Glomerella cingulata); and a single unblemished quince with a leafy spur showing fungal spots. There are four clusters of grapes, black, red, golden, and white; the red cluster on the right shows several mummied fruit, while the two clusters on the left each show an overripe berry. There are two grape leaves, one severely desiccated and shriveled while the other contains spots and evidence of an egg mass. In the right part of the basket are two green figs and a ripe black one is nestled in the rear on the left. On the sides of the basket are two disembodied shoots: to the right is a grape shoot with two leaves, both showing severe insect predations resembling grasshopper feeding; to the left is a floating spur of quince or pear.&lt;ref name="purdue1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/caravaggio/caravaggio_l.html |title=Caravaggio |publisher=Hort.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much has been made of the worm-eaten, insect-predated, and generally less than perfect condition of the fruit. In line with the culture of the age, the general theme appears to revolve about the fading beauty, and the natural decaying of all things. Scholars also describe the basket of fruit as a metaphor of the Church.

A recent X-ray study revealed that it was painted on an already used canvas painted with grotesques in the style of Caravaggio’s friend [[Prospero Orsi]], who helped the artist in his first breakthrough into the circles of collectors such as his first patron, [[Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte]], around 1594/1595, and who remained close to him for many years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artonline.it/eng/opera.asp?IDOpera=73 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125052634/http://www.artonline.it/eng/opera.asp?IDOpera=73 |date=November 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have had more than their usual level of disagreement in assigning a date to the painting: [[John T. Spike]] places it in 1596; [[Catherine Puglisi]] believes that 1601 is more probable; and practically every year in between has been advanced. Puglisi's reasoning seem solid, (the basket in this painting seems identical with the one in the first of Caravaggio's two versions of ''[[Supper at Emmaus (disambiguation)|Supper at Emmaus]]'' - even the quince seems to be the same piece of fruit), but no consensus has emerged.&lt;ref name="purdue1"/&gt;

In 1607 it was part of Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]]’s collection, a provenance which raises the plausibility of a conscious reference to the Book of Amos. Borromeo, who was archbishop of [[Milan]], was in Rome approximately 1597-1602 and a house guest of Del Monte in 1599. He had a special interest in the Northern European painters such as [[Paul Bril]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], who were also in Rome at the time, (indeed, he took Breughel into his own household), and in the way they did landscapes and flowers in paintings as subjects in their own right, something not known at the time in Italian art. He would have seen the way Caravaggio did still life as incidental accessories in paintings such as ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard (Caravaggio)|Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'', ''[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]'', in Del Monte's collection, and ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'' in the collection of Del Monte's friend [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]]. The scholarly Giustiniani wrote a treatise on painting years later, wherein, reflecting the hierarchical conventions of his day, he placed flowers "and other tiny things" only fifth on a twelve-scale register, but he said also that Caravaggio once said to him "that it used to take as much workmanship for him to do a good picture of flowers as it did to do one of human figures."

Like its doppelganger in ''Supper at Emmaus'', the basket seems to teeter on the edge of the picture-space, in danger of falling out of the painting and into the viewer's space instead. In the ''Supper'' this is a dramatic device, part of the way in which Caravaggio creates the tension of the scene; here, ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' seems to be almost the whole purpose of the painting, if we subtract the possible didactic element. But the single element that no doubt attracted its original owner, and still catches attention today, is the extraordinary quasi-photographic realism of the observation which underlies the illusionism. ''Basket of Fruit'' can be compared with the same artist's ''[[Still Life with Fruit (Caravaggio)|Still Life with Fruit]]'' (c. 1603), a painting which John Spike identifies as "the source of all subsequent Roman still-life paintings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/03/02/cara.t.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050814080036/http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/03/02/cara.t.php |date=August 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other people}}
'''Catherine Blake''' (née '''Boucher'''; 25 April 1762 – 18 October 1831) was the wife of the poet, painter and [[Engraving|engraver]] [[William Blake]], and a vital presence and assistant throughout his life.

==Life==
Catherine was born the daughter of a man of a market gardener{{clarification needed|date=February 2017}} in [[Battersea]], then just outside London on the other side of the [[River Thames]]. She met William here in 1781, during his brief visit to the area, while he was recovering from an emotional upset following the failure of an earlier relationship. Their courtship was brief. According to early biographers of Blake, Catherine immediately recognised him as her future husband and when she sympathised with him over his earlier emotional troubles he replied "do you pity me? Then I love you."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wright, ''Life of William Blake'', Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Blake married Catherine &amp;ndash; who was five years his junior &amp;ndash; on 18 August 1782 in [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an 'X'.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/William_Blake/11.R.htm Catherine Blake, ca.1805]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 5 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They remained together until his death in 1827.&lt;ref name="M155"&gt;Myrone, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Blake taught her to read and write, and also to use his [[printing-press]].

The couple did not have children, and it has been suggested that Blake wanted to bring a concubine into the relationship to act as a surrogate mother, which was consistent with the theories of [[Swedenborgianism]] by which Blake was influenced.&lt;ref name = "rob"&gt;Robert Rix, ''William Blake and the Cultures of Radical Christianity'', Ashgate, 2007, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Blake's earliest biographer [[Alexander Gilchrist]] does not mention this, but speaks of unspecified troubles in the early years of the relationship. However, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] later explicitly asserted that this was the case, but that Blake dropped the idea when he saw that it upset Catherine. No documentary evidence survives supporting this notion, but Blake is known to have stated that he "learned from the Bible that wives should be held in common."&lt;ref name = "rob"/&gt;
[[File:The Letters of William Blake (1906) Kate's portrait.png|thumb|200px|Pencil drawing by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] after Tatham's life sketch of Catherine Blake]]&lt;!-- another poor reproduction at File:The Letters of William Blake- Catherine Blake.png --&gt;
Writers who knew the couple in their later years describe a very happy relationship. In 1802, [[William Hayley]] wrote that William "and his excellent wife (a true helpmate!) pass the plates thro' a rolling press in their own cottage together".&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt; On his deathbed, Blake drew a picture of Catherine as his last work, stating "you have ever been an angel to me".

After her husband's death Catherine was taken in by Blake's admirer [[Frederick Tatham]], for whom she nominally worked as a housekeeper. At this period she continued to sell Blake's works. When she died four years later Tatham claimed that she had bequeathed all Blake's works to him. When he later converted to [[Irvingite]] beliefs, he destroyed a number of them, asserting that they were inspired by the devil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ackroyd]], ''William Blake'', pp. 368–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Blake's art==
Throughout her husband's uneven career, Catherine not only took an active role in the production of William's engravings and illuminated books; she also ran the household finances and offered strong practical support. William's friend [[John Thomas Smith (1766–1833)|J. T. Smith]] said that Blake "allowed her, to the last moment of his practice, to take off his proof impressions and print his works, which she did most carefully."&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt; Catherine's role in colouring at least some of William's illuminated books has been wide, although her hand is usually attributed to some of the more clumsily rendered passages. Her work as a printer is held in higher regard.&lt;ref name="M155" /&gt;

==Role in literature==
It has often been suggested that the figure of [[Enitharmon]] in Blake's mythology is partly inspired by Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila A. Spector, ''Glorious Incomprehensible: The Development of Blake's Kabbalistic Language'', Bucknell University Press, 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Enitharmon is the wife of the "eternal prophet" [[Los (Blake)|Los]] in Blake's writings. Catherine is explicitly identified as the poet's "shadow of delight" in the second part of Blake's ''[[Milton a Poem]]''.

Catherine appears as a model wife in William Hayley's writings on ideal marriages. In more recent literature, she is the central character in [[Janet Adele Warner]]'s novel ''Other Sorrows, Other Joys: The Marriage of Catherine Sophia Boucher and William Blake'' (2001) and also features in [[Tracy Chevalier]]'s novel ''Burning Bright'' (2007). She is an amateur detective in short stories by [[Keith Heller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hycyber.com/MYST/EQ_ha.html|title=hycyber.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]]'s stage play ''In Lambeth'' dramatised a visit by [[Thomas Paine]] to the [[Lambeth]] home of William and Catherine Blake in 1789. It was first performed at the East Dulwich Tavern in July 1989. The play was later adapted for television in the [[BBC Two]] ''Encounters'' series (which featured similar fictionalised meetings between historical figures) and was first broadcast on 4 July 1993. It was directed by Sebastian Graham-Jones, and featured [[Mark Rylance]] as William, [[Bob Peck]] as Paine and Lesley Clare O'Neill as Catherine.

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)
{{ISBN|0763721972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Superposability|file=S06144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word for hand, χεῖρ (''kheir'').

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W. D. | year = 1959 | title = Stereochemistry of the Primary Carbon. X.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html |title=Space radiation may select amino acids for life |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meierhenrich Uwe J., Nahon Laurent, Alcaraz Christian, Hendrik Bredehöft Jan, Hoffmann Søren V., Barbier Bernard, Brack André | year = 2005 | title = Asymmetric Vacuum UV photolysis of the Amino Acid Leucine in the Solid State | url = | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 5630–5634 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200501311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-[[racemic]] chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''.  Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.&lt;ref name=EllielChir97&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eliel, E.L. | year = 1997 | title = Infelicitous Stereochemical Nomenclatures | journal = Chirality | volume = 9 | pages = 428–430 | url =  https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/inter.4/eliel/eliel.html | access-date = 5 February 2016 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-636x(1997)9:5/6&lt;428::aid-chir5&gt;3.3.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample  have the same chirality sense. Use of '''homochiral''' as a synonym is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=asymmetric synthesis| file = E02072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral''' when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomerically enriched (enantioenriched)| file = E02071}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enantiomeric excess]] or '''e.e.''' is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of ''R'' contains 70% ''R'' and 30% ''S'' (70% − 30% = 40%).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomer excess (enantiomeric excess)| file = E02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

'''Color mapping''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that maps (transforms) the [[color]]s of one (source) [[Digital image|image]] to the colors of another (target) image. A color mapping may be referred to as the [[algorithm]] that results in the mapping function or the algorithm that transforms the image colors. Color mapping is also sometimes called ''color transfer'' or, when [[Grayscale|grayscale images]] are involved, ''brightness transfer function (BTF)''.

== Algorithms ==
There are two types of color mapping algorithms: those that employ the statistics of the colors of two images, and those that rely on a given [[pixel]] correspondence between the images.

An example of an algorithm that employs the statistical properties of the images is [[histogram matching]]. This is a classic algorithm for color mapping, suffering from the problem of sensitivity to image content differences. Newer statistic-based algorithms deal with this problem. An example of such algorithm is adjusting the [[mean]] and the [[standard deviation]] of [[Lab color space|Lab]] channels of the two images.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~turkel/imagepapers/ColorTransfer.pdf Color Transfer between Images]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common algorithm for computing the color mapping when the pixel correspondence is given is building the [[Frequency_distribution#Joint_frequency_distributions|joint-histogram]] (see also [[co-occurrence matrix]]) of the two images and finding the mapping by using [[dynamic programming]] based on the joint-histogram values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2003-103.pdf Inter-Camera Color Calibration using Cross-Correlation Model Function]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the pixel correspondence is not given and the image contents are different (due to different point of view), the statistics of the image corresponding regions can be used as an input to statistics-based algorithms, such as histogram matching. The corresponding regions can be found by detecting the corresponding [[Feature_detection_(computer_vision)|features]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.idc.ac.il/sefyk/colmap.htm Piecewise-consistent Color Mappings of Images Acquired Under Various Conditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135029/http://www1.idc.ac.il/sefyk/colmap.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Color mapping can serve two different purposes: one is calibrating the colors of two cameras for further processing using two or more sample images, the second is adjusting the colors of two images for perceptual visual compatibility.

[[Color calibration]] is an important pre-processing task in [[computer vision]] applications. Many applications simultaneously process two or more images and, therefore, need their colors to be calibrated. Examples of such applications are: [[Image differencing]], [[Image registration|registration]], [[object recognition]], multi-camera [[Video tracking|tracking]], [[Segmentation (image processing)|co-segmentation]] and [[Correspondence problem|stereo reconstruction]].

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3310">A '''creative work''' is a manifestation of [[creativity|creative]] effort including [[Work of art|fine artwork]] ([[sculpture]], [[painting]]s, [[drawing]], [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]], [[performance art]]),  dance, writing ([[literature]]), [[filmmaking]], and [[music|musical composition]].

Creative works require a creative mindset and are not typically rendered in an arbitrary fashion although some works demonstrate [have in common] a degree of arbitrariness, such that it is improbable that two people would independently create the same work. At its base, creative work involves two main steps—having an idea, and then turning that idea into a substantive form or process.  The creative process can involve one or more individuals.  Based upon technological advances as well as artificial intelligence there is the possibility that creative works can be created without human intervention - thereby removing the step of "having an idea".  Typically the creative process has some aesthetic value which is identified as a creative expression which itself generally invokes an external stimuli which a person views as creative.
The term is frequently used in the context of [[copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanford|first1=Law Library|title=Copyright &amp; Fair Use|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/faqs/copyright-basics/|website=Fair Use|publisher=Stanford Libraries|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
For the purpose of section 221(2)(c) of the [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], the expression "creative works" means: 
{{quote|(a) literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, or &lt;br/&gt;(b) designs,&lt;br/&gt;created by the taxpayer personally or, if the qualifying trade, profession or vocation is carried on in partnership, by one or more of the partners personally.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/5/section/221 section 221(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Superwork ==
A '''superwork''' is a creative work that contains multiple creative works all derived from the same originating work.&lt;ref&gt;{{#invoke:Wikidata|getValueFromID|Q24261928|P50|FETCH_WIKIDATA}}, ''{{#invoke:Wikidata|getValueFromID|Q24261928|P1476|FETCH_WIKIDATA}}'' ([https://books.google.fr/books?id=r0iBW7fygu8C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true extract])&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, the superwork from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' could comprise the original text, [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|the Little Mermaid statue]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989 film), commentaries, etc.

In the context of [[Semantic Web]] the superwork was standardized as "[http://schema.org/CreativeWork CreativeWork] container", so it is a ''CreativeWork'' with many [http://schema.org/hasPart hasPart] relations with other ''CreativeWork''.
Examples, as container/part list:  [http://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries CreativeWorkSeries]/[http://schema.org/episode episode], [http://schema.org/WebSite WebSite]/[http://schema.org/WebPage WebPage], [http://schema.org/PublicationIssue PublicationIssue]/[http://schema.org/Article Article].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3767">'''''Death To The Brutes''''' is the title of a historical [[anarchist]] [[poster]] that was originally printed in [[France]] in August 1943, during [[World War II]] . The poster was signed "International Revolutionary Syndicalist Federation (F.I.S.R.)". 150 copies of the poster were produced.&lt;ref name=libcom&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The poster was referred to by [[Jean Rabaut]] in his best-selling ''Tout est possible!: Les gauchistes français 1929-1944'' (''Everything Is Possible: The French Leftists 1929-1944''), in which he gave, according to [[Libcom.org]], "a very distorted description of its contents, stating that it urged people to nail all "brutes" to doors, including those wearing the symbol of the "[[five-pointed star]].""&lt;ref name=libcom/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabaut, Jean. ''Tout est possible!: Les gauchistes français 1929-1944''. Paris: Denoël-Gonthier, 1974 {{oclc|1505571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the poster illustrates well the militant pro-worker, cosmopolitan, anti-militarist and anti-government sentiments common to the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] movement.

Original copies of the poster are held by the C.I.R.A. Library, Centre Internationale de Recherches sur l'Anarchisme, avenue de Beaumont 24, CH-1012 Lausanne, Switzerland.

{{Quotation|Proletarians!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
From East to West, from South to North, throughout the world, for three years, to a greater or lesser extent, you have been paying the price of the battle unleashed by your masters. Thousands of proletarians of all countries are dying, while men of finance, politics and war, brutes that they are, congratulate each other, giving speeches, sharing out the benefits, and dividing the wealth and privileges among them selves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Remember, you veterans of the "war to end all wars," when you came home in 1918, still blood-stained from that infamous butchery which left ten million dead, twenty million injured, ten million permanently disabled, three million missing and millions of widows and orphans--then you said, and promised, NEVER AGAIN! Now, again, the military beasts have got their hands on you. All over the world, men are no longer men, they are serial numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
How long will this last? Until the proletarians of the whole world understand that they have only one enemy: their bosses. Until the proletarians of the whole world fraternize, unite and finally charge forward, armed with bayonets still wet with their brothers' blood, to stab in the ass all the governing and war- mongering charlatans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Proletarians: In 1919 and in 1936 you shouted, "Death to The Brutes!" Now, in 1943, don't shout, ACT. Death to ALL of them, whether they wear the [[swastika]], the [[Order of the Red Star|red star]], the [[Order of the Garter]], the [[Cross of Lorraine|Lorraine Cross]] or the [[Vichy France|Francisque]].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
LONG LIVE LIBERTY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
LONG LIVE PEACE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
LONG LIVE THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION!}}

The '''''Defensor minor''''' is a work by [[Marsilius of Padua]] written around 1342. The Defensor minor is a restatement and defense of Marsilius's best known work, the ''[[Defensor pacis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nederman, Cary J. [http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521408466 Marsiglio of Padua: 'Defensor minor' and 'De translatione imperii']&lt;/ref&gt; 

The text discusses civil and [[ecclesiastical]] jurisdiction, the [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[penance]], [[indulgence]]s, the [[Crusades]], [[pilgrimage]]s, [[plenitudo potestatis]], legislative power, the origin of the sovereignty, [[wedding]], and [[divorce]].

==Civil jurisdiction==
With regard to jurisdiction, Marsilius distinguishes between divine and human laws, the first event which is independent of any human will and on the conduct of man in view of the afterlife, the second which determines the will of the people, endowed with coercive power and not modifiable by any clergyman.

This applies also to the Pope that even with his decrees may waive the law, manifestation of the people's sovereignty. While the beneficiaries of the two laws are identical, its object and purpose are different. The one seeks the good of the soul and the other cares for earthly well-being, with the result that the church is denied the power to make laws, even in the persistent silence of human legislation. The same applies to amendments and changes, which should remain solely with the people. The only thing that is relevant to the clergy is the non-legal rules that affect morality and resolve themselves into simple counsels and take effect with counsellors.

==The clergy==
The task and the main function of the clergy is to teach the sacred texts and preparing souls for the afterlife. The Church has repeatedly stated that for the sinner there is no other system of redemption from sin but confession. Marsilius, in an effort to bring man to God, regardless of any broker, says that confession should be done directly to God and that salvation comes only by true repentance. This anticipates what will be one of the tenets of Protestantism. The necessity of this Sacrament, that is only recommended and not required, is not detected from the Holy Scriptures. Only sincere repentance to the outside of any denominational gives you that peace in the soul that is the prelude of eternal salvation.  Absolution from sin belongs only to God and the priest, who may do so, does so only within the Church. ''Sufficit soli Deo confiteri peccata ipsa, videlicet recognoscendo, et de ipsis poenitendo cum proposito talia alterius non committendi.'' 
These words can be regarded as harbingers of what will be the principles of the Lutheran Reformation.

''Sufficit sola contritio et vera poenitentia de commisso absque omni confessione facta vel fienda sacerdoti, ut immediate absolvatur per Deum.'' Marsilio does not exclude absolutely confession: he says only that it is useful but not essential,  which it would be if it were a precept, therefore  he also denies the priestly power to inflict penalties.
Only contrition frees from sin not repentance of any material or spiritual character almost like a compensation for the sin.''Quamvis in hoc saeculo nullam realem aut personalem satisfactionem exhibeat pro peccatis.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7971">'''Depletion gilding''' is a method for producing a layer of nearly pure [[gold]] on an object made of gold alloy by removing the other metals from its surface.&lt;ref name="Never Judge A Gold Object by Its Surface Analysis: A Study of Surface Phenomena in a Selection of Gold Objects From the Staffordshire Hoard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blakelock|first1=E. S.|title=Never Judge A Gold Object by Its Surface Analysis: A Study of Surface Phenomena in a Selection of Gold Objects From the Staffordshire Hoard|journal=Archaeometry|date=2015|pages=912–929|doi=10.1111/arcm.12209|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as a "surface enrichment" process.&lt;ref&gt;The Surface Enrichment of Carat Gold Alloys - Depletion Gilding. Mark Grimwade in Gold Technology, Issue 26; July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Most [[gilding]] methods are additive: they deposit gold that was not there before onto the surface of an object. By contrast, depletion gilding is a subtractive process whereby material is removed to increase the purity of gold that is already present on an object's surface.

In depletion gilding, other metals are etched away from the surface of an object composed of a gold alloy by the use of acids or salts, often in combination with heat. Since no gold is added, only an object made of an alloy that already contains gold can be depletion gilded.

Depletion gilding relies on the fact that gold is highly resistant to oxidation or corrosion by most common chemicals, whereas many other metals are not. Depletion gilding is most often used to treat alloys of gold with [[copper]] or [[silver]]. Unlike gold, both copper and silver readily react with a variety of chemicals. For example, [[nitric acid]] is effective as an etching agent for both copper and silver. Under the proper circumstances, even ordinary [[table salt]] will react with either metal.

The object to be gilded is coated, immersed, or packed in a suitable acid or salt, and usually heated to speed the process. These chemicals then attack the metallic copper and silver in the object's surface, transforming it to various copper and silver compounds. The resulting copper and silver compounds can be removed from the object's surface by a number of processes. Washing, chemical leaching, heating, or even physical absorption by porous materials such as brick dust have all been used historically. Meanwhile, the relatively inert gold is left unaffected. The result is a thin layer of nearly pure gold on the surface of the original object.

There is no well-defined minimum gold content required to successfully depletion gild an object. However, the less gold that is present, the more other material must be etched away to produce the desired surface appearance.  In addition, the removal of the other metals usually leaves the surface covered with microscopic voids and pits. This can make the surface soft and "spongy" with a dull or matte appearance. This effect becomes more pronounced as more base metal is removed. For this reason, most depletion gilded objects are [[Burnishing (metal)|burnished]] to make their surfaces more durable and give them a more attractive polished finish.

Like other gilding processes, depletion gilding provides a way to produce the appearance of pure gold without its disadvantages: its cost and rarity, and its softness and denseness. By producing a layer of gold over a layer of copper or other metal, objects can be made that are lighter, sturdier, and cheaper while still appearing to be nearly pure gold.

==Variations==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Keum-boo]] --&gt;
The term depletion gilding usually refers to the production of a layer of gold. However, it can also be used to produce a layer that is an alloy of gold and silver, sometimes referred to as [[electrum]]. Certain chemicals, such as [[oxalic acid]], attack copper but do not affect either silver or gold. Using such a chemical, it is possible to remove only the copper in an alloy, leaving both silver and the gold behind. Thus, if the original object is composed of copper, silver, and gold, it can be given a gold surface by removing both silver and copper, or an electrum surface by removing only the copper.

Likewise, with an appropriate chemical, a layer of nearly pure silver can be produced on an object made of copper and silver. For instance, [[sterling silver]] can be depleted—'depletion silvering'—to produce a [[fine silver]] surface, perhaps as preamble to application of gold, as in the [[Keum-boo]] technique.

However, in the majority of cases depletion gilding is in fact used to produce a gold finish, rather than one of electrum or silver.

==Applications==
Depletion gilding is a decorative process, with no significant industrial applications. It is not widely used in modern times, having been superseded by processes more suited to mass production, such as [[electroplating]]. Some individual artisans and small shops continue to practice it.

However, depletion gilding was widely used in antiquity.&lt;ref name="BatesLiddiard2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bates|author2=Robert Liddiard|title=East Anglia and Its North Sea World in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFDoCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246|date=18 June 2015|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd.|isbn=978-1-78327-036-1|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it requires skill to execute it well, the process itself is technologically simple, and uses materials that are readily available to most ancient civilizations. Some form of depletion gilding has been used by nearly every culture that developed metalworking. The South American [[Sican culture|Sican]] culture in particular developed depletion gilding to a high art.&lt;ref&gt;Precious Metal Objects of the Middle Sican. Izumi Shamada and Jo Ann Griffin in Scientific American Special, Volume 15, Number 1, pages 80-89; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient alloys, such as [[tumbaga]], may have been developed specifically for use in depletion gilding. The technique was not known to be used by [[Anglo-Saxons]] until detailed examination with electron microscopes of treasures such as the [[Staffordshire Hoard]] revealed its use in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/news/britains-greatest-treasure-hoard-reveals-how-goldsmiths-cheated-their-saxon-clients-9799977.html Britain's greatest treasure hoard reveals how goldsmiths fooled the Anglo-Saxon world]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/17/staffordshire-hoard-anglo-saxon-gold-secret-technique-treasure&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbican Research Associates"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blakelock|first1=Eleanor|title=Contextualising Metal-Detected Discoveries: Staffordshire Anglo-Saxon Hoard|url=http://www.barbicanra.co.uk/assets/pd-appendix-3-scientific-analysis.pdf|publisher=Barbican Research Associates|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain cultures are thought to have attached mythical or spiritual significance to the process. Gold was considered sacred in many early civilizations and was highly valued in nearly all of them, and anything relating to it had the potential to take on cultural importance. Moreover, the ability to turn what appeared to be an object made of copper into what seemed to be pure gold would be very impressive. There is some speculation that depletion gilding may have contributed to the concepts of [[alchemy]], a major goal of which was to physically transform one metal into another.

'''Eflatun Pınar''' ({{lang-tr|Eflatunpınar}}, "Plato's Spring") is the name given to a spring, which rises up from the ground, and the stone-built pool monument built at the time of the [[Hittite Empire]]. The spring lies inside the [[Lake Beyşehir National Park]], {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Konya]], and drains into [[Lake Beyşehir]] in central [[Anatolia]] at ancient [[Pisidia]] region. During the [[Late Bronze Age]], a sacred pool monument was built here in [[trachyte]] ashlar masonry dedicated to the sacred spring cult of ancient [[Hittites|Hittite]]s. The monument was interpreted as a shrine to [[Plato]] during the medieval (Seljuk) period.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Overview==
Eflatun Pınar's location near the lake shore corresponds to an almost exact level with other important ruins on the opposite shore, those of [[Kubadabad Palace]], which were built by [[Seljuk Sultanate of Anatolia|Seljuk]]s.

Eflatun Pınar was briefly examined by the [[University of Oxford]] archaeologist Dr. Lucia Nixon in her paper on [[Çatalhöyük]], and she makes use of [[F.W.Hasluck]]'s early-20th century work. The site remains largely unexplored to date.

In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the '''''eirôn''''' ({{lang-grc|εἴρων}}) was one of three [[stock characters]] in [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''eirôn'' usually succeeded in bringing down his braggart opponent (the ''[[Alazon|alazôn]]'') by understating his own abilities.&lt;ref name="eiron1"&gt;Frye (1957, 172).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The ''eirôn'' developed in [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[Old Comedy]] and can be found in many of [[Aristophanes]]' plays. For example, in ''[[The Frogs]]'' after the God [[Dionysus]] claims to have sunk 12 or 13 enemy ships with [[Cleisthenes (son of Sibyrtius)]], his slave [[Xanthias]] says 'Then I woke up.'

The [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] names the ''eirôn'' in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', where he says: "in the form of understatement, self-deprecation, and its possessor the self-deprecator" (1108a12).&lt;ref name="eiron2"&gt;'ἡ δ' ἐπὶ τὸ ἔλαττον εἰρωνεία καὶ '''εἴρων''' (1108a12, emphasis added); Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Nic.+Eth.+1108a+1 Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics].&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage, Aristotle establishes the ''eirôn'' as one of the main characters of comedy, along with the ''alazôn''.

===Irony===
The modern term [[irony]] is derived from the ''eirôn'' of the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical Greek theatre]]. Irony entails opposition (not mere difference) between the actual meaning and the apparent meaning of something.&lt;ref name="eiron3"&gt;Dictionary.com (2006). [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=irony Irony]&lt;/ref&gt;

A photograph taken four minutes after her death by photography student Robert Wiles has become an iconic [[suicide]] photograph, referred to as "the most beautiful suicide".&lt;ref name="time_'The"&gt;{{Cite web |title='The Most Beautiful Suicide': A Violent Death, an Immortal Photo |author=Ben Cosgrove |work=TIME.com |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=http://time.com/3456028/the-most-beautiful-suicide-a-violent-death-an-immortal-photo/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyti_Cras"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Crashing to Earth, Again and Again |author=Page, Max |work=New York Times |date=April 23, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/nyregion/thecity/23scar.html?_r=1&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Evelyn McHale was born in [[Berkeley, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/evelyn_f_mchale_born_1923_797875 |work=[[California Birth Index]] |title=The Birth of Evelyn Mchale |accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of nine children to Helen and Vincent McHale. Vincent was a [[bank examiner]] and relocated to [[Washington D.C.]] in 1930. Her mother suffered from undiagnosed and untreated depression, this led to a challenging marriage, and ultimately a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evelyn Mchale |url=http://www.codex99.com/photography/43.html |website=Codex99 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent gained custody of all children and moved to [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe, New York.]]

After graduating from high school Evelyn joined the [[Women's Army Corps]], and was stationed in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]].

She later moved to [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin, New York]] and was employed as a bookkeeper at the Kitab Engraving Company on [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]]. She met her fiance Barry Rhodes, a college student discharged from the United States Army Air Force.&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Most Beautiful Suicide: Evelyn McHale Leapt to Her Death from the Empire State Building, 1947 |author=Robert C.

===Death===
On April 30, 1947, McHale took a train from New York to [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] to visit Rhodes. The next day, after leaving Rhodes' residence, she returned to New York City and went to the Empire State Building where she jumped from the 86th floor observatory. A security guard was reportedly standing approximately ten feet from her just before she jumped.

Rhodes did not notice any indication of suicide before McHale left. Detective Frank Murray found her [[suicide note]] in a black pocketbook next to her neatly folded cloth coat over the observation deck wall which read:&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="real_TheW"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Wild and Dark History of the Empire State Building, One of New York City's Most Recognized Landmarks, and Known for its Record-Breaking Height |last=Reporter |first=Staff |work=Realty Today |date=November 27, 2015 |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |url=http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/56503/20151127/wild-dark-history-empire-state-building-one-new-york-city.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I don't want anyone in or out of my family to see any part of me. Could you destroy my body by cremation? I beg of you and my family – don't have any service for me or remembrance for me. My fiance asked me to marry him in June. I don't think I would make a good wife for anybody. He is much better off without me. Tell my father, I have too many of my mother's tendencies.}}

Her body was identified by her sister, Helen Brenner.

In accordance with her wishes, she was cremated with no memorial, service or grave.&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"/&gt;

Her then-fiance, Barry became an engineer before moving South, he died in Melbourne, Florida on October 9th 2007, unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evelyn Mchale |url=http://www.codex99.com/photography/43.html |website=Codex99 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Evelyn McHale.jpg|thumb|The Robert Wiles photo]]

The photo of her body, taken by Robert Wiles, has been compared to the photograph by [[Malcolm Wilde Browne]] of the [[self-immolation]] of Vietnamese Buddhist monk [[Thích Quảng Đức]] who burned himself alive at a busy Saigon road intersection on June 11, 1963, which is widely regarded as among the most iconic suicide photographs. Ben Cosgrove of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the photo as "technically rich, visually compelling and ... downright beautiful". Cosgrove described her body as "resting, or napping, rather than ... dead" and appears as if she is "daydreaming of her beau".&lt;ref name="time_'The"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gawk_Spec"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Specter Detector: Courting the Empire State Building's Prettiest Ghost |last=Conaboy |first=Kelly |work=[[Gawker]] |date=September 25, 2015 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=http://gawker.com/specter-detector-courting-the-empire-state-buildings-p-1732169081 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425222325/http://gawker.com/specter-detector-courting-the-empire-state-buildings-p-1732169081 |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andy Warhol]] used Wiles' photo in one of his prints entitled ''Suicide (Fallen Body)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillenberger |first=Jane D. |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KemglT-1jSIC&amp;pg=PA67 |date=February 1, 2001 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-0-8264-1334-5 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her picture was also used on the cover of [[Saccharine Trust]]'s album ''[[Surviving You, Always]]'', released in 1984 by [[SST Records]].

[[David Bowie]]'s 1993 video for the single "[[Jump They Say]]" includes a recreation of the image, with the singer splayed atop a smashed car.

The cover of the 1995 album ''[[Gilt (album)|Gilt]]'' by the Tucson band [[Machines of Loving Grace]] uses a color photo that recreates the original image.

The shot is also referenced at the start of Taylor Swift's 'Bad Blood' video.

The '''Federal Art Project''' (1935–43) was a [[New Deal]] program to fund the [[visual arts]] in the [[United States]]. Under national director [[Holger Cahill]], it was one of five [[Federal Project Number One]] projects sponsored by the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), and the largest of the New Deal art projects. It was created not as a cultural activity but as a relief measure to employ artists and artisans to create murals, easel paintings, sculpture, graphic art, posters, photography, [[Federal Theatre Project|theatre scenic design]], and arts and crafts. The WPA Federal Art Project established more than 100 community art centers throughout the country, researched and documented American design, commissioned a significant body of [[public art]] without restriction to content or subject matter, and sustained some 10,000 artists and craft workers during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].

The Federal Art Project was the visual arts arm of the Great Depression-era Works Progress Administration, a Federal One program. Funded under the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]], it operated from August 29, 1935, until June 30, 1943. It was created as a relief measure to employ artists and artisans to create murals, easel paintings, sculpture, graphic art, posters, photography, [[Index of American Design]] documentation, museum and theatre scenic design, and arts and crafts. The Federal Art Project operated community art centers throughout the country where craft workers and artists worked, exhibited and educated others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/employment-and-activities-poster-wpas-federal-art-project-11772 |title=Employment and Activities poster for the WPA's Federal Art Project, 1936|website=Archives of American Art |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |access-date=2015-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project created more than 200,000 separate works, some of them remaining among the most significant pieces of public art in the country.&lt;ref name="Kalfatovic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalfatovic |first=Martin R. |date=1994 |title=The New Deal Fine Arts Projects: A Bibliography, 1933–1992 |url=https://archive.org/details/newdealfineartsp00kalf |location=Metuchen, N.J. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page= |isbn=0-8108-2749-2 |access-date=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Art Project's primary goals were to employ out-of-work artists and to provide art for non-federal municipal buildings and public spaces. Artists were paid $23.60 a week; tax-supported institutions such as schools, hospitals and public buildings paid only for materials.&lt;ref name="NYT American Murals"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brenner |first=Anita |date=April 10, 1938 |title=America Creates American Murals |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/04/10/archives/american-creates-american-murals-to-bid-for-the-favor-of-a-new-mass.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2015-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was divided into art production, art instruction and art research. The primary output of the art-research group was the Index of American Design, a mammoth and comprehensive study of American material culture.

As many as 10,000 artists were commissioned to produce work for the WPA Federal Art Project,&lt;ref name="Brian Naylor"/&gt; the largest of the [[New Deal]] art projects. Three comparable but distinctly separate New Deal art projects were administered by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]: the [[Public Works of Art Project]] (1933–34), the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]] (1934–43) and the [[Treasury Relief Art Project]] (1935–38).&lt;ref name="GSA Inventory Project"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/101384 |title=New Deal Artwork: GSA's Inventory Project |publisher=[[General Services Administration]] |access-date=2015-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WPA program made no distinction between [[Representation (arts)|representational]] and [[Abstraction#Abstraction in art|nonrepresentational]] art. [[Abstract art|Abstraction]] had not yet gained favor in the 1930s and 1940s and, thus, was virtually unsalable. As a result, the Federal Art Project supported such iconic artists as [[Jackson Pollock]] before their work could earn them income.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Robert (1993).

One particular success was the Milwaukee Handicraft Project, which started in 1935 as an experiment that employed 900 people who were classified as unemployable due to their age or disability.&lt;ref name="When Art Worked"/&gt;{{Rp|164}} The project came to employ approximately 5,000 unskilled workers, many of them women and the long-term unemployed. Historian [[John Gurda]] observed that the city's unemployment hovered at 40 percent in 1933. "In that year," he said, "53 percent of Milwaukee's property taxes went unpaid because people just could not afford to make the tax payments."&lt;ref name="Handicraft WPR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpr.org/depression-era-milwaukee-handicraft-project-put-thousands-people-work |title=Depression-Era Milwaukee Handicraft Project Put Thousands of People to Work|last=Whaley |first=K.

==Index of American Design==
[[File:Index-of-American-Design-Illinois.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Federal Art Project Illinois poster for an exhibition of the Index of American Design]]
{{quotation|As we study the drawings of the Index of American Design we realize that the hands that made the first two hundred years of this country's material culture expressed something more than untutored creative instinct and the rude vigor of a frontier civilization. … The Index, in bringing together thousands of particulars from various sections of the country, tells the story of American hand skills and traces intelligible patterns within that story.|[[Holger Cahill]], national director of the Federal Art Project&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;{{Rp|xv}}}}
The Index of American Design program of the Federal Art Project produced a pictorial survey of the crafts and decorative arts of the United States from the [[Colonial history of the United States|early colonial period]] to 1900. Artists working for the Index produced nearly 18,000 meticulously faithful watercolor drawings,&lt;ref name="When Art Worked"/&gt;{{Rp|226}} documenting material culture by largely anonymous artisans.&lt;ref name="Christensen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cahill |first=Holger |authorlink=Holger Cahill |year=1950 |chapter=Introduction |editor1-last=Christensen |editor1-first=Erwin O. |title=The Index of American Design |location=New York |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|The Macmillan Company]] |publication-date= |pages=ix–xvii |oclc=217678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|ix}} Objects range from furniture, silver, glass, stoneware and textiles to tavern signs, ships's figureheads, cigar-store figures, carousel horses, toys, tools and weather vanes.&lt;ref name="When Art Worked"/&gt;{{Rp|224}}&lt;ref name="Herzberg"&gt;{{cite news |last=Herzberg |first=Max |date=October 15, 1950 |title=American Craftsmanship Offers Beauty and Utility  |newspaper=[[Newark Evening News]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photography was used only to a limited degree since artists could more accurately and effectively present the form, character, color and texture of the objects. The best drawings approach the work of such 19th-century [[trompe-l'œil]] painters as [[William Harnett]]; lesser works represent the process of artists who were given employment and expert training.&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;{{Rp|xiv}}

"It was not a nostalgic or antiquarian enterprise," wrote historian [[Roger G. Kennedy]]. "It was initiated by modernists dedicated to abstract design, hoping to influence industrial design — thus in many ways it parallelled the founding philosophy of the Museum of Modern Art in New York."&lt;ref name="When Art Worked"/&gt;{{Rp|224}}

Like all WPA programs, the Index had the primary purpose of providing employment.&lt;ref name="NYT Jones"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Louis C. |date=October 22, 1950 |title=Only Yesterday It Was Wooden Indians and Whittled Toys |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/10/22/archives/only-yesterday-it-was-wooden-indians-and-whittled-toys.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2015-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its function was to identify and record material of historical significance that had not been studied and was in danger of being lost. Its aim was to gather together these pictorial records into a body of material that would form the basis for organic development of American design — a usable American past accessible to artists, designers, manufacturers, museums, libraries and schools. The United States had no single comprehensive collection of authenticated historical native design comparable to those available to scholars, artists and industrial designers in Europe.&lt;ref name="NYT Jewell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jewell |first=Edward Alden |date=March 19, 1939 |title=Saving Our Usable Past |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1939/03/19/archives/saving-our-usable-past-the-index-of-american-design-reviews-its.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2015-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In one sense the Index is a kind of archaeology," wrote  Holger Cahill. "It helps to correct a bias which has tended to relegate the work of the craftsman and the folk artist to the subconscious of our history where it can be recovered only by digging. In the past we have lost whole sequences out of their story, and have all but forgotten the unique contribution of hand skills in our culture."&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;{{Rp|xv}}

The Index of American Design operated in 34 states and the District of Columbia from 1935 to 1942. It was founded by [[Romana Javitz]], head of the Picture Collection of the [[New York Public Library]], and textile designer [[Ruth Reeves]].&lt;ref name="When Art Worked"/&gt;{{Rp|224}} Reeves was appointed the first national coordinator; she was succeeded by C. Adolph Glassgold (1936) and Benjamin Knotts (1940). [[Constance Rourke]] was national editor.&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;{{Rp|xii}} The work is in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/iad/history/overview.shtm |title=History |website=Index of American Design |publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]] |access-date=2015-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index employed an average of 300 artists during its six years in operation.&lt;ref name="Christensen"/&gt;{{Rp|xiv}} One artist was Magnus S. Fossum, a longtime farmer who was compelled by the Depression to move from the Midwest to Florida. After he lost his left hand in an accident in 1934, he produced watercolor renderings for the Index, using magnifiers and drafting instruments for accuracy and precision. Fossum eventually received an insurance settlement that made it possible for him to buy another farm and leave the Federal Art Project.&lt;ref name="When Art Worked"/&gt;{{Rp|228}}

'''Feng shui''' or '''fengshui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水|s=风水|first=t}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Zh-feng1shui3.ogg|f|eng|1|.|sh|ui|3}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a [[pseudoscience]] originating from China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt; The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as "wind-water" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost ''[[Classic of Burial]]'' recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]]:&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].&lt;ref&gt;
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the ''[[Shijing]]''. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north-south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])— is oriented along a north-south axis.&lt;ref&gt;Zhentao Xuastronomy. 2000: 2&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 248–249.
&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel. (2006) ''Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou]],&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 230–37.
&lt;/ref&gt;
all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; "Manual of Crafts") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{lang-zh|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; "Lu ban's manuscript") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 55&lt;/ref&gt; before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass: Step by Step Guide.'' 1998: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)&lt;/ref&gt; they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski (1996). "The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China." Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.&lt;/ref&gt; the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Yin Difei. "Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, "Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23–24 (1998–99):125–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui&lt;ref&gt;Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of "energy". The "perfect spot" is a location and an axis in time.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"&gt;Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"&gt;Bennett, Steven J. (1978) "Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology." ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui is not a science, but is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Qi'' (''ch'i'')===
[[File:Lingshan Islamic Cemetery - turtle tomb - DSCF8492.JPG|thumb|A traditional [[turtle-back tombs|turtle-back tomb]] of southern [[Fujian]], surrounded by an [[omega]]-shaped ridge protecting it from the "noxious winds" from the three sides&lt;ref name=deGroot941&gt;{{citation

|url=https://archive.org/details/religioussystemo03groo |pages=941–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''[[Qi]]''（氣）(pronounced "chee" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In feng shui as in [[Chinese martial arts]], it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or ''[[élan vital]]''. A traditional explanation of ''qi'' as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local [[microclimate]]s, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Wu Yuanyin&lt;ref&gt;''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was "congealed ''qi''", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life.

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=E. T. C.|title=Myths and Legends of China|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London Bombay Sydney|page=84|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15250/15250-h/15250-h.htm|accessdate=2010-03-23|isbn=0-486-28092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''The Legacy of the Luoshu.'' pp. 31, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''Legacy of the Luoshu''. p. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird 鳥), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire 火), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void 虛), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Structure in Early China.'' 2000: 107–28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock, and Robert E. Stencel. ''[https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923142811/https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 |date=2006-09-23 }}.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form School===
The Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the "Book of the Tomb" [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;f=false] and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"/&gt; The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The "form" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass School===
The Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="fengshuinatural1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass Step by Step Guide.'' 1998:46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compass School includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| publisher = | year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage of traditional schools===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools |url=http://interiordesigncoursesdelhiinstitutes.in/2018/10/26/feng-shui-schools-delhi/|publisher=Feng Shui Natural |accessdate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

Traditional feng shui relies upon the compass to give accurate readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to the Feng Shui Compass: A Compendium of Classical Feng Shui|first=Stephen|last=Skinner|publisher=[[Golden Hoard]]|year=2008|isbn=9780954763992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqU2uQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UCNAAAAQBAJ|p=185|title=Feng Shui for the Curious and Serious|volume=1|first=Phil N.|last=Nguyen|publisher=[[Xlibris Corporation]]|year=2008|isbn=9781469118826}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate as fluctuations caused by solar winds have the ability to greatly disturb the electromagnetic field of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|p=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4xDhVCxAQIC|title=The Cambridge Guide to the Solar System|first=Kenneth R.|last=Lang|edition=2|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=9781139494175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a property or site location based upon Magnetic North will result in inaccuracies because true magnetic north fluctuates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's Inconstant Magnetic Field|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield|publisher=NASA Science|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites "with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the "recondite science" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: "What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?".&lt;ref&gt;"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;lr=&amp;pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the "rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture," and urged fellow missionaries "to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about ''fung-shuy''".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W.

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a "feudalistic superstitious practice" and a "social evil" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of "promoting feudalistic superstitions" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title="風水迷信"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly because of the [[Cultural Revolution]], in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 ''Debate on Feng Shui''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232943/http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 |date=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com/58913151.html |title=Beware of Scams Among the Genuine Feng Shui Practitioners |publisher=Jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/3941393.html|title=ˮȨɽ--Ļ--|work=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|title=方术之国|work=newmind40.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040204/http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jiang Xun |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4870000/newsid_4872500/4872542.stm |title=Focus on China ''From Voodoo Dolls to Feng Shui Superstitions''|language=Chinese|publisher=BBC Chinese service|date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of [[Fudan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |title=蔡达峰 – Cao Dafeng |publisher=Fudan.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032825/http://fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liu Shenghuan of [[Tongji University]].

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:&lt;ref&gt;Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: "Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monty Vierra. Harried by "Hellions" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Johnson:&lt;ref&gt;"Reality Testing in Feng Shui." ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age "energy" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.&lt;ref name="The Skeptic's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting "lucky bamboo" in ecosystems that could not handle them.&lt;ref name="Fabulous Feng Shui"&gt;Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= "Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton "spirit rock" to the county seat to ward off "bad luck."&lt;ref name=NYT51013&gt;{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- I hope this "it" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --&gt; is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''1"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''2"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,&lt;ref name="Journal of Popular Culture''3"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.&lt;ref name="Feng Shui Kingdom"&gt;Laura M. Holson, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/business/worldbusiness/the-feng-shui-kingdom.html "The Feng Shui Kingdom"]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studia Geophysica Et Geodaetica, 55(1), 159–74. {{doi|10.1007/s11200-011-0009-2}}. Abstract: "Extant written records indicate that knowledge of an ancient type of compass in China is very old – dating back to before the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) to at least the 4th century BC. Geomancy (feng shui) was practised for a long time (for millennia) and had a profound influence on the face of China's landscape and city plans. The tombs (pyramids) near the former Chinese capital cities of Xi'an and Luoyang (together with their suburban fields and roads) show strong spatial orientations, sometimes along a basic South-North axis (relative to the geographic pole), but usually with deviations of several degrees to the East or West. The use of the compass means that the needle was directed towards the actual magnetic pole at the time of construction, or last reconstruction, of the respective tomb. However the magnetic pole, relative to the nearly 'fixed' geographic pole, shifts significantly over time. By matching paleomagnetic observations with modeled paleomagnetic history we have identified the date of pyramid construction in central China with the orientation relative to the magnetic pole positions at the respective time of construction. As in Mesoamerica, where according to the Fuson hypothesis the Olmecs and Maya oriented their ceremonial buildings and pyramids using a compass even before the Chinese, here in central China the same technique may have been used. We found a good agreement of trends between the paleodeclinations observed from tomb alignments and the available global geomagnetic field model CALS7K.2."

'''''frankie magazine''''' is a bi-monthly Australian magazine that features music, art, fashion, photography, craft and other cultural content. In 2012, it was awarded Australian Magazine of the Year at the Australian Magazine Awards, as well as winning out over both ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' for the Australian Fashion Magazine of The Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnews.com.au/awards/australian-magazine-awards Australian magazine awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''frankie magazine'' was launched in October 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Dale|title=Magazines in a bind|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/magazines-in-a-bind-20130823-2sf6j.html|accessdate=30 April 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by editor Louise Bannister and creative director Lara Burke.&lt;ref name="meg"&gt;{{cite news|author=Megan Reynolds|title=Frankie Press co-founders depart as Morrison Media moves sales hub to Melbourne|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-press-co-founders-depart-204965|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=Mumbrella|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, Bannister was replaced by Jo Walker as editor, with Bannister becoming publisher.

''frankie magazine'' is owned and published by niche publisher Morrison Media, and makes up "frankiepress" along with its men's publication, ''Smith Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankiepress.com.au Frankie press]&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison Media was acquired by Pacific Star Network in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alex Hayes|title=Frankie publisher Morrison Media bought out in $10m deal|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-publisher-morrison-media-bought-10m-deal-262164|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=Mumbrella|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both founders of the magazine, Louise Bannister and Lara Burke, left the magazine before the acquisition.&lt;ref name="meg"/&gt;

The magazine was headquartered in [[Queensland]] until 2013 when it was relocated in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="meg"/&gt;

==Readership==
The magazine's audience has grown rapidly since its inception. It is now estimated to be read by 286,000 globally. Despite the 2008 [[Global Financial Crisis]], that saw Australian magazine sales drop 3%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Wells|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/forget-celebrity-goss-this-mag-plays-it-smart-and-cool-20100220-omrv.html|title=Forget celebrity goss, this mag plays it smart and cool|work=The Age|date=20 February 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, frankie magazine's circulation rose by 31.60% in 2009: making frankie magazine the fastest growing magazine in Australia during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/09/2922264.htm|title=Homemade magazine bucks the trend|work=ABC|date=9 June 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication continued this trend in 2010, with circulation rising another 43.20%, according to the Australian Bureau of Circulation's January–June 2010 audit figures. This was the second year in a row that they had the highest growth out of all Australian magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/abcs-masterchef-magazine-hits-the-big-time-while-rise-of-frankie-continues-31473|title=ABCs: Masterchef magazine hits the big time while rise of Frankie continues|work=Mumbrella|date=13 August 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, [[Harper's Bazaar]] had an increase of 9.04% over the same time period.

frankie magazine also has significant social media impact, having a notable social media presence in Australian publishing, with over 175,000 Facebook fans and 55,000 Twitter followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/frankiemagazine|title=frankie magazine (@frankiemagazine)|work=Twitter|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
frankie magazine covers a range of cultural topics that concern the 10 - to 15 -year-old age bracket. Their content features DIY and vintage culture as well as music, art, fashion, photography, craft, humour, hipster culture, illustration and design. ABC's [[7:30 Report]] described ''frankie magazine'' as being between "quite edgy" and "quite daggy", having a strong emphasis on strong, curious stories instead of diets and celebrity culture, supporting emerging artists, musicians, entrepreneurs and designers and preferring to profile up-and-coming hipsters rather than existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2921938.htm|title=The 7.30 Report |work=ABC|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has many well known senior contributors, including broadcaster and writer [[Marieke Hardy]], and author [[Benjamin Law (writer)|Benjamin Law]].

==Other publications==
In addition to their magazine and website, ''frankie magazine'' has also published a series of books through their imprint, frankiepress. These are two recipe books, "Afternoon Tea" and "Sweet Treats", an anthology of frankie magazine photography called "Photo Album", a book on creative and collaborative areas called "Spaces", and their "Gift Paper Book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankiepress.com.au/shop |title=buy frankie magazine &amp; Smith Journal magazine|work=frankie press|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''frankie magazine'' also brings out a calendar and a diary annually, which have both sold out every year to date.

In 2011 ''frankie magazine'' launched a quarterly bambino publication for men, titled [[Smith Journal (magazine)|''Smith Journal''.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Lallo |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/size-doesnt-matter-in-a-shrinking-market-mens-magazines-try-new-models-to-stay-on-top-20110813-1is6i.html |title=Size doesn't matter.

'''''Grey Gardens''''' is a 2009 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[biographical film|biographical]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] about the lives of [[Edith Bouvier Beale]]/"Little Edie", played by [[Drew Barrymore]], and her mother [[Edith Ewing Bouvier]]/"Big Edie", played by [[Jessica Lange]]. Co-stars include [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] (Little Edie's cousin) and [[Ken Howard]] as [[Phelan Beale]] (Little Edie's father). The film, directed by [[Michael Sucsy]] and co-written by Sucsy and [[Patricia Rozema]], flashes back and forth between various events and dates ranging from Little Edie as a young [[débutante]] in 1936 moving with her mother to their [[Grey Gardens (estate)|Grey Gardens estate]] through the filming and premiere of the actual 1975 [[Grey Gardens|documentary ''Grey Gardens'']].

Filming for the [[HBO]] film began on October 22, 2007 in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117938667?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Thesps tend to 'Gardens' |author= Felming, Michael |date=2006-02-21 |work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first aired on HBO on April 18, 2009.

The film won the 2009 Television Critics Association award for Outstanding Achievement Movies, Miniseries, and Specials. It was also nominated for 17 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie|Outstanding Made for Television Movie]], [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie|Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie]] (Lange) and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie|Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie]] (Howard). It was also nominated for three [[Golden Globe Awards]], winning Best Made for Television Movie and Best Actress in a Made for Television Movie (Barrymore). Lange was also nominated in this category.

==Plot==
The film is based on the life stories of the eccentric paternal aunt and first cousin of [[Jackie Kennedy]], both named Edith Bouvier Beale. The elder [[Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale|Edith Bouvier Beale]] was the sister of Jackie Kennedy's father [[John Vernou Bouvier III]] and was referred to as "Big Edie", [[Edith Bouvier Beale|her daughter]] was referred to as "Little Edie". The Beale women were members of NYC high society, but in their later years, withdrew from the New York City life, taking shelter at their [[Long Island]] summer home/estate [[Grey Gardens (estate)|Grey Gardens]]. The house eventually fell into a state of disrepair that gave the Beale women notoriety.

[[Phelan Beale]] (husband of "Big Edie" and father of "Little Edie"), eventually divorced "Big Edie." In the movie, "Little Edie" decides to move to New York to pursue a career in acting (as well as an ill-fated romance with high-profile married man, [[Julius Albert Krug|Julius 'Cap' Krug]]).  Her father frankly tells her that she has to find a husband to support her lifestyle.  "Little Edie" sadly and slowly realizes her fate is to remain her mother's companion at Grey Gardens. The two women become reclusive and known around town as the highly eccentric proprietors of Grey Gardens, which has become decrepit and full of stray animals taken in by the Beale women. The plot includes the filming of the documentary ''[[Grey Gardens]]'' by [[Albert and David Maysles]] as well as flashback events in the Beales' past, including their arrival at the estate, the disintegration of Big Edie's marriage, and Little Edie's failed attempts to have her own life and find independence.

After Phelan Beale dies, the two sons tell their mother, Big Edie, that there is little money and she should sell the estate and move to Florida. The house was in her name and this was her home. She was going nowhere. Grey Gardens became a health hazard, over run with cats and also infested with raccoons. Health officials condemned the home and newspaper articles ran blaming Jackie Kennedy. Jackie goes to the home in a chauffeur driven limousine for a visit. Jackie and her sister, Lee, pay for the cleanup and restoration of the Hampton's home. Mom and daughter grow old together. The documentary is finished and Little Edie attends the premiere, wearing a surprise gift from her mother.

The movie ends with Little Edie singing "[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]" at the Reno Sweeney cabaret in [[Greenwich Village]], and the quote, "My mother gave me a truly priceless life."

==Production==
Michael Sucsy said that he used [[primary source]]s to flesh out the story including letters and journals kept by Little Edie. He also interviewed family members and friends including Lois Wright who lived in the house and wrote her own book about the events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loiswright.net/ Lois Wright, ''My Life at Grey Gardens'']&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Maysles is credited as a source in the movie. Sucsy said that the house facade as well as the interior were created from blueprints. Sucsy said that an aerial shot of the house circa 1936 was historically accurate on the placement of the house in relation to other mansions in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] at the time (although requiring [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] enhancements to create the illusion).&lt;ref name="audio"&gt;Grey Gardens DVD – 2009 – HBO – Audio commentary with executive producers Michael Sucsy, Lucy Barzun Donnelly and Rachael Horovitz&lt;/ref&gt; As with many movies based on historical events, some events in the Beales' lives, such as the timing of Big Edie and Phelan's divorce, were shifted to make a more coherent story.

The entire film was shot in [[Ontario]], with most of the shots in metropolitan [[Toronto]]. The Valley Halla Estate in [[Rouge Park]] was the setting of exterior shots of Grey Gardens. Waterfront shots were on Centre Island in the [[Toronto Islands]]. Hotel shots were at the [[Fairmont Royal York]]. Studio work was done at Toronto Film Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758751/locations|title=Grey Gardens (TV Movie 2009)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aerial shot of The Pierre was licensed from ''[[An Affair to Remember]]''.&lt;ref name="audio" /&gt;

Post-production was done in New York and Los Angeles. The DVD commentary was done in the same studio where the Maysles mixed the original documentary.&lt;ref name="audio" /&gt;

The''' history of the book''' in [[Brazil]] focuses on the development of the access to publishing resources and acquisition of the book in the country, covering a period extending from the beginning of the editorial activity during colonization to today's publishing market, including the history of [[publishing]] and [[bookstores]] that allowed the modern accessibility to the book.

== Colonial Period ==
It is believed that [[printing]] was only introduced by the settlers and colonisers in the colonies, which had a highly developed indigenous culture that the colonial power wanted to supplant or suppress. This idea is supported by the Brazilian historian [[Nelson Werneck Sodré]]&lt;ref&gt;SODRÉ, Nelson Werneck, 1970, p. 291-293.&lt;/ref&gt;  and others. Printing, in the first two centuries of Portuguese and Spanish colonization, was in part a result of [[Christian evangelization]]. It was deployed through religious initiative, so that its production was destined to meet the clergy's needs and that of the missions.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patiosantoinacio.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|[http://www.santoinacio-rio.com.br/s/ Colégio Santo Inácio] (St. Ignatius College) is believed to have crafted the first printed works in Brazil, in 1724.]]
"História da Companhia de Jesus no Brasil", by Serafim Leite,&lt;ref name="Hallewell, 1985, p. 10"&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; says that the library of [http://www.santoinacio-rio.com.br/s/ Colégio Santo Inácio], in O Morro do Castelo, [[Rio de Janeiro]]. (This was a landform that existed in the city of Rio, the hill being one of the foundation points of the city in the sixteenth century and which housed landmarks of great importance, such as colonial forts and buildings of the Jesuits. Nevertheless, it was destroyed in an urban reform in 1922.) This centre is believed to have undertaken some printed jobs around 1724, the accuracy of the claim not be ascertained. It could be referring to two books of the time, "Vocabulário de la lengua guarany", by [[Antônio Luiz Restrepo]] (1722), and "Arte de la lengua guarany", which were printed in a region that is currently part of Brazil, but which at the time belonged to [[Paraguay]], [[Pueblo de Santa Maria la Mayor]].&lt;ref name="Hallewell, 1985, p. 10"&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In most colonies, the necessities of governance made it an imperative to accept printing, and only in [[Portuguese Latin America]] did the administration remained so elementary that this need was dispensed with. This need only become imminent when the government of the colony suffered the impact of the Napoleonic invasion, a few years later.

The first attempt to introduce effective printing into Brazil was made by the Dutch, during the period of their occupation of northeastern Brazil, between 1630 and 1650.

During the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] occupation, negotiations between [[Pernambuco]] and the [[Netherlands]] resulted in the selection of a printer, [[Janszonon Pieter]], to be in charge of printing in [[Recife]], but he died as soon as he arrived in Brazil on 3 August 1643.&lt;ref&gt;TAUNAY, Afonso d’Escragnolle, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Dutch West Indies Company]] was still looking out for a printer without success. At the time, [[Maurice of Nassau]] had already left, and the pressured Dutch no longer gave priority to the subject.

== The start of publishing activity ==
About 60 years later, [[Recife]] had the first printer of Brazil according to historians [[Ferreira de Carvalho]]&lt;ref&gt;CARVALHO, Alfredo Ferreira de, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pereira da Costa]],&lt;ref&gt;COSTA, Francisco Agusto Pereira da, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; but the identity of the printer is not known. [[Serafim Leite]], in "Arts and Workshops of the Jesuits in Brazil,",&lt;ref name="Hallewell, 1985, p. 14"&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; says the printer worked from 1703 to 1706, and argues that the typesetter was a Jesuit, Antonio da Costa, but there is no proof, however, the existence of such a printer.

In Rio de Janeiro, in 1747, there is definitive evidence is available that there was a printer, via leaflets printed at the time. The printer was [[Antonio Isidoro da Fonseca]],&lt;ref name="Hallewell, 1985, p. 14"&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; a recognized typographer of [[Lisbon]], who had sold his business and come to [Brazil]. Isidoro had problems in [[Lisbon]], with the [[Inquisition]], being considered as "The [[Jew]]" editor. Antonio Jose da Silva, of [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]], was born in 1703 from a family of converted Jews, and that turned out to be burned later in an [[Auto-da-fé|auto de fé]] of the [[Inquisition]] on 19 October 1739.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the governor of [Rio de Janeiro] and [Minas Gerais], [[Gomes Freire de Andrade]], was interested in stimulating the intellectual life of the city of Rio de Janeiro. He encouraged the creation of [[Academia dos felizes]] in 1736, which became the [[Academia dos Selectos]] in 1752, which met at the Palácio do Governo itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete proof of the existence of printing was a leaflet, 1747, whose authorship is attributed to [[Luiz Antonio Rosado]], and a so-called volume "[[Hoc est Conclusiones real entity Metaphysicae, praeside RGM Francisco de Faria]]" in 1747. There are two other works, referring to bishop [Antonio do Desterro Malheyro]. As soon as the news reached Lisbon, however, there was order to close the letterpress, because printing in the colony was not considered appropriate at the time.

Isidoro returned to Portugal, and, after three years, requested a royal license to reinstate himself as a printer in the colony, in Rio de Janeiro or Salvador, promising never to print without the appropriate civil and ecclesiastical licenses. The request was rejected
&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's prohibition of printing in Brazil was the factor that made all Brazilian documents to get to be published in Europe or to remain in the form of manuscripts. There are several papers written by Brazilians and printed in Portugal at the time, including the poetry of [[Claudio Manuel da Costa]], the work of [[Santa Rita Durão|José de Santa Rita Durão]], [[Jose Basilio da Gama]] (author of "Uruguay", 1769), [[Tomas Antonio Gonzaga]] (whose work [[Marília de Dirceu]] was published in four editions in Lisbon between 1792 and 1800).

In 1792, there were only two bookstores in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]],&lt;ref&gt;MACARTNEY, George, 1792- 1793.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly one of these was run by Paul Martim, a native of [[Tours]] (in [[France]]) and the first [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] bookseller. His son, [[Paul Martim Filho]] kept the bookstore running until 1823. The books offered were usually pertaining to medicine or religion, and most of the books that arrived in Brazil at the time were smuggled in.

== Arrival of the royal family in Brazil ==
[[File:António_de_Araújo_e_Azevedo,_conde_da_Barca.jpg|right|thumb|184x184px|[[António de Araújo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca|António de Araújo e Azevedo]], Count of Barca, who had installed the first printing press in Brazil in his own home, in Rio de Janeiro.]]
In 1808, when the royal family, under pressure from Napoleon's invasion, moved to Brazil, it took with them 60,000 volumes of the Royal Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Installed in the new capital, [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[John VI of Portugal|Dom João VI]] and his ministers created, among other developments, the Royal Library, now the National Library ([[National Library of Brazil|Biblioteca Nacional]]), which was established in 1810. The impact of this development caused an increase in the number of bookstores, with two existing in 1808 (those of Paul Martin and Manuel Jorge da Silva) growing to five in 1809 (in addition to the above, those run by Francisco Luiz Saturnino da Veiga, Manuel Mandillo—which after 1814 was associated with José Norges Pine—and João Roberto Bourgeois); seven in 1812 (in addition to the previous, Manuel Joaquim da Silva Porto—which in 1815 was associated with Pedro Antonio Campos Bellos—and Jose Antonio da Silva); 12 in 1816 (the additional ones being those of Fernando José Pinheiro, Jeronimo Gonçalves Guimarães, Francisco José Nicolau Mandillo, Joao Batista dos Santos), and in 1818, 3 more (Antonio Joaquim da Silva Garcez, João Lopes de Oliveira Guimarães and Manuel Monteiro Trindade Coelho).&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper [[Correio Braziliense (1808)|Correio Braziliense]]", run by [[Hipólito da Costa|Hipólito José da Costa Pereira Furtado de Mendonça]], was produced in England. In Paris, there was a development of the publishing trade in Portuguese, that would last a long time, almost until 1930.

There is disagreement over whether or not a printing press existed in Brazil on the occasion of the arrival of the royal family. Reportedly, a press with movable type was finally brought to Brazil by the government itself, which had earlier been forbidden so vehemently. [[António de Araújo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca|António de Araújo e Azevedo]], then Foreign Minister and later Count of Barca, brought and had installed the press in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], on the ground floor of his own home, 44 [[Rua do Passeio]]. Brother José Mariano da Conceição Veloso, a miner religious who had been to [[Lisbon]] in 1790, returned to [[Brazil]] with the royal family to work in the press of Rio, the [[Imprensa Régia]]. The new press was launched on May 13, 1808, with the publication of a 27 page booklet, accompanied by the [[Royal Charter]]. In the 14 years of the [[printing monopoly]] in Rio over a thousand items were produced.
&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing in the province ==
* '''Minas Gerais'''
The first book printed in the province was in [[Vila Rica]], [[Minas Gerais]], later [[Ouro Preto]], in 1807, before the rise of the Royal Press ([[Imprensa Régia]]). Governor [[Pedro Maria Xavier de Ataíde e Melo|Athayde de Mello]], the future [[Earl of Condeixa]], was so pleased with a poem in his honor by [[Diogo de Vasconcelos]], who wished to see it printed. This impression was made by Father José Joaquim Viegas de Menezes, in a small press for domestic purposes. Associated with the Portuguese Manuel José Barbosa Pimenta e Sal, he gradually set up the "[[Typographia Patriota de Barbosa &amp; Cia]]", which was completed in 1821.

After 1807, the first books printed in [[Ouro Preto]] were a collection of "Laws of the Empire of Brazil" ([[Leis do Império do Brasil]]) in 1835 by a printer called Silva, and the "Dictionary of the Brazilian language" ([[Diccionario da Língua Brasileira]]), by Luis Maria da Silva Pinto in 1832. Later, other printing houses emerged in [[São João del Rei]] (1827), Diamantina (1828) and Marian (1830).&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bahia'''
[[File:Clóvis_Bevilaqua_(catedátrico_de_Legislação_Comparada_1891-1895,_Faculdade_de_Direito_do_Recife)._(Col._Francisco_Rodrigues_FR-1037).jpg|right|thumb|321x321px|[[Clóvis Beviláqua|Clóvis Bevilaqua]], owner of J. L. da Fonseca bookshop, of the School of Law in [[Recife]] between the years 1891 and 1895. Photograph by [[Alberto Henschel]].]]
In Bahia, as soon as the royal family came to [[Brazil]], a bookseller from [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Manuel Antonio da Silva Serva, a native of Portugal, asked permission to go to England and get a printer to Bahia; such permission was granted in 1809, and began printing in 1811. One might speculate that there were two printers at that time. Serva died in 1819, and the press continued with his partner and son-in-law José Teixeira and Carvalho, becoming known as "Typographia da Viúva Serva, e Carvalho." Later, his son Manuel started working at the firm. The publication known as Silva Serva had 176 titles, and the publisher survived with several name changes until 1846, but lost its monopoly position in 1823. During the struggle for independence in Brazil, the troops of the joint pro-Portugal junta invaded "Typographia da Viúva Serva" to stop the publication of the nationalist newspaper "Constitucional". Its editors fled to [[Cachoeira]], where they installed their own graphics to continue printing the weekly "O Independente Constitucional".&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The Serva press continued producing the [[Gazeta da Bahia]], which was pro-Portugal, but when the nationalist cause triumphed in June 1823, its publication had to be stopped.

With the death of Silva Serva, Bahia's literary production went into decline, only recovering in the 1890s. Standing out, at the time, were  "Livraria J. L. da Fonseca Magalhães, editores," of the lawyer [[Clóvis Beviláqua|Clovis Bevilacqua]] between 1895 and 1910, and [[Livraria Catilina]], founded by Carlos Pongetti on February 2, 1835, and which lasted until 1960, when it became the oldest bookstore in Brazil. In 1864, Sierra Teriga took over its direction, passing it to Xavier Catiline in 1877. The Catilina was a retail house, but had an impressive editorial stint, under the Romualdo dos Santos, and published works of [[Castro Alves]], [[Coelho Neto]], [[Rui Barbosa|Ruy Barbosa]], [[Xavier Marques]], and [[Ernesto Carneiro Ribeiro]]. The actual printing, however, was usually undertaken in Portugal or other European countries, as was customary at the time.
* '''Maranhão'''
[[Maranhão]] was one of the first provinces to have a printing press. It was one of the most prosperous of the empire, due to the production of cotton, which held value since the invention of Cartwright loom in 1787. During this period of development, there was a golden age cultural and intellectual activity in the region, under the influence of the Portuguese elite. The golden age of literature begins with the appearance of the first of [[Gonçalves Dias]] poems, in the 1840s, and goes on to the departure of [[Aluísio Azevedo]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], in the early 1880. Two printers stand out at this time: Belarmino de Mattos and José Maria Corrêa de Frias.

Printing was introduced in Maranhão in 1821, by the governor of [[Bernardo Silveira Pinto da Fonseca]], when he installed an official printer to produce the government newspaper "Conciliador&amp;#x20;do&amp;#x20;Maranhão."&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; A pre "Columbian", the most modern of the time, was brought in from [[Lisbon]], and then converted into the  "[[Typographia Nacional Maranhense]]" later called "Typographia Nacional Imperial".

The first privately owned printer in [[Maranhao|Maranhão]] was Ricardo Antonio Rodrigues de Araújo, whose enterprise existed from 1822 until the 1850s, and "Typographia Melandiana" of Daniel G. de Melo, who produced his first job in 1825. Most important, however, was the "Typographia Constitucional" of Clementino José Lisboa, which began in 1830. Others were the "Ignacio Jose Ferreira", founded in 1833 by João Francisco Lisboa and Frederico Magno d'Abranches; the "J. G. Magalhães Pereira e Manuel Ramos "; the "Typographia Temperança" of Francisco de Sales Nines Cascais; the "Typographia Monárquica Constitucional" which was sold in 1848 to Fábio Alexandrino de Carvalho Reis, Theophilus A. de Carvalho Leal and A. Rego, and would produce "O Progresso", the first daily newspaper of Maranhão, started in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Matos Belarmino has been considered by many historians as one of the best printers that Brazil has ever had.&lt;ref&gt;MATTOS, José Veríssimo, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; He created a union, the "Associação Typographica Maranhense", inaugurated on 11 May 1857, one of the first organizations of Brazil's workers outside of Rio de Janeiro (it was preceded, in Rio de Janeiro, by the "Imperial Associação Typographica Fluminense", founded on December 25, 1853).
* '''Pernambuco'''
In [[Pernambuco]], [[Recife]] had the first typography, the "Oficina Tipográfica da República restaurada de Pernambuco" in 1817, which was soon closed by the government for political reasons. In 1820, governor [[Luís do Rego Barreto]] ordered the building of a "screw press," the traditional model, in the local arsenal, or on the train, then becoming known as "Officina do Trem de Pernambuco", and the design of French teacher Jean-Paul Adour, was appointed to run it. When Rego was dismissed, it came to be called "Officina do Trem Nacional" in 1821 and then "Typographia Nacional". Also in Recife was the competitor Manuel Clemente do Rego Cavalcante, who settled with newly brought equipment from Portugal, associating with Felipe Mena Calado da Fonseca and the Englishman James Prinches; former priest and Portuguese professor Antônio José de Miranda Falcão learned the art of typography. In addition to these, two other printers were "Typographia Fidedigna" run by Manuel Zeferino dos Santos, from 1827-1840, and Typographia do Cruzeiro, which began in 1829.

In Olinda, Manuel Figueroa de Faria opened in mid-1831, the "Pinheiro Faria e Companhia", which moved then to Recife, and that may have been responsible for the first books of Pernambuco; it published the "Diario de Pernambuco", having bought their rights of Antonio José de Miranda Falcão, in 1835. At the time, there were 14 printers and 4 lithographic establishments in Recife. One of the most important was the "União" of Santos e Cia., founded in 1836 by the priest Ignacio Francisco dos Santos.

Perhaps the most interesting publication of Pernambuco, at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; was the work of [[Nísia Floresta]] (the pseudonym of [[Dionysia Gonçalves Pinto]]), "Direitos das Mulheres e Injustiças do Homens". This was a free adaptation of the work [[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]], authored by feminist Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in 1792.

Other printers of note are the Canon Marcelino Pacheco Amaral, who installed a printing press in his own house, only to publish his "[[Compendio de theologia moral]] (Compendium of moral theology)" in three volumes produced between 1888-1890, and then sold his "Imprensa Econômica" to a local publisher, Tobias Barreto, in 1847. He founded in [[Escada, Pernambuco|Escada]], in the interior of Pernambuco, the "Typographia Constitucional", which lasted until 1888.
* '''Paraíba'''
In Paraiba, the "Typographia Nacional da Paraíba" stands out. It printed the first provincial newspaper.
* '''Pará'''
In Pará, the printer João Francisco Madureira manufactured his own press. Already in 1822, the Liberal Press published the first newspaper of Pará, and the fifth in Brazil, "O Paraense", by the master printer Daniel Garção de Melo. The "Typographia de Santos e Menor" of Honorio José dos Santos, gave the first important publication, "Ensaio corográfico sobre a província do Pará", by [[António Ladislau Monteiro Baena]]. Then the press changed the name to "Santos e Filhos (Santos and Sons)" and later, "Santos e Irmão (Santos and Brother)."
* '''In the other provinces'''
After Pará, the picture that emerged in terms of the arrival of the press in the provinces is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;ERICKSEN, Nestor, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ceará]] in 1824, [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in February 1827, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] in June 1827, [[Goiás]] in 1830, [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] in 1831, [[Alagoas]] in 1831, [[Sergipe]] in 1832, [[Rio Grande do Norte]] in 1832, the [[Espírito Santo]] in 1840, [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] in 1853 (Rizzini argues that it was in 1849&lt;ref&gt;RIZZINI, Carlos, 1946 e 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;), Amazonas in 1854, Piaui in 1832, Mato Grosso in 1840&lt;ref&gt;Diferentemente, a "História da Tipogafia no Brasil", de C. M. Semeraro e C. Ayrosa, 1941, dá como Amazonas em 1851, Piauí em 1835 e Mato Grosso em 1839&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing in Rio de Janeiro ==
The new Portuguese constitution, adopted on 15–16 February 1821, abolished censorship, and soon Brazil saw a flood of publications emerging.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Also ended was the monopoly of the government press. In 1821, the installation of "Nova Officina Typographica" by private owners was allowed, followed by "Typographia de Moreira e Garcez" in Rio de Janeiro. On the eve of the Independence of Brazil, the city already had about seven printing establishments. Manuel Joaquim da Silva Porto, poet and bookseller, who had introduced in Brazil the dramatic tragedy [[Phèdre]], by the French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France, [[Jean Racine]], and was a printer the Royal Press, started his "Officina de Silva Porto e Cia.", along with Felizardo Joaquim da Silva Moraes, making this the first bookseller in the city to have its own printing press.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer Victoriano José dos Santos and Silva set up the "Officina dos Anais Fluminenses" (Officina of Fluminenses Proceedings; there was also the modern "Typographia Astréia", which printed a newspaper with the same name, and the firm "Torres e Costa: Innocêncio Francisco Torres e Vicente Justiniano da Costa", which was soon replaced by "Typographia Innocencio Francisco Torres e Companhia." By along with the number of printing presses, there was also an increase in the number of bookstores in Rio de Janeiro.

In 1823, Paulo Martim Filho, who had moved to the Rua dos Pescadores, No. 14, was best known bookseller in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. Silva Porto, at [[Rua da Quitanda]], was second in importance, but in all there were 11 other bookstores, and one of them was that of Francisco Luiz Saturnino da Veiga. To remarry, Francisco donated the dowry of his deceased wife to the older children, João Pedro Ferreira da Veiga and Evaristo da Veiga, who entered on their own into the book market, buying the establishment of Silva Porto.

The predominance of Rio de Janeiro in the literary market began in the 1840s and continued until 1880, despite the attempt of other provincial cities, such as the [[Casa Garraux]], the famed bookstore of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], which had at the time 400 printed works in the province i.e. 11% of all the titles in the country.

Also noteworthy is the "Casa do Livro Azul" ("Blue Book House"), at Rua do Ouvidor, which ran from 1828 to 1852;&lt;ref&gt;MACEDO, Joaquim Manuel de, 1878&lt;/ref&gt; its owner, Albino Jourdan, lost his sight and hearing and was helped by two assistants, aged 14 and 17 years.
* '''Pierre Plancher'''
[[Pierre René Constant Plancher de la Noah]], became an official printer in France in 1798. After numerous political problems with the French government, went to Rio de Janeiro in 1824, and while waiting for the Customs to release their equipment, opened his provisional shop at 60, Rua dos Ourives, in March 1824. In June of that year, he moved to the Rua do Ouvidor, initially at No. 80, then No. 95, and soon began to publish in Portuguese. Much of his publications were administrative. Among his many publications, highlights included the "Annuario Histórico Brasiliense" in 1824, the year in an almanac, "Folhinhas de Algibeira e de Porta", and in 1827, the "Almanack Plancher."
[[File:Convite_e_noticia.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|Jornal do Commercio, of June 10, 1900.]]
Plancher published the first Brazilian soap opera, "Statira a Zoroastes" by Lucas Jose Alvarenga, in 1826, comprising 58 pages. Previously, Paul Martin published some novels, but these were translated from French. Plancher published the journal "Spectador Brasileiro", a newspaper that lasted until May 23, 1827. He later acquired the "Diário Mercantil", from Francisco Manuel Ferreira and Company, and changed its name to [[Jornal do Commercio]], which became the oldest in the city of Rio from January. It is assigned to the new Plancher printing process known as lithography, which was invented in 1798 and only began to become widespread in 1815, replacing the recording on metal plates.

The printer working for Plancher was [[Hércules Florence|Hercule Florence]], who gave up the post to follow a journey of exploration and anthropology with [[Baron Langsdorff]]. The first printer in Brazil, therefore, became Armand Marie Julien Pallière, who worked a while for the Military Archives in 1819, and was replaced by Johann Jacob Steinmann, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1825 and some years later returned to Switzerland, where he published his collection of printed views, "Souvenirs of Rio de Janeiro".

Thanks to the apprentices of Steinmann, in 1846 Rio de Janeiro had four lithography printers. The oldest was that of [[Luis Aleixo Boulanger]], founded on August 15, 1829, and the most important was the firm "Ludwig e Briggs," which existed between 1843 and 1877. The main competitor of Briggs was "Heaton e Rensburg" founded in 1840 (by Englishman George Mathia Heaton and the Dutchman Eduard Rensburg), whose main feature was the publication of music.
&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Metal_movable_text.jpg|thumb|Moveable type on a linotype.]]
After the abdication of D. Pedro I, in 1832, the book trade suffered the economic effects of political uncertainty, and Plancher sold his firm to two countrymen on 9 June 1832. The buyers were Junio Constancio de Villeneuve and Réol- Antoine Mougenot, and July 15, 1834, Mougenot sold his share to Villeneuve, who has owned the first mechanical press in the southern hemisphere,&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; after the first rotary and first Linotype. Its competitors were the "[[Typographia Nacional]]", "[[Paula Brito]]," "Laemmert", the "Typographia do Diário", and the printers [[Correio Mercantil]] and [[Correio da Tarde]]. At the time, two of the oldest registered Brazilian novels were produced: "O Aniversário de D. Miguel em 1828" by J. M. Pereira da Silva in 1838, and "Os Assassinos Misteriosos (The Mysterious Assassins)", by Justiniano José da Rocha, in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Boletim Bibliográfico Brasileiro, 6 (7):374, agosto, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Louis Mongie'''
Louis Mongie had a major bookstore at Ouvidor Street, from 1832 until 1853, the year of his death, at which time the bookstore was transferred to "Pinto &amp; Waldemar," which became, around 1860, "F. L. Pinto &amp; Cia., "And then to "J. Barboza e Irmão"- all of whom called themselves, however, "Imperial Library ".
* '''Paula Brito'''
In 1831, Francisco de Paula Brito, who came from a humble family and learned to read from his sister, bought a small property of their relative Sílvio José de Almeida Brito, in Praça da Constituição (Constitution Square), No. 51. It was a stationery and bindery, besides selling tea. Brito installed a small printing press there, which he had purchased from E. C. dos Santos, and in the year 1833, Brito already had two establishments: the "Typographia Fluminense," the Rua da Constituição, 51, and "Typographia Imparcial" on No. 44; in 1837, he moved to No. 66 and expanded the store to number 64 in 1939. In 1848, Brito already had six manual printers and mechanics, and expanded its facilities to No. 68 and 78, a "corner shop" which became his bookstore and stationery outlet. He created branches in partnership with [[Antonio Goncalves Teixeira e Sousa]] and Candido Lopes, forming with the latter the "Tipografia e Loja de Lopes e Cia", in Niterói. Cândido Lopes would become later the first printer of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

In his shop, Francisco de Paula Brito created the "Sociedade Petalógica" which had such a name because of the "freedom" Brito said that its members give to the imagination (a peta = a lie), and gathered together all the members of the Romantic movement of 1840-1860: [[Antonio Goncalves Dias]], [[Laurindo Rabelo]], [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]], [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida|Manuel Antonio de Almeida]], among others. All the elite of the time, among the politicians, artists and leaders, gathered at the "Paula Brito Bookstore."
[[File:Litography_press_with_map_of_Moosburg_02.jpg|left|thumb|A lithographic press.]]
In 1851, Brito entered the field of lithography; one of his magazines, "A Marmota na Corte (The Marmots in the Court)," included a costume. Brito brought the Paris lithographer Louis Thérier, who became the lithographer for the magazine. Created on December 2, 1850 the new "Imperial Typographia Dous de Dezembro," its name marking the anniversary date of Dom Pedro II, who became its shareholder. Paula Brito was the first non-specialized genuine editor of the country, which came up with a wide variety of works and subjects, unlike their predecessors, who were devoted to more technical matters.

Paula Brito edited the country's first women's magazine in 1832, "A Mulher do Simplício" or "A Fluminense Exaltada", which was printed by Plancher, his friend. The magazine lasted until 1846, when it was replaced by "A Marmota (The Woodchuck)", which lasted, with some title changes, from 1849 to 1864, three years after his death.

There are reports of 372 non-periodical publications made by Paula Brito, on quite varied themes, and of those, 83 were in the medical field, usually theses,&lt;ref&gt;GONDIN, Eunice Ribeiro, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; but most constituted dramas. Brito encouraged the growth of the national literature, still precarious. It can be considered the first Brazilian novel with some literary value has been "O Filho do Pescador (The Fisherman's Son)," by [[Antonio Goncalves Teixeira e Sousa]], published by Brito in 1843. He used the poet [[Casimiro de Abreu]] and the young [[Machado de Assis]], who began as a proofreader of Paula Brito and began the literary career as a collaborator of "A Marmota Fluminense".

In early 1857, dissatisfied shareholders oversaw the liquidation of "Typographia Dous de Dezembro." His firm was reduced to "Typographia de Paula Brito," with only one address, even that thanks to the financial support of the emperor. The publication of books fell, dropping to 12 in 1858 and 15 in 1861, the year of his death. His widow continued the business in partnership with their son in law until 1867, amidst falling production. In 1868 Mrs. Rufina Rodrigues da Costa Brito was alone, transferring the business to Rua do Sacramento, nº 10, which survived until 1875.
* '''Garnier'''
Among the various bookstores in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], at Rua do Ouvidor, while some were owned by Frenchmen, such as Plancher and Villeneuve, others were other branches of existing companies in France such as [[Mongie]], [[Aillaud]] and [[Bossange]]. Prominent among these the Brothers [[Firmin Didot]], but in order of importance, the most prominent was the [[Garnier Frères]], who worked in Brazil from 1844 to 1934.

The brothers Auguste (born in 1812) and Hippolyte (born in 1816) [[Garnier]] began working as bookstore clerks in [[Paris]] in 1828, and later opened their own business, at the age of 21 and 17 years. The younger brother, [[Baptiste Louis Garnier]] (born March 4, 1823), worked for his brother until 1844, and then went to Brazil, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on June 24, 1844. After two years of temporary accommodation, he settled at Rua do Ouvidor, nº 69, and remained there until 1878, moving to No. 71 in front of its main competitor, the "Livraria Universal" E. &amp; H. Laemmert. By 1852, the firm was called the "Garnier Brothers" then "B. L. Garnier "and it is believed that the brothers separated between 1864 and 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1870s, Garnier had its own printing press, the "Tipografia Franco-americana." Overall, Garnier is credited with 655 works by Brazilian authors published between 1860 and 1890 and several translations, from the French, of the most popular novels. Garnier influenced the French format of books that Brazil adopted: octavo (16.5 x 10.5&amp;nbsp;cm) and 'in-doze' (17.5 x 11.0&amp;nbsp;cm, a size close to the A format paperback), an imitation of the Parisian firm [[Calmann-Levy]].
&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, in poor health, Baptiste started negotiations for the sale of his company, but dissatisfied with the price, gave up and died three years later, on 1 October 1893; the company passed on to his brother Hippolyte, who resided in Paris, thus returning to being the branch of the "Garnier Frères" in Rio de Janeiro.

Hippolyte Garnier was 77 years old when his brother Baptiste died. The Garnier in France ended up being in the 1890s and 1920s the leading publisher of Spanish-American literature worldwide. The death of Baptiste, as well as of the Laemmert brothers, caused a stagnation in the Brazilian book market, and the fall of the empire completely transformed the social climate. In 1898, Hyppolite sent to [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] a new manager, Julien Lansac, and his Jacinto Silva became his assistant, who had great autonomy, given the difficulties of Julien to speak Portuguese. Hippolyte was sent reform the Garnier facilities, which opened with fanfare. Each guest was presented with an autographed copy of the 2nd edition of Don Casmurro, by Machado de Assis. Around 1904, Jacinto Silva left the firm and was directing the Casa Garraux books department, in São Paulo, and in 1920 launched his own "Casa Editora O Livro," which was the center of the modernist movement.

Garnier Hippolyte died at age 95 in 1911, and Lansac returned to France in 1913; the business passed to a nephew, Auguste P. Garnier, who sent to Rio de Janeiro another French manager, Émile Izard (born in 1874). From then, Garnier went into decline, with few publications, and the end came close to 1934, when the Garnier Bookstore was sold to [[Ferdinand Briguiet]] who previously bought the Lachaud bookstore, on Rua Nova do Ouvidor.
* '''Briguiet-Garnier'''
When Garnier was sold, it began to use the name Bookstore Briguiet-Garnier, and lasted until 1951, when the "[[Difusão Européia do Livro]]" (Difel) took the Brazilian subsidiary of Garnier. The Garnier building was demolished in 1953 to give place to a bank, and Briguiet was restricted to Rua Nova do Ouvidor. Briguiet then had been replaced by his nephew Ferdinand, who died without heirs in the mid 1970. Some of the firm's assets were purchased by "Library Itatiaia" of Belo Horizonte and the Briguiet shop was closed in 1973.
* '''Lombaerts'''
Among the foreign bookstores in Rio de Janeiro, one that stood out was the [[Belgian]] [[Jean Baptiste Lombaerts]]'s (1821-1875) that of and his son Henri Gustave Lombaerts (1845-1897), which was the largest of lithographs mounted at the time at Rua do Ourives, No 17. It ran between 1848 and 1904 when the store was demolished to make way for Avenida Central. From 1871 to 1879, the library has produced a supplement in Portuguese to follow one of its main imported periodicals, the French magazine "La Saison". From 1879, it began to publish its own Brazilian edition of the magazine, named "A Estação".

Another prominent firm was the Swiss Leuzinger, founded by [[Georg Leuzinger]] (1813-1892), who arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] in 1832, and until 1840 had saved enough to buy the oldest stationery outlet of the city, "the Red Book" of Jean Charles Bouvier, at Rua do Ouvidor, 31. In 1852, Leuzinger acquired Typographia Franceza, founded by [[Jean Soleil Saint Amand]] in 1837, and in 1841 published the first poems of [[Joaquim Norberto]], "Modulações Poéticas", and the first two editions, in 1844 and 1845, of "[[A Moreninha]]", by [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]]. Under the direction of Leuzinger, this became one of the best equipped printing houses in the country. Leuzinger had much involvement in the development of wood engraving (woodcut) in the country, and in 1843, brought from Germany two talented engravers wood, [[Eduard Hüslemann]] and R. Rollenberger. In 1850, Rollenberger died of yellow fever and Hüslemann returned to Germany, but left behind many apprentices in Brazil. Leuzinger was responsible, among other things, for the introduction of illustrated postcards in the country, and ventured into photography too. The 54 woodcuts that illustrate the book of Louis and Elizabeth Agassiz, "Journey in Brazil", 1868, are by Leuzinger. As a press, the Leuzinger survived under the name "Gráfica Ouvidor".
* '''Laemmert'''
The most important foreign bookshops was, however, [[Laemmert]]; between 1893 and the turn of the century, it was the main Brazilian publisher. [[Eduard Laemmert]] (born August 10, 1806) and Heinrich (born October 27, 1812) were children of F. W. Laemmert, a Protestant clergyman who educated them at home and at 14 sent them to learn the book trade. Leaving for Paris, Eduard was working in the firm of Bossange Martin and his son Hector. Two years later, Bossange decided to open a branch in Rio de Janeiro, and Eduard, as representative of Bossange, opened a company with a Portuguese called Souza, representative of JP Aillaud. They set up shop at [[Rua dos Latoeiros]] (now Gonçalves Dias), No. 88 under the Souza Laemmert name. When the contract expired in 1833, Eduard decided to stay in Brazil, married a Brazilian and started his own business in Quitanda Street # 77, the "Livraria Universal". His brother Heinrich came, at his request, to Brazil, and formed the "E. &amp; H. Laemmert, mercadores de livros e de música (E. &amp; H. Laemmert, dealers of books and music)" in 1838. Soon began to edit and in 1839 created their "Folhinha "annual. In 1844, they began the "[[Almanack Laemmert]]" which surpassed all competitors and, in 1875, came to have 1770 pages. They set up in 1868 at Rua do Ouvidor, 68. The printing press Laemmert was inaugurated on January 2, 1838, and named [[Typographia Universal]].

In 1877, Eduard moved away from the firm, going to [[Karlsruhe]], the city where he had learned the craft, and suddenly died there on January 18, 1880. Henry died four years later. All the business went over to a company formed by Gustave Massow, Henry's son-Edgon Widmann Laemmert and Arhur Sauer. In 1891 the firm was reorganized under the name of Laemmert &amp; Companhia, and in 1898, had branches in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Recife]]. In 1903, there was another change of partners, and Edgon was replaced by his son Hugo and Gustave by his brother Hilario. Laemmert had a library with a copy of each edition produced, but this was destroyed by fire in 1909, after which the library was never reopened. The copyright of their property were sold to Francisco Alves, who acquired the most famous of their titles, "Os Sertões", by Euclides da Cunha, whom Laemmert published in 1902 and sold three editions.

Printing continued, and the property, which had been with Arthur Sauer, went to Manuel José da Silva in 1910, who already owned the "Anuário Geral de Portugal (General Yearbook of Portugal)", then the almanac changed the name to "Anuário do Brasil (Brazil Yearbook)". The new organization has undergone several ownership changes, becoming "Sergio &amp; Pinto" in 1919, "Alvaro Pinto &amp; Cia." in 1920, Alexandre Henault &amp; Cia. in 1921, and in 1925 was acquired by the [[Jockey Club of Rio de Janeiro]], where it was called "Almanack Laemmerte Limited". Few books have been produced at that time, especially the "Livro de Ouro do Centenário a Independência do Brasil (Golden Centenary Book of the Independence of Brazil)", on September 7, 1922. In 1942, another fire destroyed the Almanac, and the last number was from 1943. The Gráfica Laemmert returned to publish books by 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sellos &amp; Couto'''
The Sellos &amp; Couto firm was founded in 1815, when José Gonçalves Agra opened a bookstore in Rua do Sabão, No. 22. In the 1820s, the company passed into the hands of Agostinho Gonçalves de Freitas, who was succeeded in 1852 by his nephews Antonio and Agostinho Gonçalves Guimaraes, who added to it a printing workshop, "Typographia Episcopal". Antonio began to devote himself to banking and Augustine retired in 1887, selling the firm to his stepson John Antonio Pinto. When he died, bankrupt, the business was purchased by Antonio Joaquim de Sellos and Gaspar Pereira Couto, who began operating first as Sellos, Guimarães &amp; Cia., Then as Sellos &amp; Couto.
* '''J. Ribeiro dos Santos'''
J. Ribeiro dos Santos, another major firm, was founded by the Portuguese Serafim José Alves, in 1871, at 11, Praça D. Pedro II, today Praça 15 de Novembro. At the end of the century, it moved to the Rua Sete de setembro, No. 83, and soon afterwards adopted the name of the heir of Alves, Jacintho Ribeiro dos Santos. Jacintho bought the Francisco Rodrigues da Cruz bookstore, successor to the Livraria Cruz Coutinho, the Livraria Popular, which was created by Antonio Augusto da Cruz Coutinho. The Library Jacintho Ribeiro dos Santos stood out for the good workmanship of its textbooks, use of images, and the high number of runs in any of its books, which reached the mark of over 100,000 copies in 1924, in a population of 1,157,141 in the city. As "Livraria Jacintho", it survived until 1945 when it was bought over by "Editora A Noite".
* '''Livraria Quaresma'''
The Livraria de Serafim José Alves seems to have had some connection also with the [[Livraria Quaresma]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pedro da Silva Quaresma was the founder of the "Livraria do Povo" in 1879 inRua São José. The Livraria Quaresma lasted until the 1960s, with cheap books and those of a popular appeal, and was the training grounds for bookseller and used bookstore owner Carlos Ribeiro, who later founded the "Livraria São José", active in the 1950s and 1960s.
* '''Antônio Joaquim Castilho'''
The bookseller and printer Castilho is also from this time, but the most important individual from this firm was his son, Antonio Joaquim Castilho. Castilho faced financial difficulties and in 1931, his firm became the "Livraria América", of A, Bedeschi, which lasted until the 1940s, and Castilho was working at [[Editora Civilização Brasileira]].
* '''Francisco Alves'''
Born on August 2 de1848, Francisco Alves d'Oliveira went to Rio in 1863, and got a job in a store of nautical items, and savings. He opened a used bookstore in Rua São José, then he sold it and went back to [[Porto]]. Upon receiving his uncle's invitation to work at his bookstore, he went to Brazil again, and was naturalized on 28 July 1883. The firm Francisco Alves, originally called Livraria Clássica, was founded on August 15, 1854, at Rua of Braziers, No. 54 (later changed to No. 48), by his uncle Nicholas Antonio Alves. Francisco ended up buying the shares of all partners and his uncle by 1897. Initially devoted to textbooks, due to the increasing of the number of schools in the country (in the last years of the Empire, schools increased from 3,561 to 7,500), Francisco Alves came to have a near monopoly of textbooks in Brazil.

Livraria Francisco Alves opened its first branch in São Paulo, on April 23, 1893, where Manuel Pacheco Leão, some of the education secretary and friend of Francis, Teófilo das Neves Leão, was charged with part of the shares of the company. In 1906, he opened a second branch in [[Belo Horizonte]]. In São Paulo, acquired the "N. Falconi "and "Livraria Melilo"; in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], he acquired "Lombaerts," the "Livraria Católica de Sauvin", the "Livraria Luso-Brasileira" of Lopes da Cunha, the "Empresa Literária Fluminense", of AA da Silva Lobo, the home of "Domingos de Magalhães ". He also bought the Portuguese firm "A Editora", formerly "David Corazzi". In 1909, he acquired the "Laemmert", acquiring the rights to "[[Os Sertões]]", by [[Euclides da Cunha]], and [[Inocência|Innocence, Taunay]]. He also bought a small bookstore "Viúva Azevedo" in Rio de Janeiro.

In the literary line, Francisco Alves published [[Júlio Afrânio Peixoto|Afrânio Peixoto]], [[Emílio de Menezes]], [[Raul Pompeia|Raul Pompeii]], among others, but most of his books were printed abroad, for economic and technical reasons which prevented the internal printing, which was the cause of criticism from many nationalists. In his spare time, [[Francisco Alves]] wrote his own books under the pseudonym William Prado or F. d'Oliveira. They were cataloged after his death, totalling some 39 books of his own.
&lt;ref&gt;BRAGA, Oswaldo de Melo.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alves was diabetic and acquired pneumonia that led to tuberculosis. When the member Leo Pacheco died on December 23, 1913, Alves acquired the share of the widow, but himself died on June 29, 1917, after complications from a broken leg in a railway accident. In his will, he left a great legacy and a lifetime pension to a lady who had been his mistress since 1891, Maria Dolores Braun. All the rest of his property would be left for the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]], but with the condition that the Academy should hold every five years, two competitions in his honor, each with a first prize of 10 short stories, a second five stories and a third of three stories. One of the contests should be for monographs on "the best way to expand primary education in Brazil," and the other for monographs on the Portuguese language.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Academy is statutorily prevented from managing any type of business, it sold the bookshop to a group of former employees, led by Paulo Ernesto Azevedo Pacheco, Leão's successor in managing the affiliate of São Paulo, and Antonio de Oliveira Martins. The new company adopted the name "Paulo de Azevedo &amp; Companhia", but continued to use the mark F. Alves, and to dominate the market of textbooks until the appearance of [[Companhia Editora Nacional]], of Octalles Marcondes Ferreira, in the decade of the 1920s.

Paulo Azevedo died in 1946 and was succeeded by his children Ivo and Ademar. The latter admitted as members Alvaro Ferreira de Almeida, Raul da Silva Passos and Lelio de Castro Andrade, to work towards the revitalization of the bookshop. In 1972, the company was sold to Admiral José Celso de la Rocque Maciel Soares Guimarães, who changed its name to "Livraria Francisco Alves Editora"; in 1974, Netumar shipping company, owned by Ariosto Amado, acquired 80% of its capital and Carlos Leal took over its management.
* '''Other publishers'''
Other major publishers and bookstores at the end of the nineteenth century were the publishing firm [[Editora Pimenta de Mello]], founded in 1845 and which survived until 1937, and the [[Livraria Moderna]], Domingos de Magalhaes e Companhia, a leading publisher in the field of literature in the 1890s.

== Publishing in São Paulo ==
* '''Século XIX'''
[[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], in the early nineteenth century, formed a single province together with [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], had a small capital with less than 10,000 inhabitants, and then enjoyed little importance.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, [[José da Costa Carvalho]], the future [[Marquis of Monte Alegre]], imported a press and a printer, and produced the first newspaper of the province, "[[O Farol Paulistano]]".

In 1827, the city of São Paulo was chosen to host one of the two country's law schools, and student life there transformed the city. In 1836, a São Paulo press printed the book, "Questões sobre presas marítimas," by Jose Maria Avelar Brotero. This was followed by other works, and the first of the locally produced literature emerged: in 1849, Rosas e Goivos, by the then student [[José Bonifácio the Younger|José Bonifácio, o Moço]] and, in 1852, Cantos da Solidão, by [[Bernardo Guimaraes]], printed in "Typographia Liberal" which was owned by Joaquim Roberto de Azevedo Marques.

In 1855, [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] had a population of only 25,000 inhabitants, while [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] had crossed a quarter million and [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]] were over 80,000. There were three bookstores, "Fernandes de Souza," "Gravesnes" and "Torres de Oliveira," and three presses, the "Typographia Liberal" of Azevedo Marques, the "Typographia Dous de Dezembro" (no connection with the Paula Brito) of Antonio Antunes Lousada, and "Typographia Litteraria". There also was a bookbinder, the German U. Knossel, whose business was acquired in 1880 by the German Jorge Seckler, and became important graphic with steam-powered printers. In the late 1860, also in operation were the "Typographia Litteraria", the "Typographia Americana" and "Typographia Americana" typography.
* '''Casa Garraux'''
In 1860, the French publisher [[Baptiste Louis Garnier]] opened a branch in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and entrusted it to Anatole Louis Garraux (1833-1904). Three years later, Garraux became independent and opened the Livraria Acadêmica, in partnership with Guelfe de Lailhac and Raphael Suares. This publishing house was known as "Casa Garraux". It was in the Casa Garraux that [[José Olympio]] began to build an interest in the book market, getting a job tidying and cleaning books there.

Before 1920, Garraux did not publish, but became a prominent bookseller, becoming the bookstore with the most updated stock of the country.&lt;ref&gt;ANDREWS, Christofer C. Brazil, its condition and prospects.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1872, [[coffee]] was modifying the provincial scene, and in this year the Garraux moved from Largo da Sé to the Rua da Imperatriz (the future XV de Novembro), going on to play role important in the intellectual and cultural development of the region. Garraux passed on the direction of the store at that time to his son in law Willy Fischer, who retired in 1888, and his successor, Alexander Thiollier,   ran the business until 1893, then moving the direction of the hands of the partner Charles Hildebrand, of Strasbourg.

* '' 'Other São Paulo bookstores' ''
From three bookstores in 1850, São Paulo grew to five in 1870, one of these being the "Great Library Paulista", which the brothers Antonio and Maria José Joaquim Teixeira opened in 1876.

In 1893, due to Italian immigration and also the trail of drought in the North East, São Paulo grew in size to have 192,409 inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and at the turn of the century, it equaled Rio de Janeiro, with 239,820 inhabitants. The paper industry installed in the state began to grow; one of the factories was the "Cia. Melhoramentos de São Paulo", formed in 1890 by Colonel Anthony Proost Brill, and in 1920 joined the paper industry for books, associating with the label of "Weiszflog Brothers". At the end of the century, however, São Paulo still had only eight bookstores. Among others, the prominent ones included "Casa Eclectica".

== 20th century ==
* '''Monteiro Lobato'''

Till the [[World War I|First World War]], Brazilian books were printed mostly in Europe. The Garnier Publisher, used by [[Machado]] and almost all [[Brazilian Academy of Letters|Academic]], was French and had their workshops in [[France]]. [[Coelho Neto]] was printed on [[Porto]] in [[Portugal]], and edited by Lelo &amp; Brother. Brazilian publishers and bookstores devoted themselves more to textbooks, and little was printed in Brazil.

[[Monteiro Lobato|Lobato]] took the initiative that changed the Brazilian publishing market. Printed on their own, in the newspaper presses of "[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]", his book [[Urupês]], found that at the time, Brazil had only 30 bookstores that were able to receive and sell books.&lt;ref&gt;NEVES, Arthur.&lt;/ref&gt; He then wrote to all postmasters of Brazil (1300 in all), requesting the names and addresses of newsagents, stationers, warehouses and pharmacies interested in selling books.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 2005, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 100% of postal agents responded, providing a network of nearly two thousand distributors across the country. Lobato began publishing works of his friends and novice writers.
[[File:Monteiro_Lobato.jpg|right|thumb | 217x217px|Lobato, one of the great supporters of the book in Brazil, Companhia Editora Nacional: "A country is made with men and books."]]
When the original firm of Cia. Gráfio-Editora Monteiro Lobato collapsed, Octalles Marcondes Ferreira (1899-1972), who was his assistant and became his partner, encouraged him to open another publishing venture, and in November 1925, the Companhia Editora Nacional was already established and was preparing to publish a version, supervised by Lobato, of the 1st book written in Brazil in the sixteenth century, the story of [[Hans Staden]], "My Captivity Among the Brazilian Wild," with a print run of 5000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 2005, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

While Octalles remained in São Paulo, Lobato ran the branch of Rio de Janeiro; traveling to the United States, due to speculation in the stock market and the crash of October 1929, Lobato had to sell to Octalles his publisher's shares, and went on to contribute just as an author and translator.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 2005: . 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher began investing gradually in educational titles. In 1932, Octalles acquired Editora Civilização Brasileira, founded in 1929 by Getúlio M. Costa, Ribeiro Couto e [[Gustavo Barroso]], and now, slowly, passed on to the son Enio Silveira. In 1934, the brand "Nacional" was almost entirely reserved for teaching and children's books. In 1943, there six teachers responsible for implementing the textbooks abandoning the company, they went on to found their own publishing house, the "Editora do Brasil", specializing in books relating to [[Didactic method|teaching]]. The assistant of Octalles, Arthur Neves (1916-1971), left and formed Editora Brasiliense, which launched its own bookstore, the "Livraria Brasiliense."

Octalles died in 1973, and presidency of the company passed on to his brother Lindolfo. In 1974 Livraria José Olympio Editora requested financial aid to buy the publisher,&lt;ref&gt;Millarch, Aramis.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this operation was never undertaken. "The company Jose Olimpio requested government aid: in this case, the total financing of the operation, so the National Bank for Economic Development ([[Brazilian Development Bank|BNDES]]) acquired all the shares of the company [...] however, the economic situation of José Olympio made the desired transfer impossible and the Nacional eventually became property of the BNDE."&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, Laurence, 2005, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the Brazilian Institute of Pedagogical Issues (IBEP) acquired Companhia Editora Nacional, forming one of the largest publishing groups in the country. In 2009, [[Conrad Editora]], specializing in [[Comics|Comic]], was bought by IBEP-Group Company Editora Nacional&lt;ref&gt;ASSISI, Erico.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '' 'Jose Olympio' ''
The publisher started in 1931, also in São Paulo, with a successful book, "Know thyself by psychoanalysis," by the American J. Ralph, a work that today is known as a self-help title.&lt;ref name = "Silvers. House "&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/061206/p_136.htm Pratas House]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, Olympio became the country's largest publisher, publishing 2 000 titles, with 5000 issues, which in the 1980s comprised 30 million books 900 national authors and 500 foreign authors books.

The Livraria José Olympio bookstore got into a crisis that began with the collapse in the stock market. In the 1970s, he tried to buy Companhia Editora Nacional. On May 3, 1990, when he died, José Olympio was no longer owner of the publishing house that bore his name, because after being taken over by the BNDES in the 70s, it was bought by Record in 2001; today it belongs to Grupo Editorial Record.&lt;ref name="Silvers. House "/&gt;
* '' 'Publisher Martins' ''
José de Barros Martins decided to leave the job to open a bookstore in a small room on the first floor of a building in the Rua da Quitanda in São Paulo, in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, Laurence, 2005, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt; He organized his own editorial department, under the direction of Edgard Cavalheiro and his first title in early 1940 was "Direito Social Brasileiro", dealing with the Brazilian social law, and authored by [[Antonio Ferreira Cesarino Junior]].

Martins promoted the liquidation of his company in 1974, but tried to remain in the business, the most valuable negotiating publishing contracts with Editora Record.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 2005, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Martins Editora is an imprint of Livraria Martins Fontes.

* '' 'Civilização Brasileira' ''
Founded by Getúlio M. Costa, Ribeiro Couto and [[Gustavo Barroso]] in 1929, the company Civilização Brasileira had at the time few titles, and in 1932 was acquired by Octalles Marcondes Ferreira,&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, Laurence, 2005, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; becoming part of the Companhia Editora Nacional. Enio Silveira took part in the Civilização Brasileira, and increased its impact, and at the end of the 1950s, it had become already one of the leading publishers in the country. In 1963, Enio Silveira took full control of Civilização Brasileira&lt;ref name = "Hallewell, p. 447"&gt;Hallewell, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year his book output was the same as that of the Companhia Editora Nacional, added 46 new titles. Civilização Brasileira eventually becoming the most important channel for modern Brazilian literature in the 1960s,&lt;ref name = "Hallewell, p. 447"&gt;Hallewell, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to devote to translations of both the European countries as the US, Japanese and Latin American.

In 1982, Enio accepted an operational supply from DIFEL, a foreign company, to cooperate with his firm. At the same time, Banco Pinto de Magalhães, the Portuguese bank, and a Portuguese entity, Batista da Silva, acquired 90% stake in Civilização Brasileira, and Enio's share was 10%. In March 1984, it formalized the transfer of the Civilização Brasileira operations to São Paulo, maintaining a branch in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; Silveira of Enio died in 1996. Currently, the Civilização Brasileira is part of Grupo Editorial Record.
* '' 'Publisher Attica' ''
Between 1964 and 1965, Editora Attica made an impact. On 15 October 1956, the Curso de Madureza Santa Inês was founded, for the education of youth and adults, by the brothers Anderson Fernandes Dias and Vasco Fernandes Dias Filho and his friend Antonio Narvaes Filho. Over time, through the increasing number of students, the mimeograph became insufficient to print handouts, and 1962 saw the creation of Sesil (Sociedade Editora do Santa Inês Ltda. or the Santa Inês Publishing Society Ltd.). Anderson Fernandes Dias, however, backed the creation of a publishing house. Thus, Editora Attica emerged in August 1965, and the following year, it already had 20 titles in its catalog.

In 1999, Attica was bought by [[Editora Abril]], in partnership with the French group Vivendi. In 2002, Vivendi sold its publications branch companies to the French group Lagardère, but Editora Attica got out of that commercial transaction. In 2003, the two controlling shareholders of Attica - April and Vivendi - again put the publisher up for sale. After a year of negotiations, the financial assets of Vivendi were acquired by Editora Abril, in February 2004, becoming the majority owner of Editora Attica, ushering in a new phase in the company's history, which became part of Abril Education. In early 2005, the publisher began to work on building the Edifício Abril on Marginal Tiete.
* '' 'Bookstore Globe' ''
In the 1880s, the "Livraria Americana", originally set up in Pelotas, by Carlos Pinto, had several translations of foreign authors, not always with permission of the authors. Such cases, and many others, led to a reaction by the authors and the government, and began to establish laws in order to preserve those rights. The origins of Editora Globo belong to this time, but the publisher did not start a regular program of editions in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the early 1930s, the Livraria do Globo emerged in Porto Alegre, and the beginning of the publishing industry seems to have given especially the disadvantageous position of the new government with respect to the copyright rights of others States. The magazine Globo, having no money to republished materials, also resorted to piracy&lt;ref&gt;Verissimo, Erico.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flourishing of publishing activity was also due to the development and growth of the [[Rio Grande do Sul]],   at the time of the [[First Brazilian Republic|Old Republic]], 1889-1930. The [[Editora Globo]] started with a small stationery and bookstore, founded in 1883 by Portuguese immigrant Laudelino Pinheiro Barcellos, next to which was built a graphic workshop for custom work. José Bertaso, a boy admitted for minor services in 1890, became a partner and in 1919, the owner. Bertaso predicted shortages of paper with the [[World War I|First World War]] and cared enough to profit later from the sales. The "Barcellos, Bertaso and Co." acquired a linotype machine, the first in the state, and in 1922 began to publish books leading to a local literary revival, the counterpart of the [[Modernism|modernist movement]]. Mansueto Bernardi, an Italian and director of the publicity department, was even more ambitious, and encouraged the publication of translated titles. He has assembled a team of reviewers, translators and graphic artists, and created the magazine Revista do Globo.

Bernardi in 1931 with the creation of the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]], exited the field of editorial activity and began to drive the [[Mint (facility)|Mint]]. The eldest of his three sons, Henry d'Avila Bertaso, who began in Livraria Globo bookstore in 1922, at age 15, took over the publishing industry, while the direction of the Globe Magazine was given to a young writer, [[Erico Verissimo]], who becoma one of the main [[Translation|translators]] of the publisher. Verissimo's career as an author had begun in 1928 when Bernardi accepted his story "Ladrão de Gado" ("Cattle Thief") for theRevista do Globo magazine. His first book,  "Fantoches" ("Puppets") was a collection of short stories that H. Bertaso accepted for publication in 1932. After a few books, the only commercial success came in 1935 with "Caminhos Cruzados", which received several awards.
[[File:Revista_do_globo_anno_IV_n_7.jpg|thumb|196x196px | Cover 'magazine Globe' 'Year IV No. 7, 1932, with illustration of Francis Pelichek]].
Due to the economic situation, the Brazilian book became competitive, a fact that was capitalised on by the Livraria Globo bookstore. In 1936, the company already had three floors, 500 employees, 20 Linotype machines, and the publishing industry had about 500 titles. Verissimo passed on the control of the magazine to De Souza Júnior, and b H. Bertaso became editorial consultant, allowing for the gain of the literary publisher's quality. The policy emphasized the Anglo-American authors, due to the preponderance of translations from English. With the [[World War II]], there was a sudden prosperity in the book business, and several translators were employed, such as Leonel Vallandro, Juvenal Jacinto, Herbert Caro, and Homero de Castro as permanent employees. In the early 1950s, with the rigor in Brazil over the control of remittance of foreign currency abroad, there was a decline in the production of translations of the globe. There then was a slight recovery in the 1960s, but without recovery of the old interest especially in other areas.

Verissimo began to devote more to his own literary production; José Bertaso died in 1948 and in 1956, when the Globo reached its 2,000th title since 1930, it was decided to transform the publishing part of the business into a legally separate development, creating [[Editora Globo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Verissimo was gradually disengaging the Globo, and died in 1975. Henry Bertaso died in 1977, having passed on his business to his sons Jose Otavio, Fernando and Claudio. In 1986 the company was sold to Rio Gráfica Editora (GER) of [[Roberto Marinho]]. Rio Graphic started using only the Editora Globo name since.
* '' 'National Institute of Books' ''
With the revolution of 1930, the Rio Grande do Sul gained importance on the national scene. With the implementation of the Estado Novo, one of the consequences was the creation of the National Book Institute, the initiative of Minister Capanema in September / December 1937 (Decree-Law No. 93 of September 21 of 1937). The poet [[Augusto Meyer]] was the director until 1954 and again from 1961 to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; It was created and encouraged by [[Getúlio Vargas]] with the objective of developing an [[encyclopedia]] and [[dictionary]] of the Brazilian language and to build the [[national identity|identity]] and [[national memory]] and support the implementation of public libraries throughout Brazil. Until 1945, however, they had not yet completed the encyclopedia and dictionary, but the number of public libraries has grown, especially in the states of cultural scarcity, thanks to the help provided by INL in the collection of the composition and technical training.
* '''Other prominent publishers'''
Besides those already mentioned, in the early twentieth century among the other important ones were, in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] Livraria H. Antunes founded by Hector Antunes in 1909, and Arthur Vecchi in 1913, which began with publication of books and later dedicated itself to [[comic books]]. Besides these, the [[Livraria Editora Leite Ribeiro e Maurillo]], founded in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] in 1917, and in the mid-1920s was renamed as Freitas Bastos; [[Livraria Schmidt Editora|Livraria Católica]], founded by the poet [[Augusto Frederico Schmidt]], in 1930, which soon became a meeting point for intellectuals of the time. Those who attended became known as the "Catholic Circle". Schmidt took later removed the 'Catholic' word from its name and it became and was just Livraria Schmidt Editora, which remained so until 1939, when the business was absorbed and the facilities acquired by Zélio Valverde, in whose firm Schmidt became a partner. Others are the [[Gianlorenzo Schettino Livraria Editora]], which existed from 1922 to 1931;Editora A. Coelho Branco, and [[Editora Ariel]], of the writers Gastao Cruls and Agripino Grieco, which was exclusively a publisher.

* '''Publishing in other states'''
In [[Rio Grande do Sul]], apart from [[Editora Globo]], the oldest publisher was the "Livraria e Editora Selbach", founded in 1931, having started its activity with "Farrapos!", by [[Walter Spalding]]. It ended around 1960, Other major publishers were "Livraria Sulina" founded in 1946 by the brothers Leopold and Nelson Boeck, which specialized in law, business administration and history. The "Tabajara" with textbooks, and [[L&amp;PM Editores]], created by Ivan Pinheiro Machado and Paulo de Lima, in 1974, at the time to publish a single book, "Rango, história em quadrinhos de um marginal" by Edgar Vasques, which had appeared before in the Porto Alegre newspaper "[[Folha da Manhã]]". Encouraged by the success, the two young editors began to publish a small number, but select titles, qustioning the government of the time, during the military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, other major publishers were [[Editora Movimento]] and Editora-Mercado-Aberto.

In [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], at [[Curitiba]], in the 1930s [[Editora Guaira]] gained national reputation with titles like "Esperança" by [[André Malraux]], "Doña Barbara" by [[Romulo Gallegos]], among others. In the early 1940s, production was 40 titles per year. It declined after World War II. Also in [[Curitiba]], Editora dos Professores, created by Ocyron Cunha in 1962, was intended to produce works of regional teachers, and is currently inactive.

[[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], despite having only a little publishing activity, has plenty of outlets, and most of its municipalities have bookstores, which got it the fifth national place in book sales in the 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other cities of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Petropolis]] was noteworthy, with [[Editora Vozes]] created on March 5, 1901, by the local [[Franciscan]] convent. It is the oldest publisher in Brazil still active.

In [[Minas Gerais]], at [[Belo Horizonte]] one initiative that stands out is the [[Livraria Itatiaia Editora]], as well as Editora Comunicação, Editora Vega, Interlivros and LEMI (Livraria Editora Miguilim), publisher of children's books.

In Bahia, between the 1940s and 1960s, the most important editorial brand was the "Livraria Progresso," by Aguiar and Souza Ltda. (not to be confused with the Progresso do Grupo Delta). Another was the Edições Macunaíma, founded in 1957 by [[Calasans Neto]], Fernando da Rocha Peres, Glauber Rocha and Paulo Soares Gili as Macunaíma Editorials Empreendimentos Ltda. In 1974, the highlight was the Editora Itapuã of Dmeval Keys and Editora Janaína, or Jorge Amado.

In [[Recife]], the highlights were the "Livraria Sete", and "Gráfica Amador", which changed its name to Editora Igarassu, and in 1980, Editora Guararapes.

== Pocket books ==
[[File:Paperback-stack.png|right|200x200px|thumbs]]
There have been several attempts in Brazil to produce a lower-priced book.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; In the  "Coleção Globo" of [[Livraria do Globo]], in the early 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://somlivros.weebly.com/blog/um-legado-impresso-pela-historia Um legado impresso pela história] [https://somlivros.weebly.com/ Som Livros usados]&lt;/ref&gt;  24 titles were released, including classics, adventures and police fiction, in the format 11x16 cm, cartoned. In 1942, Bertaso started the "Coleção Tucano" with fiction of good quality, such as works by [[André Gide]], [[Thomas Mann]], and others. In the 1960s, Globo launched the "Coleção Catavento" successfully. In 1944, there was the "Coleção Saraiva" of Brazilian classics.

There were distribution attempts through newsagents and kiosks at airports. In 1956, [[Editora Monterrey]] was constituted to produce popular light fiction (pulp) in paperback format, founded by the Spanish published [[El Coyote (character)|O Coyote]] (The Coyote)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=|title=Suplemento cultural: Coletânea|publisher=Companhia Editora de Pernambuco|year=2005|pages=99|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; series and [[Brigitte Montfort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|URL=http://www.parana-online.com.br/colunistas/jornalista-externo/7452/O+OUTONO+DE+BRIGITTE+MONTFORT|title=O outono de Brigitte Montfort|author=Edilson Pereira|date=2003-05-20|publisher=[[O Estado do Paraná]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of better quality was the Tecnoprint Gráfica, which later adopted the editorial brand of [[Ediouro|Edições de Ouro]], its most famous title in the format being the series of German science fiction Perry Rhodan.&lt;ref name="arquivos"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0%2C%2COI4059647-EI6622%2C00-Nos%20arquivos%20da%20Ediouro.html |title=Nos arquivos da Ediouro |author=[[Roberto de Sousa Causo]] |date=24 October 2009 |publisher=[[Portal Terra]] |access-date= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918002939/http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0%2C%2COI4059647-EI6622%2C00-Nos%2Barquivos%2Bda%2BEdiouro.html |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960, [[Dominus Editora S/A]] (DESA) came out with pocket editions and [[Livraria José Olympio Editora]] launched the "Sagarana" with reprints in small format. In 1970, the [[Editora Bruguera]], the Brazilian subsidiary of [[Francisco Bruguera]], [[Argentina]], published a foreign and domestic fiction pocketbook collection, mostly in the [[public domain]]. [[Editora Artenova]] also worked with pocketbook. In the end of 1971, the [[Editora Edibolso]] started with just 14 titles and in late 1977 already launched nearly a hundred paperbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Hallewell, 1985, p. 564&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best known pocket collections today are of [[L&amp;PM]] (Pocket Guide or Coleção Pocket) and [[Martin Claret]].

In the 1990s the editor [[Vicente Fittipaldi]] ([[Editora Fittipaldi]] and [[Editora Contato]]) stood out in the segment, editing over 6 million copies annually with distribution in newsstands by Abril group.

== Current editorial overview ==
From the 1980s there was an upward growth trend in the Brazilian publishing market, with an increase in the publishing sector. New publishers emerged, but many of the old have been replaced or incorporated into others. The [[Companhia Editora Nacional]], for example, currently belongs to [http://www.bienaldolivrosp.com.br/pt-BR/Exhibitors/419595/Grupo-IBEP Grupo-IBEP], and [[Civilização Brasileira]], the [[Grupo Editorial Record]], which appeared in 1942 and marked its entry into publishing in 1957. The [[Editora Pensamento-Cultrix]] merged into [[Editora Pensamento-Cultrix]] while [[Editora Cortez &amp; Moraes]] separated, forming the [[Editora Cortez]] and [[Editora Moraes]], which in turn became the [[Centauro Editora]] label. Old publishers survived as [[Editora Brasiliense]] and [[Editora Vozes]], the oldest still active in Brazil, and new publishers have grown and diversified the national publishing scene as [[Editora Perspectiva]] (1965), [[Editora Nórdica]] (1970), Editora Cátedra (1970), [[Martin Clare]] (1970), Alfa-Ômega (1973), [[Editora Rocco]] (1975), [[Companhia das Letras]] (1986), among others.

* '''Editora Nova Fronteira'''
The Editora Nova Fronteira was founded in Rio de Janeiro em1965, the political journalist [[Carlos Lacerda]]. Before he died in 1977, he built a formal link with the Editora [[Nova Aguilar]], founded in 1958 by a nephew of the owner of his namesake in Madrid. With the death of Lacerda, his sons Sergio and Sebastian took over.

* '''Editora Abril'''
[[File:BIRMANN_21.JPG|right|thumb|200x200px|[[Birmann 21]] Editora Abril's headquarters in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], is one of the tallest [[skyscrapers]] in [[Brazil]].]]
[[Editora Abril]] was responsible for the success of a kind of book sold on newsstands: the edition in fascicles (a section of a book or set of books being published in installments as separate pamphlets or volumes). [[Editora Abril]] was founded by [[Victor Civita]] and his friend [[Giordano Rossi]] in 1950, initially as a magazine publisher. It started with [[Donald Duck]], working with the [[Walt Disney]] organization, and their first venture in the book market was in 1965, with an illustrated edition of the [[Holy Bible]], in fortnightly installments, followed by others of general interest. The growth and acceptance it received were outstanding, and in 1974, its fascicles on philosophy, [[Os Pensadores]] (The Thinkers) of which it sold 100,000 copies a week. In 1982, they launched [[Os Economistas]], including 20 titles that had never been published before in Portuguese.

* '''The current situation of reading in Brazil'''
The National Union of Book Publishers (Sindicato Nacional dos Editores de Livros, SNEL), the Brazilian Book Chamber (Câmara Brasileira do Livro, CBL), the Brazilian Association of Book Publishers (Associação Brasileira de Editores de Livros, ABRELIVROS) and the Brazilian Association of Pulp and Paper (Associação Brasileira de Celulose e Papel, BRACELPA)  research the reading habits of Brazilians and provide information for planning the market and public policies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snel.org.br/ui/pesquisaMercado/retratoLeitura.aspx Sindicato Nacional dos Editores de Livros] (consulta: 28/07/10)&lt;/ref&gt; and currently has about 659 publishers registered.

A survey by the Associação Nacional de Livrarias (ANL), available on July 27, 2010, shows that in the country there are currently 2980 stores - 11% more than there were in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anl.org.br/web/news/noticia_09.html Associação Nacional de Livrarias] (consulta:28/07/10)&lt;/ref&gt; The ANL points out, however, that the Brazilians read only 1.9 books per year, which falls short of the average in other Latin American countries. [[Vitor Tavares]], president of the ANL, gives examples: "In [[Argentina]], we read about five. In [[Chile]], three. In [[Colombia]], reads 2.5 books a year. " Also according to Tavares, "More and more libraries are opened in big cities but in towns of up to 80,000 inhabitants, often there is no selling point." Also according to the ANL, the southeastern region has the largest number of shops; [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], with 864 retailers specializing in books, has more than twice the second place, followed by [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The Paraná is in fifth place in number of bookstores. Bahia has the largest number of bookstores in the Northeast, and the sixth in the country, tied with [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]; [[Roraima]], despite having only 25 bookstores has, proportionally, in the North, the best national average.&lt;ref&gt;Vitor Tavares, presidente da ANL.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survey ==
On 23 July 2010, the [[Valor Econômico]] newspaper held a poll with a group of critics and teachers to identify what is the best publisher in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;FERRARI, Mário, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the [[Companhia das Letras]] showing up in the first place (81%), and the Cosac Naify at second (76%). In the third spot were Editora 34, Martins Fontes and Record; in fourth was Editora UFMG; in fifth Ateliê Editorial, Editora Hedra, Editora Iluminuras, Editora da Unicamp;&lt;ref&gt;ALVES FILHO, Manuel, 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and in the sixth spot Contraponto Editora, Difel, Edusp, Editora Escrituras, Editora Perspectiva, UnB, Editora Vozes, WMF Martins Fontes, Zahar Editores.

The survey conducted by the newspaper did not aim to measure business efficiency, but to focus on publishers who stand out culturally. Voting started with an emphasis on artistic and literary areas and the humanities, and the ability to intervene in the cultural life and to form readers with the criteria if measuring the quality of a publisher. The 21 experts surveyed were asked to name the best three publishing houses. The more specialized areas were excluded, such as technical books, self-help, textbooks and supplementary teaching material.

'''''In the Heat of the Night''''' is a 1967 American [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Norman Jewison]]. It is based on [[John Ball (American author)|John Ball]]'s 1965 [[In the Heat of the Night (novel)|novel of the same name]] and tells the story of [[Virgil Tibbs]], a black [[police detective]] from [[Philadelphia]], who becomes involved in a murder investigation in a small town in [[Mississippi]]. It stars [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Rod Steiger]], and was produced by [[Walter Mirisch]]. The screenplay was by [[Stirling Silliphant]].

The film won five [[Academy Awards]], including the [[40th Academy Awards|1967]] awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and Rod Steiger for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].

The film was followed by two [[sequel]]s, ''[[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!]]'' in 1970, and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'' in 1971. In 1988, it also became the basis of a [[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|television series]] adaptation of the same name.

Although the film was set in the fictional Mississippi town of Sparta (with supposedly no connection to the real [[Sparta, Mississippi]]), most of the movie was filmed in [[Sparta, Illinois]], where many of the film's landmarks can still be seen. The quote "They call me ''Mister Tibbs!''{{-"}} was listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes. In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
In 1966, a wealthy industrialist named Phillip Colbert has moved from [[Chicago]] to [[Sparta, Mississippi]] to build a factory. One night, police officer Sam Wood discovers that Colbert has been murdered.

Chief Gillespie leads the investigation. A doctor estimates that Colbert had been dead for a few hours. Wood finds a black man named [[Virgil Tibbs]] at the train station and arrests him. Gillespie quickly assumes that Tibbs is the culprit and tries to get Tibbs to make a confession. However, he is embarrassed to learn that Tibbs is a top homicide detective from [[Philadelphia]]. Gillespie phones Tibbs' chief, who confirms this and recommends that Tibbs should assist them. This idea does not appeal to Gillespie or Tibbs, but they reluctantly agree.

Gillespie arrests another suspect, but Tibbs clears him. The victim's widow is frustrated by the ineptitude of the local police and impressed by Tibbs. She threatens to stop the construction of the factory unless Tibbs leads the investigation. Despite the rocky start, the two policemen begin to respect each other as they are forced to work together.

Tibbs initially suspects plantation owner Endicott, a racist who publicly opposes the new factory. When Tibbs attempts to interrogate Endicott, Endicott slaps him in the face and Tibbs slaps him back. Endicott sends a gang of hooligans after Tibbs. Gillespie rescues him from the fight and tells him to leave town for his safety, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case. He examines Colbert's body and suggests the murder happened earlier than initially thought. He examines Colbert's car and deduces that Colbert was murdered elsewhere and the culprit moved the body. Tibbs asks Wood to retrace his car patrol route on the night of the murder, and Gillespie joins them. When Tibbs notices that Wood has changed his route, Gillespie starts suspecting Wood, though Tibbs hints there is another reason.

Gillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit into his bank account the day after the murder while Purdy, a local, files charges against Wood for getting his 16-year-old sister Delores pregnant. Gillespie arrests Wood, despite Tibbs' protests, and Delores is interrogated. Purdy is offended that a black man was present at the interrogation, and he gathers a mob to get revenge. Tibbs reveals that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory and clears Wood. He also admits that he knew why Wood had changed his route: Delores is an [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] and Wood has been spying on her.

Tibbs visits a [[backstreet abortion]]ist, who reveals that someone paid for Delores to have an abortion. When Delores arrives, Tibbs follows her outside and is confronted by the murderer, Ralph. Purdy's mob tracks down Tibbs and holds him at gunpoint; he responds by proving that Ralph got Delores pregnant. Ralph shoots Purdy dead before Tibbs disarms him. Ralph is arrested and confesses to Colbert's murder: he robbed Colbert to fund Delores's abortion but accidentally killed him.

The final scene shows Tibbs boarding a train bound for Philadelphia, as Gillespie respectfully bids him farewell.

==Production==
Jewison, Poitier, and Steiger worked together and got along well during the filming, but Jewison had problems with the Southern authorities, and Poitier had reservations about coming south of the [[Mason–Dixon Line]] for filming. However, despite their reservations, Jewison decided to film part of the film in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]] and [[Union City, Tennessee|Union City]], Tennessee, anyway while the rest was filmed in Sparta, [[Chester, Illinois|Chester]] (Harvey Oberst chase scene), and [[Freeburg, Illinois|Freeburg]] (Compton's diner), Illinois.

The famous scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the novel. According to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the textbook "Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History)," Poitier states: "I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie for you if you give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him right back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this movie.' I try not to do things that are against nature." &lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History), Vivienne Sanders, Hodder Education, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, Poitier's version of the story is contradicted by [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] in his book, ''Pictures at a Revolution''. Harris states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay that he obtained clearly contain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by Jewison and Silliphant.

The film is also important for being the first major Hollywood film in color that was lit with proper consideration for a black person. [[Haskell Wexler]] recognized that standard strong lighting used in filming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions and rendered the features indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler toned it down to feature Poitier with better photographic results.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Mark. ''Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of a New Hollywood''. Penguin Press, 2008, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In contrast to films like ''[[The Chase (1966 film)|The Chase]]'' and ''[[Hurry Sundown (film)|Hurry Sundown]]'', which offered confused visions of the South, ''In the Heat of the Night'' offered a tough, edgy vision of a Southern town that seemed to hate outsiders more than itself, a theme reflecting the uncertain mood of the time as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] attempted to take hold. Canadian director Jewison wanted to tell an anti-racist story of a white man and a black man working together in spite of difficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a conviction he had held for a long time: "It's you against the world. It's like going to war. Everybody is trying to tell you something different and they are always putting obstacles in your way."

In one famous scene, Gillespie mocks the name 'Virgil' by saying "That's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia! What do they call you up there?" An irritated Tibbs replies: "They call me Mr. Tibbs!" The line was later listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes, and was also the title of [[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!|the sequel]]. An iconic scene that surprised and perhaps shocked audiences at the time occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs responds by slapping him back.

In a [[San Francisco]] pre-screening, Jewison was concerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if it were a comedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene convinced Jewison that the film was effective as drama.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp. 288–90.&lt;/ref&gt; That scene helped make the film so popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film actor physically strike back against bigotry, that the film earned the nickname, ''[[Superspade|Super-spade]] Versus the Rednecks''.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier occasionally went to the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]] to amuse themselves seeing how many black and white audience members there were, which could be immediately ascertained by listening to the former cheering Tibbs's retaliatory slap and the latter whispering "Oh!" in astonishment.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp. 335–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Then-freshman critic [[Roger Ebert]] in 1967 gave ''In the Heat of the Night'' a positive review and placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130707145722/http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-10-best-lists-1967-present Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967 to Present.] [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' via the [[Internet Archive]].

Retrieved October 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; AD Murphy of ''[[Variety magazine]]'' felt it was a good but uneven film.&lt;ref&gt;Later, Poitier did the sequels ''[[They Call Me MISTER Tibbs]]'' and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'', but both films failed at the box office.[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117488059 ''Variety'' review, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film currently holds a 96% "Certified Fresh" rating on the [[Review aggregator|review aggregate]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], out of 46 reviews collected with an average rating of 8.2/10. Its consensus states, "Tense, funny, and thought-provoking all at once, and lifted by strong performances from Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger, director Norman Jewison's look at murder and racism in small-town America continues to resonate today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_heat_of_the_night/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=In the Heat of the Night, Movie Reviews |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allmusic]]'s Steven McDonald said the soundtrack had "a tone of righteous fury woven throughout" and that "the intent behind ''In the Heat of the Night'' was to get a Southern, blues-inflected atmosphere to support the angry, anti-racist approach of the picture .. although the cues from ''In the Heat of the Night'' show their age".&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|first=Steven|last=McDonald|class=album|id=mw0000034374|title=''In the Heat of the Night/They Call Me Mr. Tibbs'' – Review|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Vinyl Factory]] said "this soundtrack to a film about racism in the South has a cool, decidedly Southern-fried sound with funk-bottomed bluesy touches, like on the strutting 'Cotton Curtain', the down 'n' dirty 'Whipping Boy' or the fat 'n' sassy 'Chief's Drive to Mayor'".&lt;ref&gt;[https://thevinylfactory.com/features/10-definitive-quincy-jones-soundtracks-from-the-60s-and-70s/ 10 definitive Quincy Jones soundtracks from the '60s and '70s], The Vinyl Factory, accessed January 19, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''[[Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV]]'' (1972–73 edition) gives ''In the Heat of the Night'' its highest rating of 4 stars, recommending it as an "[E]xciting, superbly acted and directed film about prejudice, manners and morals in a small Mississippi town", with the concluding sentences stating, "[D]irector Norman Jewison does an outstanding job in creating the subsurface tension of life in a 'sleepy' Southern town, and the supporting performances are uniformly fine. A first-rate film in all respects." ''[[Leonard Maltin's TV Movies &amp; Video Guide]]'' (1989 edition) follows Scheuer's example with its own highest rating of 4 stars, concluding that "[M]arvelous social thriller hasn't dated one bit—tough, funny, and atmospheric, with unbeatable acting and splendid Quincy Jones score. Five Oscars include Best Picture..."

''Mick Martin's &amp; Marsha Porter's DVD &amp; Video Guide'' (2007 edition) also puts its rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5), finding it "[A] rousing murder mystery elevated by the excellent acting of Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier."

British references likewise show high regard for the film, with [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]] in his 1984 ''The Good Film and Video Guide'' giving 3 (out of 4) stars, noting that "[A]s mystery or detective story this film is only fair but it has enormous tension. Within its given framework, it is good on the colour question. There is tension in the eyes of the black (Sidney Poitier), who happens to be a homicide officer, and malevolence in those of the local police chief (Rod Steiger). These are two remarkable performances, well supported by Warren Oates, Lee Grant and Larry Gates."

Another British film critic with a highly personal ''Film Guide'', [[Leslie Halliwell]], gave 2 stars (out of 4) describing it in the 5th edition (1985) as an "[O]verrated policier in which the personality clash is amusing (and was timely) but the murder puzzle is a complete throwaway." The ''Guide'' continued to be published after Halliwell's death in 1989 and, in the 21st edition, ''Halliwell's Film Video &amp; DVD Guide 2007'', John Walker, who took over as the ''Guide's'' author, raised the rating to the highest level of 4 stars and rewrote the evaluation to state that it is "[A] tense and exciting thriller that also explores racism through the explosive clash of two contrasting personalities."

==Home media==
''In the Heat of the Night'' was first released on [[DVD]] in 2001. In 2010, the film was digitized in High Definition (1080i) and broadcast on [[MGM HD]].

In 2014, MGM released the film on Blu-ray.

'''{{Lang|de|Kindertotenlieder}}''' (''Songs on the Death of Children'') is a [[song cycle]] (1904) for voice and orchestra by [[Gustav Mahler]]. The words of the songs are poems by [[Friedrich Rückert]].

==Text and music==

[[File:Friedrich Rückert.jpg|thumb| [[Friedrich Rückert]], as portrayed by Bertha Froriep in 1864]]
The original {{Lang|de|Kindertotenlieder}} were a group of 428 poems written by Rückert in 1833–34&lt;ref name=P174&gt;Painter (2002, 174)&lt;/ref&gt; in an outpouring of grief following the illness ([[scarlet fever]]) and death of two of his children. Karen Painter describes the poems thus: "Rückert's 428 poems on the death of children became singular, almost manic documents of the psychological endeavor to cope with such loss. In ever new variations Rückert's poems attempt a poetic resuscitation of the children that is punctuated by anguished outbursts. But above all the poems show a quiet acquiescence to fate and to a peaceful world of solace."&lt;ref name=P174 /&gt; These poems were not intended for publication,&lt;ref name=P174 /&gt; and they appeared in print only in 1871, five years after the poet's death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512096/Friedrich-Ruckert&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahler selected five of Rückert's poems to set as [[Lied]]er, which he composed between 1901 and 1904. The songs are written in Mahler's [[Romantic music#Late Romantic Era (1850–1900)|late-romantic]] idiom, and like the texts reflect a mixture of feelings: anguish, fantasy resuscitation of the children, resignation. The final song ends in a major key and a mood of transcendence.

The cello melody in the postlude to "{{Lang|de|In diesem Wetter, in diesem Braus}}" ([[Bar (music)|mm.]] 129–133) alludes to the first subject of the finale of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 3]] (1895/96), a movement titled "What love tells me" ("{{Lang|de|Was mir die Liebe erzählt}}"). "Musically, then, this is the last word of the {{Lang|de|Kindertotenlieder}}: that death is powerful, yet love is even stronger."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, "{{Lang|de|Trost für die Untröstlichen. Mahlers Kindertotenlieder und Bergs Violinkonzert}}", in: ''Musikfreunde'' 25 (2012/13), no. 5, pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and premiere==
Hefling indicates that Mahler composed the first, third, and fourth songs in 1901 (he played them for his friend [[Natalie Bauer-Lechner]] on 10 August). There followed a long break, and the remaining songs were composed in the summer of 1904.

The work was premiered in Vienna on 29 January 1905. [[Friedrich Weidemann]], a leading baritone at the [[Vienna Court Opera]], was the soloist, and the composer conducted. The hall was selected as a relatively small one, compatible with the intimacy of the lied genre, and the orchestra was a chamber orchestra consisting of players drawn from the [[Vienna Philharmonic]].&lt;ref name="Tunbridge 2010:77"&gt;Tunbridge (2010:77)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scoring and performance ==
The work is scored for a vocal soloist (the notes lie comfortably for a [[baritone]] or [[mezzo-soprano]]) and an orchestra consisting of [[piccolo]], 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]], 2 [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]] (English horn), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horn]]s, [[timpani]], [[glockenspiel]], [[tam-tam]], [[celesta]], [[harp]], and [[string section|strings]]. There are no trumpets. Deployed at chamber-orchestra scale, this instrumentation permitted Mahler to explore a wide variety of timbres within a smaller-scale sound; Tunbridge sees this as a new precedent adopted by later composers; for instance [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] in ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]''.&lt;ref name="Tunbridge 2010:77"/&gt;

Concerning the performance of the work, the composer wrote "these five songs are intended as one inseparate unit, and in performing them their continuity should not be interfered with".&lt;ref&gt;This instruction is reproduced on page 3 of the piano score (IMC, New York, c.1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work takes about 25 minutes to perform.

==The ''Kindertotenlieder'' and Mahler's life history==
At the time he wrote the work Mahler was no stranger to the deaths of children. Hefling writes, "Such tragedy was familiar to Mahler, eight of his siblings died during their childhood. Among all of them, the death of his closest younger brother Ernst in 1874 had affected him most deeply, and he confided to [his friend] Natalie [Bauer-Lechner] that "such frightful sorrow he had never again experienced, as great a loss he had nevermore borne."&lt;ref&gt;Hefling (2009:218)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, when Mahler resumed the composition of the interrupted work (see above), it was only two weeks after the birth of his own second child, upsetting his wife [[Alma Mahler|Alma]], who "found it incomprehensible and feared Mahler was tempting Providence."&lt;ref&gt;Hefling (2009:318-319) Hefling also discusses the possibility that the timing of Mahler's resumption of work was not accidental: "Birth and death had been closely paired for Mahler since his infancy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Alma's fears proved all too prescient, as four years after the work had been completed the Mahlers' daughter Maria, aged four, died of scarlet fever. Mahler wrote to [[Guido Adler]]: "I placed myself in the situation that a child of mine had died. When I really lost my daughter, I could not have written these songs any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Haunting Melody: Psychoanalytic Experiences in Life and Music|last=Reik|first=Theodor|authorlink=Theodor Reik|year=1953|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Young|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-76138-6|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Nun will die Sonn' so hell aufgeh'n'''" ([[D minor]])
:Nun will die Sonn' so hell aufgeh'n
:als sei kein Unglück die Nacht gescheh'n.
:Das Unglück geschah nur mir allein.
:Die Sonne, sie scheinet allgemein.

:Du mußt nicht die Nacht in dir verschränken
:mußt sie ins ew'ge Licht versenken.
:Ein Lämplein verlosch in meinem Zelt,
:Heil sei dem Freudenlicht der Welt.

"'''Nun seh' ich wohl, warum so dunkle Flammen'''" ([[C minor]])
:Nun seh' ich wohl, warum so dunkle Flammen
:ihr sprühtet mir in manchem Augenblicke.
:O Augen, gleichsam, um in einem Blicke
:zu drängen eure ganze Macht zusammen.

:Doch ahnt' ich nicht, weil Nebel mich umschwammen,
:gewoben vom verblendenden Geschicke,
:daß sich der Strahl bereits zur Heimkehr schicke,
:dorthin, von wannen alle Strahlen stammen.

:Ihr wolltet mir mit eurem Leuchten sagen:
:Wir möchten nah dir immer bleiben gerne!
:Doch ist uns das vom Schicksal abgeschlagen.

:Sieh' recht uns an, denn bald sind wir dir ferne!
:Was dir noch Augen sind in diesen Tagen:
:In künft'gen Nächten sind es dir nur Sterne.

"'''Wenn dein Mütterlein'''" ([[C minor]])
:Wenn dein Mütterlein
:tritt zur Tür herein,
:und den Kopf ich drehe,
:ihr entgegen sehe,
:fällt auf ihr Gesicht
:erst der Blick mir nicht,
:sondern auf die Stelle,
:näher nach der Schwelle,
:dort, wo würde dein
:lieb Gesichtchen sein.
:Wenn du freudenhelle
:trätest mit herein,
:wie sonst, mein Töchterlein.

:Wenn dein Mütterlein
:tritt zur Tür herein,
:mit der Kerze Schimmer,
:ist es mir, als immer
:kämst du mit herein,
:huschtest hinterdrein,
:als wie sonst ins Zimmer!
:O du, des Vaters Zelle,
:ach, zu schnell
:erlosch'ner Freudenschein!

"'''Oft denk' ich, sie sind nur ausgegangen'''" ([[E-flat major]])
:Oft denk' ich, sie sind nur ausgegangen,
:bald werden sie wieder nach Hause gelangen.
:Der Tag ist schön, o sei nicht bang,
:sie machen nur einen weiten Gang.

:Ja wohl, sie sind nur ausgegangen,
:und werden jetzt nach Hause gelangen.
:O, sei nicht bang, der Tag ist schön,
:sie machen einen Gang zu jenen Höh'n.

:Sie sind uns nur voraus gegangen,
:und werden nicht wieder nach Hause verlangen.
:Wir holen sie ein auf jenen Höh'n
:im Sonnenschein, der Tag ist schön,
:auf jenen Höh'n

"'''In diesem Wetter'''" ([[D minor]]–[[D major]])
:In diesem Wetter, in diesem Braus,
:nie hätt' ich gesendet die Kinder hinaus;
:man hat sie getragen hinaus,
:ich durfte nichts dazu sagen!

:In diesem Wetter, in diesem Saus,
:nie hätt' ich gelassen die Kinder hinaus;
:ich fürchtete sie erkranken,
:das sind nun eitle Gedanken.

:In diesem Wetter, in diesem Graus,
:Nie hätt' ich gelassen die Kinder hinaus;
:ich sorgte, sie stürben morgen,
:das ist nun nicht zu besorgen.

:In diesem Wetter, in diesem Graus!
:Nie hätt' ich gesendet die Kinder hinaus!
:Man hat sie hinaus getragen,
:ich durfte nichts dazu sagen!

:In diesem Wetter, in diesem Saus, in diesem Braus,
:sie ruh'n als wie in der Mutter Haus,
:von keinem Sturm erschrecket,
:von Gottes Hand bedecket.

"'''Now the sun wants to rise as brightly'''"
:Now the sun wants to rise as brightly
:as if nothing terrible had happened during the night.
:The misfortune had happened only to me,
:but the sun shines equally on everyone.

:You must not enfold the night in you.
:You must sink it in eternal light.
:A little star went out in my tent!
:Greetings to the joyful light of the world.

"'''Now I see well, why with such dark flames'''"
:Now I see well, why with such dark flames
:in many glances you flash upon me
:O Eyes: as if in one look
:to draw all your strength together.

:I didn't realise, because a mist surrounded me
:woven of tangled destinies
:that your beam was already returning homewards to the place
:from which all rays emanate.

:You would tell me with your brightness:
:We would gladly stay with you!
:Now that is denied to us by Fate.

:Look at us, soon we will be far away!
:What are only eyes to you in these days,
:in the coming night shall be your stars.

"'''When your mama'''"
:When your mama
:steps in through the door
:and I turn my head
:to see at her,
:on her face
:my gaze does not first fall,
:but at the place
:nearer the doorstep,
:there, where your
:dear little face would be,
:when you with bright joy
:step inside,
:as you used to, my little daughter.

:When your mama
:steps in through the door
:with the glowing candle,
:it seems to me, as if you always
:came in with her too,
:hurrying behind her,
:as you used to come into the room.
:Oh you, of a father's cell,
:ah, too soon
:extinguished joyful light!

"'''I often think: they have only just gone out'''"
:I often think: they have only just gone out,
:and now they will be coming back home.
:The day is fine, don't be dismayed,
:They have just gone for a long walk.

:Yes indeed, they have just gone out,
:and now they are making their way home.
:Don't be dismayed, the day is fine,
:they have simply made a journey to yonder heights.

:They have just gone out ahead of us,
:and will not be thinking of coming home.
:We go to meet them on yonder heights
:In the sunlight, the day is fine
:On yonder heights.

"'''In this weather'''"
:In this weather, in this windy storm,
:I would never have sent the children out.
:They have been carried off,
:I wasn't able to warn them!

:In this weather, in this gale,
:I would never have let the children out.
:I feared they sickened:
:those thoughts are now in vain.

:In this weather, in this storm,
:I would never have let the children out,
:I was anxious they might die the next day:
:now anxiety is pointless.

:In this weather, in this windy storm,
:I would never have sent the children out.
:They have been carried off,
:I wasn't able to warn them!

:In this weather, in this gale, in this windy storm,
:they rest as if in their mother's house:
:frightened by no storm,
:sheltered by the Hand of God.

The '''Lainzer Tiergarten''' is a 24.50 km² (6,054-[[acre]])&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/lage.htm Location and size description on the Lainzer Tiergarten's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706124041/http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/lage.htm |date=2006-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wildlife preserve]] in the southwest corner of [[Vienna, Austria]], 80% of it being covered in [[woodland]]. It dates back to 1561, when [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] created it as a fenced-in hunting ground for his family to use. Since 1919, it has been open to the public. Its name consists of its location by the [[Lainz]] district of Vienna's [[Hietzing|13th District]], and ''Tiergarten'', which means zoo (literally, "animal garden").

==Location==

The Lainzer Tiergarten is located mostly in Vienna's [[Hietzing|13th district]], with a small adjacent portion lying in [[Laab im Walde]], [[Lower Austria]]. The [[Wien River]] is located to its north, the [[Liesingbach]] to its south.

==History==

Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] created the Lainzer Tiergarten in 1561. He had wooden fence built to enclose an area that he could use as a private hunting preserve. In 1781, a stone wall replaced the wooden fence. After the fall of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the Austrian government declared the grounds a public nature preserve, though between 1940 and 1955, the entire grounds were closed to the public. Until 1973 access to the preserve required the payment of an admission fee. Since then admission is free.

A large portion of the Lainzer Tiergarten was lost after [[World War I]], when the ''Friedenstadt'' ("Peace City") neighborhood was constructed in its eastern portion. The old wall can still be seen in the ''Hörndlwald'' woods east of the Lainzer Tor.

Due to construction of the [[Westautobahn]] in the 1960s, a corner in the northwest of the preserve was also lost. This time there was compensation, however, as a portion of the ''Laaber Wald'', adjacent to the southwest corner, was annexed.

==Wildlife==

Today the Lainzer Tiergarten is home to between 800 and 1,000 [[wild boar]], 200 to 250 [[fallow deer]], approximately 700 [[mouflon]]s, and 80 to 100 [[red deer]] (elk).&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/ltwild.htm Wildlife information on the Lainzer Tiergarten's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706124509/http://www.wien.gv.at/wald/lainz-tg/ltwild.htm |date=2006-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gates==
[[Image:LainzerTiergarten2.jpg|thumb|This view of Vienna from the preserve shows the wall in the bottom foreground.]]

The preserve is surrounded by approximately {{convert|22|km|mi|sp=us}} of wall. There are seven gates, with different operating hours. Clockwise these are:

* Lainzer Tor (main gate)
* Gütenbachtor
* Laaber Tor
* Pulverstampftor
* Nikolaitor
* Sankt Veiter Tor

The entire preserve is open for approximately nine months of the year, from early March to early November. In the remaining months only the park around the Hermesvilla, accessible from the Lainzer Tor, is open. Between Christmas and the New Year, the entire park opens, but is only accessible from the Lainzer Tor and Nikolaitor.

===Lainzer Tor===
[[Image:Lainzer Tor.jpg|thumb|The Lainzer Tor]]
[[Image:LainzerTorTransitAccess.png|thumb|Public transportation access to the Lainzer Tor]]
As it is open year-round, and is home to a visitor center, the Lainzer Tor is the preserve's main gate. It is also the origin and the terminus of a {{convert|2.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} walk to the Hermesvilla, which can often also be ridden via horse carriage. Public restrooms are also located near the gate, as is a water fountain. This is also one of two gates that has a parking lot.

The Lainzer Tor is located at the end of Hermesstraße, and is reachable using the 55A bus, which connects the gate to the 60 and 62 trams line at 15- to 20-minute intervals. These tram lines can be taken from the stop Speising, Hermesstraße, and connect to multiple [[Vienna U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] and [[Vienna S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] lines. Line 62 can also be taken directly from the [[Vienna Staatsoper]] to Hermesstraße.

===Gütenbachtor===
The Gütenbachtor is located on Gütenbachstraße, and accesses the southeastern corner of the Lainzer Tiergarten. It also features a water fountain and a parking lot, but is a 45-minute walk from the nearest public transportation, regional bus lines 253 and 354.

===Laaber Tor===
The Laaber Tor is located by the [[Lower Austria]]n town of [[Laab am Walde]]. It accesses a separate corner of the Lainzer Tiergarten that was added in the 1960s as a compensation for territory that was lost in the north of the preserve when a highway was built. Visitors using this gate will pass the Dianator, which was the gate in this corner before the annexation of additional land. The Laaber Tor also has a water fountain.

Similar to the Gütenbachtor, the only public transportation within reach is the regional bus line 253, which is a 15-minute walk from this gate.

===Pulverstampftor===
The Pulverstampftor is located in the northwest corner of the preserve, near the [[Auhof]] neighborhood of Vienna's [[Penzing (Vienna)|14th district]]. It features a water fountain, and can be accessed from the ''Umspannwerk Auhof'' stop of the regional bus line 50B from [[Hütteldorf]] (five-minute walk).

===Nikolaitor===
Due to its location near the [[Hütteldorf]] railway station, the Nikolaitor is an important gate of the Lainzer Tiergarten. Hütteldorf can be accessed with the U-Bahn U4, S-Bahn S45, S50 and S60, tram line 49, as well as multiple bus lines. From the station it is a 10-minute walk across the [[Wien River]] to Nikolaigasse. This gate also features a water fountain.

===Adolfstor===
The Adolfstor was located along the eastern wall of the Lainzer Tiergarten. It is now closed.

===Sankt Veiter Tor===
The Sankt Veiter Tor is directly accessible using a special hourly-served branch of the 54A bus line from the Ober Sankt Veit [[Vienna U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station. Higher-frequented bus lines to Ober St. Veit and the terminus of the 62 tram line, Lainz Wolkersbergenstraße, are available by walking down Hanschweg to Stock im Weg.

==Locations in the preserve==
[[Image:Hubertuswarte.JPG|thumb|200px|The Hubertuswarte]]
[[Image:LainzerTiergarten4.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the visit of the Japanese Imperial Couple in 2002]]

There are three restaurants, two scenic viewpoints, and one museum located within the Lainzer Tiergarten.

===Hermesvilla and park===
[[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] commissioned the construction of the [[Hermesvilla]], which was completed in 1886, and served as a getaway mansion for his [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|wife]]. Today it serves as a museum and also contains a restaurant and café, which is highly frequented due to its close location to the Lainzer Tor. The property around the Hermesvilla is a special area of the Lainzer Tiergarten, fenced off from the rest of the preserve. Separate gates on the paths leading deeper into the park allow access to the larger section when this is open.

===Hirschgstemm and Rohrhaus===
Besides the Hermesvilla, visitors to the Lainzer Tiergarten can also eat and drink at the Hirschgstemm and Rohrhaus restaurants. These are located deeper in the reserve than the Hermesvilla, but also have full menus.

===Hubertuswarte===
The Hubertuswarte is an [[observation tower]], built in 1927, and located on the Kaltbründel Berg, the highest point in the preserve (508 meters/1667 ft). From the top of the tower, visitors have a 360-degree view of the region, including Vienna and neighboring villages.

===Wiener Blick===
Closer to the city side of the Lainzer Tiergarten, the Wiener Blick offers a view of the city from 434&amp;nbsp;m (1424&amp;nbsp;ft). In July 2002, this observation point was visited by the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Akihito]] and his wife [[Empress Michiko of Japan|Michiko]].

The following is a '''list of conservation organizations''' associated with the professional field of [[conservation-restoration]].

Professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider conservation field, and within their area of specialization.

These organizations exist to "support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/aboutaic About AIC]&lt;/ref&gt; This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among conservators, allied professionals, and the public.

'''Brief History of Chamber of Restorers, Slovak Republic'''

The Chamber of Restorers was established on September 1, 1994 by the Law of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No. 200/1994 Collection of Law about the Chamber of Restorers and the Execution of the Restoration Activity of its Members, as a so-called professional chamber with compulsory membership, which has the task to gather physical persons executing the profession “restorer” in the area of the Slovak Republic. The seat of the Chamber of Restorers is in the capital of the Slovak Republic, Bratislava and it operates within the whole area of the Slovak Republic.

The essential mission of the Chamber of Restorers is to act as public authority in two main areas.

* The first area is the authority of the chamber to decide about the ability to execute the liberal profession “restorer” in the relevant specialisation of restoration and for that purpose to keep the list of its members. The chamber in this area of its activity has the position of public authority which decides about which natural person in which specialisation of restoration will carry out business activities in the area of the Slovak Republic in the field of restoration activity on national cultural heritage and collection items of works of art.
* The second area is the realisation of the chamber’s law duty to continuously monitor that its members carry out their profession in accordance with the professional, expert and ethical principles and rules which are related to the execution of the liberal profession “restorer”.

For this purpose the law entrusted the chamber on one side with the authority to issue internal (corporative/professional) rules which are legally binding for its members and on the other side it accredited the chamber with disciplinary authority over its members, which manifests in the chamber’s right to impose disciplinary measures on its members (written warning, monetary fine, or deletion from the list of the members of the chamber) in cases when they have committed misconduct fulfilling the features of disciplinary offence.

Besides these two areas in which the Chamber of Restorers as the authority of the so-called interest self-government fulfils tasks in the field of public administration from the position of its executor, its duty is also to promote and protect the rights of the professional, social and economic interests of its members, as well as to protect the professional honor of its members.

The task of the Chamber of Restorers is also to cooperate with the providers of the university level education with restoration specialisation in the area of the Slovak Republic and to propose measures leading to improvement of the quality of the education in this field and the preparation for the profession restorer.

The Chamber of Restorers in the interest of providing the highest possible protection and the widest accessibility of the cultural heritage to the public cooperates with the government bodies, local self-government with the domestic and foreign partner professional chambers and professional associations acting in the field of restoration activity and activities related to the restoration activity. As a result of its long-term activity in the area of cooperation also on the European level the Chamber of Restorers in the year 2005 became a full member of the European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers´ Organisations – E.C.C.O. which acts as an international body gathering professional organisations from the member states of the European Union and the EEA which is also a permanent specialised partner of the European Commission and the Council of Europe in the area of the protection and restoration of European objects of cultural heritage.

Egypt is also well known for its vast library collections, for the great part in public institutions such as the National Library Dar El Kutub, university libraries, museums etc. Public and private collections of antique photographs and books in Egypt are in a state of rapid deterioration due to environmental factors.
In order to address these issues, Catania University and Helwan University, in cooperation with Egyptian-Italian Center for the Conservation of Antique Photographs and Paper Heritage (acronym EICAP), propose a master in Conservation of Antique Photographs and Paper Heritage.

'''Literary descriptions of cities''' (also known as '''urban ''descriptiones''''') form a [[literary genre]] that originated in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[epideictic]] [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m2881&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |title=Medieval descriptions of cities |author=[[Kenneth Hyde|JK Hyde]] |journal=[[Bulletin of the John Rylands Library]] |year=1966 |volume=48 |pages=308–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fulton&gt;{{citation |jstor=40732051 |title=The Encomium Urbis in Medieval Welsh Poetry |author=Helen Fulton |journal=Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium |volume=26/27 |pages=54–72 |year=2006–2007 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benson /&gt; They can be prose or poetry. Many take the form of an '''urban eulogy''' (variously referred to as an '''''encomium urbis''''', '''''laudes urbium''''', '''''encomium civis''''', '''''laus civis''''', '''''laudes civitatum'''''; or in English: '''urban''' or '''city encomium''', '''panegyric''', '''laudation''' or '''praise poem''') which praise their subject.&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faulkner_2011 /&gt; Laments to a city's past glories are sometimes also included in the genre.&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benson /&gt; ''Descriptiones'' often mix [[topography|topographical]] information with abstract material on the spiritual and legal aspects of the town or city, and with social observations on its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benson /&gt; They generally give a more extended treatment of their urban subject than is found in an encyclopedia or general geographical work. Influential examples include Benedict's ''[[Mirabilia Urbis Romae]]'' of around 1143.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;

The Greek rhetorician [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], in the first century AD, was the first to prescribe the form of a [[eulogy]] to a city in detail. Features he touches on include the city's location, size and beauty; the qualities of its river; its [[temple]]s and [[secular]] buildings; its origin and founder, and the acts of its citizens.&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rhetorician [[Quintilian]] expounds on the form later in the first century, stressing praise of the city's founder and prominent citizens, as well as the city's site and location, fortifications and public works such as temples.&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faulkner_2011 /&gt; The third-century rhetorician [[Menander Rhetor|Menander]] expands on the guidelines further, including advice on how to turn a city's bad points into advantages.&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt; These works were probably not directly available to medieval writers,&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; but the form is outlined in many later grammar primers, including those by [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]] and [[Priscian]].&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faulkner_2011&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycQmDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT93 |author= Mark Faulkner |chapter=The Spatial Hermeneutics of Lucian's ''De Laude Cestrie'' |title=Mapping the Medieval City: Space, Place and Identity in Chester, c. 1200–1600 |editor=Catherine AM Clarke (ed.) |year=2011 |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=1783164611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priscian's ''Praeexercitamina'', a translation into [[Latin]] of a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] work by [[Hermogenes of Tarsus|Hermogenes]], was a particular influence on [[medieval]] authors.&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;

Surviving late Roman examples of ''descriptiones'' include [[Ausonius]]'s ''[[Ordo urbium nobilium|Ordo Nobilium Urbium]]'', a fourth-century Latin poem that briefly describes thirteen cities including [[Milan]] and [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt; [[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus|Rutilius Namatianus]]'s ''De reditu suo'' is a longer poem dating from the early fifth century that includes a section praising [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;

Numerous medieval examples have survived, mainly but not exclusively in Latin, the earliest dating from the eighth century.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt; They adapt the classical form to [[Christianity|Christian]] theology.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faulkner_2011 /&gt; The form was popularised by widely circulated guidebooks intended for [[pilgrim]]s.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; Common topics include the [[defensive wall|city walls]] and gates, markets, churches and local [[saint]]s; ''descriptiones'' were sometimes written as a preface to the biography of a saint.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; The earliest examples are in verse. The first known prose example was written in around the tenth century, and later medieval examples were more often written in prose.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; Milan and Rome are the most frequent subjects, and there are also examples describing many other Italian cities.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; Outside Italy, pre-1400 examples are known for [[Chester]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[London]], [[York]] and perhaps [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in England,&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlauch&gt;{{citation |jstor=27704714 |author=[[Margaret Schlauch]] |title=An Old English "Encomium Urbis" |journal=[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]] |year=1941 |volume=40 |pages=14–28 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abram /&gt; [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] in Wales,&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt; and [[Angers]], [[Paris]] and [[Senlis]] in France.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gransden /&gt;  The form spread to Germany in the first half of the 15th century, with [[Nuremberg]] being the most commonly described city.&lt;ref name=Blamires_1990 /&gt;

[[Kenneth Hyde|J. K. Hyde]], who surveyed the genre in 1966, considers the evolution of ''descriptiones'' written before 1400 to reflect "the growth of cities and the rising culture and self-confidence of the citizens", rather than any literary progression.&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; Later medieval examples tend to be more detailed and less generic than early ones, and to place an increasing emphasis on secular over religious aspects. For example, [[Bonvesin da la Riva|Bonvesin della Riva]]'s 1288 description of Milan, ''De Magnalibus Urbis Mediolani'', contains a wealth of detailed facts and statistics about such matters as local crops. These trends were continued in [[Renaissance]] ''descriptiones'', which flourished from the early years of the 15th century,&lt;ref name=Hyde_1966 /&gt; especially after the popularisation of the [[printing press]] from the middle of that century.&lt;ref name=Blamires_1990&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m2246&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |title=The portrayal of towns in sixteenth-century German ''Volksbŭcher'' |author=David Blamires |journal=[[Bulletin of the John Rylands Library]] |volume=72 |year=1990 |pages=49–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to find [[minced oath]]s in literature and media. Writers often include minced oaths instead of [[profanity]] in their writing so that they do not offend audiences or incur [[censorship]].

==Novels==

[[W. Somerset Maugham]] referred to this problem in his 1919 novel ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'', where he admitted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strickland, according to Captain Nichols, did not use exactly the words I have given, but since this book is meant for family reading, I thought it better—at the expense of truth—to put into his mouth language familiar to the domestic circle.&lt;ref name="moon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Maugham |first=W. Somerset |authorlink=W. Somerset Maugham |title=The Moon and Sixpence|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|year=1919|chapter=chapter 47 |isbn=978-0-486-44602-8|oclc=22207227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Geoffrey |title=Swearing: A Social History of Foul Language, Oaths and Profanity in English |publisher=Blackwell |year=1991 |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-631-16593-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|187}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In particular, authors of children's fiction sometimes put minced oaths into the mouths of characters who swear a lot, as a way of depicting a part of their behaviour that would be unconvincing not to represent, but also avoiding the use of swear words which would be considered unsuitable for children to read.

In 1851, [[Charles Dickens]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bark's parts of speech are of an awful sort—principally adjectives. I won't, says Bark, have no adjective police and adjective strangers in my adjective premises! I won't, by adjective and substantive! ... Give me, says Bark, my adjective trousers!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charles |first=Dickens |authorlink=Charles Dickens |year=1851 |title=On Duty with Inspector Field |journal=Household Words |pages=151–52 |url=http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/dickens/pieces.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manis |first=Jim |year=1999 |title=Reprinted Pieces by Charles Dickens |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |location=Hazleton, Pa |series=Penn State series on Dickens |pages=150 |url=http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/dickens/pieces.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''dickens'' itself, probably from the surname, became a minced oath when referring to the devil.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

[[Norman Mailer]]'s novel ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''&lt;ref name="NM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mailer |first=Norman |title=The Naked and the Dead |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=1948 |edition=50 |pages=736 |isbn=978-0-312-26505-2 |url=http://www.enotes.com/naked-dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses "fug" in place of "fuck" throughout.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/remembering-mailer-the-high-heat-and-the-roiling-simmer/ |title=Remembering Mailer: The High Heat and the Roiling Simmer |last=Garner |first=Dwight |date=2007-11-12 |work=Paper Cuts |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanlegends.com/authors/norman_mailer.html |title=Norman Mailer: Autocrat of the Remainder Table |last=Martinetti |first=Ron |date=November 2007 |work=American Legends |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1568933/Norman-Mailer-The-streetwise-literary-master.html |title=Norman Mailer: The streetwise literary master |date=2007-10-10 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mystery writer Fran Rizer deploys "kindergarten cussin'" in her [[Callie Parrish]] series, where the main character can be heard muttering, "[[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]!" and "[[Shih Tzu]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rizer |first=Fran |title=Casket Case |publisher=Berkley Penguin |year=2008|series=Callie Parrish |volume=3 |isbn=978-0-425-22428-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' series, characters use oaths such as "flaming" or "blood and ashes" or the interjection "light" in the same strength as a curse word, without having to print swear words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staveley |first1=Brian |title=OF LUMMOXES AND DICKHEADS: CURSING IN FANTASY |url=https://bstaveley.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/cursinginfantas/ |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Fiction writer [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in novels such as ''[[The Shockwave Rider]]'' and ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'', uses '[[Shiv (weapon)|Shiv]]' and '[[Pudendal cleft|slit]]' to refer to male and female body parts (and sometimes males and females) respectively.

The lead characters of [[Anthony Crowley]] (a demon) and [[Aziraphale]] (an angel) from ''[[Good Omens]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Neil Gaiman]], both use minced oaths on a number of occasions, though for different reasons (Aziraphale genuinely means to avoid offense, while Crowley, being a demon, simply finds it more acceptable to his post to say 'gosh' instead of 'God').

In [[Stephen King]]'s 2006 novel ''[[Lisey's Story]]'', the main characters, Lisey and Scott Landon, use the word ''smuck'' instead of ''fuck'', replacing it wherever ''fuck'' would be conceivably used: ''smucking, mothersmucker, smucked up'', etc.

In the ''[[Gaunt's Ghosts]]'' series by [[Dan Abnett]], the Imperial Guardsmen use the word ''feth'' as a general all-purpose swear word, primarily to replace the word ''fuck''.

In the series ''TZA'', John Spencer uses ''spash'' in place of most curses from the second book forth.

Throughout his comic novel ''[[Myron]]'', [[Gore Vidal]] replaces various obscenities with the names of judges who were involved in an obscenity trial.

In the ''[[Codex Alera]]'' series, by Jim Butcher, most obscenities are replaced with a variation of the word crow, e.g. crows or crowbegotten.

[[Terry Pratchett]] uses minced oaths for comic effect, for example in [[Mort]]: ''"A wizard. I hate ----ing wizards." "Well, you shouldn't ---- them then," replied the second, effortlessly pronouncing a row of dashes.''  In a later book, [[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]], the character [[Discworld characters#Mr Tulip|Mr Tulip]] habitually and persistently uses a similarly diagetic form of pseudo-profane interjection throughout his dialogue.

In [[Stephen King]]'s 2009 novel ''[[Under the Dome (novel)|Under the Dome]]'', the character 'Big Jim' Rennie avoids swearing by replacing words such as ''fucking and clusterfuck'' with ''cottonpicking and clustermug''.

Ernest Hemingway substituted muck for that with which it rhymes in 'Across the River and into the Trees ' and fornicate for that with which it doesn't rhyme in 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.' It makes for some awkward constructions in the latter.

[[Spider Robinson]], in his science fiction novels, consistently uses "kark" in place of "fuck", and "taken slot" in place of "fucking slut" -- "slot" perhaps being also a reference to the female anatomy as receptacle.

[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]] features the minced oaths of "mouse-dung" and rarely "fox-dung," and others relevant to the forest are used in place of curses.

==Comic books==
In the [[Judge Dredd]] comic strip featured in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'', the futuristic justice department approved the terms ''Stomm'', ''Drokk'', and ''Grud''. This last is a clear reference to the Christian God as it is accompanied by the apparatus of an organized religion, including "Church of Grud" and similar. Use of the terms includes the colorful "Grud on a Greenie!".&lt;ref name="E2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everything2.com/node/497833 |title=Swear words from science fiction |last=Saunders |first=Suzanne (Segnbora-t)|date=2000-04-15 |work=[[Everything2]] |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1979, ''2000 AD'' also featured a ''[[Dan Dare#2000 AD|Dan Dare]]'' comic strip, loosely set in the same continuity as ''Judge Dredd'', and these strips too used such parlance as ''Stomm'' and ''Drokk''.

In comic series ''[[Johnny the Homicidal Maniac]]'', the characters sometimes use the word ''fook'' in place of ''fuck''.

The DC Comics character [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], an invulnerable, intergalactic bounty hunter uses the term ''bastich'' or ''bastiches'' as a combination of bastard and bitch. i.e. "Take that you lousy bastiches!"

[[Captain Haddock]], from ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', swears unlike a real sailor with sesquipedalian ejaculations like "billions of blistering blue barnacles" and "thundering typhoons".&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=9734 |title=Billions of Blistering Blue Barnicles! |last=Lopresti |first=Rob |date=2009-11-11 |work=Criminal Brief |accessdate=2009-11-13 |location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==

In the [[Al Pacino]] epic ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', the title character [[Tony Montana]], played by Pacino, is warned by his Colombian accomplice in the censored version of the film, "Don't fool with me, Tony", and "I warned you not to fool with me, you foolish little monkey". Otherwise, the film, especially in its uncensored version, is filled with use of the word 'fuck', and the censored TV version replaces these in their dozens with 'fool'.

''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'', in the film of the same name, which is rated PG, uses minced oaths to a particularly comical effect.

In the 1945 [[war film]] ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]'', the screenplay substitutes "loving" for "fucking" (the universal American soldier's descriptor).

In ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', the character Ralphie is punished by his parents for saying "Oh, fuck," although the offensive word is replaced with "fudge" in the film.  The narrator, an adult version of Ralphie (voiced by [[Jean Shepherd]]), explains that "I didn't say fudge.  I said THE word...the queen mother of dirty words: the F-dash-dash-dash word."

In the 1984 film ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]'', the character Roman Maronie is known for butchering the English language, especially English vulgarities:
:* You ''fargin' '' sneaky ''bastages''! (You fucking sneaky bastards!)
:* Don't ''bullshtein'' me! (Don't bullshit me!)
:* You lousy ''corksuckers''. (You lousy cocksuckers.)
:* Dirty ''summina-batches''. (Dirty sons-of-bitches.)
:* I'm gonna shove 'em up your ''icehole''. (I'm gonna shove 'em up your asshole.)

One of the more infamous TV edits is that of John McClane's iconic line from ''[[Die Hard]]'', "Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker" is changed to "Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Falcon".

The TV edit of the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', instead of having the police lineup say, "Give me the keys, you fucking cocksucker", they say "Give me the keys, you fairy godmother".

In the 1998 film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', a well-known television edit exists of one profane-heavy scene altered. "See what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass" is changed to "See what happens when you find a stranger in the alps" and "this is what happens when you feed a stoner scrambled eggs".

A television edit of the film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' contains the injunction "Flip you, melon farmer!" (Fuck you, motherfucker!)

A censored version of the 2004 film [[Shaun of the Dead]] contains a scene where "fuck" and "prick" are changed to "funk" and "prink", respectively. This leads to an exchange of minced oaths beginning, "it's four in the funking morning!" and ending with "it's not hip-hop, it's electro. Prink".

In Disney's 2016 animated film ''[[Zootopia]]'', Officer Judy Hopps uses the minced oath "Oh sweet cheese and crackers".
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
The televised version of the 2006 film ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' received the following edits to two of Samuel L. Jackson's lines: The line "I've had with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane" was changed to "I've had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane", and a later use of "fucking" is replaced with "freaking".

==Drama==

Late [[Elizabethan]] drama contains a profusion of minced oaths, probably due to [[Puritan]] opposition to swearing. Seven new minced oaths are first recorded between 1598 and 1602, including ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'sblood&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''By God's blood'' from [[Shakespeare]], ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'slight&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''God's light'' from [[Ben Jonson]], and ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'snails&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for ''By God's nails'' from the historian John Hayward.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford |year=1989|edition=2|isbn=978-0-19-861186-8|url=http://www.oed.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swearing on stage was officially banned by the [[Act to Restrain Abuses of Players|Act to Restraine Abuses of Players]] in 1606, and a general ban on swearing followed in 1623.

In some cases the original meanings of these minced oaths were forgotten; ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'struth&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (''By God's truth'') came to be spelled ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'strewth&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''zounds'' changed pronunciation so that it no longer sounded like ''By God's wounds''.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;{{rp|103–105}} Other examples from this period include ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'slid&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' for "By God's eyelid" (1598) and ''sfoot'' for "By God's foot" (1602). ''Gadzooks'' for "by God's hooks" (the [[nail (relic)|nails]] on [[Christian cross|Christ's cross]]) followed in the 1650s, ''egad'' for ''oh God'' in the late 17th century,&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|date=August 2006|edition=4|isbn=978-0-618-70172-8|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCD"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laird|first=Charlton Grant|title=Webster's New World College Dictionary |editors=Guralnik, David, Agnes |publisher=Wiley, John &amp; Sons|location=Cleveland|date=April 2004|edition=4|isbn=978-0-7645-7125-1|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ods bodikins'' for "by God's little body" in 1709.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;{{rp|13}} This is similar to the use popularized in the 1950s of ''gee whiz'' as an oath for ''Jesus' wisdom''.&lt;ref name="AHD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WCD" /&gt;

In modern times, the gang members in the musical ''[[West Side Story]]'' talk in an invented 1950s-style slang that includes several minced oaths. At the end of the "Jet Song," they sing "We're gonna beat / Every last buggin' gang / On the whole buggin' street / On the whole ever-mother-lovin' street!" where ''buggin'' and ''mother-lovin'' are obvious minced oaths.

==Television==

"Freaking" (or sometimes "fricking") is often employed on U.S. over-the-air television entertainment programming as an alternative to the adjective "fucking", as in "where's my freaking food?" It is rarely used to replace "fucking" as a term for sexual intercourse.

In the ''[[Father Ted]]'' episode "[[The Old Grey Whistle Theft]]", Ted's picnic at the local picnic area is disturbed by people claiming that he is in their "fupping spot". The man yells out "Fup off, ya grasshole" and when Ted asks them why they are talking like that, the man points to a list of picnic area rules, one of which is "No Swearing". The man finishes by yelling out "Fup off, ya pedrophile." In every single episode of ''Father Ted'' no Irish character utters the word "fuck", apart from one scene in "Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep" where the phrase "fucking hell" is shouted twice; although its attenuated alternative "[[feck]]" is heard repeatedly throughout.

In both incarnations of the television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', characters use the word "frack" ([[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original]]) or "frak" ([[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|re-imagined]]) in place of "fuck" in every sense of the word, as an interjection, as an alternative to the adjective "fucking", as in "where's my fracking food?" as well as "fuck" or "fucking" as a term for sexual intercourse. Characters in the original series also use "felgercarb" in place of "shit". Characters on ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' then adopted "frak" from ''Battlestar Galactica''.

In the TV series ''[[Farscape]]'' the characters use the word "frell" as a combination of "frig", "fuck", and "hell" (as in "What the frell is going on?"), and the word "dren" instead of "shit". "Hezmana" and "yotz" are also used as rough replacements for "hell" and "crap" respectively.

In the TV series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', characters often use the word "gorram" in place of "goddam" or "god damned." Further, the word "fuck" and its variants is replaced variously by "hump", "humped" or "rutting". For example, "I would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume I'm an evil, lecherous hump," "If they find us at all, we're humped." and "It's the chain I go get and beat you with 'til you understand who's in ruttin' command here." Additionally, the characters do much of their cursing in Mandarin Chinese. This keeps the show unobjectionable enough to air on network television, yet at the same time maintain a realistic level of profanity for a show about outlaws, inspired by the wild west.

Likewise, in ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', characters use a series of minced oaths regularly. Two such are used moderately, "Gimboid" and "goit" are derivations of "gimp" and "git" respectively (although "git" is frequently used also), but the final is a series trademark, "smeg". Although it is said to have derived from "smegma", the show's writers have said it is just a coincidence, as its similarity to the label of an Italian white-goods manufacturer. In any case, it has evolved into a word almost entirely specific to the Red Dwarf universe and numerous alterations were used in the show, such as: "smeg-head", "smeg-for-brains", "smegging", etc.

In ''[[South Park]]'' the word "[[fudge]]" (instead of "fuck") is frequently used, especially in the episode ''[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]'', where [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] sells chocolate fudge delicacies called "Fudge 'Ems", "Fudge This", "Go Fudge Yourself", "I Don't Give a Flying Fudge" and "I Just Went and Fudged Your Momma". "Lover" and "loving" are used in place of "fuck" through the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "Chickenlover". This is explained in the episode to be for the purpose of protecting young news viewers.

The television series ''[[A Bit of Fry and Laurie]]'' contains a sketch in which Fry and Laurie employ minced oaths; it is situated in a courthouse, and Laurie plays a policeman reciting the words of an offender. Examples include, "I apprehended the accused and advised him of his rights. He replied "Why don't you ram it up your pim-hole, you fusking cloff prunker."" and "Skank off, you cloffing cuck, you're all a load of shote-bag fuskers, so prunk that up your prime-ministering pim-hole." The sketch ends with Fry asking of Laurie's response to this language, and Laurie proclaiming, "I told him to mind his fucking language, m'lud."

In the Nickelodeon children's show ''[[iCarly]]'', characters often use the term "chizz" as a general purpose expletive, most often used in place of 'shit'.&amp;nbsp; ''iCarly'' is notorious for its thinly veiled adult humor.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, in the spinoff ''[[Sam &amp; Cat]]'', the term "wazz" is used in place of 'piss'.

Characters in the series ''[[The Good Place]]'' find themselves in an afterlife where they are incapable of using profanity. When they intend to curse, the word instead comes out as a benign minced oath such as "fork" for "fuck", "shirt" for "shit", or "bench" for "bitch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Erik |title=The rules of The Good Place were meant to be broken |url=https://www.avclub.com/the-rules-of-the-good-place-were-meant-to-be-broken-1822250773 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubbing of movies for television often replaces "Fuck you!" with "Forget you!", "bastard" with "buzzard", "fucking" with "stinking", and "prick" with "pig".

==Music==

[[The Fugs]], a mid-1960s band named by [[Tuli Kupferberg]], used a euphemism for "fuck" found in [[Norman Mailer]]'s novel ([[#Novels|above]]), ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="NM" /&gt;

==Internet==

In a discussion of profanity, writer Leigh Lundin uses the glyph [[ƒ]].&lt;ref name="CB0329"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=5931|title=WTF|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2009-03-29|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further discusses being "nannied" by Internet software, noting that words like cockatoo, pussycat, and even Hummer may be flagged,&lt;ref name="CB0729"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=137|title=Bad Words |chapter=Petting |last=Lundin|first=Leigh|date=2007-07-29|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has become known as the [[Scunthorpe problem]].

In that vein, [[ProBoards]] forums replace the word "cock" with "thingy", thereby transforming the statement "cock his shotgun" into "thingy his shotgun". Similarly, the [[Something Awful forums]], filters replace "fuck" with the phrase "gently caress" and "shit" with "poo-poo" for unregistered users, and the Fark website replaces words such as "fuck" with "fark".&lt;ref name="fark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/|title=Fark|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online, [[leet|alternative typographical glyphs]] are sometimes used to evade [[profanity filter]]s (such as $hit or $#!+ instead of [[shit]], @$$ or @rse instead of [[Buttocks|ass]] or [[Buttocks|arse]]).

"fsck", from "[[fsck|'''f'''ile'''s'''ystem '''c'''hec'''k''']]", is commonly used on Usenet and in other technology-related circles to replace "fuck".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2024">'''Non-narrative film''' is an aesthetic of cinematic film that does not narrate, or relate "an event, whether real or imaginary". The aesthetic is non-representational. 

[[Narrative film]] is the dominant aesthetic, though non-narrative film is not fully distinct from that aesthetic. While the non-narrative film avoids "certain traits" of the narrative film, it "still retains a number of narrative characteristics". Narrative film also occasionally uses "visual materials that are not representational".&lt;ref name=Aesthetics&gt;{{cite book | last1=Aumont | first1=Jacques | last2=Bergala | first2=Alain | last3=Marie | first3=Michel | last4=Vernet | first4=Marc | year=1992 | title=Aesthetics of Film | series=Texas Film and Media Studies | publisher=University of Texas Press | pages=70–71 | isbn=978-0-292-70437-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Film Experience'', non-narrative film is distinct from nonfiction film, though both forms may overlap in [[documentary film]]s. The book writes, "A non-narrative film may be entirely or partly fictional; conversely, a nonfiction film can be constructed as a narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Corrigan | first1=Timothy | last2=White | first2=Patricia | year=2012 | title=The Film Experience: An Introduction | publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's | page=264 | isbn=978-0-312-68170-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri Rousseau - Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henri Rousseau]], ''In a Tropical Forest Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo'', 1908-1909, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]

'''Primitivism''' is a mode of aesthetic idealization that either emulates or aspires to recreate "primitive" experience. In [[Western art]], primitivism typically has borrowed from non-Western or prehistoric people perceived to be "primitive", such as [[Paul Gauguin]]'s inclusion of [[Tahiti]]an motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from primitive art has been important to the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-388-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Marianna Torgovnick. ''Gone primitive: Savage intellects, Modern lives'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018) for an account of the different understandings and critiques of primitivism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "primitivism" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of [[Naïve art|naïve]] or [[folk art]] like [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]] and others.

== Philosophy ==
Primitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional "state of nature" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond "civilization" (cultural primitivism).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire of the "civilized" to be restored to a "state of nature" is as longstanding as civilization itself.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In antiquity the superiority of "primitive" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the [[Golden Age]], depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the [[Pastoral]]. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, “The Savage Critic: Some European Images of the Primitive,” ''The Yearbook of English Studies'', 13 (1983), 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]] (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than "civilized" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature.

In the 18th century, the German scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (''Prolegomena to Homer'', 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by [[Herder]].&lt;ref&gt;See Isaiah Berlin, ''Vico and Herder'' (New York: Viking, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Rubin]], "Modernist Primitivism, 1984," p. 320 in ''Primitivism: Twentieth Century Art, A Documentary History'', Jack Flam and Miriam Deutch, editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of [[historicism]], or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. [[Neoclassicism]] in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such "historicist" movement in art was the [[Nazarene movement]] in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian "primitive" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting).

Where conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of [[John Ruskin]], who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of.

Two developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref&gt;See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art'' (Princeton University Press, 19810).&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in [[École des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts]] Schools of [[Academic painting]], which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance perspective painting]] as the culmination of civilization and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|title=Ecole des Beaux-Arts|first=|last=Natasha|date=|website=www.jssgallery.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106041532/http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art.

In rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to [[Japanese art|Japanese]] and [[Chinese art]], which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and [[tribal art]] fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting.

Tribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as [[pastoral]] art had done for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, F, ''The Sleep of Reason'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century "historicism", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors.

The painting of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and the music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', is "primitivist" in so far as its [[Program music|programmatic]] subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre-Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict "[[Dionysian]]" [[Musical modernism|modernism]], i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more "[[Apollonian]]" [[neoclassicism]], to use [[Nietzsche]]'s terminology, although in his use of [[serialism]] he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein.

==The origins of modernist primitivism==
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|150px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris just prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']] 
Primitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the "[[Age of Discovery]]", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, S: ''In Search of the Primitive'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1974), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; As the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. With the decline of [[feudalism]], philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the [[New World]].

From the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is "the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities".&lt;ref&gt;Diamond 1974, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization.

The invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to "primitive" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the [[hieroglyph]], emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater, ''Primitivism in Modern Art'', rev. ed. (New York: Vintage, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of [[Africa]] and the [[Oceanic islands]] that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their "white, Western, and preponderantly male quest" for the "elusive ideal" of the primitive, "whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference."&lt;ref&gt;See Solomon-Godeau 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well.

==Paul Gauguin==
[[File:Paul Gauguin- Manao tupapau (The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch).JPG|thumb|left|[[Paul Gauguin]]. ''Spirit of the Dead Watching'', 1892. Oil on canvas. [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]].]]
Painter [[Paul Gauguin]] sought to escape European [[civilization]] and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of [[Tahiti]] and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe.

Gauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as ''[[Spirit of the Dead Watching|The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch]]'' (1892), ''Parau na te Varua ino'' (1892), ''Anna the Javanerin'' (1893), ''Te Tamari No Atua'' (1896), and ''Cruel Tales'' (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical [[pastoral]] of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called "Tahitian Pastoral" and another "[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|Where Do We Come From"]].&lt;ref&gt;Writing about "Where Do We Come From?" in a review entitled "Back to Paradise", New York Times Art Critic Hilton Kramer quotes art historian George T.M. Shackelford: "Although, [Gauguin] downplayed the painting's relationship to the murals of Puvis on the grounds of procedure and intention, in formal terms he cannot have hoped that his figured landscape&amp;mdash;for all its apparent rejection of classical formulas and execution&amp;mdash;could escape comparison with the timeless groves that Puvis had popularized in murals for the museums in Lyon and Rouen, as well as the great hemicycle of the Sorbonne."&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non-European models.

Gauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist [[postcolonial]] critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is "wrong" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the "dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in "an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness" with "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]ness". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to [[Exoticism]] and [[Orientalism]], as critqued by [[Edward Said]], in which European [[imperialism]] and monolithic and degrading views of the "East" by the "West" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.&lt;ref&gt;(See [[Edward Said]]'s 1978 book, ''[[Orientalism]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fauves and Picasso==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. The two figures on the right are the beginnings of [[Picasso|Picasso's]] African-inspired period.]]
{{see also|Picasso's African Period}}
In 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Oceania]], in part because of the compelling works of [[Paul Gauguin]] that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence.  Artists including [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. 

[[Pablo Picasso]], in particular, explored  [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African sculpture]], [[African traditional masks]], and other historical works including the [[Mannerism|Mannerist paintings]] of [[El Greco]], resulting in his masterpiece ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and, eventually, the invention of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalizing term "primitivism" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Joshua I. “Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.” The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticolonial primitivism==
Although primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about "primitive" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of artists connected with the [[Négritude]] movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. ''Négritude'' was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre-colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]] is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery Stokes Sims. Wifredo Lam and the international avant-garde, 1923-1982. University of Texas Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, ''The Jungle'', Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar.

'''Secondary liability''', or indirect infringement, arises when a party materially contributes to, facilitates, induces, or is otherwise responsible for directly infringing acts carried out by another party. The US has statutorily codified secondary liability rules for [[trademarks]] and [[patents]], but for matters relating to [[copyright]], this has solely been a product of case law developments. In other words, courts, rather than Congress, have been the primary developers of theories and policies concerning secondary liability.

==Early case law==
Secondary liability in copyright has come about with case-by-case decisions. In other words, there has not been any real or consolidated theory. Furthermore, patent and copyright cases have tended to cross-cite each other. Examples of this are cases such as ''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers''&lt;ref name=kalem&gt;''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/222/222.US.55.26.html 222 U.S. 55] (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; (the producer of the movie [[Ben Hur (1907 film)]] didn't himself infringe, but was responsible for making and commercially distributing the infringing film), ''Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.''&lt;ref name=shapiro&gt;''Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/316/316.F2d.304.294.27979.html 316 F.2d 304] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; (a booth in a department store that sold infringing sound recordings and the store was ultimately held liable), and the so-called "dance hall" cases (the operator of an entertainment establishment was held liable because he had effective control of the premises ''and'' obtained a direct financial benefit derived from charging entrance fees to the public).&lt;ref name=dreamland&gt;''Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/36f2354.html 36 F. 2d 354] (7th Cir. 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copyright Act of 1790]] did not provide a formal definition of infringement, stating only that “any person or persons who shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof... shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor all damages occasioned by such injury.” Furthermore, the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] simply provided that any person who “shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States… shall be liable” for various remedies.

Despite the fact that the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] did not explicitly establish liability for acts committed by a party different than the direct infringer, several cases decided under this Act set forth the guidelines under which a party may be deemed secondarily liable. Examples of the gradual recognition by courts of copyright liability extending to those who contribute to or vicariously profit from the infringing acts of others are ''Fishel v. Lueckel''&lt;ref name=fishel&gt;''Fishel v. Lueckel'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/53f499.html 53 F. 499] (1892).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers''.&lt;ref name=kalem /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, and Mark A. Lemley (2007). ''Intellectual Property in the New Technological Era'', p. 572, Aspen Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinds of secondary liability==
There are generally two kinds of secondary [[Legal liability|liability]] developed by courts – [[vicarious liability]] and [[contributory liability]]. Although the line between these categories of liability is blurry, a precondition for all forms of secondary liability is the underlying act (or acts) of infringement. However, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ecourse/cases/netcom.htm 907 F. Supp. 1361, **36, citing 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 12.04{A}{1}, at 12-70] (1995)

Some academics have classified the active inducement adopted in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'' as a new type of secondary liability because it is based on express acts of inducement and not on a mere failure to act;&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson,[http://www.mttlr.org/volthirteen/samuelson.pdf ''Three Reactions to MGM v. Grokster''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021534/http://www.mttlr.org/volthirteen/samuelson.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}, 13 Mich. Telecomm. Tech. L. Rev. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the specific intent to bring about infringing acts is another important factor in this analysis.

===Vicarious liability===
One of the theories widely accepted as a basis for liability in copyright infringement cases is vicarious liability.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Gorman and Jane C. Ginsburg (2009). ''Copyright Cases and Materials'', Foundation Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of vicarious liability was developed in the Second Circuit as an extension of the [[common law]] doctrine of [[agency (law)|agency]] – ''respondeat superior'' (the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate). Pursuant to this doctrine, courts recognized that employers should be liable for the infringing acts of their employees under traditional master-servant principles. An example of this is ''M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Calloway''.&lt;ref name=Witmark&gt;''M. Witmark &amp; Sons v. Calloway'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/22f2d412.html 22 F. 2d 412, 415 ] (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the master-servant context, however, courts have extended liability to those who profit from infringing activity when an enterprise has the right and ability to prevent the infringement. Under ''Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.'',&lt;ref name=dreamland/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“[T]he owner of a dance hall at whose place copyrighted musical compositions are played in violation of the rights of the copyright holder is liable, if the playing be for the profit of the proprietor of the dance hall. And this is so even though the orchestra be employed under a contract that would ordinarily make it an independent contractor.”&lt;/blockquote&gt; By contrast, courts did not extend liability to landlords who leased premises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and did not participate directly in organizing or soliciting the infringing activity. For example, ''Deutsch v. Arnold'',&lt;ref name=Deutsch&gt;''Deutsch v. Arnold'', [http://secondreporter.eu5.org/98f2d686.html 98 F. 2d 686] (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction''&lt;ref name=fonovisa&gt;''Fonovisa v. Cherry Auction'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/76/76.F3d.259.94-15717.html 76 F. 3d 259] (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; (extending liability to the operator of a swap meet who repeatedly leased booth space to concessionaires selling infringing tapes).&lt;ref&gt;[[Julie E. Cohen]], Lydia Pallas Loren, [[Ruth L. Okediji]], and [[Maureen A. O'Rourke]] (2006). ''Copyright in a Global Information Economy'', p. 481, Aspen Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark case on vicarious liability for sales of counterfeit recordings is ''[[Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.]]''&lt;ref name=shapiro /&gt; In ''Shapiro'', the court was faced with a copyright infringement suit against the owner of a chain of department stores where a concessionaire was selling counterfeit recordings. The ''Shapiro'' court ultimately imposed liability, even though the defendant was unaware of the infringement, reasoning that the store proprietor had the power to cease the conduct of the concessionaire, and because the proprietor obtained direct financial benefit from the infringement.

===Contributory liability===
{{main article|Contributory copyright infringement}}

Contributory liability or [[Contributory Copyright Infringement|contributory infringement]] has been widely defined as a form of liability on the part of someone who is not directly infringing but nevertheless is making contributions to the infringing acts of others. Material contributions to the act (or enabling thereof), as well as knowledge of the act itself, are key elements of contributory liability. Additionally, in the course of performing such material contributions, the parties know that they are materially infringing copyrighted content.

Contributory liability is rooted in the [[tort]] theory of enterprise liability. Contributory liability holds the third party liable for the primary act based on the third party's relationship with the actual harm - either by enabling or by benefiting from it. As the court stated in ''[[Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.]]'': “one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes … may be held liable as a contributory infringer.”&lt;ref name=Gershwin&gt;''Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/443/443.F2d.1159.606.35260.html 443 F. 2d 1159] (2d Cir. 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after the passage of the [[1976 Copyright Act]], the scope of contributory infringement liability was tested in a case in which the copyright owners claimed that the sale of a recording device – the VCR - illegally contributed to infringement. In ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]''&lt;ref name=sony&gt;''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/464/464.US.417.81-1687.html 464 U.S. 417] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919165747/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/464/464.US.417.81-1687.html |date=2008-09-19 }} (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; was established a variant on contributory liability claims with respect to technologies. When Universal City Studios initially sued Sony for making and selling the [[Betamax]], the theory was that Sony materially contributed to acts of infringement performed by users of the Betamax, and knew or had reason to know that the technology would be used for infringing purposes. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that, even though material contributions and knowledge of the infringement are generally sufficient to establish secondary liability, in the case of infringing technology, contributory liability cannot be imposed unless the technology lacks substantial non-infringing uses. As the Court phrased the ''Sony'' exception with regard to new technologies: "The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses."&lt;ref name=sony /&gt;

==Liability of internet service providers (ISPs)==
Regarding [[internet]] communications, sometimes the most promising remedy is only available from the standpoint of the internet intermediary (e.g. delete the post, take down the link). In fact, the internet is a special field for secondary liability, because the open architecture of the internet facilitates many communications and users need intermediaries in order to access and contact each other's services.

The question of whether [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) should be held liable for the actions of network users is unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;See K. A. Taipale, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=712101 ''Secondary Liability on the Internet: Towards a Performative Standard for Constitutive Responsibility''], Center for Advanced Studies Working Paper No. 04-2003 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.

Recent statutes in the United States ([[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] of 1998) and the [[European Union]] have provided significant, though not total, immunity from primary copyright liability that, in the absence of those statutes, would exist for ISPs.&lt;ref&gt;See D. Panethiere,''The Basis for Copyright Infringement Liability: The Law in Common Law Jurisdictions'', 13 [[European Intellectual Property Review]] 26 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DMCA]] states four safe harbors:
(a) Transitory network communications
(b) System caching
(c) Information storage and
(d) Information location tools.&lt;ref name=17usc512&gt;''[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/512.html 17 U.S.C. §512]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
The last three have so called “notice &amp; take down” rules for specificity in notice of infringement, counter-notice and put-back and liability if false notice has been given.

In order to be eligible for the safe harbor provisions, it is required that the service provider has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy to terminate the accounts of repetitive infringers. In addition, ISPs must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their works.&lt;ref name="17usc512"/&gt;

As to trademarks, in the absence of statutory guidance, courts have extended both types of secondary liability (vicarious and contributory) to third parties, including in some circumstances ISPs. Here, too, the question whether ISPs will be held liable for the acts of their infringing customers will depend on the degree of the ISP's knowledge and involvement in the specific infringing activity.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Coleman, [http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 ''Secondary Trademark Infringement: A Short Treatise on Contributory and Vicarious Infringement in Trademark''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913081422/http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 |date=2012-09-13 }} (Revised, Sept. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary liability in the future?==
Future treatment of secondary liability by US courts is uncertain. Some cases and commentators have argued for broadening secondary liability through [[cost-benefit analysis]], multi-factor balancing tests, or simply basing it on technical designs or [[business models]].&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Samuelson, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1002676 ''Preliminary Thoughts on Copyright Reform''], Utah Law Review (2007); UC Berkeley Public Law Research Paper No. 1002676.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed EU directive would make aiding and abetting infringement a basis for liability.
In light of the above, it is permissible to conclude that there is no consensus on this issue.

The band has had several lineup changes throughout its existence, with Max and Igor Cavalera departing in 1996 and 2006, respectively. Sepultura's current lineup consists of vocalist [[Derrick Green]], guitarist [[Andreas Kisser]], bassist [[Paulo Jr.]] and drummer [[Eloy Casagrande]]. Since Igor Cavalera's departure in 2006, there have been no original members left in the band. Paulo Jr., who has been a member of Sepultura since 1985, is the only member to appear on every release.

==History==
[[File:Sepultura logo.png|thumb|right|Sepultura logo]]

===Max Cavalera era===
[[File:Sepultura Max Cavalera.jpg|thumb|Singer and guitarist [[Max Cavalera]] formed Sepultura, along with his brother [[Igor Cavalera|Igor]], in 1984, and stayed with the band until 1996.]]
Sepultura was formed in 1984 in [[Belo Horizonte]], the capital city of [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil.&lt;ref name="barcinski16"/&gt; The band was founded by teen brothers [[Max Cavalera|Max]] and [[Igor Cavalera]], the impoverished sons of Vânia, a model, and Graciliano, a well-to-do Italian [[Diplomacy|diplomat]] whose fatal heart attack left his family in financial ruin.&lt;ref&gt;Barcinski &amp; Gomes 1999, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Graciliano's death deeply affected his sons, inspiring them to form a band after Max heard the album ''[[Black Sabbath Vol. 4]]'' the very same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Roots |titlelink=Roots (Sepultura album) |others=Sepultura |year=2005 |chapter=The Roots of Sepultura |first=Steffan |last=Chirazi |page=13 |type=CD booklet |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |location= New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; They chose the band name ''Sepultura'', the Portuguese word for "grave", when Max translated the lyrics of the [[Motörhead]] song "Dancing on Your Grave".&lt;ref name="Barcinski17"/&gt;

The brothers' early influences included [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Deep Purple]], and metal and hard rock artists of the early 1980s, such as [[Van Halen]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Motörhead]], [[AC/DC]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[V8 (band)|V8]].&lt;ref name="barcinski16"/&gt; They would travel to a record shop in [[São Paulo]] that mixed tapes of the latest records by American bands.&lt;ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baird|first=Robert|title=The Boys from Brazil Transplanted to Phoenix, Sepultura Strives for Death Metal with a Conscience|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/160396|accessdate=2010-08-03|newspaper=Phoenix New Times|date=1993-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their listening habits changed dramatically after being introduced to [[Venom (band)|Venom]]. As Igor Cavalera put it:

{{cquote|I remember the first time I listened to Venom, it was on a friend's borrowed tape. It was similar to Motörhead, only a lot heavier. I remember someone saying: it's the devil's Motörhead! After we got acquainted with Venom, we stopped listening to Iron Maiden and all that lighter stuff.&lt;ref&gt;Barcinski &amp; Gomes 1999, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Cavalera brothers started listening to bands such as [[Hellhammer]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Megadeth]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]].&lt;ref&gt;Barcinski &amp; Gomes 1999, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; They also had influences on Brazilian metal from bands like [[Stress (Brazilian band)|Stress]], [[Sagrado Inferno]] and [[Dorsal Atlântica]]. By 1984, they had dropped out of school.&lt;ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/&gt; After several early membership changes, Sepultura established a stable lineup of Max on guitar, Igor on drums, vocalist [[Wagner Lamounier]], and bassist [[Paulo Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Barcinski &amp; Gomes 1999, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Lamounier departed in March 1985 after disagreements with the band, and moved on to become the leader of the pioneering Brazilian [[black metal]] band [[Sarcófago]]. After his departure, Max took over the vocal duties. [[Jairo Guedes]] was invited to join the band as lead guitarist.&lt;ref&gt;Barcinski &amp; Gomes 1999, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bestial Devastation'' and ''Morbid Visions'' (1984–1986)====
After about a year of performing, Sepultura signed to [[Cogumelo Records]] in 1985. Later that year, they released ''[[Bestial Devastation]]'', a shared EP with fellow Brazilian band Overdose. It was self-produced and recorded in just two days. The band recorded their first full-length album, ''[[Morbid Visions]]'', in August 1986. It contained their first hit, "Troops of Doom", which gained some media attention. The band then decided to relocate to the larger city of São Paulo.&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio"/&gt;

====''Schizophrenia'', ''Beneath the Remains'' and ''Arise'' (1987–1992)====
[[File:Sepultura in performance (Lisboa 2004).jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Kisser]] has been the lead guitarist of Sepultura since 1987. His arrival provided the group with a more technical experience.]]
In early 1987, Jairo Guedz quit the band. Guedz was replaced by [[São Paulo]]-based guitarist [[Andreas Kisser]],&lt;ref&gt;Barcinski &amp; Gomes 1999, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and they released their second studio album, ''[[Schizophrenia (Sepultura album)|Schizophrenia]]'', in 1987. The album reflected a stylistic change towards a more thrash metal-oriented sound, while still keeping the death metal elements of ''Morbid Visions''. ''Schizophrenia'' was an improvement in production and performance, and became a minor critical sensation across Europe and America as a much sought-after import. The band sent tapes to North America(USA) that made radio playlists at a time when they were struggling to book gigs because club owners were afraid to book them due to their style.&lt;ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/&gt; The band gained attention from [[Roadrunner Records]] who signed them and released ''Schizophrenia'' internationally before seeing the band perform in person.&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colon 1991-08-07"&gt;{{cite news|last=Colon|first=Suzan|title=Name That Tomb|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/content/printVersion/233397|accessdate=2010-08-02|newspaper=Miami New Times|date=1991-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a May 2018 interview with teenyrockers.com, Kisser noted that Sepultura would not have been possible without family support, not only from his own family but also from the families of Max &amp; Igor and Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May 2018 Interview With Derrick Green and Andreas Kisser|url=https://teenyrockers.com/blogs/milk-hugs-rock-n-roll/teeny-rockers-presents-sepultura|website=www.teenyrockers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's third studio album, ''[[Beneath the Remains]]'', was released in 1989. The album was recorded in a rustic studio in Rio de Janeiro while the band communicated through translators with the American producer [[Scott Burns (producer)|Scott Burns]].&lt;ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/&gt; It was an immediate success and became known in thrash metal circles as a classic on the order of Slayer's ''[[Reign in Blood]]''.&lt;ref name="Colon 1991-08-07"/&gt; It was hailed by ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine as one of the all-time top 20 thrash metal albums,&lt;ref&gt;''Terrorizer'' No.&amp;nbsp;109 (2003), page 35 (author unknown)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as gaining a place in their all-time top 40 death metal records.&lt;ref name= terrorizer151&gt;Hinchliffe 2006, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMusic]] gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, "The complete absence of filler here makes this one of the most essential death/thrash metal albums of all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r17716 |title=Beneath the Remains – Sepultura |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A long European and American tour furthered the band's reputation, despite the fact that they were still very limited English speakers. Their first US show was held on October 31, 1989 at [[Ritz (rock club)|the Ritz]] in New York City, opening for Danish heavy metal band [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]]. The band filmed its first video for the single "Inner Self".

In January 1991, Sepultura played for more than 100,000 people at the [[Rock in Rio]] II festival. The band relocated from their native Brazil to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] in 1990, obtained new management, and recorded the album ''[[Arise (Sepultura album)|Arise]]'' at [[Morrisound Recording|Morrisound Studios]] in Tampa, Florida.&lt;ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/&gt; By the time the album was released in March 1991, the band had become one of the most critically praised thrash/death metal bands of the time. The first single "[[Dead Embryonic Cells]]" was a success, and the [[Arise (Sepultura song)|title track]] gained additional attention when its video was banned by MTV America due to its apocalyptic religious imagery. The album was critically acclaimed and their first to chart on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], reaching No.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1991-05-04/billboard-200

Max Cavalera married the band's manager Gloria Bujnowski during this period.&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio"/&gt; In 1992, Sepultura was part of two major tours: [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]]/[[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Alice in Chains]]/[[Ozzy Osbourne]].

====''Chaos A.D.'', Nailbomb and ''Roots'' (1993–1996)====

Sepultura's fifth album, ''[[Chaos A.D.]]'', was released in 1993. It saw a departure from their death metal style,&lt;ref&gt;Barcinski &amp; Gomes 1999, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt; adding influences of [[groove metal]],&lt;ref name="Sound of the Beast"&gt;{{citation |author=Christe |year=2003 |page=264 |quote=As close to death metal as any other gold-selling record before it, ''Chaos A.D.'' stripped down Sepultura's sound into a coarse metallic loop.

They released an even more industrial-oriented album, ''[[Point Blank (Nailbomb album)|Point Blank]]'' the same year. The group performed only one full live gig at [[Dynamo Open Air]] in 1995, and the performance was released as ''[[Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide]]''. Nailbomb was disbanded shortly afterwards.

Sepultura's sound change continued with their sixth album, ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'', which was released in 1996. On this album the band experimented with elements of the music of Brazil's indigenous peoples, and adopted a slower, down-tuned sound. The album was hailed as a modern-day heavy metal classic and a major influence on the then-nascent [[nu metal]] scene. [[AllMusic]] gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, "''Roots'' consolidates Sepultura's position as perhaps the most distinctive, original heavy metal band of the 1990s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r233334 |title=Roots – Sepultura |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1996, Sepultura performed "War (Guerra)" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'' produced by the Red Hot Organization.

====Departure of Max Cavalera (1996–1997)====
In August 1996, Sepultura played on the Castle Donington Monsters of Rock main stage alongside [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], [[Type O Negative]], [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] and [[Fear Factory]]. The band was suddenly a three-piece with Andreas Kisser taking over on lead vocals, after Max Cavalera left the concert site earlier in the day upon learning of the death of his stepson Dana Wells in a car accident. After Dana Wells' funeral was finished, Max returned and continued to tour with Sepultura. A few months after Wells' death, the band had a meeting with Max and said that they wanted to fire their manager Gloria Bujnowski, who was Max's wife and Dana's mother, and find new management. Their reasoning was that Bujnowski was paying too much attention to Max and not enough to the rest of the band. Max, who was still coming to terms with the death of Wells, felt betrayed by his bandmates for wanting to rid of Bujnowski and abruptly quit the band.&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio"/&gt; Max Cavalera's final performance with Sepultura was at [[Brixton Academy]] in England on December 16, 1996.

In an interview with ''Faceculture'' in 2010, Max Cavalera explained that one of the reasons he left Sepultura was that Kisser's wife attempted to arrange Dana Wells' funeral before he and Bujnowski could return home from England. Max also claimed that he had recently attempted to reach out to Kisser for a possible reunion in which Bujnowski could manage him and Igor Cavalera while Kisser and Paulo Jr could be managed by someone else, but Kisser rejected the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faceculture.com/news_detail.php?id=719 |title="Max Cavalera quit Sepultura over funeral", July 10, 2010 |publisher=Faceculture.com |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2011-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710223659/http://www.faceculture.com/news_detail.php?id=719 |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepultura Biography|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Sepultura/Biography/|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's eighth album, ''[[Nation (Sepultura album)|Nation]]'', released in 2001, sold poorly. It would be their last studio album with Roadrunner Records. [[AllMusic]] gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and said, "As Green scrapes the lining of his vocal chords through the brash, impassioned tracks, he's singing about more than just 'one nation, Sepulnation'; he's suggesting something bigger, something worth shouting about and fighting for." In an interview, Derrick Green said that, "Every song will be related to the idea of building this nation.

After recording ''[[Revolusongs]]'', an EP of covers in 2002, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Roorback]]'', in 2003. Despite receiving greater critical acclaim than its predecessors, sales remained low. It was their first album with [[SPV GmbH|SPV Records]]. [[AllMusic]] gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, "if there are still any lingering doubts about the Green/Sepultura match, 2003's excellent ''Roorback'' should put them to rest for good.

In November of that year, a live double [[DVD]]/double [[CD]] package, ''[[Live in São Paulo (Sepultura album)|Live in São Paulo]]'', was released.

Sepultura's tenth album, ''[[Dante XXI]]'', was released on March 14, 2006. It is a [[concept album]] based on [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Music videos were recorded for the songs "[[Convicted in Life]]" and "Ostia". [[AllMusic]] gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that, "Overall, Dante XXI is easily one of Sepultura's strongest releases to feature Green on vocals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r821812 |title=Dante XXI – Sepultura |publisher=AllMusic |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 interview with ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' magazine, Max Cavalera stated that he and Igor, both of whom having recently reconciled after a decade-long feud, would reunite with the original Sepultura lineup. There were also rumors that the reunited line up would play on the main stage at [[Ozzfest#Ozzfest 2007|Ozzfest 2007]]. However, this was denied by Kisser and the reunion did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=62221|title= There will be no Sepultura reunion i2007|date= 2006-11-15|publisher= Blabbermouth.net|accessdate= 2007-07-13|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514080245/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=62221|archivedate= 2008-05-14|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Igor Cavalera left the band after the release of ''Dante XXI'' and was replaced by Brazilian drummer [[Jean Dolabella]], leaving the band without any of its original members.

Looking back on the band's career arc for a 2016 article on Max and Igor Cavalera's retrospective Return to Roots tour (in commemoration of the album's 20th anniversary), [[Nashville Scene]] contributor Saby Reyes-Kulkarni observed that "Before ''Chaos A.D.'', the overwhelming majority of metal had a 'white' feel to it. Sepultura changed that forever. And with ''Roots,'' the band went a step further, asserting once and for all that the genre can accommodate native stylings from any culture, much like jazz had done for decades prior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/features/article/20833678/roots-run-deep-twenty-years-later-sepultura-founders-max-and-iggor-cavalera-perform-their-former-bands-pinnacle-album-in-full|title=Roots Run Deep: Twenty Years Later, Sepultura Founders Max and Iggor Cavalera Perform Their Former Band’s Pinnacle Album in Full|work=Nashville Scene|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTV has called Sepultura the most successful Brazilian heavy metal band in history and "perhaps the most important heavy metal band of the '90s".&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio" /&gt; In 1993, Robert Baird of ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' wrote that the band played "machine-gun-tempo mayhem" and that the members "love to attack organized religion and repressive government".&lt;ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Shōzaburō Watanabe'''|渡辺 庄三郎|Watanabe Shōzaburō|June 2, 1885 – February 14, 1962}} was a Japanese print publisher and the driving force behind the Japanese printmaking movement known as ''[[shin-hanga]]'' ("new prints").

== Biography ==
He started his career working for the export company of {{illm|Kobayashi Bunshichi|ja|小林文七}}, which gave him an opportunity to learn about exporting art prints. In 1908, Watanabe married Chiyo, a daughter of the woodblock carver Chikamatsu.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Richard and Jennifer Saville, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/watanabe_shozaburo.asp Artlino]&lt;/ref&gt;

Watanabe employed highly skilled carvers and printers, and commissioned artists to design prints that combined traditional Japanese techniques with elements of contemporary Western painting, such as perspective and shadows. Watanabe coined the term ''shin-hanga'' in 1915 to describe such prints. [[Charles W. Bartlett]], [[Hashiguchi Goyō]], [[Kawase Hasui]], [[Yoshida Hiroshi]], {{illm|Kasamatsu Shirō|ja|笠松紫浪}}, [[Torii Kotondo]], [[Ohara Koson]], {{illm|Terashima Shimei|ja|寺島紫明}}, [[Itō Shinsui]], [[Takahashi Shōtei]] and [[Yamakawa Shūhō]] are among the artists whose works he published.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Richard and Jennifer Saville, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his company's stockpile of both prints and their original printing-blocks was destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923. In the following years, new versions of many of these prints were created, using re-carved blocks; typically, the re-issued "post-quake" prints included changes and revisions in the designs.

Watanabe exported most of his ''shin-hanga'' prints to the United States and Europe due to a lack of Japanese interest. After the close of [[World War II]], his heirs continued the business, which still operates.

[[File:Tape art by Max Zorn.jpg|thumb|A work in brown packing tape on acrylic glass by Max Zorn, illuminated from behind]]

'''Tape art''' is an artwork created with [[adhesive tape]] such as [[duct tape]] or [[packing tape]]. It developed from urban art in the 1960s, as an alternative to the widely spread use of [[spray can]]s in the urban art scene. Tape can be used to produce a "[[stained glass]]" effect when applied to glass or plastic which is lit from behind. It can be attached to a wall to form the outline or an image, or can be shaped into three-dimensional sculptures.

Tape artists such as [[Max Zorn (artist)|Max Zorn]] show their work at art fairs including [[Art Basel Miami Beach|Art Basel Miami]].

== Characteristics ==

Tape art can be installed quickly and almost silently, making it suitable for small or temporary urban art projects. No masking or covering is necessary. Tape is relatively easy to handle, and can be applied to various surfaces, such as stone, asphalt, wood, [[aluminum]], [[sandwich panel]]s or glass. Interior installations work just as well as exterior ones.{{dubious|date=March 2016}} Unlike [[spray paint art]], tape art can be removed easily without leaving a permanent mark.

Materials for tape art vary depending on which tape is being used. Tape art can use duct tape, packing tape, [[masking tape]] or other products. Unlike traditional paintings and sculptures, tape art can be applied anywhere, including the doors, ceilings and floors of galleries. Duct tape can be used to construct [[three-dimensional]] sculptures.&lt;ref name="About tape art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ostap about tape art|url=http://ostap-art.com/tape-artist-slava-ostap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Call to Poetry''' was a one-night [[performance art]] / international poetry gathering event held April 5, 2012 in [[Istanbul]], near [[Taksim Square]], widely promoted and heavily attended by international poets to celebrate the [[history of poetry]] with a dramatic reading of the world’s oldest love poem, which is housed in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Istanbul to host celebration of world’s oldest love poem|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-276386-istanbul-to-host-celebration-of-worlds-oldest-love-poem.html|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Call to Poetry garnered significant interest in Istanbul, the greater Middle East and the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient Love Poem Sees Light of Day in Istanbul|url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/ancient-love-poem-istanbul/|newspaper=PRI's The World|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did a portion of the evening dedicated to poetry of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hesham Al-Gakh’s Tahrir Square poetry honored in Istanbul|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/2012/04/08/hesham-al-gakhs-tahrir-square-poetry-honored-in-istanbul/|newspaper=The Daily News Egypt|date=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The World's Oldest Love Poem ==
Written on a 4,000-year-old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al Jakh is 'Prince of Poets' finalist|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/al-jakh-is-prince-of-poets-finalist|newspaper=The National (UAE)|date=Feb 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; clay tablet known as [[Istanbul 2461|İstanbul #2461]], the  [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] poem currently has its home at the İstanbul Archaeology Museum and was composed in the 21st century B.C. for the Sumerian king [[Shu-Sin]], who ruled from 2037–2029 BC. The poem was intended for a spring fertility ritual and recited by one of his brides.&lt;ref name="Guinness World Records 2007. Guinness World Records Limited, 2006."&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arab Spring Poetry ==
The Call to Poetry featured readings from contemporary Egyptian poet Hesham Al-Gak, a 2011 contestant on the Arab world's popular [[American Idol]]-style TV program based in [[Abu Dhabi]] called ''[[Prince of Poets]]''. During the Egyptian revolution, Al-Gak used the competition to recite poems critical of Egyptian leaders and departed ''Prince of Poets'''s Abu Dhabi studios to visit [[Cairo]]  to compose and recite verse at the height of protests there.

== Event Organizers ==
Call to Poetry organizer, American writer Dan Boylan cited [[Beat Generation]] figure [[Allen Ginsberg]] as an influence on the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating the World’s Oldest Love Poem in Istanbul on April 5th, 2012|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/133112/celebrating-the-world’s-oldest-love-poem-in-istanbul-on-april-5th-2012-.html|publisher=The Turkish Weekly Journal|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having met Ginsberg as a teenager, Boylan premiered Istanbul-inspired [[sound poetry]] during the event, which included music and an over-capacity crowd that listened from outside the venue. American journalist David Trilling served as the first Call to Poetry's master of ceremonies and New Zealand Poet Fred Simpon released his book of verse, “Lucky Me!” during the event.

'''''The Golf Players''''' (1658) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on panel painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]], it is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of [[Polesden Lacey]].

This painting by Hooch was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote; "305. The Game of Golf. In an entrance-hall paved with red tiles a little girl carrying a golf-club stands with her hand on the latch of an open door. She looks at a boy who is playing golf in the courtyard. In the distance is a village. Panel, 25 inches by 18 inches. Formerly in the collection of Count von Fries, Vienna. 
Sales: 
* Heris of Brussels, in Paris, June 19, 1846, No. 27. 
* Pierard of Valenciennes, in Paris, March 21, 1860, No. 29. 
* Sir H. H. Campbell, in London, 1867 (bought in for ₤63)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/561/mode/1up entry 305 for ''The Game of Golf''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting seems to have been a successful design for De Hooch as there are several variations on the subject of this little girl in the doorway:

'''''The Raising of Lazarus''''', c. 1609, in the [[Museo Regionale]], [[Messina]], is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Caravaggio]] (1571–1610). 

In August 1608 Caravaggio fled from [[Malta]], where he had been imprisoned for an unknown crime, and took refuge in Sicily with his friend, the artist [[Mario Minniti]]. Through Minniti's intercession he procured a number of important commissions, including this for the church of the Padri Crociferi in Messina, where it was presented by the wealthy Genoese merchant Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari on 10 June 1609. The fee was a thousand scudi, more than double any Caravaggio had received previously.

Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, was the patron saint of Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari, to whom Caravaggio was contracted to paint an altarpiece in the church of the Padri Crociferi. The [[Gospel of John]] tells how he fell sick, died, was buried and then miraculously raised from the dead by Christ. As in several paintings from this period of Caravaggio's career, the scene is set against blank walls that overwhelm the frieze of human actors. The interaction of the relief of figures caught in corporate effort and emotion, with a large void above, is quite different from the closely focussed individualised dramas of his early and middle periods. As is usual with Caravaggio, light becomes an important element in the drama, picking out crucial details such as Lazarus's hands—one lax and open to receive, the other reaching towards Christ—and the wonder-struck faces of the onlookers.

The old story that Caravaggio had a freshly buried body exhumed for this painting is "probably apocryphal, but not beyond the bounds of possibility" (John Gash, see below). Some of the figures were said to be modelled on members of the community, but Caravaggio has also relied on his memory—the whole design is based on an engraving after Giulio Romano and his Jesus is a reversed image of the Christ who called Matthew to join him in ''[[The Calling of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of Saint Matthew]]''. The painting is in poor condition and much restored, and it's possible that some passages are the work of assistants.

According to Francesco Susinno, Caravaggio had produced a first version that he destroyed with a razor after adverse criticism. Subsequently he would have finished in record time the present version, but probably this account is fanciful.

Before it was even debuted, the series set off a storm of controversy because of a perceived light-hearted take on the issue of [[American slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/09/30/1998-09-30_a_racial_tv_battle_blacks_ri.html|title=A Racial TV Battle: Blacks Rip Sitcom About Lincoln Butler That Find Humor in Slavery|last=Millner|first=Denene|date=1998-09-20|publisher=nydailynews.com|accessdate=2009-05-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930101634/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/09/30/1998-09-30_a_racial_tv_battle_blacks_ri.html|archivedate=2009-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
A black English nobleman named Desmond Pfeiffer, chased out of England due to gambling debts, becomes President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s valet. In the show, he serves as the intelligent and erudite backbone of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era [[White House]] populated by louts and [[drunkard]]s.

==Cast==
* [[Chi McBride]] as Desmond Pfeiffer, Black English gentleman serving as President Lincoln's butler
* [[Dann Florek]] as [[Abraham Lincoln]], 16th President of the United States
* [[Christine Estabrook]] as [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], President Lincoln's wife
* Max Baker as Nibblet, Pfeiffer's assistant
* Kelly Connell as [[Ulysses S. Grant]], General of the United States Army

==Controversy==
Before the series' premiere, several African American activist groups, including the Los Angeles area [[NAACP]], protested against the premise of the series. On September 24, 1998, a protest against the series was held outside [[Paramount Studios]]. Five days later, [[UPN]] released a statement regarding the controversy and stated that the network planned on delaying the controversial pilot episode (which never aired) and would instead air an alternate episode in its place. The first episode of the series aired on October 5, 1998, ranking 116th out of 125 television programs for that week. ''Desmond Pfeiffer'' was removed from UPN's schedule on October 24 and, after airing one episode two days after being removed from UPN's lineup, was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/category/q-and-a/|title=Q &amp; A: The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer, Whodunnit?|date=2009-05-20|publisher=tvobscurities.com|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' listed the show as the eleventh-worst TV series ever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 [[TV Guide Network]] listed the show at #15 on their list of ''25 Biggest TV Blunders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100302tvguide01|title=Breaking News - TV Guide Network's "25 Biggest TV Blunders" Special Delivers 3.3 Million Viewers|date=2010-03-02|publisher=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film Threat]]'s Phil Hall gave the show a positive review, writing, "Today, the show is remembered (barely) as a bizarre flop – but after watching a pair of episodes that are currently available for YouTube viewing, I would be bold enough to declare that "The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer" deserves a new consideration. ... If you have the patience for crass, innuendo-laced, no-taste bawdy comedy, you will certainly find yourself laughing out loud over this series."&lt;ref name=filmthreat/&gt;

The series was alluded to multiple times in the unaired pilot episode of ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'', "Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make", which featured Dante and Randal drawing inspiration from a non-existent episode of ''The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'', which Randal describes as "classic Pfeiffer".&lt;ref name=filmthreat&gt;http://www.filmthreat.com/features/58140/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Wild Swans''' is a literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a [[princess]] who rescues her eleven brothers from a spell cast by an evil queen. The tale was first published on 2&amp;nbsp;October 1838 as the first installment in Andersen's ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]'' by C. A. Reitzel in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. It has been adapted to various media including ballet, television, and film.

==Synopsis==
[[File:The Wild Swans.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"The Wild Swans" by [[Arthur Gaskin]]]]

In a faraway kingdom, there lives a widowed king with his twelve children: eleven [[prince]]s and one [[princess]]. One day, he decides to remarry. He marries a wicked queen who was a [[witch]]. Out of spite, the queen turns her eleven stepsons into [[swan]]s (they are allowed to become human by night) and forces them to fly away. The queen then tries to bewitch their 15-year-old sister, Elisa, but Elisa's goodness is too strong for this, so the queen has Elisa [[banishment|banished]]. The brothers carry Elisa to safety in a foreign land where she is out of the reach of her stepmother.

There, Elisa is guided by the queen of the [[fairies]] to gather [[Urtica dioica|stinging nettles]] in graveyards to knit into shirts that will eventually help her brothers regain their human shapes. Elisa endures painfully blistered hands from nettle stings, and she must also take a [[vow]] of silence for the duration of her task, for speaking one word will kill her brothers. The king of another faraway land happens to come across the mute Elisa and falls in love with her. He grants her a room in his castle where she continues her knitting. Eventually he proposes to crown her as his queen and wife, and she accepts.

However, the [[Archbishop]] is chagrined because he thinks Elisa is herself a witch, but the king will not believe him. One night Elisa runs out of nettles and is forced to collect more in a nearby church graveyard where the Archbishop is watching. Ghoulish spirits that devour the bodies of the dead are also in the churchyard, and the archbishop believes that Elisa is in league with them.  He reports the incident to the king as proof of [[witchcraft]]. The statues of the [[saint]]s shake their heads in protest, but the Archbishop misinterprets this sign as confirmation of Elisa's guilt. The Archbishop orders to put Elisa on [[Witch-hunt|trial for witchcraft]]. She can speak no word in her defense and is sentenced to death by [[death by burning|burning at the stake]].

The brothers discover Elisa's plight and try to speak to the king but fail, thwarted by the rising sun. Even as the [[tumbril]] bears Elisa away to execution, she continues knitting, determined to keep it up to the last moment of her life. This enrages the people, who are on the brink of snatching and destroying the shirts when the swans descend and rescue Elisa. The people interpret this as a sign from Heaven that Elisa is innocent, but the [[executioner]] still makes ready for the burning. When Elisa throws the shirts over the swans, her brothers return to their human forms. (Unfortunately, the youngest brother has a swan's wing instead of an arm, as Elisa did not have time to finish one sleeve of his shirt.)  Elisa is now free to speak and tell the truth, but she faints from exhaustion, so her brothers explain. As they do so, the firewood around Elisa's stake miraculously takes root and bursts into flowers. The king plucks the topmost flower and presents it to Elisa, and they are married. And the youngest prince's wing becomes normal again.

The '''toadstone''', also known as '''bufonite''', is a [[mythical]] stone or [[Gemstone|gem]] that was thought to be found in the head of a [[toad]]. It was supposed to be an [[antidote]] to [[poison]] and in this it is not unlike '''batrachite''', supposedly formed in the heads of frogs. Toadstones were actually the button-like [[fossilized]] teeth of ''[[Lepidotes]]'', an extinct genus of [[ray-finned fish]] from the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. They appeared to be "stones that are perfect in form" and were set by European jewellers into magical rings and amulets from Medieval times until the 18th century.&lt;ref name='Independent UK Fossils1'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fossils: myths, mystery and magic | date=2007-02-12 | publisher=Independent UK | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fossils-myths-mystery-and-magic-436005.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
From ancient times people associated the fossils with jewels that were set inside the heads of toads. The toad has poison glands in its skin, so it was naturally assumed that they carried their own antidote and that this took the form of a magical stone. They were first recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the first century.

According to Paul Taylor of the London [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]:

{{quote|Like [[Shark tooth#History of discovery|tonguestones]], toadstones were considered to be antidotes for poison and were also used in the treatment of [[epilepsy]]". As early as the 14th century, people began to adorn jewelry with toadstones for their [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] abilities. In their folklore, a toadstone was required to be removed from an old toad while the creature was still alive, and as instructed by the 17th century [[naturalist]] [[Edward Topsell]], could be done by setting the toad on a piece of red cloth.}}

[[File:Lepidotes elvensis skull.jpg|thumb|[[Fossile|Fossilized]] ''[[Lepidotes]]'', showing detail of the skull, from which toadstones originated]]
[[File:Various toadstones.jpg|thumb|right|Toadstones from Jurassic sediments in Oxfordshire UK]]

The true toadstone was taken by contemporary jewellers to be no bigger than the nail of a hand and they varied in colour from a whitish brown through green to black, depending on where they were buried.&lt;ref name="17thC Lapidary"&gt;Thomas Nicols (1652). Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones. Part ii, chapter xxxvi, pp.158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; They were supposedly most effective against poison when worn against the skin, on which occasion they were thought to heat up, sweat and change colour.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Widdowes alias Woodhouse (1631). [https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5158807 Naturall Philosophy: Or Description of the World, and of the Severall Creatures therein contained]. Second Edition, corrected and enlarged.&lt;/ref&gt; If a person was bitten by a venomous creature a toadstone would be touched against the affected part to effect a cure.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lupton (1576). A Thousand Notable Things, Of Sundry Sortes.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively  Johannes de Cuba, in his book ''Hortus sanitatis'', claimed that toadstone would help with kidney disease and earthly happiness.&lt;ref name=Campbell33&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Marian |date=2009 |title=Medieval Jewellery in Europe 1100-1500|publisher=V&amp;A Publishing |page=33 |isbn=9781851775828 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loose toadstones were discovered among other gemstones in the Elizabethan [[Cheapside Hoard]] and there are surviving toadstone rings in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[British Museum]].

==Allusions in literature==

The toadstone is [[Allusion|alluded]] to by Duke Senior in [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[As You Like It]]'' (1599), in  Act 2, Scene 1, lines 12 through 14:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sweet are the uses of adversity; &lt;br /&gt;
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, &lt;br /&gt;
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[James Branch Cabell]]'s [[short story]] "Balthazar's Daughter" (collected in ''The Certain Hour'') and its subsequent play adaptation ''The Jewel Merchants'', [[Alessandro de Medici]]  attempts to seduce Graciosa by listing various precious jewels in his possession, including "jewels cut from the brain of a toad".

The '''Tomb of Hafez''' and its associated memorial hall, the '''Hāfezieh''' ({{lang|fa|حافظیه}}), are two memorial structures erected in the northern edge of [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], in memory of the celebrated Persian poet [[Hafez]].  The open pavilion structures are situated in the Musalla Gardens on the north bank of a seasonal river and house the marble tomb of Hafez.  The present buildings, built in 1935 and designed by the French architect and archaeologist [[André Godard]], are at the site of previous structures, the best-known of which was built in 1773.  The tomb, its gardens, and the surrounding memorials to other great figures are a focus of tourism in Shiraz.

== History ==

Hafez was born in Shiraz in 1315 and died there in 1390.  A beloved figure of the Iranian people, who learn his verses by heart, Hafez was prominent in his home town and held a position as the court poet.&lt;ref name="khorr"/&gt;  In his memory, a small, dome-like structure was erected in Shiraz near his grave at Golgast-e Mosalla in 1452 at the order of [[Babur Ibn-Baysunkur]], a [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] governor.  The Golgast-e Mosalla were gardens (now known as Musalla Gardens) that featured in Hafiz's poetry.  With a surface of over 19,000 square metres, the gardens were also home to one of Shiraz's cemeteries, and Babur had a pool built here at the same time as the memorial.  Believing they were ordered by omens in Hafez's poetry, [[Abbas I of Persia]] and [[Nader Shah]] both carried out separate restoration projects in the following 300 years.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;

[[File:Tomb of the poet Hafez by Eugène Flandin.jpg|thumb|Drawing by [[Eugène Flandin]], 1840s]]
[[File:Tomb of Hafez by Pascal Coste.jpg|thumb|Drawing by [[Pascal Coste]], 1840s]]

A much more substantial memorial was constructed in the gardens in 1773 during the reign of [[Karim Khan|Karim Khan Zand]].  Situated on the north bank of the seasonal Rudkhaneye Khoshk river in the Musalla Gardens, the Hāfezieh consisted of four central columns, with two rooms built at the east and west end and with the north and south sides remaining open.  The building split the gardens into two regions, with the orange grove in the front and the cemetery in the back.  The actual tomb was outside of the structure, in the middle of the cemetery, with a marble slab placed over the grave.  The marble was engraved by a [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] with excerpts from Hafez's poetry.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;

The tomb was restored in 1857 by a governor of [[Fars Province|Fars]], and a wooden enclosure was built around the tomb in 1878, by another governor of Fars.  Following this, the site became a subject of controversy, when, in 1899, Ardeshir, a [[Parsi]] from [[India]] began to build a shrine around Hafez's grave.  Although the philanthropist Parsi had obtained permission from a [[ulema]] of Shiraz to build the iron and wood shrine, a doctor of religious law with some authority in Shiraz, ʿAli-Akbar Fāl-Asiri, objected to a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] building over the grave of a Muslim.  With his followers, he destroyed the half-built construction.  The people of Shiraz protested the destruction and the government ordered the rebuilding of the monument, but Fāl-Asiri opposed them and pronounced that he would destroy any building raised there, even if it were erected by the king himself.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;

[[File:Hafez tomb-old.jpg|thumb|right|160px|A photo of iron transenna, once in place around Hafez's tomb]]
The site remained in ruins for two years, until 1901 when Prince [[Malek Mansur Mirza Shao es-Saltaneh]] placed a decorative iron [[wikt:transenna|transenna]] around Hafez's tomb.  It was inscribed with verse and the names of the patrons of the transenna.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;

==Present structure==

[[File:Mausoleo de Hafez, Shiraz, Irán, 2016-09-24, DD 15.jpg|thumb|View of the tomb of Hafez]]

Activities to restore and expand the memorial to Hafez began in 1931, when the orange grove was repaired and the Hāfezieh was altered by a governor of Fars and [[Isfahan]], Faraj-Allāh Bahrāmi Dabir-e Aʿẓam.  Additional improvements were delayed until the Ministry of Education organised for a new building to be built, in 1935.  [[André Godard]], a French archaeologist and architect, was the technical director of the Department of Antiquities at the time, and was commissioned to design the new buildings.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt; Other sources however attribute the design to [[Maxime Siroux]].&lt;ref&gt;Yuka Kadoi, Iván Szántó. ''The Shaping of Persian Art: Collections and Interpretations of the Art of Islamic Iran and Central Asia''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2014. {{ISBN|1443864498}}, 9781443864497 pp.204&lt;/ref&gt;

Alterations to Hafez's tomb involved elevating it one metre above ground level and encircling it with five steps.  Eight columns, each ten metres tall, support a copper dome in the shape of a dervish's hat.  The underside of the dome is an [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] and colourful mosaic.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;

The original, four-columned memorial hall built in 1773 by Karim Khan Zand was extensively expanded.  Sixteen pillars were added to the four original, creating a long verandah, and on several façades are engraved [[ghazal]]s and other excerpts from Hafez's poetry.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;

==Gardens and tourism==
[[File:Hafeziyeh 0457.JPG|thumb|The tomb of Hafez illuminated at night]]

Several rectangular pools have been added amongst the gardens, and well-maintained orange trees, paths, streams, and flower beds create a pleasant environment for the tourism hub of Hafez's tomb and memorial hall.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraz"/&gt;  A tea house on the grounds provides refreshments in a traditional setting.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kianush"/&gt;  The dome over Hafez's grave is well lit at night, providing an attractive focal point.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt;  The former tomb of Qāsem Khan Wāli is now a library containing 10,000 volumes dedicated to Hafez scholarship.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia iranica"/&gt;

A '''wall decal''', also known as a wall [[sticker]], wall tattoo, or wall [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], is a vinyl sticker that is affixed to a wall or other smooth surface for decoration and informational purposes. Wall decals are cut with [[Plotter#Vinyl cutter|vinyl cutting machines]]. Most decals use only one color, but some may have various images printed upon them.

==Types and sizes==
[[File:Stickerbrand 3.jpg|thumb|A vinyl art wall decal]]

Decals can range from simple small wall borders and cut outs to more complex murals covering entire walls. They may feature words, pictures and designs. Vinyl wall decals come in various shapes and sizes. They can be as small or as large as necessary. Regular wall decals are usually between 30&amp;nbsp;cm x 50&amp;nbsp;cm and 60&amp;nbsp;cm x 100&amp;nbsp;cm. Larger decals may be 100&amp;nbsp;cm x 100&amp;nbsp;cm or larger.

Most vinyl decals are not reusable, although some reusable vinyl types are available. They use a different adhesive on the rear which means that they can be re-positioned a couple of times before the adhesive wears out.  Vinyl stickers at a large size can be very difficult to apply as they can tear, stretch and stick back on themselves.  Traditional decals are made from pvc plastic and cut from a single colour using a vinyl cutter or laser cutter.  It is possible to print a full colour image onto vinyl and then contour cut around it.  Block cut vinyls come in many different finishes from glitter, to metallic, to mirror effect.  They can also be supplied as blackboard or whiteboard finish and cut to shape to create a wall decal.

A range of non-PVC fabric wall decals sold as "FabriStick" is made from a finely woven fabric with 3M type adhesive on the rear.  It can be printed to full colour and still profile cut to create intricate designs.  It does not stretch, tear or peel back on itself and is re-positionable and re-usable in a way that vinyl stickers are not.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

==Uses==
Vinyl decals have various uses.  Vinyl decals were originally only used for sign making, but they have recently been added to interior decorators portfolios and have also become well known as a [[Do it yourself|Do-It-Yourself]] home decorating option.  The fabric wall stickers are particularly popular with people in rental properties as they allow personal creativity in home decoration without any damage to the walls.  Even better, the wall decorations can be put back onto the supplied backing sheets and taken to the next property.

Decals can be used on windows, walls or tiles as branding, [[advertising]], or decoration. They may also serve as a tool to inform people that there is a glass door or window.

'''Yarn weight''' refers to the thickness of [[yarn]] used by [[knitting|knitters]], [[weaving|weavers]], [[crochet]]ers and other [[fiber artist]]s.

==Importance==
Changing yarn weight or needle size can have a significant impact on the finished project, so standardized systems have been spread about, as well as conversion systems for regional standards (especially needle sizes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knitbuddies Crochet and Knitting Needle Conversion Charts|url=http://www.knitbuddies.com/needle_conversion_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Yarn weight is important in achieving the correct gauge or tension for a particular project and can help with yarn substitution. The [[Craft Yarn Council of America]] has developed a system that seeks to standardize the labeled weights of yarn.&lt;ref&gt;The CYC weight system can be found at http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/weight.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most yarns state their weight on the ball band but some may not, only giving the composition. Some brands use a standardized numbering system that uses seven ranges of relative thickness of [[List of yarns for crochet and knitting|yarn]]. However there are methods for individuals to gauge weight for themselves.

==Wrap method==
One way of determining the weight of an unknown yarn is to use the wrapping method. This convenient method is also used to calculate the amount of yarn needed for a project. By this method it is possible to check yarn for sale with a simple pencil and ruler&lt;ref name=Festival/&gt; without unwinding the skein, simply slipping the pencil under approximately an inch of the threads and holding a ruler against them.&lt;ref name=Festival/&gt;

Wrap the yarn around a large needle or a ruler. Make sure the yarn lies flat. Push the yarn together so there are no gaps between wraps. Smooth it out so it is neither too loose nor too tight. Measure the number of wraps per inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm). For better accuracy, measure the wraps at the center of your yarn sample.

The number of wraps will act as a gauge to assess the thickness of unmarked yarn; for example 12 wraps per inch is 12 WPI, and is used to calculate how much yarn is required for various articles,&lt;ref name=Festival&gt;[http://www.woolfestival.com/articles/wpi.htm Wraps per inch with tables]&lt;/ref&gt; so that 12 WPI is equivalent to 8 ply (worsted weight, medium weight) yarn.&lt;ref name=Festival/&gt;

==Swatch methods==
A more hands-on method, there is the Test swatch and the Gauge swatch. Knitting a Test swatch requires at its simplest, knitting the yarn into a small, roughly 4 in (10&amp;nbsp;cm) square textile of even stitches.&lt;ref name=Hiatt&gt;''The Principles of Knitting'' By June Hiatt, Simon &amp; Schuster. p.457&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing this with recommended needle sizes, yarn, and the knitter's own signature tension, allows for adjustments to all of these things. For example, changing needle size is one way to bring the test swatch nearer to an accurate measurement in yarn weight.&lt;ref name=Hiatt/&gt;

The Gauge swatch goes further. Not only is it a tool for checking whether yarn conforms to a desired dimension, but it is usually produced with some of the complexities of the intended project (i.e. multiple colours, varied stitches, edgings) making it a much larger test piece. This larger sample is then "dressed" meaning washed, ironed, and subjected to other processes expected of the finished item. It is especially used for items that require a lot of work and time, to avoid dimensional mistakes in the long run.&lt;ref name=Hiatt/&gt;

== Fabric ==

The following equation may be used to determine the weight of warp and weft required for a particular fabric:

*Weight of warp = (0.65 x qty. of fabric (metres) x no. of warp ends) / count

If there are two colors in the warp, use the following equations:

*Weight of color A (kg) = (0.65 x qty. of fabric (metres) x no. of warp ends of color A) / count of color A
*Weight of color B (kg) = (0.65 x Qty. of fabric (metres) x no. of warp ends of color B) / count of color B

If the counts of two warps are the same:

*Weight of color A (kg) = (total weight of warp reqd. x no. of ends of color A) / total no. of warp ends
*Weight of color B (kg) = (total weight of warp reqd. x no. of ends of color B) / total no. of warp ends

or

*Weight of color (B) = total weight of warp reqd. - weight of color A
*Weight of weft = (0.6 x qty. of fabric (metres) x PPI x reed space) / count

If there are two colors in the weft:

*Weight of color A (kg) = (0.6 x qty. of fabric (metres) x PPI of color A x reed space) / count of color A
*Weight of color B (kg) = (0.6 x qty. of fabric (metres) x PPI of color B x reed space) / count of color B

or

*Weight of color (B) = total weight of weft reqd. - weight of color A
* Another formula

# Reed x width / 7000 = Ans
# Ans x quantity (mtr) / count = The weight required (Kg)
