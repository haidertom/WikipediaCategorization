[[File:kilnerfig.jpg|thumb|200px|Representation of a human aura, after a diagram by [[Walter John Kilner]] (1847–1920).]]

An '''aura''' or '''human energy field''' is, according to [[New Age]] beliefs, a colored emanation said to enclose a human body or any animal or object.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=857}} In some esoteric positions, the aura is described as a [[subtle body]].{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=55}} [[Psychics]] and holistic medicine practitioners often claim to have the ability to see the size, color and type of vibration of an aura.{{sfn|Hines|2002|p=427}}

In New Age [[alternative medicine]], the human aura is seen as a hidden anatomy that affect the health of a client, and is often understood to comprise centers of vital force called [[chakra]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=857}} Such claims are not supported by [[scientific evidence]] and are [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn|Hines|2002|pp=362–69}} When tested under [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]], the ability to see auras has not been shown to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheiber|first1=Béla|last2=Selby|first2=Carla|title=Therapeutic Touch|date=2000|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=1573928046|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]], ''aura'' means wind, breeze or breath. It was used in [[Middle English]] to mean "gentle breeze". By the end of the 19th century, the word was used in some spiritualist circles to describe a speculated subtle emanation around the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=aura |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marques|first1=A.|title=The Human Aura: A Study|publisher=Office of Mercury|pages=1–2 and preface|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Jj9DAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Charles Webster Leadbeater.019.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] is credited with developing and popularizing the concept of auras.]]
The concept of auras was first popularized by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], a former priest of the Church of England and a member of the mystic [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=686}} Leadbeater had studied [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] in India, and believed he had the capacity to use his clairvoyant powers to make scientific investigations.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=193}} He claimed that he had discovered that most men come from Mars but the more advanced men come from the Moon, and that [[hydrogen]] atoms are made of six bodies contained in an egg-like form.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=220–22}} In his book ''Man Visible and Invisible'' published in 1903, Leadbeater illustrated the aura of man at various stages of his moral evolution, from the "savage" to the [[saint]].{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=235}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leadbeater|first1=Charles Webster|title=Man Visible and Invisible: Examples of Different Types of Men as Seen by Means of Trained Clairvoyance|date=2012|publisher=New Theosophical Press|isbn=9781471747038|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMTJAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Leadbeater introduced the modern conception of auras by incorporating the [[Tantra|Tantric]] notion of [[chakra]]s in his book ''The Inner Life''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=183}} But Leadbeater didn’t simply present the Tantric beliefs to the West, he reconstructed and reinterpreted them by mixing them with his own ideas, without acknowledging the sources of these innovations. Some of Leadbeater’s innovations are describing chakras as energy vortexes, and associating each of them with a gland, an organ and other body parts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=184–87}}

In the following years, Leadbeater’s ideas on the aura and chakras where adopted and reinterpreted by other Theosophists such as [[Rudolf Steiner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Rudolf|last2=Creeger|first2=Catherine E.|title=Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos|date=1994|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|location=Hudson, New York|isbn=0880103736|page=159|edition=3rd|url=https://steiner.presswarehouse.com/sites/steiner/research/archive/theosophy/theosophy.pdf|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edgar Cayce]], but his occult anatomy remained of minor interest within the esoteric counterculture until the 1980s, when it was picked up by the New Age movement.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=187}}

In 1977, American esotericist [[Christopher Hills]] published the book ''Nuclear Evolution: The Rainbow Body'', which presented a modified version of Leadbeater’s occult anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hills|first1=Christopher|title=Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body|date=1977|publisher=University of the Trees Press|location=Boulder Creek, California|isbn=9780916438098|page=36|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bXRWAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Leadbeater had drawn each chakras with intricately detailed shapes and multiple colors, Hills presented them as a sequence of centers, each one being associated with a color of the rainbow. Most of the subsequent New Age writers will base their representations of the aura on Hill’s interpretation of Leadbeater’s ideas.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=188}} Chakras became a part of mainstream esoteric speculations in the 1980s and 1990s. Many New Age techniques that aim to clear blockages of the chakras were developed during those years, such as [[crystal healing]] and aura-soma.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=92}} Chakras were, by the late 1990s, less connected with their theosophical  and Hinduist root, and more infused with New Age ideas. A variety of New Age books proposed different links between each chakras and colors, personality traits, illnesses, Christian sacraments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myss|first1=Caroline|title=Anatomy of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing|date=1997|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=9780609800140|page=71|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=NmwwRCv52SAC|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=189}} Various type of holistic healing within the New Age movement claim to use aura reading techniques, such as [[bioenergetic analysis]], [[energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and [[energy medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=Barbara Ann|title=Hands of Light: A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field|date=1988|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0553345397|pages=109–10|edition=Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?output=html_text&amp;id=M3dOAgz05bQC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Character+structure |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Kirlian photography}}
There have been numerous attempts to capture an energy field around the human body, going as far back as photographs by a French army officer in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baraduc|first1=Hippolyte|title=L'ame humaine: ses mouvements, ses lumières et l'iconographie de l'invisible fluidique|date=1896|publisher=G. Carré|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tD8wAAAAYAAJ|page=61|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supernatural interpretations of these images have often been the result of a lack of understanding of the simple natural phenomena behind them, such as heat emanating from a human body producing aura-like images under [[infrared photography]].&lt;ref name=Nickell&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Nickell |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/aura_photography_a_candid_shot/ |title=Aura Photography: A Candid Shot  |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baraducforcevital.tif|thumb|left|150px|Picture by Hippolyte Baraduc published in 1896, purported to show a "vital force" around a child.]]
In 1939, [[Semyon Davidovich Kirlian]] discovered that by placing an object or body part directly on photographic paper, and then passing a high voltage across the object, he would obtain the image of a glowing contour surrounding the object. This process became known as [[Kirlian photography]].{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=240–43}} Some parapsychologists, such as [[Thelma Moss]] of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], have proposed that these images show levels of psychic powers and bioenergies. However, studies have found that the Kirlian effect is caused by the presence of moisture on the object being photographed. Electricity produces an area of gas ionization around the object if it is moist, which is the case for living things. This causes an alternation of the electric charge pattern on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pehek|first1=JO|last2=Kyler|first2=HJ|last3=Faust|first3=DL|title=Image modulation in corona discharge photography |journal=Science |date=15 October 1976|volume=194|issue=4262|pages=263–70|pmid=968480}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rigorous experimentations, no mysterious process has been discovered in relation to the Kirlian photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=edited by Kendrick|title=The Hundredth monkey and other paradigms of the paranormal : a Skeptical inquirer collection|date=1991|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=0879756551|pages=209–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hines|2002|pp=427–28}}

More recent attempts at capturing auras include the Aura Imaging cameras and software introduced by Guy Coggins in 1992. Coggins claims that his software uses [[biofeedback]] data to color the picture of the subject. The technique has failed to yield reproducible results.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;

==Tests==
[[File:Aura_testing.jpg|thumb|right|An aura reader tested in a [[Scientific control|controlled experiment]] at the [[Observatoire Zététique]], May 2004]]

Tests of psychic abilities to observe alleged aura emanations have repeatedly been met with failure.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;

One test involved placing people in a dark room and asking the psychic to state how many auras she could observe. Only chance results were obtained.&lt;ref name="Loftin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftin|first1=Robert W.|title=Auras: Searching for the Light|journal=The Skeptical Inquirer|date=1990|volume=24|pages=403–09|publisher=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of auras has occasionally been tested on television. One test involved an ''aura reader'' standing on one side of a room with an opaque partition separating her from a number of slots which might contain either actual people or mannequins. The aura reader failed to identify the slots containing people, incorrectly stating that all contained people.&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/auras.html |title= Auras|accessdate=2006-12-15|work=The Skeptic's Dictionary| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061205221945/http://skepdic.com/auras.html| archivedate= 5 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another televised test another aura reader was placed before a partition where five people were standing. He claimed that he could see their auras from behind the partition. As each person moved out, the reader was asked to identify where that person was standing behind the slot. He identified 2 out of 5 correctly.&lt;ref name=Randi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZeQGld5QBU |title=James Randi tests an aura reader|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to prove the existence of auras scientifically have repeatedly met with failure; for example people are unable to see auras in complete darkness, and auras have never been successfully used to identify people when their identifying features are otherwise obscured in controlled tests.&lt;ref name=Nickell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loftin/&gt;&lt;ref name=skepdic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Randi/&gt; A 1999 study concluded that conventional sensory cues such as radiated body heat might be mistaken for evidence of a metaphysical phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Bernhardt/publication/230683042_Perception_of_Conventional_Sensory_Cues_as_an_Alternative_to_the_Postulated'Human_Energy_Field'of_Therapeutic_Touch/links/55eda87108aedecb68fb074e.pdf |title=Perception of Conventional Sensory Cues as an Alternative to the Postulated'Human Energy Field'of Therapeutic Touch (PDF Download Available) |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine.|year=1999|issue=Fall/Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanation==

Bridgette Perez in a review for the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' has written "perceptual distortions, illusions, and hallucinations might promote belief in auras... Psychological factors, including absorption, fantasy proneness, vividness of visual imagery, and after-images, might also be responsible for the phenomena of the aura."&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bridgette M. Perez |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_aura_a_brief_review/ |title=The Aura: A Brief Review  |publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in laboratory conditions have demonstrated that the aura is best explained as a visual illusion known as an [[afterimage]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser-Harris, D. F. (1932). ''A psycho physiological explanation of the so-called human "aura"''.  British Journal of Medical Psychology 12: 174–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale, A., Anderson, D. &amp; Wyman, L. (1978).  ''Perceptual Aura: Not Spirit but Afterimage and Border Contrast Effects''.  ''[[Perceptual and Motor Skills]]'' 47: 653–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Neurologists contend that people may perceive auras because of effects within the brain: [[epilepsy]], [[migraine]]s, or the influence of [[psychedelic drugs]] such as [[LSD]].&lt;ref name="ASID"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Donna L|last2=Daroff|first2=Robert B|last3=Ducros|first3=Anne|last4=Newman|first4=Nancy J|last5=Biousse|first5=Valérie|title=Most Cases Labeled as "Retinal Migraine" Are Not Migraine|journal=Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology|date=March 2007|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–8|doi=10.1097/WNO.0b013e3180335222|url=http://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2007&amp;issue=03000&amp;article=00002&amp;type=abstract|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fole"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/23/1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015956/http://neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/68/23/1995 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |title=Familial occipitotemporal lobe epilepsy and migraine with visual aura |publisher=Neurology.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Andrew Neher has written that "there is no good evidence to support the notion that auras are, in any way, psychic in origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neher|first1=Andrew|title=The Psychology of Transcendence|date=1990|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0486261670|pages=186–88|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that auras may be the result of [[synaesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/auras.html |title=auras – The Skeptic's Dictionary |publisher=Skepdic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2012 study discovered no link between auras and synaesthesia, concluding "the discrepancies found suggest that both phenomena are phenomenologically and behaviourally dissimilar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milán|first1=E.G.|last2=Iborra|first2=O.|last3=Hochel|first3=M.|last4=Rodríguez Artacho|first4=M.A.|last5=Delgado-Pastor|first5=L.C.|last6=Salazar|first6=E.|last7=González-Hernández|first7=A.|title=Auras in Mysticism and Synaesthesia: A Comparison|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=March 2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=258–68|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2011.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical neurologist [[Steven Novella]] has written "Given the weight of the evidence it seems that the connection between auras and synaesthesia is speculative and based on superficial similarities that are likely coincidental."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novella |first=Steven |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/05/07/is-aura-reading-synaesthesia-probably-not/ |title=Is Aura Reading Synaesthesia? Probably Not |publisher=Skepticblog |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes may include disorders within the [[visual system]] provoking optical effects.

* The book ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'', written by Cyril Henry Hoskin under the pseudonym [[Lobsang Rampa]], claims that Tibetan monks opened the spiritual third eye using [[trepanation]] in order to accelerate the development of clairvoyance and allow to see the aura. It also includes body gazing techniques purported to help achieve aura visualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rampa|first1=Lobsang|title=The Third Eye|date=1988|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=9780345340382|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered to be a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yapp|first1=Nick|title=Hoaxers and Their Victims|date=1993|publisher=Parkwest|location=London|isbn=9780860517818|pages=140–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodin|first1=Thierry|title=Imagining Tibet: Perceptions, Projections, and Fantasies|date=2001|publisher=Wisdom Publishing|location=Boston|isbn=9780861711918|pages=196–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is calculated to be responsible for the formation of most of the universe's [[helium]] as the [[Isotopes of helium|isotope]] [[helium-4]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He), along with small amounts of the hydrogen isotope [[deuterium]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H or D), the [[helium]] isotope [[helium-3]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He), and a very small amount of the [[lithium]] isotope [[lithium-7]] (&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li). In addition to these stable nuclei, two unstable or [[Radionuclide|radioactive]] isotopes were also produced: the heavy [[hydrogen]] isotope [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H or T); and the [[beryllium]] isotope [[beryllium-7]] (&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be); but these [[Radionuclide|unstable isotopes]] later decayed into &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li, as above.

Essentially all of the elements that are heavier than lithium were created much later, by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] in evolving and exploding stars.

==Characteristics==
There are several important characteristics of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN):
* The initial conditions (neutron-proton ratio) were set in the first second after the Big Bang.
* The universe was very close to homogeneous at this time, and strongly [[radiation]]-dominated. 
* The fusion of nuclei occurred between roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang; this corresponds to the temperature range when the universe was cool enough for deuterium to survive, but hot and dense enough for [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions to occur at a significant rate.&lt;ref name=RPP&gt;{{cite journal

* It was widespread, encompassing the entire [[observable universe]].

The key parameter which allows one to calculate the effects of BBN is the baryon/photon number ratio, which is a small number of order 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;. This parameter corresponds to the baryon density and controls the rate at which nucleons collide and react; from this it is possible to calculate element abundances after nucleosynthesis ends. Although the baryon per photon ratio is important in determining element abundances, the precise value makes little difference to the overall picture. Without major changes to the Big Bang theory itself, BBN will result in mass abundances of about 75% of hydrogen-1, about 25% [[helium-4]], about 0.01% of deuterium and [[helium-3]], trace amounts (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;) of lithium, and negligible heavier elements.  That the observed abundances in the universe are generally consistent with these abundance numbers is considered strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.

In this field, for historical reasons it is customary to quote the helium-4 fraction ''by mass'', symbol Y, so that 25% helium-4 means that helium-4 atoms account for 25% of the [[mass]], but less than 8% of the nuclei would be helium-4 nuclei. Other (trace) nuclei are usually expressed as number ratios to hydrogen.

==Important parameters==
The creation of light elements during BBN was dependent on a number of parameters; among those was the neutron-proton ratio (calculable from [[Standard Model|Standard Model physics]]) and the baryon-photon ratio.

===Neutron–proton ratio===
The neutron-proton ratio was set by Standard Model physics before the nucleosynthesis era, 
essentially within the first 1-second after the Big Bang. 
Neutrons can react with positrons or electron neutrinos to create protons and other products in one of the following reactions:
:&lt;chem&gt;n \ + e+ &lt;=&gt; \overline{\nu}_e + p  &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;n \ + \nu_{e} &lt;=&gt; p + e- &lt;/chem&gt;

At times much earlier than 1 sec, these reactions were fast and maintained the n/p ratio close to 1:1. As the temperature dropped, the equilibrium shifted in favour of protons due to their slightly lower mass, and the n/p ratio smoothly decreased.  
These reactions continued until the decreasing temperature and density caused the reactions to become too slow, which occurred at about T = 0.7 MeV (time around 1 second) and is called the freeze out temperature. At freeze out, the neutron-proton ratio was about 1/6. However, free neutrons are unstable with a mean life of 880 sec; some neutrons decayed in the next few minutes before fusing into any nucleus, so the ratio of total neutrons to protons after nucleosynthesis ends is about 1/7.  Almost all neutrons that fused instead of decaying ended up combined into helium-4, due to the fact that helium-4 has the highest [[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]] per nucleon among light elements. This predicts that about 8% of all atoms should be helium-4, leading to a mass fraction of helium-4 of about 25%, which is in line with observations. Small traces of deuterium and helium-3 remained as there was insufficient time and density for them to react and form helium-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon–photon ratio===
The baryon–photon ratio, η, is the key parameter determining the abundances of light elements after nucleosynthesis ends. Baryons and light elements can fuse in the following main reactions:
{|style="text-align:right;"

|

:&lt;chem&gt;p + n -&gt; ^2H + \gamma &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;p + ^2H -&gt; ^3He + \gamma &lt;/chem&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;^3He + ^2H -&gt; ^4He + p &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;^3H + ^2H -&gt; ^4He + n &lt;/chem&gt;
|}
along with some other low-probability reactions leading to &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li or &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be. 
(An important feature is that there are no stable nuclei with mass 5 or 8, which implies that reactions adding one baryon to &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, or fusing two &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, do not occur). 
Most fusion chains during BBN ultimately terminate in &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He (helium-4), while "incomplete" reaction chains lead to small amounts of left-over &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He; the amount of these decreases with increasing baryon-photon ratio. That is, the larger the baryon-photon ratio the more reactions there will be and the more efficiently deuterium will be eventually transformed into helium-4. This result makes deuterium a very useful tool in measuring the baryon-to-photon ratio.

==Sequence==
[[File:Scheme of nuclear reaction chains for Big Bang nucleosynthesis.svg|thumb|300px|The main nuclear reaction chains for Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]

Big Bang nucleosynthesis began roughly 10 seconds after the big bang, when the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow deuterium nuclei to survive disruption by high-energy photons. (Note that the neutron-proton freeze-out time was earlier). This time is essentially independent of dark matter content, since the universe was highly radiation dominated until much later, and this dominant component controls the temperature/time relation. At this time there were about 
six protons for every neutron, but a small fraction of the neutrons decay before fusing in the next few hundred seconds, so at the end of nucleosynthesis there are about seven protons to every neutron, and almost all the neutrons are in Helium-4 nuclei.  The sequence of these reaction chains is shown on the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Carlos A. | last=Bertulani | authorlink=Carlos Bertulani | title=Nuclei in the Cosmos | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4417-66-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feature of BBN is that the physical laws and constants that govern the behavior of matter at these energies are very well understood, and hence BBN lacks some of the speculative uncertainties that characterize earlier periods in the life of the universe. Another feature is that the process of nucleosynthesis is determined by conditions at the start of this phase of the life of the universe, and proceeds independently of what happened before.

As the universe expands, it cools. [[Free neutron]]s are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons have a strong tendency to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium. Before nucleosynthesis began, the temperature was high enough for many photons to have energy greater than the binding energy of deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed (a situation known as the '''deuterium bottleneck'''). Hence, the formation of helium-4 is delayed until the universe became cool enough for deuterium to survive (at about T = 0.1 MeV); after which there was a sudden burst of element formation. However, very shortly thereafter, around twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and density became too low for any significant fusion to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, and the only changes were the result of the [[radioactive]] decay of the two major unstable products of BBN, [[tritium]] and [[beryllium-7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Weiss | first = Achim | title = Equilibrium and change: The physics behind Big Bang Nucleosynthesis | url = http://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlights/BBN_phys/index.html | website = Einstein Online | accessdate = 2007-02-24 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208212219/http://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlights/BBN_phys/index.html | archivedate = 8 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of theory===
The history of Big Bang nucleosynthesis began with the calculations of [[Ralph Alpher]] in the 1940s. Alpher published the [[Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper]] that outlined the theory of light-element production in the early universe.

During the 1970s, there was a major puzzle in that the density of baryons as calculated by Big Bang nucleosynthesis was much less than the observed mass of the universe based on measurements of galaxy rotation curves and galaxy cluster dynamics. This puzzle was resolved in large part by postulating the existence of [[dark matter]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Heavy elements===
{{Nucleosynthesis periodic table.svg}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced very few nuclei of elements heavier than [[lithium]] due to a bottleneck: the absence of a stable nucleus with 8 or 5 [[nucleon]]s. This deficit of larger atoms also limited the amounts of lithium-7 produced during BBN. In [[stellar nucleosynthesis|stars]], the bottleneck is passed by triple collisions of helium-4 nuclei, producing [[carbon]] (the [[triple-alpha process]]). However, this process is very slow and requires much higher densities, taking tens of thousands of years to convert a significant amount of helium to carbon in stars, and therefore it made a negligible contribution in the minutes following the Big Bang.

The predicted abundance of CNO isotopes produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is expected to be on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; that of H, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, none of these primordial isotopes of the elements from lithium to oxygen have yet been detected, although those of beryllium and boron may be able to be detected in the future. So far, the only stable nuclides known experimentally to have been made before or during Big Bang nucleosynthesis are protium, deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1403.4156v1|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates|last2 = Vangioni|first2 = Elisabeth|class = astro-ph.CO|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helium-4===
{{Main article|Helium-4}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis predicts a primordial abundance of about 25% helium-4 by mass, irrespective of the initial conditions of the universe. As long as the universe was hot enough for protons and neutrons to transform into each other easily, their ratio, determined solely by their relative masses, was about 1 neutron to 7 protons (allowing for some decay of neutrons into protons). Once it was cool enough, the neutrons quickly bound with an equal number of protons to form first deuterium, then helium-4. Helium-4 is very stable and is nearly the end of this chain if it runs for only a short time, since helium neither decays nor combines easily to form heavier nuclei (since there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of 5 or 8, helium does not combine easily with either protons, or with itself). Once temperatures are lowered, out of every 16 nucleons (2 neutrons and 14 protons), 4 of these (25% of the total particles and total mass) combine quickly into one helium-4 nucleus. This produces one helium for every 12 hydrogens, resulting in a universe that is a little over 8% helium by number of atoms, and 25% helium by mass.

One analogy is to think of helium-4 as ash, and the amount of ash that one forms when one completely burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one burns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested that this might be the case, causing astrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Deuterium===
{{Main article|Deuterium}}
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Deuterium is in some ways the opposite of helium-4, in that while helium-4 is very stable and difficult to destroy, deuterium is only marginally stable and easy to destroy. The temperatures, time, and densities were sufficient to combine a substantial fraction of the deuterium nuclei to form helium-4 but insufficient to carry the process further using helium-4 in the next fusion step. BBN did not convert all of the deuterium in the universe to helium-4 due to the expansion that cooled the universe and reduced the density, and so cut that conversion short before it could proceed any further. One consequence of this is that, unlike helium-4, the amount of deuterium is very sensitive to initial conditions. The denser the initial universe was, the more deuterium would be converted to helium-4 before time ran out, and the less deuterium would remain.

There are no known post-Big Bang processes which can produce significant amounts of deuterium. Hence observations about deuterium abundance suggest that the universe is not infinitely old, which is in accordance with the Big Bang theory.

During the 1970s, there were major efforts to find processes that could produce deuterium, but those revealed ways of producing isotopes other than deuterium. The problem was that while the concentration of deuterium in the universe is consistent with the Big Bang model as a whole, it is too high to be consistent with a model that presumes that most of the universe is composed of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s.  If one assumes that all of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, the density of the universe is such that much of the currently observed deuterium would have been burned into helium-4.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The standard explanation now used for the abundance of deuterium is that the universe does not consist mostly of baryons, but that non-baryonic matter (also known as [[dark matter]]) makes up most of the mass of the universe.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  This explanation is also consistent with calculations that show that a universe made mostly of protons and neutrons would be far more ''clumpy'' than is observed.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Schramm (astrophysicist)|Schramm, D. N.]], ''The Big Bang and Other Explosions in Nuclear and Particle Astrophysics'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TtrxQGjYqU8C&amp;pg=PA175 p. 175].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very hard to come up with another process that would produce deuterium other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after no more than a few minutes. It would also be necessary for the deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Producing deuterium by fission is also difficult. The problem here again is that deuterium is very unlikely due to nuclear processes, and that collisions between atomic nuclei are likely to result either in the fusion of the nuclei, or in the release of free neutrons or [[alpha particles]]. During the 1970s, [[cosmic ray spallation]] was proposed as a source of deuterium. That theory failed to account for the abundance of deuterium, but led to explanations of the source of other light elements.

===Lithium===
{{Main article|Lithium}}
Lithium-7 and lithium-6 produced in the Big Bang are in the order of: lithium-7 to be 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; of all primordial nuclides; and lithium-6 around 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Primodal-lithium-problem-2012-arx"&gt;BD Fields [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.3551v1.pdf "The Primordial Lithium Problem"], ''Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science'' 2011 &lt;!-- Cited by 54--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurements and status of theory==
The theory of BBN gives a detailed mathematical description of the production of the light "elements" deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7. Specifically, the theory yields precise quantitative predictions for the mixture of these elements, that is, the primordial abundances at the end of the big-bang.

In order to test these predictions, it is necessary to reconstruct the primordial abundances as faithfully as possible, for instance by observing astronomical objects in which very little [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] has taken place (such as certain [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]]) or by observing objects that are very far away, and thus can be seen in a very early stage of their evolution (such as distant [[quasar]]s).

As noted above, in the standard picture of BBN, all of the light element abundances depend on the amount of ordinary matter ([[baryon]]s) relative to radiation ([[photons]]). Since the [[Cosmological Principle|universe is presumed to be homogeneous]], it has one unique value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. For a long time, this meant that to test BBN theory against observations one had to ask: can ''all'' of the light element observations be explained with a ''single value'' of the baryon-to-photon ratio? Or more precisely, allowing for the finite precision of both the predictions and the observations, one asks: is there some ''range'' of baryon-to-photon values which can account for all of the observations?

More recently, the question has changed: Precision observations of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]&lt;ref&gt;David Toback (2009). [http://bigbang.physics.tamu.edu/ChapterText/Ch12text.pdf "Chapter 12: Cosmic Background Radiation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706222531/http://bigbang.physics.tamu.edu/ChapterText/Ch12text.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Toback (2009). [http://bigbang.physics.tamu.edu/ChapterText/Ch13text.pdf "Unit 4: The Evolution Of The Universe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706223121/http://bigbang.physics.tamu.edu/ChapterText/Ch13text.pdf |date=2010-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] give an independent value for the baryon-to-photon ratio. Using this value, are the BBN predictions for the abundances of light elements in agreement with the observations?

The present measurement of helium-4 indicates good agreement, and yet better agreement for helium-3. But for lithium-7, there is a significant discrepancy between BBN and WMAP/Planck, and the abundance derived from [[Population II stars]]. The discrepancy is a factor of 2.4―4.3 below the theoretically predicted value and is considered a problem for the original models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Bitter Pill: The Primordial Lithium Problem Worsens |author=R.

==Non-standard scenarios==
In addition to the standard BBN scenario there are numerous non-standard BBN scenarios. These should not be confused with [[non-standard cosmology]]: a non-standard BBN scenario assumes that the Big Bang occurred, but inserts additional physics in order to see how this affects elemental abundances. These pieces of additional physics include relaxing or removing the assumption of homogeneity, or inserting new particles such as massive [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Soler, F. J. P., Froggatt, C. D., &amp; Muheim, F., eds., ''Neutrinos in Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology'' ([[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]: [[CRC Press]], 2009), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=mRGThuuYHgsC&amp;pg=PA362 p. 362].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been, and continue to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This has proved to be of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what has to happen before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable [[tau neutrino]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, R. W., ''The Cosmic Compendium: The Big Bang &amp; the Early Universe'' ([[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville, NC]]: [[Lulu (company)|Lulu Press, Inc.]], 2015), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=9U6yCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Board of Architectural Education''' is no longer appointed.  It had been a [[statutory body]] in the [[United Kingdom]] constituted under section 5 of the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931.

The Act was citable with two amending Acts as the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]]. Further amendments and changes enacted by the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]] included abolition of the statutory '''Board of Architectural Education'''.

==Nomination and appointment to the Board==

Subsection 5(1) of the 1931 Act had required the Board of Architecturaql Education to be appointed annually by the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK) ("the Council").  The Board was to be constituted in accordance with the Second Schedule of the Act.  This included:

* one person nominated by the [[Liverpool University|Liverpool School of Architecture]] and the nine other [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]] named in the Schedule;
* four persons nominated jointly by the Department of Architecture in the [[University of Cambridge]] and the eight other Schools of Architecture named in the Schedule;
* the Director of Education of the School of Architecture of the [[Architectural Association]] in [[London]];
* a total of 14 persons nominated by various other educational bodies, and
* 24 registered persons nominated by the Council.

==The Board's duty==

Subsection 5(2) of the 1931 Act had made it the duty of the Board (of Architectural Education) to recommend to the Council:

* the recognition of any examinations in architecture the passing of which ought, in the opinion of the Board (of Architectural Education), to qualify persons for registration in the Register of Registered Architects, and
* the holding of any examinations in architecture which ought, in the opinion of the Board (of Architectural Education), to be passed by applicants for registration.

==Statutory nomenclature==

The amendments to the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938]] which were made by the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 included the abolition of the statutory Board of Architectural Education and renaming the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] as the [[Architects Registration Board]].  The Board of Architectural Education is not mentioned in the [[Architects Act 1997]], which consolidated and replaced the Acts of 1931 to 1938, as amended by the Act of 1996.

By section 26, "the Board" in the Architects Act 1997 was henceforth to mean the registration body renamed as the [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB), which had previously been named the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4085">'''Brass Tablature''' is a rather rare form of music notation that applies to all brass instruments, but is most commonly found written for trumpet{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.  It consists of lines with partials, and numbers representing valve or slide positions.

==Examples==
The basic setup is shown here, with names of open notes for each partial on the left and rhythm or rhythmic notation above. The bottom line, indicating first-partial [[pedal tones]], is not usually used by trumpet or horn. The seventh partial (B&amp;#9837; on trumpet) is  This method is impractical in the [[altissimo]] range, because of fingering differences between horns.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Numbers are used to represent fingerings. For trumpet you may see true fingerings (0 or any combination of 1, 2, or 3) or,more commonly, positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). [[Trombone tablature]] will always have slide positions. Here is an example of a two octave C major scale for trumpet:

Three-valve instruments and trombones without valves have seven possible configurations or positions. Four-valve instruments, tenor [[trombones]] with [[F attachment]]s and bass trombones (potentially with multiple valves) are more complicated. The extra length of tubing utilized when instruments are extended by nearly half their length throws off the ratios of the other tubes' lengths, which were designed to produce half-steps without the extra fourth valve. Compensating euphoniums and tubas allow for this by having two sets of tubes for each of the first three valves. Non-compensating instruments and trombones must not use the third position or valve combination because it is not in tune; other combinations must be altered drastically. Some musicians prefer to extend the tablature numbering system to 12 or more; others prefer a symbol to indicate a lesser-used, longer valve. In this table, the symbol "/" is used to indicate an F-valve on the trombone or the fourth valve on a four-valved instrument.

'''Broadcast automation''' incorporates the use of [[broadcast programming]] technology to [[automate]] [[broadcasting]] operations.  Used either at a [[broadcast network]], [[radio station]] or a [[television station]], it can run a facility in the absence of a human [[Operator (profession)|operator]].  They can also run in a "live assist" mode when there are on-air personnel present at the [[master control]], [[television studio]] or [[control room]].

The [[radio transmitter]] end of the [[airchain]] is handled by a separate [[automatic transmission system]] (ATS).

==History==
Originally, in the USA, many (if not most) [[broadcast license|broadcast licensing]] authorities required a licensed [[board operator]] to run every station at all times, meaning that every [[DJ]] had to pass an exam to obtain a license to be on-air, if their duties also required them to ensure proper operation of the transmitter.  This was often the case on overnight and weekend [[shift work|shift]]s when there was no [[broadcast engineer]] present, and all of the time for small stations with only a contract engineer on call.

In the U.S., it was also necessary to have an operator on duty at all times in case the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] (EBS) was used, as this had to be triggered manually.  While there has not been a requirement to relay any other [[Warning system|warning]]s, any mandatory messages from the U.S. president would have had to first be [[Authentication|authenticated]] with a [[code word]] sealed in a pink envelope sent annually to stations by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).

Gradually, the quality and reliability of electronic equipment improved, regulations were relaxed, and no operator had to be present (or even available) while a station was operating.  In the U.S., this came about when the [[Emergency Alert System|EAS]] replaced the EBS, starting the movement toward automation to assist, and sometimes take the place of, the live [[disc jockey]]s (DJs) and [[radio personalities]].

==Early analog systems==
[[Image:WWJQAutomation.jpg|right|thumb|Harris automation system used at the former WWJQ (now [[WPNW]]) in 1993.]]
Early automation systems were [[electromechanical]] systems which used [[Repeater|relay]]s.  Later systems were "computerized" only to the point of maintaining a schedule, and were limited to radio rather than TV.  Music would be stored on [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] audio tape.  [[Subaudible tone]]s on the tape marked the end of each song.  The computer would simply rotate among the tape players until the computer's internal clock matched that of a scheduled event.  When a scheduled event would be encountered, the computer would finish the currently-playing song and then execute the scheduled block of events.  These events were usually [[Radio advertising|advertisements]], but could also include the station's top-of-hour [[station identification]], news, or a [[commercial bumper|bumper]] promoting the station or its other shows.  At the end of the block, the rotation among tapes resumed.

Advertisements, [[jingle]]s, and the top-of-hour station identification required by law were often on "carts".  Short for cartridges, these were endless tapes similar to [[Stereo-Pak|4-track tapes]], were mechanically identical as well, and were called [[Fidelipac]]s. The primary difference between carts and 4 track is two fold. The Cart had only two tracks and the 4-track (obviously) had four. The Cart ran at 7 and 1/2 [[Inch_per_second|IPS]] whereas the 4-Track ran at 3 and 3/4 IPS.  Carts had a slot for a pinch roller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wikimedia|first1=Commons|title=Cartridge Picture|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NAB-cartridge.jpg|website=Wikimedia Commons|publisher=Wikimedia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a spindle which was activated by solenoid upon pressing the start button on the cart machine.  The [[Tape_transport#Capstan|capstan]] was spinning at full speed and this allowed for nearly instantaneous playback start without artifacts.   Mechanical [[carousel]]s would rotate the carts in and out of multiple [[cassette deck|tape players]] as dictated by the computer.  Time announcements were provided by a pair of dedicated cart players, with the even minutes stored on one and the odd minutes on the other.  This meant an announcement would always be ready to play, even if the minute was changing when the announcement was triggered.  The system did require attention throughout the day to change reels as they ran out and reload carts.  It became obsolete when a method was developed to automatically rewind and re-cue the reel tapes when they ran out, extending 'walk-away' time indefinitely.

Radio station [[WSJM-FM|WIRX]] may have been one of the world's first completely automated radio stations, built and designed by Brian Jeffrey Brown in 1963 when Brown was only 10 years old.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  The station broadcast in a classical format, called "More Good Music (MGM)" and featured five-minute bottom-of-the-hour news feeds from the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].  The heart of the automation was an 8 x 24 telephone [[Stepping switch|stepping relay]] which controlled two reel-to-reel tape decks, one twelve inch [[Ampex]] machine providing the main program audio and a second [[RCA]] seven inch machine providing "fill" music.  The tapes played by these machines were originally produced in the [[Mid-West_Family_Broadcasting|Midwest Family Broadcasting]] (MWF) Madison, Wisconsin production facility by WSJM Chief Engineer Richard E. McLemore (and later in-house at WSJM) with sub-audible tones used to signal the end of a song.  The stepping relay was programmed by slide switches in the front of the two relay racks which housed the equipment.  The news feeds were triggered by a [[microswitch]] which was attached to a [[Western Union]] clock and tripped by the minute hand of the clock. and then reset the stepping relay.  Originally, 30-minute station identification was accomplished by a [[simulcast]] switch in the control booth for sister station [[WSJM (AM)]], whereupon the disc jockey in the booth would announce "This is WSJM-AM and... (then pressing the momentary contact button) ...WSJM-FM, St. Joseph, Michigan."  This only lasted about six months, however, and a standard tape cartridge player was wired in to announce the station identification and triggered by the Western Union clock.

[[Image:OpenReel-GMS204.jpg|size200px|thumb|Solidyne GMS200 tape recorder with computer self-adjustment. Argentina 1980-1990]]
A different technology appeared in 1980 with the analog recorders made by Solidyne, which used a computer-controlled tape positioning system.  Four GMS 204 units were controlled from a 6809 [[microprocessor]], with the program stored in a [[Solid-state drive|solid-state]] plug-in [[memory module (disambiguation)|memory module]]. This system has a limited programming time of about eight hours.

Satellite programming often used audible [[dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF) signals to trigger events at [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] stations.  This allowed the automatic local insertion of ads and station IDs.  Because there are 12 (or 16) tone pairs, and typically four tones were sent in rapid succession (less than one second), more events could be triggered than by sub-audible tones (usually 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and 35&amp;nbsp;Hz).

==Modern digital systems==

Modern systems run on [[hard disk]], where all of the music, jingles, advertisements, [[voice track]]s, and other announcements are stored.  These audio files may be either [[data compression|compressed]] or uncompressed, or often with only minimal compression as a compromise between file size and quality.  For [[radio software]], these disks are usually in computers, sometimes running their own custom [[operating system]]s, but more often running as an [[Application software|application]] on a PC operating system.
 
[[Scheduling (broadcasting)|Scheduling]] was an important advance of these systems, allowing for exact timing.  Some systems use [[GPS]] satellite [[receiver (radio)|receivers]] to obtain exact [[atomic time]], for perfect [[synchronization]] with satellite-delivered [[radio programming|programming]].  Reasonably-accurate timekeeping can also be obtained with the use of [[Internet protocol]]s (IP) like [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP).

Automation systems are also more interactive than ever before with [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with [[console automation]] and can even record from a [[telephone hybrid]] to play back an edited conversation with a telephone caller.  This is part of a system's live-assist mode.

The use of automation software and [[voice track]]s to replace live DJs is a current trend in radio broadcasting, done by many [[Internet radio]] and [[adult hits]] stations.  Stations can even be voice-tracked from another city far away, now often delivering sound files over the Internet.  In the U.S., this is a common practice under controversy for making radio more generic and artificial.  Having local content is also touted as a way for traditional stations to compete with [[satellite radio]], where there may be no [[radio personality]] on the air at all.

[[Image:Placa-audioPC-925.jpg|size100px|left|thumb|Solidyne 922: The first bit compression card for PC, 1990]]
A commercially available, for-sale product named [[Audicom]] was introduced by Oscar Bonello in 1989.&lt;ref name="solidyne1"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/Archivo/Nota.asp?nota_id=187775 LA NACION newspaper article about development of bit compression technology, Buenos Aires, February 5th, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[Audio compression (data)|psychoacoustic lossy compression]], the same principle being used in most modern lossy audio encoders such as [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC), and it allowed both broadcast automation and recording to [[hard drives]].&lt;ref name="solidyne2"&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2384 New Improvements in Audio Signal Processing for AM Broadcasting by Bonello, Oscar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solidyne3"&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=6674 PC-Controlled Psychoacoustic Audio Processor by Bonello, Oscar Juan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In television, [[playout]] [[automation]] is also becoming more practical as the storage space of [[hard drive]]s increases. [[Television shows]] and [[television commercials]], as well as [[digital on-screen graphic]]s (DOG or BUG), can all be stored on [[video server]]s remotely controlled by computers utilizing the [[9-Pin Protocol]] and the [[Video Disk Control Protocol]] (VDCP).  These systems can be very extensive, tied-in with parts that allow the "ingest" (as it is called in the industry) of video from satellite networks and [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG) operations and management of the video library, including archival of [[footage]] for later use.  In [[ATSC]], [[Programming Metadata Communication Protocol]] (PMCP) is then used to pass information about the video through the airchain to [[Program and System Information Protocol]] (PSIP), which transmits the current [[electronic program guide]] (EPG) information over digital television to the viewer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3137">[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] System '''H''' is an analog broadcast [[television]] system primarily used in Belgium, the Balkans and Malta on the UHF bands.

== Specifications ==

Some of the important specs are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference Data for Radio Engineers, ITT Howard W.Sams Co., New York, 1977, section 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Channel spacing for CCIR television System H (UHF Bands).jpg|frame|Channel spacing for CCIR television System H (UHF Bands)&lt;br&gt;The separation between the audio and video carriers is 5.5 MHz.]]
A frame is the total picture. The '''frame rate''' is the number of pictures displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice '''interleaving''' odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So '''field rate''' is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 625 '''lines''' (or 312.5 lines in a field.) So '''line rate''' (line frequency) is 625 times the frame frequency or 625•25=15625&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The RF parameters of the transmitted signal are almost the same as those for [[CCIR System B|System B]] which is used on the 7.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channels of the [[VHF]] bands. The only difference to the RF spectrum of the signal is that the vestigial sideband is 500&amp;nbsp;kHz wider at 1.25&amp;nbsp;MHz. Due to this and the extra width of the channel allocations at UHF, the width of the guard band between the channels is 650&amp;nbsp;kHz (assuming the worst case which is when NICAM sound is in use).

== System G ==

Many countries use a variant of system '''H''' which is known as [[CCIR System G|System G]]. System '''G''' is similar to system '''H''' but the lower (vestigial) side band is 500&amp;nbsp;kHz narrower. This makes poor use of the 8.0&amp;nbsp;MHz channels of the UHF bands by merely increasing the width of the guard-band by 500&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1.15&amp;nbsp;MHz. The advantage(?) is that the RF spectrum of system '''G''' (on UHF) is the same as system '''B''' (on VHF), simplifying the band-switching circuitry in VHF/UHF televisions.

More precisely, choreomusicology grew out of Euro-American performance traditions that considered musical composition and dance choreography as separate specialties. Not all performance genres separate music and dance into separate theoretical categories. The directionality of the relationship between sound and movement is not always fixed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Choreomusicology&lt;/ref&gt; Choreomusicologists hold that studying the variable relationships between sound and movement in diverse performance arts can provide insight into perceptual sensibilities, cultural processes, and interpersonal dynamics. Famous artists whose works exhibit rich choreomusical relationships include: [[John Cage]] and [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[George Balanchine]], and [[Louis Horst]] and [[Martha Graham]]. Interesting choreomusical relationships also exist in West Sumatran [[Tari Piring]], West Javanese [[Pencak Silat]], and Afro-Brazilian [[Capoeira]] to name but a few examples.&lt;ref&gt;http://jonathanstill.com/2012/03/02/new-choreomusicology-article/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = P.H. | year = 2012 | title = Music, dance and the total art work: choreomusicology in theory and practice | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14647893.2011.651116#preview | journal = Research in Dance Education | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | doi=10.1080/14647893.2011.651116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17411912.2014.926632 | volume=23 | title=Tapping the Plate or Hitting the Bottle: Sound and Movement in Self-accompanied and Musician-accompanied Dance | journal=Ethnomusicology Forum | pages=208–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commercial character design''' is the process of creating a character and utilising it to enhance or publicise a commercial entity through design. 

== Design process ==
Examples of characters which have been designed to be used in a commercial application are found throughout the modern world, on advertisement billboards, murals, graphic marketing within interior spaces and within recent years, as animations on the Internet. A character can appear in two dimension (2D) or as a three-dimensional design (3D) as modelled using a computer or traditionally sculpted. Commercial entities use characters which are designed to embody a [[brand image]] or enhance a sales campaign.

== Well-known designers ==
Well known design companies include:
*[[Walt Disney Company]] (animators and cartoonists)
*[[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] (advertisers)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Condom fatigue''' is a term used by medical professionals and [[safer sex]] educators to refer to the phenomenon of decreased condom use. It can also be used to describe a general weariness of and decreased effectiveness of safer sex messages. This is sometimes called "prevention fatigue".

The term has particularly been used to describe [[men who have sex with men]], though the term applies to people of all [[gender]]s and [[sexual orientation]]s.  Condom fatigue has been partially blamed for an increase in [[HIV]] infection rates, though this has not been substantiated in any study.

Condom fatigue is not a universal phenomenon. In Germany, condom use between new sexual partners has increased between 1994 and 2010 from 65% to 87%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bzga.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/hohes-schutzniveau-bei-hiv-aids-schutz-gegen-sexuell-uebertragbare-krankheiten-immer-wichtiger/|title=BZgA : Pressemitteilungen|first=Die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche|last=Aufklärung|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corbelled tomb''' is a generic term given to burial [[tomb]]s with [[corbel]]led roofs rather than simple slabs, which generally denote an earlier type of construction.

In Europe they include the [[Mycenaean period|Mycenean]] [[Beehive tombs|tholos]] tomb type.

A '''cortical modem''' is a type of brain machine interface that specifically inject images directly into the [[visual cortex]] by way of a [[direct neural interface]] (DNI) chip.  The true breakthrough goal lies in the information transfer speed.  Both computers and the human brain can transfer information at incredible speeds, and the real bottleneck in the field of brain-computer interaction is the lack of data transfer speeds between the two.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/17/darpas_google_glass_will_plug_straight_into_your_brain DARPA's 'Cortical Modem' will plug straight into your BRAIN], The Register, 17 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/203718-darpa-dreams-cortical-modems-and-neural-ramplants-for-restoring-active-memory DARPA dreams: cortical modems and neural RAMplants for restoring active memory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}
The '''cultural rights''' movement has provoked attention to protect the rights of groups of people, or their [[culture]], in similar fashion to the manner in which the [[human rights]] movement has brought attention to the needs of individuals throughout the world.

==Protecting a culture==
Cultural Rights are rights related to art and culture, both understood in a large sense. The objective of these rights is to guarantee that people and communities have an access to culture and can participate in the culture of their selection. Cultural rights are human rights that aim at assuring the enjoyment of culture and its components in conditions of equality, human dignity and non-discrimination. They are rights related to themes such as [[linguistic rights|language]]; cultural and artistic production; participation in cultural life; cultural heritage; intellectual property rights; [[cultural diversity|author’s rights]]; [[minority group|minorities]] and access to culture, among others. Focusing less on the preservation of cultures as an end in itself and more on the realization of "ecological" relations between cultural groups as a condition for equitable interactions and the potential for organic cultural change, Meyjes proposes the interchangeable terms cultural justice &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethno-cultural justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|pp=12, 381ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intercultural justice]] — which he defines as the principle of maximally accommodating the culturally-specific values and practices of minority groups and their members, in the form of rights, within the overall legal, regulatory, or policy limits of the institution, community, or society concerned (also see [[universalization]]).

==Ethnic Groups Cultural preservation==
Cultural rights of groups focus on such things as religious and ethnic minorities and indigenous societies that are in danger of disappearing. Cultural rights include a group’s ability to preserve its way of life, such as child rearing, continuation of [[language]], and security of its economic base in the nation, which it is located. The related notion of indigenous '''''intellectual property rights''''' (IPR) has arisen in attempt to conserve each society’s culture base and essentially prevent [[ethnocide]].

The cultural rights movement has been popularized because much traditional cultural knowledge has commercial value, like ethno-medicine, cosmetics, cultivated plants, foods, [[folklore]], arts, crafts, songs, dances, costumes, and [[rituals]]. Studying ancient cultures may reveal evidence about the history of the human race and shed more light on our origin and successive cultural development. However, the study, sharing and commercialization of such cultural aspects can be hard to achieve without infringing upon the cultural rights of those who are a part of that culture.

Cultural rights should be taken into consideration also by local policies. In that sense, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]], the first document with worldwide mission that advocates establishing the groundwork of an undertaking by cities and local governments for cultural development, includes as cultural rights as one of the principles and states: “''Local governments recognize that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, taking as their reference the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948)''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda21culture.net Agenda 21 for culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural anthropology==
"Cultural rights are vested not in individuals but in groups, such as religious and ethnic [[minority group|minorities]] and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies." All cultures are brought up differently, therefore cultural rights include a group's ability to preserve its culture, to raise its children in the ways it forebears, to continue its language, and to not be deprived of its economic base by the nation in which it is located." Anthropologists sometimes choose not to study some cultures beliefs and rights, because they believe that it may cause misbehavior, and they choose not to turn against different diversities of cultures. Although anthropologists sometimes do turn away from studying different cultures they still depend a lot on what they study at different archaeological sites.

'''Digital humanities''' ('''DH''') is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of [[computing]] or [[Information technology|digital technologies]] and the disciplines of the [[humanities]]. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the [[humanities]], as well as the reflection on their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/?page_id=13|title=Intro to Digital Humanities: Introduction|last=Drucker|first=Johanna|date=September 2013|website=UCLA Center for Digital Humanities|publisher=|access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/melissa-terras/DigitalHumanitiesInfographic.pdf|title=Quantifying Digital Humanities|last=Terras|first=Melissa|date=December 2011|website=UCL Centre for Digital Humanities|publisher=|access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; DH can be defined as new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/9780262018470_Open_Access_Edition.pdf|title=Digital_Humanities|last=Burdick|first=Anne|last2=Drucker|first2=Johanna|last3=Lunenfeld|first3=Peter|last4=Presner|first4=Todd|last5=Schnapp|first5=Jeffrey|publisher=MIT Press|year=November 2012|isbn=9780262312097|location=Open Access eBook|quote=|via=|access-date=2016-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026210950/https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/9780262018470_Open_Access_Edition.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching and research possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, a distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation, often simultaneously.

==Definition==
The definition of the digital humanities is being continually formulated by scholars and practitioners. Since the field is constantly growing and changing, specific definitions can quickly become outdated or unnecessarily limit future potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hla3uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Digital+Humanities+in+practice|title=Digital Humanities in Practice|last=Warwick|first=Claire|last2=Terras|first2=Melissa|last3=Nyhan|first3=Julianne|date=2012-10-09|publisher=Facet Publishing|isbn=9781856047661|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume of ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' (2016) acknowledges the difficulty in defining the field: "Along with the digital archives, quantitative analyses, and tool-building projects that once characterized the field, DH now encompasses a wide range of methods and practices: visualizations of large image sets, 3D modeling of historical artifacts, 'born digital' dissertations, [[hashtag activism]] and the analysis thereof, [[alternate reality game]]s, mobile makerspaces, and more. In what has been called 'big tent' DH, it can at times be difficult to determine with any specificity what, precisely, digital humanities work entails."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/2|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|website=dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the digital humanities developed out of humanities computing and has become associated with other fields, such as humanistic computing, social computing, and media studies. In concrete terms, the digital humanities embraces a variety of topics, from curating online collections of primary sources (primarily textual) to the [[data mining]] of large cultural data sets to [[topic modeling]]. Digital humanities incorporates both digitized (remediated) and [[born-digital]] materials and combines the methodologies from traditional humanities disciplines (such as [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[art]], [[archaeology]], [[music]], and [[cultural studies]]) and social sciences,&lt;ref name="digital-humanities-network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Humanities Network|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.cam.ac.uk/|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with tools provided by [[computing]] (such as [[hypertext]], [[hypermedia]], [[data visualisation]], [[information retrieval]], data mining, [[statistics]], [[text mining]], [[digital mapping]]), and [[electronic publication|digital publishing]]. Related subfields of digital humanities have emerged like [[software studies]], platform studies, and [[critical code studies]]. Fields that parallel the digital humanities include [[new media studies]] and [[information science]] as well as [[media theory of composition]], [[game studies]], particularly in areas related to digital humanities project design and production, and [[cultural analytics]].

[[File:Digital Humanities Stack (from Berry and Fagerjord 2017- 18).jpg|thumb|The Digital Humanities Stack (from Berry and Fagerjord, ''Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age'')]]

Berry and Fagerjord have suggested that a way to reconceptualise digital humanities could be through a "digital humanities stack". They argue that "this type of diagram is common in computation and computer science to show how technologies are ‘stacked’ on top of each other in increasing levels of abstraction. Here, [they] use the method in a more illustrative and creative sense of showing the range of activities, practices, skills, technologies and structures that could be said to make up the digital humanities, with the aim of providing a high-level map."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the "diagram can be read as the bottom levels indicating some of the fundamental elements of the digital humanities stack, such as computational thinking and knowledge representation, and then other elements that later build on these. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Digital humanities descends from the field of humanities computing, whose origins reach back to the 1930s and1940s in the pioneering work of English professor [[Josephine Miles]] and Jesuit scholar [[Roberto Busa]] and the women they employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Heffernan|first1=Laura|last2=Sagner Buurma|first2=Rachel|date=2018-04-11|title=Search and Replace: Josephine Miles and the Origins of Distant Reading|url=https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/search-and-replace|journal=Modernism / Modernity Print+|volume=3|issue=1|accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=svensson&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1938-4122| volume = 3| issue = 3| last = Svensson| first = Patrik| title = Humanities Computing as Digital Humanities| journal = Digital Humanities Quarterly| accessdate = 2012-05-30| year = 2009| url = http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000065/000065.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hockney&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Blackwell| isbn = 1405103213| editors = Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth (eds.)| last = Hockney| first = Susan| title = Companion to Digital Humanities| chapter = The History of Humanities Computing| location = Oxford| series = Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture| year = 2004| url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-2-1&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-2-1&amp;brand=9781405103213_brand}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[IBM]], they created a computer-generated concordance to [[Thomas Aquinas]]' writings known as the ''Index Thomisticus''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other scholars began using mainframe computers to automate tasks like word-searching, sorting, and counting, which was much faster than processing information from texts with handwritten or typed index cards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the decades which followed archaeologists, classicists, historians, literary scholars, and a broad array of humanities researchers in other disciplines applied emerging computational methods to transform humanities scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1  = Feeney| first1 = Mary| last2  = Ross| first2 = Seamus| lastauthoramp = yes| title   = Information Technology in Humanities Scholarship, British Achievements, Prospects, and Barriers | journal = Historical Social Research| volume  = 19| issue   = 1 (69)| year    = 1994| pages = 3–59| jstor=20755828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berryandfagerjord&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Polity| isbn = 978-0-7456-9765-9 | last1 = Berry| first1 = David M. | last2 = Fagerjord| first2 = Anders | title = Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age | location = Cambridge | year = 2017 | url=http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0745697658,subjectCd-CO30.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tara McPherson has pointed out, the digital humanities also inherit practices and perspectives developed through many artistic and theoretical engagements with electronic screen culture beginning the late 1960s and 1970s. These range from research developed by organizations such as [[SIGGRAPH]] to creations by artists such as [[Charles and Ray Eames]] and the members of [[Experiments in Art and Technology|E.A.T.]] (Experiments in Art and Technology). The Eames and E.A.T. explored nascent computer culture and intermediality in creative works that dovetailed technological innovation with art.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Tara. "DH by Design: Feminism, aesthetics + the digital.” Congress of the Social Science and Humanities. University of Calgary, 2016-05-31. Keynote.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first specialized journal in the digital humanities was ''Computers and the Humanities'', which debuted in 1966. The Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) were then founded in 1977 and 1978, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Soon, there was a need for a standardized protocol for tagging digital texts, and the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) was developed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The TEI project was launched in 1987 and published the first full version of the ''TEI Guidelines'' in May 1994.&lt;ref name=hockney /&gt; TEI helped shape the field of electronic textual scholarship and led to [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML), which is a tag scheme for digital editing. Researchers also began experimenting with databases and hypertextual editing, which are structured around links and nodes, as opposed to the standard linear convention of print.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the nineties, major digital text and image archives emerged at centers of humanities computing in the U.S. (e.g. the ''[[Women Writers Project]]'', the ''[http://www.rossettiarchive.org/ Rossetti Archive]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, University of Virginia| editor = Jerome J. McGann | title = Rossetti Archive| accessdate = 2012-06-16| date =| url = http://www.rossettiarchive.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The William Blake Archive]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| publisher = | editors = Morris Eaves, Robert Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| title = The William Blake Archive| accessdate = 2012-06-16| date =| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which demonstrated the sophistication and robustness of text-encoding for literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0093-1896| volume = 31| issue = 1| pages = 49–84| last = Liu| first = Alan| title = Transcendental Data: Toward a Cultural History and Aesthetics of the New Encoded Discourse| journal = Critical Inquiry| year = 2004| jstor = 10.1086/427302| doi=10.1086/427302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of personal computing and the World Wide Web meant that Digital Humanities work could become less centered on text and more on design. The multimedia nature of the internet has allowed Digital Humanities work to incorporate audio, video, and other components in addition to text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The terminological change from "humanities computing" to "digital humanities" has been attributed to [[John Unsworth]], Susan Schreibman, and Ray Siemens who, as editors of the anthology ''A Companion to Digital Humanities'' (2004), tried to prevent the field from being viewed as "mere digitization."&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Fitzpatrick| first = Kathleen| title = The humanities, done digitally| work = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2011-07-10| date = 2011-05-08| url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-Humanities-Done-Digitally/127382/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the hybrid term has created an overlap between fields like rhetoric and composition, which use "the methods of contemporary humanities in studying digital objects,"&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick"/&gt; and digital humanities, which uses "digital technology in studying traditional humanities objects".&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick" /&gt; The use of computational systems and the study of computational media within the arts and humanities more generally has been termed the 'computational turn'.&lt;ref name="berry"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Berry| first = David| title = The Computational Turn: Thinking About the Digital Humanities| work = Culture Machine| accessdate = 2012-01-31| date = 2011-06-01| url = http://culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/viewDownloadInterstitial/440/470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) launched the Digital Humanities Initiative (renamed Office of Digital Humanities in 2008), which made widespread adoption of the term "digital humanities" all but irreversible in the United States.&lt;ref name="kirschenbaum-dept" /&gt;

Digital humanities emerged from its former niche status and became "big news"&lt;ref name="kirschenbaum-dept"&gt;{{Cite news| volume =| issue = 150| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew G. | title = What is Digital Humanities and What's it Doing in English Departments?| work = ADE Bulletin| accessdate = | year = 2010| url = http://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/kirschenbaum_ade150.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the 2009 [[Modern Language Association|MLA convention]] in Philadelphia, where digital humanists made "some of the liveliest and most visible contributions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0009-5982| last = Howard| first = Jennifer| title = The MLA Convention in Translation| work = The Chronicle of Higher Education | accessdate = 2012-05-31| date = 2009-12-31| url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-MLA-Convention-in/63379/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had their field hailed as "the first 'next big thing' in a long time."&lt;ref name="pannapacker-mla"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Pannapacker| first = William| title = The MLA and the Digital Humanities| work = Brainstorm| format = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2012-05-30| date = 2009-12-28| url = http://chronicle.com/blogPost/The-MLAthe-Digital/19468/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Values and methods ==
Although digital humanities projects and initiatives are diverse, they often reflect common values and methods.&lt;ref name="Northwestern University Library"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Honn|first1=Josh|title=A Guide to Digital Humanities: Values Methods|url=http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919224700/http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 September 2015|publisher=Northwestern University Library|accessdate=19 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can help in understanding this hard-to-define field.&lt;ref&gt;Find accessible, brief descriptions of each at [https://web.archive.org/web/20150919224700/http://sites.northwestern.edu/guidetodh/values-methods/ A Guide to Digital Humanities archived site].&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the value of being open and accessible, many digital humanities projects and journals are [[open access]] and/or under Creative Commons licensing, showing the field's "commitment to [[open standards]] and [[open source]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities|last=Bradley|first=John|publisher=Ashgate|year=2012|isbn=9781409410683|editors=Marilyn Deegan and Willard McCarty (eds.)|location=Farnham and Burlington|pages=11–26 [14]|chapter=No job for techies: Technical contributions to research in digital humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open access is designed to enable anyone with an internet-enabled device and internet connection to view a website or read an article without having to pay, as well as share content with the appropriate permissions.

Digital humanities scholars use computational methods either to answer existing research questions or to challenge existing theoretical paradigms, generating new questions and pioneering new approaches. One goal is to systematically integrate computer technology into the activities of humanities scholars,&lt;ref name="neh-odh-grant-opportunities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/ODH/Grant|title=Grant Opportunities|work=National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities Grant Opportunities|accessdate=25 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is done in contemporary empirical [[social sciences]]. Yet despite the significant trend in digital humanities towards networked and multimodal forms of knowledge, a substantial amount of digital humanities focuses on documents and text in ways that differentiate the field's work from digital research in [[media studies]], [[information studies]], [[communication studies]], and [[sociology]]. Another goal of digital humanities is to create scholarship that transcends textual sources. This includes the integration of [[multimedia]], [[metadata]], and dynamic environments (see [[The Valley of the Shadow]] project at the [[University of Virginia]], the [[Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular]] at [[University of Southern California]], or Digital Pioneers projects at Harvard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pioneers.darthcrimson.org/|title=Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing - Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing|website=Harvard University Arts &amp; Humanities Research Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A growing number of researchers in digital humanities are using computational methods for the analysis of large cultural data sets such as the [[Google Books]] corpus.&lt;ref name="Roth 2014"&gt;Roth, S. (2014), "Fashionable functions. A Google n-gram view of trends in functional differentiation (1800-2000)", ''International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction'', Band 10, Nr. 2, S. 34-58 (online: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2491422).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such projects were highlighted by the Humanities High Performance Computing competition sponsored by the Office of Digital Humanities in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/grant-news/grant-announcement-humanities-high-performance-computing-program|title=Grant Announcement for Humanities High Performance Computing Program|last=Bobley|first=Brett|date=December 1, 2008|work=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the Digging Into Data challenge organized in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.diggingintodata.org/Home/AwardRecipients2009/tabid/175/Default.aspx|title=Awardees of 2009 Digging into Data Challenge|work=Digging into Data|year=2009|accessdate=May 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517011354/http://www.diggingintodata.org/Home/AwardRecipients2009/tabid/175/Default.aspx|archivedate=May 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2012-01-03|title=NEH Announces Winners of 2011 Digging Into Data Challenge|date=January 3, 2012|work=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by NEH in collaboration with NSF,&lt;ref name="cohen-embrace"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/arts/17digital.html?pagewanted=all|title=Humanities Scholars Embrace Digital Technology|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|date=2010-11-16|work=The New York Times|location=New York|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in partnership with [[Joint Information Systems Committee|JISC]] in the UK, and [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council|SSHRC]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub151|title=Computationally Intensive Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences: A Report on the Experiences of First Respondents to the Digging Into Data Challenge|last=Williford|first=Christa|date=June 2012|work=Council on Library and Information Resources|last2=Henry|first2=Charles|ISBN=978-1-932326-40-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to books, historical newspapers can also be analyzed with big data methods.

Digital humanities is also involved in the creation of software, providing "environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is 'born digital' and lives in various digital contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cnx.org/content/m34246/latest/|title=Digital Humanities 2.0: A Report on Knowledge|last=Presner|first=Todd|work=Connexions|year=2010|accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the field is sometimes known as computational humanities.[[File:Tripletsnew2012.png|thumb|right|Narrative network of US Elections 2012&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Automated analysis of the US presidential elections using Big Data and network analysis; S Sudhahar, GA Veltri, N Cristianini; Big Data &amp; Society 2 (1), 1-28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Tools ==
Digital humanities scholars use a variety of digital tools for their research, which may take place in an environment as small as a mobile device or as large as a [[virtual reality]] lab. Environments for "creating, publishing and working with digital scholarship include everything from personal equipment to institutes and software to cyberspace."&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Eileen and Ronald G. Musto. (2015). [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/general/digital-humanities-primer-students-and-scholars?format=PB ''The Digital Humanities: A Primer for Students and Scholars.''] Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars use advanced programming languages and databases, while others use less complex tools, depending on their needs. DiRT (Digital Research Tools Directory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dirtdirectory.org/|title=Welcome // - DiRT Directory|website=dirtdirectory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) offers a registry of digital research tools for scholars. TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca/home|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170929202656/http://tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca/home|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-09-29|title=TAPoR|website=tapor-test.artsrn.ualberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a gateway to text analysis and retrieval tools. An accessible, free example of an online textual analysis program is [[Voyant Tools]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyant-tools.org/|title=Voyant Tools|website=voyant-tools.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which only requires the user to copy and paste either a body of text or a URL and then click the 'reveal' button to run the program. There is also an online list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital|title=dhresourcesforprojectbuilding [licensed for non-commercial use only] / Digital Humanities Tools|website=dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of online or downloadable Digital Humanities tools that are largely free, aimed toward helping students and others who lack access to funding or institutional servers. Free, open source web publishing platforms like [[WordPress]] and [[Omeka]] are also popular tools. [[File:Poemage.png|thumb|300px|Example of a visualization tool used to study poetry in a new way with [http://www.sci.utah.edu/~nmccurdy/Poemage/ Poemage] ]]

== Projects ==
Digital humanities projects are more likely than traditional humanities work to involve a team or a lab, which may be composed of faculty, staff, graduate or undergraduate students, information technology specialists, and partners in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Credit and authorship are often given to multiple people to reflect this collaborative nature, which is different from the sole authorship model in the traditional humanities (and more like the natural sciences).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are thousands of digital humanities projects, ranging from small-scale ones with limited or no funding to large-scale ones with multi-year financial support. Some are continually updated while others may not be due to loss of support or interest, though they may still remain online in either a [[beta version]] or a finished form. The following are a few examples of the variety of projects in the field:&lt;ref&gt;See [https://wiki.commons.gc.cuny.edu/Sample_Projects/ CUNY Academic Commons Wiki Archive] for more.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital archives===

The [[Women Writers Project]] (begun in 1988) is a long-term research project to make pre-Victorian women writers more accessible through an electronic collection of rare texts. The Walt Whitman Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitmanarchive.org/|title=The Walt Whitman Archive|website=www.whitmanarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (begun in the 1990s) sought to create a hypertext and scholarly edition of [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]]’s works and now includes photographs, sounds, and the only comprehensive current bibliography of Whitman criticism. The Emily Dickinson Archive (begun in 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/features/dickinson/|title=Emily Dickinson, From Fascicle to Open Access {{!}} Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|access-date=2016-12-26}}. See [http://www.edickinson.org/ Emily Dickinson Archive website]&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of high-resolution images of [[Emily Dickinson|Dickinson]]’s poetry manuscripts as well as a searchable lexicon of over 9,000 words that appear in the poems. [[File:Humanités Numériques.JPG|thumb|300px|Example of [[social network analysis|network analysis]] as an archival tool at the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva.

The Slave Societies Digital Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/esss/|title=Homepage|website=Slave Societies Digital Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources for Slave Societies), directed by Jane Landers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/jane-landers/|title=People|website=Department of History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hosted at Vanderbilt University, preserves endangered ecclesiastical and secular documents related to Africans and African-descended peoples in slave societies. This Digital Archive currently holds 500,000 unique images, dating from the 16th to the 20th centuries, and documents the history of between 6 and 8 million individuals. They are the most extensive serial records for the history of Africans in the Atlantic World and also include valuable information on the indigenous, European, and Asian populations who lived alongside them. 

The involvement of librarians and archivists plays an important part in digital humanities projects because of the recent expansion of their role so that it now covers [[digital curation]], which is critical in the preservation, promotion, and access to digital collections, as well as the application of scholarly orientation to digital humanities projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Curation in the Digital Humanities: Preserving and Promoting Archival and Special Collections|last=Sabharwal|first=Arjun|publisher=Elsevier|year=2015|isbn=9780081001431|location=Waltham, MA|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific example involves the case of initiatives where archivists help scholars and academics build their projects through their experience in evaluating, implementing, and customizing metadata schemas for library collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Supporting Digital Humanities for Knowledge Acquisition in Modern Libraries|last=Sacco|first=Kathleen|publisher=IGI Global|year=2015|isbn=9781466684447|location=Hershey, PA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiatives at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] is another example of a digital humanities project. These include the digitization of 17th-century manuscripts, an electronic corpus of Mexican history from the 16th to 19th century, and the visualization of pre-Hispanic archaeological sites in [[3D computer graphics|3-D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities in Practice|last=Warwick|first=Claire|last2=Terras|first2=Melissa|last3=Nyhan|publisher=Facet Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9781856047661|location=London|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Cultural analytics===

"Cultural analytics" refers to the use of computational method for exploration and analysis of large visual collections and also contemporary digital media. The concept was developed in 2005 by [[Lev Manovich]] who then established the Cultural Analytics Lab in 2007 at Qualcomm Institute at California Institute for Telecommunication and Information (Calit2). The lab has been using methods from the field of computer science called Computer Vision many types of both historical and contemporary visual media—for example, all covers of ''Time'' magazine published between 1923 and 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2016/04/timeline-4535-time-magazine-covers-1923.html|title=Timeline: 4535 Time Magazine Covers, 1923-2009|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20,000 historical art photographs from the collection in Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2016/04/exploratory-visualizations-of-thomas.html|title=A View from Above: Exploratory Visualizations of MoMA Photography Collection|last=|first=|authorlink=Nadav Hochman and Lev Manovich|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one million pages from Manga books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lab.culturalanalytics.info/2010/11/one-million-manga-pages_14.html|title=Exploring One Million Manga Pages with Supercomputers and HIPerSpace|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 16 million images shared on Instagram in 17 global cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/instagram-and-contemporary-image|title=Instagram and Contemporary Image|last=Manovich|first=Lev|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural analytics also includes using methods from media design and data visualization to create interactive visual interfaces for exploration of large visual collections e.g., Selfiecity and On Broadway.

Cultural Analytics research is also addressing a number of theoretical questions. How can we "observe" giant cultural universes of both user-generated and professional media content created today, without reducing them to averages, outliers, or pre-existing categories? How can work with large cultural data help us question our stereotypes and assumptions about cultures? What new theoretical cultural concepts and models are required for studying global digital culture with its new mega-scale, speed, and connectivity? 

The term “cultural analytics” (or “culture analytics”) is now used by many other researchers, as exemplified by two academic symposiums,&lt;ref&gt;“[http://neubauercollegium.uchicago.edu/events/uc/cultural_analytics/ Cultural Analytics: Computational Approaches to the Study of Culture],” the University of Chicago, May 2015 and “[https://sites.google.com/nd.edu/ca2017/home Cultural Analytics symposium],” Notre Dame University, May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; a four-month long research program at UCLA that brought together 120 leading researchers from university and industry labs,&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/culture-analytics/ Culture Analytics program],” Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), UCLA, March 7–June 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; an academic peer-review ''Journal of Cultural Analytics: CA'' established in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturalanalytics.org/about/|title=Journal of Cultural Analytics: CA|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academic job listings.

===Textual mining, analysis, and visualization===

WordHoard (begun in 2004) is a free application that enables scholarly but non-technical users to read and analyze, in new ways, deeply-tagged texts, including the canon of Early Greek epic, [[Chaucer]], [[Shakespeare]], and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]. The Republic of Letters (begun in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2013/novemberdecember/feature/mapping-the-republic-letters|title=Mapping the Republic of Letters|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeks to visualize the social network of Enlightenment writers through an interactive map and visualization tools. Network analysis and data visualization is also used for reflections on the field itself – researchers may produce network maps of social media interactions or infographics from data on digital humanities scholars and projects.[[File:Digital Humanities on Twitter.png|thumb|Network analysis: graph of Digital Humanities Twitter users]]

===Analysis of macroscopic trends in cultural change===

[[Culturomics]] is a form of [[computational lexicology]] that studies [[human behavior]] and [[cultural trends]] through the [[Statistics|quantitative analysis]] of digitized texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Patricia | last=Cohen | title=In 500 Billion Words, New Window on Culture | newspaper=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/books/17words.html | date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Brian|last=Hayes|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.12418,y.2011,no.3,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx|title=Bit Lit|journal=[[American Scientist]]|volume=99|issue=3|page=190|doi=10.1511/2011.90.190|date=May–June 2011|access-date=2017-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018204747/http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.12418,y.2011,no.3,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers [[data mining|data mine]] large [[digital archive]]s to investigate cultural phenomena reflected in language and word usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.amhighed.com/documents/charleston2011/AIHE2011_Proceedings.pdf#page=228 | first=David W. |last=Letcher | title=Cultoromics: A New Way to See Temporal Changes in the Prevalence of Words and Phrases | journal=American Institute of Higher Education 6th International Conference Proceedings | volume=4 | issue=1 | page=228 | date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is an American [[neologism]] first described in a 2010 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article called ''Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books'', co-authored by Harvard researchers Jean-Baptiste Michel and [[Erez Lieberman Aiden]].&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Jean-Baptiste | last1=Michel | first2=Erez | last2=Liberman Aiden | title=Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=16 December 2010 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2010/12/15/science.1199644 | doi=10.1126/science.1199644 | pmid=21163965 | volume=331 | issue=6014 | pmc=3279742 | pages=176–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study&lt;ref name="Lansdall-Welfare 201606380"/&gt; published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] compared the trajectory of n-grams over time in both digitised books from the 2010 [[Science (journal)|Science]] article&lt;ref name="Jean" /&gt; with those found in a large corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom over the course of 150 years. The study further went on to use more advanced [[Natural language processing]] techniques to discover macroscopic trends in history and culture, including gender bias, geographical focus, technology, and politics, along with accurate dates for specific events.

===Online publishing===

The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (begun in 1995) is a dynamic reference work of terms, concepts, and people from philosophy maintained by scholars in the field. [https://mla.hcommons.org/ MLA Commons] offers an open peer-review site (where anyone can comment) for their ongoing curated collection of teaching artifacts in ''[https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/ Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments]'' (2016). The ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' platform contains volumes of the open-access book of the same title (2012 and 2016 editions) and allows readers to interact with material by marking sentences as interesting or adding terms to a crowdsourced index.

==Criticism==
Lauren F. Klein and Matthew K. Gold have identified a range of criticisms in the digital humanities field: "'a lack of attention to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; a preference for research-driven projects over pedagogical ones; an absence of political commitment; an inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; an inability to address texts under copyright; and an institutional concentration in well-funded research universities".&lt;ref name="dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Berry and Fagerjord have argued that a digital humanities should "focus on the need to think critically about the implications of computational imaginaries, and raise some questions in this regard. This is also to foreground the importance of the politics and norms that are embedded in digital technology, algorithms and software. We need to explore how to negotiate between close and distant readings of texts and how micro-analysis and macro-analysis can be usefully reconciled in humanist work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Liu has argued, "while digital humanists develop tools, data, and metadata critically, therefore (e.g., debating the ‘ordered hierarchy of content objects’ principle; disputing whether computation is best used for truth finding or, as Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann put it, ‘deformance’; and so on) rarely do they extend their critique to the full register of society, economics, politics, or culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Alan|url=http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/where-is-cultural-criticism-in-the-digital-humanities/|publisher=UCSB|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these concerns have given rise to the emergent subfield of Critical Digital Humanities (CDH): &lt;blockquote&gt;"Some key questions include: how do we make the invisible become visible in the study of software? How is knowledge transformed when mediated through code and software? What are the critical approaches to Big Data, visualization, digital methods, etc.? How does computation create new disciplinary boundaries and gate-keeping functions? What are the new hegemonic representations of the digital – ‘geons’, ‘pixels’, ‘waves’, visualization, visual rhetorics, etc.? How do media changes create epistemic changes, and how can we look behind the ‘screen essentialism’ of computational interfaces? Here we might also reflect on the way in which the practice of making- visible also entails the making-invisible – computation involves making choices about what is to be captured. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age|last=Berry|first=David M.|last2=Fagerjord|publisher=Polity|year=2017|isbn=9780745697666|location=UK|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Negative publicity===

Klein and Gold note that many appearances of the digital humanities in public media are often in a critical fashion. Armand Leroi, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', discusses the contrast between the algorithmic analysis of themes in literary texts and the work of Harold Bloom, who qualitatively and phenomenologically analyzes the themes of literature over time. Leroi questions whether or not the digital humanities can provide a truly robust analysis of literature and social phenomenon or offer a novel alternative perspective on them. The literary theorist [[Stanley Fish]] claims that the digital humanities pursue a revolutionary agenda and thereby undermine the conventional standards of "pre-eminence, authority and disciplinary power."&lt;ref name="fish-mortality"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/|title=The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality|last=Fish|first=Stanley|date=2012-01-09|work=The New York Times|location=New York|accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, digital humanities scholars note that "Digital Humanities is an extension of traditional knowledge skills and methods, not a replacement for them. Its distinctive contributions do not obliterate the insights of the past, but add and supplement the humanities' long-standing commitment to scholarly interpretation, informed research, structured argument, and dialogue within communities of practice".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some have hailed the digital humanities as a solution to the apparent problems within the humanities, namely a decline in funding, a repeat of debates, and a fading set of theoretical claims and methodological arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leroi|first1=Armand|title=Digitizing the Humanities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/opinion/digitizing-the-humanities.html|website=The New York Times Online|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Kirsch, writing in the ''New Republic'', calls this the "False Promise" of the digital humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirsch|first1=Adam|title=Technology Is Taking Over English Departments|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117428/limits-digital-humanities-adam-kirsch|website=The New Republic|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the rest of humanities and many social science departments are seeing a decline in funding or prestige, the digital humanities has been seeing increasing funding and prestige.  Burdened with the problems of novelty, the digital humanities is discussed as either a revolutionary alternative to the humanities as it is usually conceived or as simply new wine in old bottles. Kirsch believes that digital humanities practitioners suffer from problems of being marketers rather than scholars, who attest to the grand capacity of their research more than actually performing new analysis and when they do so, only performing trivial parlor tricks of research. This form of criticism has been repeated by others, such as in Carl Staumshein, writing in ''Inside Higher Education'', who calls it a "Digital Humanities Bubble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straumshein|first1=Carl|title=Digital Humanities Bubble|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/08/digital-humanities-wont-save-humanities-digital-humanists-say|publisher=Inside Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same publication, Straumshein alleges that the digital humanities is a 'Corporatist Restructuring' of the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straumshein|first1=Carl|title=Digital Humanities as 'Corporatist Restructuring'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/06/article-criticizes-impact-digital-humanities-colleges|website=Inside Higher Education|publisher=Inside Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see the alliance of the digital humanities with business to be a positive turn that causes the business world to pay more attention, thus bringing needed funding and attention to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Tracy|title=Humanities and business go hand in hand|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/04/24/humanities-and-business-hand-hand/9nG9n04SSF1Ko0MRJjguxK/story.html|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it were not burdened by the title of digital humanities, it could escape the allegations that it is elitist and unfairly funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pannapacker|first1=William|title=Stop Calling It 'Digital Humanities'|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Calling-It-Digital/137325/|publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black box===

There has also been critique of the use of digital humanities tools by scholars who do not fully understand what happens to the data they input and place too much trust in the "black box" of software that cannot be sufficiently examined for errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dobson|first=James E.|title=Can an Algorithm be Disturbed? Machine Learning, Intrinsic Criticism, and the Digital Humanities|year=2015|periodical=College Literature |volume=42|issue=4 |pages= 543–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johanna Drucker]], a professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Department of Information Studies, has criticized the "epistemological fallacies" prevalent in popular visualization tools and technologies (such as [[Google]]'s n-gram graph) used by digital humanities scholars and the general public, calling some network diagramming and topic modeling tools "just too crude for humanistic work."&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/140307034|title=Johanna Drucker (UCLA) Lecture, "Should Humanists Visualize Knowledge?"|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of transparency in these programs obscures the subjective nature of the data and its processing, she argues, as these programs "generate standard diagrams based on conventional algorithms for screen display...mak[ing] it very difficult for the semantics of the data processing to be made evident."&lt;ref name="vimeo.com" /&gt;

===Diversity===

There has also been some recent controversy among practitioners of digital humanities around the role that race and/or identity politics plays. Tara McPherson attributes some of the lack of racial diversity in digital humanities to the modality of [[Unix|UNIX]] and computers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/29|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open thread on DHpoco.org recently garnered well over 100 comments on the issue of race in digital humanities, with scholars arguing about the amount that racial (and other) biases affect the tools and texts available for digital humanities research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/05/10/open-thread-the-digital-humanities-as-a-historical-refuge-from-raceclassgendersexualitydisability/|title=Open Thread: The Digital Humanities as a Historical "Refuge" from Race/Class/Gender/Sexuality/Disability?|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021953/http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/05/10/open-thread-the-digital-humanities-as-a-historical-refuge-from-raceclassgendersexualitydisability/|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson posits that there needs to be an understanding and theorizing of the implications of digital technology and race, even when the subject for analysis appears not to be about race.

Amy E. Earhart criticizes what has become the new digital humanities "canon" in the shift from websites using simple [[HTML]] to the usage of the [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] and visuals in textual recovery projects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/16|title=Debates in the Digital Humanities|website=dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Works that has been previously lost or excluded were afforded a new home on the internet, but much of the same marginalizing practices found in traditional humanities also took place digitally. According to Earhart, there is a "need to examine the canon that we, as digital humanists, are constructing, a canon that skews toward traditional texts and excludes crucial work by women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

===Issues of access===

Practitioners in digital humanities are also failing to meet the needs of users with disabilities. George H. Williams argues that universal design is imperative for practitioners to increase usability because "many of the otherwise most valuable digital resources are useless for people who are—for example—deaf or hard of hearing, as well as for people who are blind, have low vision, or have difficulty distinguishing particular colors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/44|title=Disability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities|work=Debates in the Digital Humanities |author=George H. Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to provide accessibility successfully, and productive universal design, it is important to understand why and how users with disabilities are using the digital resources while remembering that all users approach their informational needs differently.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Cultural criticism===

Digital humanities have been criticized for not only ignoring traditional questions of lineage and history in the humanities, but lacking the fundamental cultural criticism that defines the humanities. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the humanities have to be tied to cultural criticism, per se, in order to be the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Alan|url=http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/where-is-cultural-criticism-in-the-digital-humanities/|publisher=UCSB|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berryandfagerjord/&gt; The sciences{{vague|date=June 2017}} might imagine the Digital Humanities as a welcome improvement over the non-quantitative methods of the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Poetry in Motion'|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7352/full/474420b.html|website=Nature|publisher=Nature|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirschenbaum|first1=Matthew|url=https://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dhterriblethingskirschenbaum.pdf|website=Wordpress|publisher=Matthew Kirschenbaum|accessdate=14 May 2016|title=What Is "Digital Humanities," and Why Are They Saying Such Terrible Things about It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulty of evaluation===

As the field matures, there has been a recognition that the standard model of academic peer-review of work may not be adequate for digital humanities projects, which often involve website components, databases, and other non-print objects. Evaluation of quality and impact thus require a combination of old and new methods of peer review.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One response has been the creation of the ''DHCommons Journal''. This accepts non-traditional submissions, especially mid-stage digital projects, and provides an innovative model of peer review more suited for the multimedia, transdisciplinary, and milestone-driven nature of Digital Humanities projects. Other professional humanities organizations, such as the [[American Historical Association]] and the [[Modern Language Association]], have developed guidelines for evaluating academic digital scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Professional-Issues/Committee-on-Information-Technology/Guidelines-for-Evaluating-Work-in-Digital-Humanities-and-Digital-Media|title=Guidelines for Evaluating Work in Digital Humanities and Digital...|website=Modern Language Association|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/digital-history-resources/evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-in-history/guidelines-for-the-professional-evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-by-historians|title=Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of focus on pedagogy===

The 2012 edition of ''Debates in the Digital Humanities'' recognized the fact that pedagogy was the “neglected ‘stepchild’ of DH” and included an entire section on teaching the digital humanities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Part of the reason is that grants in the humanities are geared more toward research with quantifiable results rather than teaching innovations, which are harder to measure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In recognition of a need for more scholarship on the area of teaching, ''Digital Humanities Pedagogy'' was published and offered case studies and strategies to address how to teach digital humanities methods in various disciplines.

==Organizations==

The [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) is an umbrella organization that supports digital research and teaching as a consultative and advisory force for its constituent organizations. Its governance was approved in 2005 and it has overseen the annual [[Digital Humanities conference]] since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adho.org/about|title=About {{!}} ADHO|website=adho.org|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current members of ADHO are:

ECU-TEST aims at the specification, implementation, documentation, execution and assessment of [[test case]]s. Owing to various [[test automation]] methods, the tool ensures an efficient implementation of all necessary activities for the creation, execution and assessment of test cases.&lt;ref&gt;Rocco Deutschmann: Semi-formal methods for the automated test of embedded systems. Doctoral thesis, TU Dresden, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==

=== Methodology ===
ECU-TEST automates the control of the whole test environment and supports a broad range of test tools.
Various abstraction layers for [[measured quantity|measured quantities]] allow its application on different [[software testing#testing levels|testing levels]], e.g. within the context of model in the loop, software in the loop and [[hardware in the loop]] as well as in real systems (vehicle and driver in the loop).
Creating test cases using ECU-TEST is conducted graphically and does not require programming skills. Test-case descriptions have a generic form, which together with extensive parameterization and configuration options, allows uniform access to all test tools and thereby simplifies re-use of existing tests over multiple development phases.

=== Structure ===
ECU-TEST is organized in four parts:
* Editor and Project manager
* Configurator
* Test engine
* Analyzer and Protocol generator
In order to create a test case, one or more sequences of test steps and their parameterizations are specified using the editor. Test steps comprise reading and evaluating measured quantities of the test object, manipulating the test environment as well as the execution of diagnostic functions and control structures. Multiple test cases can be organized using the project manager.
Additional settings for test object and test environment can be made using the configurator.
The execution of test cases is performed using a multi-stage test engine. The generated [[logging|log]] data serve as the basis for the creation of test reports.
Subsequent to the test execution, optional checks of recorded measured quantities are performed in the analyzer. From the results of test-execution and subsequent checks, the protocol generator produces a detailed test report, which is displayed interactively and can be archived in files and data bases.

== Interfaces ==
ECU-TEST provided clear interfaces for extensions and for the integration in existing test and validation processes.

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|300px|thumb|upright=1.5|"The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire. Hers is the head upon which all "the ends of the world are come," and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed! All the thoughts and experience of the world have etched and moulded there, in that which they have of power to refine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias. She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants: and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one; and modern thought has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the modern idea." The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' described by [[Walter Pater]]]]

'''Ekphrasis''' or '''ecphrasis''',  comes from the Greek for the description of a work of art produced as a rhetorical exercise,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chambers Dictionary'', Chambers Harrap, Edinburgh 1993 {{ISBN|0-550-10255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in the adjectival form '''ekphrastic''', is a vivid, often dramatic, verbal description of a [[Visual arts|visual work of art]], either real or imagined. In [[Classical antiquity|ancient times]], it referred to a description of any thing, person, or [[experience]]. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐκ ''ek'' and φράσις ''phrásis'', 'out' and 'speak' respectively, and the verb ἐκφράζειν ''ekphrázein'', "to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name".

According to the [[Poetry Foundation]], "an ekphrastic poem is a vivid description of a scene or, more commonly, a work of art."&lt;ref&gt;The Poetry Foundation, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/glossary-term/ekphrasis Glossary Terms: Ekphrasis] (accessed 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, an ekphrastic poem is a poem inspired or stimulated by a work of art.

Ekphrasis has been considered generally to be a [[rhetorical device]] in which one medium of [[art]] tries to relate to another medium by defining and describing its [[essence]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and in doing so, relate more directly to the audience, through its illuminative liveliness.
A descriptive work of [[prose]] or [[poetry]], a [[film]], or even a [[photograph]] may thus highlight through its ''rhetorical'' vividness what is happening, or what is shown in, say, any of the [[visual art]]s, and in doing so, may enhance the original art and so take on a life of its own through its brilliant description. One example is a painting of a sculpture: the painting is "telling the story of" the sculpture, and so becoming a storyteller, as well as a story (work of art) itself. Virtually any type of [[artistic media|artistic medium]] may be the actor of, or subject of ekphrasis. One may not always be able, for example, to make an accurate sculpture of a book to retell the story in an authentic way; yet if it's the spirit of the book that we are more concerned about, it certainly can be conveyed by virtually any medium and thereby enhance the artistic impact of the original book through [[synergy]].

In this way, a painting may represent a sculpture, and vice versa; a poem portray a picture; a sculpture depict a heroine of a novel; in fact, given the right circumstances, any art may describe any other art, especially if a ''rhetorical element'', standing for the sentiments of the artist when she/he created her/his work, is present. For instance, the distorted faces in a crowd in a painting depicting an original work of art, a sullen countenance on the face of a sculpture representing a historical figure, or a film showing particularly dark aspects of neo-Gothic architecture, are all examples of ekphrasis.

== History ==

=== Plato's forms, the beginning of ekphrasis ===
In the ''Republic'', Book X, Plato discusses [[substantial form|forms]] by using real things, such as a [[bed]], for example, and calls each way a bed has been made, a "bedness". He commences with the original form of a bed, one of a variety of ways a bed may have been constructed by a craftsman and compares that form with an ideal form of a bed, of a perfect [[archetype]] or image in the form of which beds ought to be made, in short, the [[epitome]] of bedness.

In his analogy, one bedness form shares its own bedness – with all its shortcomings – with that of the ideal form, or template. A third bedness, too, may share the ideal form. He continues with the fourth form also containing elements of the ideal template or archetype which in this way remains an ever-present and invisible ideal version with which the craftsman compares his work. As bedness after bedness shares the ideal form and template of all creation of beds, and each bedness is associated with another ad infinitum, it is called an "infinite regress of forms".

=== From form to ekphrasis ===
It was this epitome, this template of the ideal form, that a craftsman or later an artist would try to reconstruct in his attempt to achieve perfection in his work, that was to manifest itself in ekphrasis at a later stage.

Artists began to use their own literary and artistic [[genre]] of art to work and reflect on another art to illuminate what the eye might not see in the original, to elevate it and possibly even surpass it.

=== Plato and Aristotle ===
For [[Plato]] (and [[Aristotle]]), it is not so much the form of each bed that defines ''bedness'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~jjacobs1/utpictura/1.htm|title=Ecphrasis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[mimesis|mimetic]] stages at which beds may be viewed that defines ''bedness.'' 
# a bed as a physical entity is a mere form of bed
# any view from whichever perspective, be it a side elevation, a full panoramic view from above, or looking at a bed end-on is at a second remove
# a full picture, characterising the whole bed is at a third remove
# ekphrasis of a bed in another art form is at a fourth remove

=== Socrates and Phaedrus ===
In another instance, [[Socrates]] talks about ekphrasis to [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] thus:&lt;br /&gt;
"You know, Phaedrus, that is the strange thing about writing,
which makes it truly correspond to painting.&lt;br /&gt;
The painter's products stand before us as though they were alive,&lt;br /&gt;
but if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence.&lt;br /&gt;
It is the same with written words; they seem to talk&lt;br /&gt;
to you as if they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything&lt;br /&gt;
about what they say, from a desire to be instructed,&lt;br /&gt;
they go on telling you just the same thing forever".&lt;ref&gt;Plato: ''Phaedrus'' 275d&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genre ==

=== In literature ===

The fullest example of ekphrasis in antiquity can be found in [[Philostratus III|Philostratus of Lemnos]]' ''Eikones'' which describes 64 pictures in a Neapolitan villa.  Ekphrasis is described in [[Aelius Festus Aphthonius|Aphthonius]]' ''[[Progymnasmata]]'', his [[textbook]] of [[style guide|style]], and later classical literary and rhetorical textbooks, and with other classical literary techniques was keenly revived in the Renaissance.

In the Middle Ages, ekphrasis was less often practiced, especially as regards real objects, and historians of [[medieval art]] have complained that the accounts of monastic chronicles recording now vanished art concentrate on objects made from valuable materials or with the status of [[relic]]s, and rarely give more than the cost and weight of objects, and perhaps a mention of the subject matter of the [[iconography]].

The [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods made much use of ekphrasis. In Renaissance Italy, Canto 33 of [[Ariosto]]'s ''Orlando Furioso'' describes a picture gallery created by Merlin. In Spain, [[Lope de Vega]] often used allusions and descriptions of Italian art in his plays, and included the painter [[Titian]] as one of his characters. [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] also incorporated works of art in dramas such as ''The Painter of his Dishonor''. [[Cervantes]], who spent his youth in Italy, utilized many Renaissance frescoes and paintings in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and many of his other works. In England, [[Shakespeare]] briefly describes a group of erotic paintings in [[Cymbeline]], but his most extended exercise is a 200-line description of the Greek army before Troy in [[The Rape of Lucrece]]. Ekphrasis seems to have been less common in France during these periods.

Instances of ekphrasis in [[19th century literature]] can be found in the works of such influential figures as Spanish novelist [[Benito Pérez Galdós]], French poet, painter and novelist [[Théophile Gautier]], Norwegian playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]], and Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].

[[Herman Melville|Herman Melville's]] ''[[Moby Dick]], or The Whale'' features an intense use of ekphrasis as a stylistic manifesto of the book in which it appears. In the chapter "The Spouter Inn", a painting hanging on the wall of a whaler's inn is described as irreconcilably unclear, overscrawled with smoke and defacements. The narrator, so-called Ishmael, describes how this painting can be both lacking any definition and still provoking in the viewer dozens of distinct possible understandings, until the great mass of interpretations resolves into a Whale, which grounds all the interpretations while containing them, an indication of how Melville sees his own book unfolding around this chapter.

In Pérez Galdós's ''Our Friend Manso'' (1882), the narrator describes two paintings by [[Théodore Géricault]] to point to the shipwreck of ideals; while in  ''La incógnita'' (1889), there are many allusions and descriptions of Italian art, including references to [[Botticelli]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Masaccio]], [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], etc.

In [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s 1888 work ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'', the first act begins with the description of a painting of a mermaid dying on the shore and is followed by a description of a sculpture that depicts a woman having a nightmare of an ex-lover returning to her.  Both works of art can be interpreted as having much importance in the overall meaning of the play as protagonist Ellida Wangel both yearns for her lost youth spent on an island out at sea and is later in the play visited by a lover she thought dead.  Furthermore, as an interesting example of the back-and-forth dynamic that exists between literary ekphrasis and art, in 1896 (eight years after the play was written) Norwegian painter [[Edvard Munch]] painted an image similar to the one described by Ibsen in a painting he entitled (unsurprisingly enough) ''Lady from the Sea''.  Ibsen's last work [[When We Dead Awaken]] also contains examples of ekphrasis as the play's protagonist, Arnold Rubek, is a sculptor who several times throughout the play describes his masterpiece "Resurrection Day" at length and in the many different forms the sculpture took throughout the stages of its creation.  Once again the evolution of the sculpture as described in the play can be read as a reflection on the transformation undergone by Rubek himself and even as a statement on the progression Ibsen's own plays took as many scholars have read this final play (stated by Ibsen himself to be an 'epilogue') as the playwright's reflection on his own work as an artist.

The Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] employed ekphrasis most notably in his novel ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]''.  In this novel, the protagonist, Prince Myshkin, sees a painting of a dead Christ in the house of Rogozhin that has a profound effect on him.  Later in the novel, another character, Hippolite, describes the painting at much length depicting the image of Christ as one of brutal realism that lacks any beauty or sense of the divine.  Rogozhin, who is himself the owner of the painting, at one moment says that the painting has the power to take away a man's faith, a comment that Dostoyevsky himself made to his wife Anna upon seeing the actual painting that the painting in the novel is based on, ''[[The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb]]'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]].  The painting was seen shortly before Dostoyevsky began the novel.  Though this is the major instance of ekphrasis in the novel, and the one which has the most thematic importance to the story as a whole, other instances can be spotted when Prince Myshkin sees a painting of Swiss landscape that reminds him of a view he saw while at a sanatorium in Switzerland, and also when he first sees the face of his love interest, Nastasya, in the form of a painted portrait.  At one point in the novel, Nastasya, too, describes a painting of Christ, her own imaginary work that portrays Christ with a child, an image which naturally evokes comparison between the image of the dead Christ.

The Irish aesthete and novelist [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890/1891) tells how Basil Hallward paints a picture of the young man named Dorian Gray. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, who espouses a new hedonism, dedicated to the pursuit of beauty and all pleasures of the senses. Under his sway, Dorian bemoans the fact that his youth will soon fade. He would sell his soul so as to have the portrait age rather than himself. As Dorian engages in a debauched life, the gradual deterioration of the portrait becomes a mirror of his soul. There are repeated instances of notional ekphrasis of the deteriorating figure in the painting throughout the novel, although these are often partial, leaving much of the portrait's imagery to the imagination. The novel forms part of the magic portrait genre. Wilde had previously experimented with employing portraits in his written work, as in [[The Portrait of Mr. W. H.]] (1889).

[[Anthony Powell]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'' begins with an evocation of the painting by [[Poussin]] which [[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|gives the sequence its name]], and contains other passages of ekphrasis, perhaps influenced by the many passages in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]''.

In the 20th century, [[Roger Zelazny]]'s "[[24 Views of Mt. Fuji, by Hokusai]]" uses an ekphrastic frame, descriptions of [[Hokusai]]'s famous series of woodcuts, as a structural device for his story.

==== Ekphrastic poetry ====
[[File:Angelo monticelli shield-of-achilles.jpg|thumb|This is a design of the Shield of Achilles based on the description in the Iliad. It was completed by Angelo Monticelli c. 1820. This shield represents the art of Ekphrastic poetry Homer used in his writings.]]
Ekphrastic poetry may be encountered as early as the days of [[Homer]] whose [[Iliad]] (Book 18) describes the [[Shield of Achilles]], with how [[Hephaestus]] made it as well as its completed shape.&lt;ref name="writingaboutart"&gt;Munsterberg, Marjorie, Writing About Art: [http://writingaboutart.org/pages/ekphrasis.html Ekphrasis] (retrieved 27 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Famous later examples include [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] when he describes what [[Aeneas]] sees engraved on the doors of [[Carthage]]'s temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and [[Catullus 64]], which contains an extended ekphrasis of an imaginary coverlet with the story of [[Ariadne]] picked out on it.

Ekphrastic poetry flourished in the [[romanticism|Romantic]] era and again among the [[pre-Raphaelite]] poets. A major poem of the English Romantics – [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]]— provides an example of the artistic potential of ekphrasis. The entire poem is a description of a piece of pottery that the narrator finds immensely evocative. [[Felicia Hemans]] made extensive use of ekphrasis &lt;ref&gt;Grant F. Scott. ''The Fragile Image: Felicia Hemans and Romantic Ekphrasis'' in ''Felicia Hemans. Reimagining Poetry in the Nineteenth Century''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-333-80109-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as did [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], especially in her ''Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures''. [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s "double-works" exemplify the use of the genre by an artist mutually to enhance his visual and literary art. Rossetti also ekphrasised a number of paintings by other artists, generally from the Italian Renaissance, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Virgin of the Rocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='For "Our Lady of the Rocks", by Leonardo da Vinci'|url=http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/5-1848.raw.html|website=Rossetti Archive|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of the genre from the nineteenth century include [[Michael Field (author)|Michael Field]]'s 1892 volume ''Sight and Song'', which contains only ekphrastic poetry; [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s poem 'Before the Mirror', which ekphrasises [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s [[Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl]], hinted at only by the poem's subtitle, "Verses Written under a Picture"; and [[Robert Browning]]'s [[My Last Duchess]], which although a [[dramatic monologue]], includes some description by the Duke of the portrait before which he and the listener stand.

Ekphrastic poetry is still commonly practised. Twentieth-century examples include [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s "Archaïscher Torso Apollos",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unix.cc.wmich.edu/~cooneys/poems/gr/Rilke.html|title=Rainer Maria Rilke, Torso of an Archaic Apollo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Shield of Achilles]]'' (1952), a poem by [[W.H. Auden]],&lt;ref name="writingaboutart" /&gt; which brings the tradition back to its start with an ironic retelling of the episode in Homer (see above), where [[Thetis]] finds very different scenes from those she expects. In contrast, his earlier poem ''[[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]]'' describes a particular real and very famous painting ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', thought until recently to be by rather than after [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], which is also described in the poem by [[William Carlos Williams]] ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]''.{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}

=== In, or as, art history ===

Since the types of objects described in classical ekphrases often lack survivors to modern times, art historians have often been tempted to use descriptions in literature as sources for the appearance of actual Greek or Roman art, an approach full of risk. This is because ekphrasis typically contains an element of competition with the art it describes, aiming to demonstrate the superior ability of words to "paint a picture".  Many subjects of ekphrasis are clearly imaginary, for example those of the epics, but with others it remains uncertain the extent to which they were, or were expected to be by early audiences, at all accurate.

This tendency is by no means restricted to classical art history; the evocative but vague mentions of objects in metalwork in ''[[Beowulf]]'' are eventually always mentioned by writers on [[Anglo-Saxon art]], and compared to the treasures of [[Sutton Hoo]] and the [[Staffordshire Hoard]]. The ekphrasic writings of the lawyer turned bishop [[Asterius of Amasea]] (fl. around 400) are often cited by art historians of the period to fill gaps in the surviving artistic record.  The inadequacy of most medieval accounts of art is mentioned above; they generally lack any specific details other than cost and the owner or donor, and hyperbolic but wholly vague praise.

Journalistic art criticism was effectively invented by [[Denis Diderot]] in his long pieces on the works in the [[Paris Salon]], and extended and highly pointed accounts of the major exhibitions of new art became a popular seasonal feature in the journalism of most Western countries.  Since few if any of the works could be illustrated description and evocation was necessary, and the cruelty of descriptions of works disliked became a part of the style.

As [[art history]] began to become an academic subject in the 19th century, exphrasis as [[formal analysis]] of objects was regarded as a vital component of the subject, and by no means all examples lack attractiveness as literature.  Writers on art for a wider audience produced many descriptions with great literary as well as art historical merit; in English [[John Ruskin]], both the most important journalistic critic and popularizer of historic art of his day, and [[Walter Pater]], above all for his famous evocation of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', are among the most notable.  As photography in books or on television allowed audiences a direct visual comparison to the verbal description, the role of ekphrasic commentary on the images was even perhaps increased.

Ekphrasis has also been an influence on art; for example the ekphrasis of the Shield of Achilles in Homer and other classical examples were certainly an inspiration for the elaborately decorated large serving dishes in silver or [[silver-gilt]], crowded with complicated scenes in [[relief]], that were produced in 16th century [[Mannerist]] metalwork.

=== In music ===

There are a number of examples of ekphrasis in music, of which the best known is probably ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a [[suite (music)|suite]] in ten movements (plus a recurring, varied Promenade) composed for [[piano]] by the Russian composer [[Modest Mussorgsky]] in 1874, and then very popular in various arrangements for orchestra. The suite is based on real pictures, although as the exhibition was dispersed, most are now unidentified.

The first movement of ''[[Three Places in New England]]'' by [[Charles Ives]] is an ekphrasis of the [[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]] in Boston, sculpted by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. Ives also wrote a poem inspired by the sculpture as a companion piece to the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mortensen|first=Scott|title=Orchestral Set No. 1: Three Places in New England – Notes|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Ives/WK_OS_1_Three_Places.htm|work=A Charles Ives Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachmaninoff]]'s symphonic poem ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'' is a musical evocation of [[Böcklin]]'s [[Isle of the Dead (painting)|painting of the same name]]. [[King Crimson]]'s song "[[Starless and Bible Black|The Night Watch]]", with lyrics written by [[Richard Palmer-James]], is an ekphrasis on [[Rembrandt]]'s painting ''[[The Night Watch]]''.

=== Notional ekphrasis ===

Notional ekphrasis may describe mental processes such as dreams, thoughts and whimsies of the imagination. It may also be one art describing or depicting another work of art which as yet is still in an inchoate state of creation, in that the work described may still be resting in the imagination of the artist before he has begun his creative work. The expression may also be applied to an art describing the origin of another art, how it came to be made and the circumstances of its being created. Finally it may describe an entirely imaginary and non-existing work of art, as though it were factual and existed in reality.

== In ancient literature ==


=== Greek literature ===

==== ''The Iliad'' ====

The [[shield of Achilles]] is described by Homer in a famous example of ekphrastic poetry, used to depict events that have occurred in the past and events that will occur in the future. The shield contains images representative of the [[Cosmos]] and the inevitable fate of the city of Troy. The shield of Achilles features the following nine depictions:
# The Earth, Sea, Sky, Moon and the Cosmos (484–89)
# Two cities – one where a wedding and a trial are taking place, and one that is considered to be Troy, due to the battle occurring inside the city (509–40)
# A field that is being ploughed (541–49)
# The home of a King where the harvest is being reaped (550–60)
# A vineyard that is being harvested (561–72)
# A herd of cattle that is being attacked by two lions, while the Herdsman and his dogs try to scare the lions off the prize bull (573–86)
# A sheep farm (587–89)
# A scene with young men and women dancing (590–606)
# The mighty Ocean as it encircles the shield (607–609)

==== ''[[Odyssey|The Odyssey]]'' ====

Although not written as elaborately as previous examples of ekphrastic poetry, from lines 609–614 the belt of [[Heracles|Herakles]] is described as having "marvelous works,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Odyssey of Homer|last=Lattimore|first=Richmond|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|year=1967|location=New York|at=lines 609–614}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as animals with piercing eyes and hogs in a grove of trees. It also contains multiple images of battles and occurrences of manslaughter. In ''the Odyssey,'' there is also a scene where Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, must prove to his wife, Penelope, that he has proof that Odysseus is still alive. She asks him about the clothes Odysseus was wearing during the time when the beggar claims he hosted Odysseus. Homer uses this opportunity to implement more ekphrastic imagery by describing the golden brooch of Odysseus, which depicts a hound strangling a fawn that it captured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''The Argonautika'' ====

The Cloak of Jason is another example of ekphrastic poetry. In ''[[Argonautica|The Argonautika]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodios|first1=Apollonios|title=The Argonautika|at=lines 720–763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason's cloak has seven events embroidered into it:

# The forging of Zeus' thunderbolts by the Cyclops (730-734)
# The building of Thebes by the sons of Antiope (735–741)
# Aphrodite with the shield of Ares (742–745)
# The battle between Teleboans and the Sons of Electryon (746–751)
# Pelops winning Hippodameia (752–758)
# Apollo punishing Tityos (759–762)
# Phrixus and the Ram (763–765)

The description of the cloak provides many examples of ekphrasis, and not only is modeled off of Homer's writing, but alludes to several occurrences in Homer's epics ''the Iliad'' and ''the Odyssey''. Jason's cloak can be examined in many ways. The way the cloak's events are described is similar to the catalogue of Women that Odysseus encounters on his trip to the Underworld.&lt;ref name="University of Berkeley, California"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulloch|first1=Anthony|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=www.academia.edu|page=59|url=https://www.academia.edu/367874/Jasons_Cloak|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloak and its depicted events lend more to the story than a simple description; in true ekphrasis fashion it not only compares Jason to future heroes such as Achilles and Odysseus, but also provides a type of foreshadowing. Jason, by donning the cloak, can be seen as a figure who would rather resort to coercion, making him a parallel to Odysseus, who uses schemes and lies to complete his voyage back to Ithaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=H. A.|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association (1974-)|date=1 January 1980|volume=110|pages=263–286|doi=10.2307/284222|jstor=284222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason also bears similarities to Achilles; by donning the cloak, Jason is represented as an Achillean heroic figure due to the comparisons made between his cloak and the shield of Achilles. He is also takes up a spear given to him by Atalanta, not as an afterthought, but due to his heroic nature and the comparison between himself and Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=James|title=The Best of the Argonauts|date=1993|publisher=The University of California Press|page=120|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3d5nb1mh&amp;chunk.id=d0e7664&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jason only wears the cloak while going to meet with Hypsipyle, it foreshadows the changes that Jason will potentially undergo during his adventure. Through the telling of the scenes on the cloak, Apollonios relates the scenes on the cloak as virtues and morals that should be upheld by the Roman people, and that Jason should learn to live by. Such virtues include the piety represented by the Cyclops during the forging of Zeus' thunderbolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=H. A.|title=Jason's Cloak|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association |date=1 January 1980|volume=110|page=265|doi=10.2307/284222|jstor=284222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reminiscent of the scene in ''the Iliad'' when Thetis goes to see Hephaestus, and requisitions him to create a new set of armor for her son Achilles. Before he began creating the shield and armor, Hephaestus was forging 20 golden tripods for his own hall, and in the scene on Jason's cloak we see the Cyclops performing the last step of creating the thunderbolts for Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=James|title=The Best of the Argonauts|page=122|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3d5nb1mh&amp;chunk.id=d0e7664&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman literature ===

==== ''The Aeneid'' ====

''[[Aeneid|The Aeneid]]'' is an epic that was written by Virgil during the reign of Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome. While the epic itself mimics Homer's works, it can be seen as propaganda for Augustus and the new Roman empire.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=R. D.|date=1981|title=The Shield of Aeneas|jstor=41591854|journal=Vergilius|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield of Aeneas is described in book eight, from lines 629–719.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This shield was given to him by his mother, Venus, after she asked her husband Vulcan to create it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Aeneid of Virgil|last=Ahl|first=Frederick|publisher=Oxford World's Classics|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-923195-9|location=Great Britain|at=lines 372–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scene is almost identical to Thetis, the mother of Achilles, asking Hephaestus to create her son new weapons and armor for the battle of Troy.

The difference in the descriptions of the two shields are easily discernible; the shield of Achilles depicts many subjects, whereas the shield made for Aeneas depicts the future that Rome will have, containing propaganda in favor of the Emperor Augustus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Much like other ekphrastic poetry, it depicts a clear catalogue of events:

# The She Wolf and the suckling Romulus and Remus (629–634)
# The Rape of the Sabine Women (635–639)
# Mettius pulled apart by horses (640–645)
# Invasion of Lars Parsona (646–651)
# Manlius guarding the capitol (652–654)
# Gauls invading Rome (655–665)
# Tartarus with Cato and Catiline (666–670)
# The Sea around the width of the shield (671–674)
# The Battle of Actium (675–677)
# Augustus and Agrippa (678–684)
# Antony and Cleopatra (685–695)
# Triumph (696–719)

There is speculation as to why Virgil depicted certain events, while completely avoiding others such as Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul. Virgil clearly outlined the shield chronologically, but scholars argue that the events on the shield are meant to reflect certain Roman values that would have been of high importance to the Roman people and to the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://classicsvic.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/penwillvol18.pdf|title=Reading Aeneas' Shield|last=Penwill|first=John|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values may include ''virtus, clementia, iustitia'', and ''pietas'', which were the values inscribed on a shield given to Augustus by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=S. J.|date=November 1997|title=The Survival and Supremacy of Rome: The Unity of the Shield of Aeneas|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8428342&amp;fileId=S0075435800058081|journal=The Journal of Roman Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instance of ekphrasitc poetry maybe Virgil's attempt to relate more of his work to Augustus.

Earlier in the epic, when Aeneas travels to Carthage, he sees the temple of the city, and on it are great works of art that are described by the poet using the ekphrastic style. Like the other occurrences of ekphrasis, these works of art describe multiple events. Out of these, there are eight images related to the Trojan War:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Depictions of Agamemnon and Menelaus, Priam and Achilles (459)
# Greeks running from Trojan soldiers (468)
# The sacking of the tents of Rhesus and the Thracians, and their deaths by Diomedes (468–472)
# Troilus being thrown from his Chariot as he flees from Achilles (473–478)
# The women of Troy in lamentation, praying to the gods to help them (479–482)
# Achilles selling Hektor's body (483–487)
# Priam begging for the return of his son, with the Trojan commanders nearby (483–488)
# Penthesilea the Amazon, and her fighters (489–493)

==== ''The Metamorphoses'' ====

There are several examples of ekphrasis in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]''; one in which Phaeton journeys to the temple of the sun to meet his father Phoebus. When Phaeton gazes upon the temple of the sun, he sees the following carvings:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metamorphoses|last=Martin|first=Charles|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The seas that circle the Earth, the surrounding lands, and the sky (8–9)
# The gods of the sea and the Nymphs (10–19)
# Scenes of men, beasts, and local gods (20–21)
# Twelve figures of the Zodiac, six on each side of the door to the temple (22–23)

== Other aspects ==

=== Educational value of using ekphrasis in teaching literature ===

The rationale behind using examples of ekphrasis to teach literature is that once the connection between a poem and a painting are recognized for example, the student's emotional and intellectual engagement with the literary text is extended to new dimensions. The literary text takes on new meaning and there is more to respond to because another art form is being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Joseph O'Beirne, and Lucy Floyd Morcock Milner. Bridging English. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice, 1999. pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as the material taught has both a visual and linguistic basis new connections of understanding are formed in the student's brain thus creating a stronger foundation for understanding, remembrance and internalization. Using ekphrasis to teach literature can be done through the use of [[higher order thinking]] skills such as distinguishing different perspectives, interpreting, inferring, sequencing, compare and contrast and evaluating.

{{Semiotics}}

'''Ethnosemiotics''' is a disciplinary perspective which links [[semiotics]] concepts to [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods.

==Definition==
[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] and Joseph Courtés defined for the first time ethnosemiotics in ''[[Semiotics]] and language: an analytical dictionary''.

"Ethno-semiotics is not truly an autonomous semiotics. If it were, it would be in competition with a field of knowledge already established under the name of ethnology or anthropology, whose contribution to the advent of semiotics itself is considerable. Rather, it is a privileged area of curiosities and of methodological exercises ... . 
Given that general semiotics authorizes the treatment of non-linguistic (gestual, somatic, etc.) syntagmatic concatenations as discourses or texts, the field of ethno-linguistics can be enlarged to become an ethno-semiotics; analyses, still rare, of rituals and ceremonies lead us to suppose that ethnology can become, once again, the privileged locus for the construction of general models of signifying behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Algirdas Julien Greimas, Joseph Courtés Semiotics and language: an analytical dictionary Indiana University Press, 1982 - 409 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, in Italy, the interest toward the discipline has been renewed thanks to the studies and the researches of Maurizio del Ninno, Tarcisio Lancioni, and Francesco Marsciani. Under the direction of Francesco Marsciani, in Bologna in 2007 the Ethnosemiotic Centre of the Bologna University (CUBE) was founded, active in different fields of inquiry. In 2015, CUBE's experience led to the series Quaderni di Etnosemiotica and the Ethnosemiotics lab.

==Focus and fields of inquiry==
The ethnosemiologist analyses the systems of signifiers which are individuated in specific cultural contexts through the observation and the application of the [[Ethnography|ethnographic methods]]. At the present, the principal researchers which have been realized are focused on urban spaces, therapy, rituals, folklore, everyday practices. 
In Italy we can distinguish two approaches to ethnosemiotics:

* the Urbin school, founded by Maurizio del Ninno, which follows the theoretical framework of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Georges Dumézil]], close to French [[Social Anthropology]].
* the Bologna-Siena school, founded by Tarcisio Lancioni and Francesco Marsciani, which were concerned by the development of a set of concepts and methods to apply semiotic analysis to different aspects of everyday life.

From 2015 the Ethnosemiotics Lab leads researches both in the theoretical and the methodological field. Developed inside CUBE, active at the Bologna University, it conducts multidisciplinary researches. The synergy between ethnographic observation and the analysis of the manifested values offers active results from the point of view of the capacity to describe social phenomena.

'''Introduction'''

FIAN International - formerly, FoodFirst Information and Action Network - was founded in 1986 as the first international human rights organization to advocate for the realization of the right to food and nutrition.
Holding a consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, FIAN is active in more than 50 countries, through national sections and seeds groups, which account for 25 of these, as well as individual members and international networks. With no religious or political affiliation dictating its work, FIAN International exposes violations of people's right to food and related rights wherever they may occur and stands up against undue and oppressive practices that prevent people from feeding themselves. 

By holding governments accountable, FIAN International strives to secure people's access to and control over natural resources and means of subsistence, crucial to ensure a life of dignity, now and for future generations. Nutrition, as an inherent component of the right to food, and a fundamental act of food sovereignty, remains a core objective in FIAN's work. As the struggle against gender discrimination and other forms of exclusion is an integral part of its mission, FIAN works with and in favor of the most marginalized and affected groups: its vision is of a world free from hunger, in which every woman, man, boy and girl can fully enjoy their right to food, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. 

FIAN International's Secretariat is based in Heidelberg, Germany, and Geneva, Switzerland.

'''Organizational Structure'''

FIAN is an international membership based organisation. FIAN's institutional members are its national sections which are legal entities in their own right and have their own membership and elected decision-making bodies.

Current sections of FIAN can be found in some 25 countries, for updates look at [http://www.fian.org/about-us/worldwide/ Worldwide]. 

The overall mission, vision and the strategy of FIAN is defined and revised by the International Council (IC), and represented by delegates of the sections who meet once every three years. The IC elects the International Executive Committee (IEC) -headed by the president, which supervises the implementation of FIAN’s strategic plans. The IEC meets bi-annually to review and strategize FIAN programs, methods and budgets. 

The operative working unit being in charge of the execution of FIAN’s programs is its International Secretariat (IS) located in Heidelberg (Germany) and Geneva (Switzerland), and coordinated by the Secretary General.

'''FIAN International's work'''

FIAN uses various working tools to achieve the realization of the right to adequate food.

'''''Case-work and Interventions'''''

At international Fact Finding Missions, FIAN identifies and addresses human rights violations. FIAN interviews people threatened or affected by violations of their right to food and verifies the facts of a situation. Face-to-face contacts to local counterparts are established and serve as a basis for trustful co-operation. On request of those affected, FIAN reacts quickly, analyses the case and mobilises members and supporters worldwide to send out Urgent Action protest letters. Violations are also followed-up in long-term case-work by local FIAN action groups. In close co-operation with the affected communities, FIAN persistently approaches the responsible authorities and identifies breaches of right to food obligations. FIAN’s analysis is based on the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] as interpreted in the UN General Comments, in particular General Comment 12 on the right to adequate food. Existing recourse mechanisms and legal remedies under national and international human rights law are applied to provide redress to the victims.

'''''Lobby and Advocacy'''''

Reliable contacts and networks, a sound documentation of cases and two decades of experience provide a solid basis for effective lobbying and advocating the right to food. FIAN holds states, international institutions and private actors accountable at the national and international levels. The Right to Food Guidelines adopted by the [[FAO]] in 2004 is one of the tools FIAN uses to monitor states’ right to food policies. FIAN tries to improve the existing right to food protection system and to establish new instruments. Intense follow-up work strives to secure the effective implementation of existing instruments, making the right to food politically and judicially enforceable everywhere for everyone.

'''''Information and Education'''''

Targeted information campaigns and awareness-raising on the right to food are at the core of FIAN’s work - to empower social movements and non-governmental organizations to hold states accountable for violations of the right to food, to clarify for governments and other duty-bearers the content and implementation needs of their obligations, and to motivate supporters from civil society to join action against human rights violations. The systematic information gathered from more than 400 individual cases over the past two decades is analyzed and fed into various professional publications.

'''Impact'''

FIAN was involved prominently in the development of the human rights protection system, for instance in the strengthened procedure of State’s and parallel reporting on economic, social, and cultural human rights in the UN human rights system; the elaboration of the UN General Comment No. 12 on the Right to Food in 1999 as the most authoritative legal interpretation of the right to food in international law; and the adoption of the “Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food” by the FAO member states in 2004.

'''''FIAN’s commitment was awarded internationally:'''''

'''Public Eye on Davos - Positive Award:''' In 2006, FIAN International together with two partners won the Public Eye on Davos - Positive Award, which is given every year on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos, for their commitment in favour of the rights of workers of the Mexican tyre factory Euzkadi.

'''Silver Rose Award:''' In 2005, two staff members of the FIAN Section Germany received the Silver Rose Award for their commitment for the rights of workers in the flower industry, the participation in the development of the International Code of Conduct for the Production of Cut flowers (ICC) and its successful implementation in the framework of the Flower Label Programm (FLP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4303">As introduced by [[Kurt Lewin]], '''genidentity''' is an ''existential relationship'' underlying the genesis of an object from one moment to the next. What we usually consider to be an object really consists of multiple entities, which are the phases of the object at various [[time]]s. Two objects are not identical because they have the same properties in common, but because one has developed from the other. 
Lewin introduced the concept in his 1922 [[Habilitationsschrift]] ''Der Begriff der Genese in Physik, Biologie und Entwicklungsgeschichte''. It is today perhaps the only surviving evidence of Lewin's influence on the philosophy of science. However, this concept never became an object of widespread discussion and debate in its own terms. Rather, it was extracted from its context by philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]], Hans Hermes, [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Adolph Grünbaum]], and [[Bas van Fraassen]] who incorporated this concept into their own theories such as the [[topology of the universe]] or the axiomatization of [[mechanics]]. Lewin's idea was to compare and contrast the concept of genidentity in various branches of science, thereby laying bare the characteristic structure of each and making their classification possible in the first place. 

== Classification of Natural Sciences ==

In his thesis mentioned above, Lewin compares [[physics]] (in which he includes [[chemistry]]) and [[biology]] (which he divides into organic biology and [[evolutionary history of life]]). A comparison of this kind presupposes that it is possible to find equivalent notions in both sciences. According to Lewin, the concept of ''genidentity'' in the various sciences meets this requirement.

Lewin distinguishes between partial and total genidentity. This is due to the difficulty caused by parts of objects: for instance, an object might disintegrate into several pieces in the course of its development. As we follow such an object through time, only a small portion of it may remain. Lewin says that two objects existing at different times are partly genidentical if at least some part of the later object was present in the earlier object. By contrast, he says that two objects are totally genidentical if and only if at neither of the considered times there is any distinct object partially genidentical to one of the two objects concerned. 

Lewin also introduces the idea of viewing physical bodies as links in a so-called ''development chain''. According to this approach, between two totally genidentical objects there always exists, at any intermediate time, an object totally genidentical with each. Thus genidentity implies the existence of an entire infinite series of intermediate objects. In this Lewin sees an analogy between physical objects and [[real number]]s, as defined by so-called [[Dedekind cut]]s in the ordering of [[rational number]]s. 

Genidentity so defined is postulated to have various characteristics, such as symmetry, transitivity, density, and continuity. When reviewed in the light of contemporary standards of logical precision, it becomes clear that Lewin had the correct intuition, even though he did not have the benefit of a highly developed terminology of definition theory or modern day [[symbolic logic]]. 

However, genidentity has never been explicitly discussed in the experimental sciences. Rather, it has always been a basic assumption hovering in the background, tacitly assumed. The credit for having made these assumptions explicit for the first time doubtlessly belongs to Kurt Lewin, usually renowned for his psychological work in the field of [[Gestalt psychology]].

The '''Graphene Research Centre''' (GRC), at the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), is the first centre in Asia dedicated to [[graphene]] research.&lt;ref name=annual_report/&gt; The Centre was established under the scientific advice of two [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Laureates in physics]] – Prof [[Andre Geim]] and Prof [[Konstantin Novoselov]] - who won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery of graphene.&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt; It was created for the conception, characterization, theoretical modeling, and development of transformative technologies based on two-dimensional crystals, such as graphene.&lt;ref name=grapheneNUS/&gt;

== History and funding ==
NUS established the GRC in 2010, under the leadership of Prof. Antonio H. Castro Neto, with a start-up fund from NUS of S$40 Million, 1,000 m2 of laboratory space,&lt;ref name=labs/&gt; and a state-of-the-art clean room facility of 800 m2.&lt;ref name=cleanroom/&gt; Speaking of commercial application today scientists are using graphene for making synthetic blood and developing non-invasive treatments for cancer. Graphene would soon replace silicon in your computer chips thus resulting in a much faster, unbreakable tablets, phone and others;&lt;ref name=nrf/&gt; GRC is also participating on a S$50 Million CREATE grant from NRF, together with [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Nanyang Technological University]], for the study of new photovoltaic systems based on two-dimensional crystals. In June 2012, the GRC announced the opening of a S$15 Million micro and nano fabrication facility to produce graphene products.&lt;ref name=channelnewsasia/&gt;

There is a row of triangular [[amulet]] [[kilim motifs|motifs]] (Muska) at top and bottom; each of the four lower guls has a star motif (Yıldız) at its centre.]]
[[File:Oriental rugs, antique and modern (1922) (14780627715).jpg|thumb|[[Turkmens|Turkmen]] carpet with 3 central gul medallions]]

A '''gul''' (also written gol, göl and gül) is a medallion-like design element typical of traditional hand-[[Weaving|woven]] carpets from [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]]. In Turkmen weavings they are often repeated to form the pattern in the main field.

==Shape==

Guls are medallions, often [[octagon]]al, and often somewhat angular on a generally octagonal plan, though they can be somewhat rounded within the constraints of carpet-weaving, and some are lozenge-shaped ([[rhombus]]es). They usually have either [[rotational symmetry#n-fold rotational symmetry|twofold rotational symmetry]] or mirror [[reflection symmetry]] (often both left/right and up/down).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rug Gallery. Carpet Turkey (Kurdish) 18th century |url=http://mathforum.org/geometry/rugs/gallery/08.html |publisher=MathForum |accessdate=28 January 2016 |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guls were historically described in the West as being elephant's foot motifs. Other Western guesses held that the gul was a drawing of a round Turkmen tent, with lines between tents representing irrigation canals; or that the emblem was a [[totem]]ic bird. None of these descriptions have any basis in weaving tradition or culture.&lt;ref name=ThompsonElephant&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term gul, gol, göl or gül is used widely across Central and West Asia, and among carpet specialists in the West. It may derive from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word gol, which means flower or rose,&lt;ref name=LittlePersia&gt;{{cite web |title=Rug Layouts and Designs|url=http://www.little-persia.com/?action=RugDesign#gul |publisher=Little Persia |accessdate=28 January 2016 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from the Turkish word gül which similarly means a rose or roundel.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

In [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] weavings, such as bags and rugs, guls are often repeated to form the basic pattern in the main field (excluding the border).&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arastan&gt;{{cite web|title=Carpet Motifs: A Beginner’s Guide|url=http://arastan.com/journey/carpet-motifs-beginners-guide|publisher=Arastan|accessdate=28 January 2016|date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This use of guls is occasionally found also in Turkish carpets, though they more often have one or a few guls arranged centrally in the main field.--&gt;

The different Turkmen tribes such as [[Teke tribe|Tekke]], [[Salor]], [[Ersari]] and [[Yomut]] traditionally wove a variety of guls, some of ancient design, but gul designs were often used by more than one tribe, and by non-Turkmens.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arastan/&gt;

Western authors have used comparison of the "design vocabulary" of tribal guls, reproduced on traditional rugs, in studying the [[ethnogenesis]] of Asian peoples.&lt;ref name=Mace&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mace, Ruth |author2=Holden, Clare J. |author3=Shennan, Stephen |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YP_p5eS898C |title=The evolution of cultural diversity: a phylogenetic approach |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1-84472-099-3 |pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Western culture==

Western artists including [[Hans Memling]] depicted [[oriental carpet]]s from Turkish Anatolia with guls in several of his paintings, to the extent that these are known as [[Memling carpet]]s. These guls often contain star or (hooked) dragon [[Kilim motifs|motifs]] as found on 15th century [[Konya]] carpets.&lt;ref name=Howe&gt;{{cite web |last1=Howe |first1=R.

'''Haldane's dilemma''' is a limit on the speed of beneficial [[evolution]], first calculated by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1957, and clarified further by later commentators. 

== Substitution cost ==

In the introduction to ''The Cost of Natural Selection'' Haldane writes that it is difficult for breeders to simultaneously select all the desired qualities, partly because the required genes may not be found together in the stock; but, writes Haldane,&lt;ref name=Haldane&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haldane | first1 = J.B.S. | year = | title = The Cost of Natural Selection | url = http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane2.pdf| journal = J. Genet | volume = 55 | issue = 511–524| page = 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;especially in slowly breeding animals such as cattle, one cannot cull even half the females, even though only one in a hundred of them combines the various qualities desired.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, the problem for the cattle breeder is that keeping only the specimens with the desired qualities will lower the reproductive capability too much to keep a useful breeding stock.

Haldane states that this same problem arises with respect to natural selection. [[Genetic correlation|Characters that are positively correlated]] at one time may be negatively correlated at a later time, so simultaneous optimisation of more than one character is a problem also in nature. And, as Haldane writes&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[i]n this paper I shall try to make quantitative the fairly obvious statement that natural selection cannot occur with great intensity for a number of characters at once unless they happen to be controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In faster breeding species there is less of a problem. Haldane mentions the [[peppered moth]], ''Biston betularia'', whose variation in pigmentation is determined by several [[alleles]] at a single gene.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;ref name="majerus1998"&gt;Majerus, M.E.N. (1998) ''[[Melanism: Evolution in Action]]''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these alleles, "C", is dominant to all the others, and any '''CC''' or  '''Cx''' moths are dark (where "x" is any other allele). Another allele, "c", is recessive to all the others, and '''cc''' moths are light. Against the originally pale [[lichen]]s the darker moths were easier for birds to pick out, but in areas, where pollution has darkened the lichens, the '''cc''' moths had become rare. Haldane mentions that in a single day the frequency of '''cc''' moths might be halved.

Another potential problem is that if "ten other independently inherited characters had been subject to selection of the same intensity as that for colour, only &lt;math&gt;(1/2)^{10}&lt;/math&gt;, or one in 1024, of the original genotype would have survived." The species would most likely have become extinct; but it might well survive ten other selective periods of comparable selectivity, if they happened in different centuries.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== Selection intensity ==

Haldane proceeds to define the ''intensity of selection'' regarding "juvenile survival" (that is, survival to reproductive age) as &lt;math&gt;I = \ln (s_0/S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of those with the optimal genotype (or genotype) that survive to reproduce, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient for the entire population. The quotient of deaths &lt;math&gt;1-S&lt;/math&gt; for the entire population would have been &lt;math&gt;1-s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if all genotypes had survived as well as the optimal, hence &lt;math&gt;s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths due to selection. As Haldane mentions, if &lt;math&gt;s_0 \approx S&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;I \approx s_0-S&lt;/math&gt; – since ln(1) = 0.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== The cost ==

Haldane writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall investigate the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation. One or more genes are rare because their appearance by mutation is balanced by natural selection. A sudden change occurs in the environment, for example, pollution by smoke, a change of climate, the introduction of a new food source, predator, or pathogen, and above all migration to a new habitat. It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the new environment, and its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection. But meanwhile, a number of deaths, or their equivalents in lowered fertility, have occurred. If selection at the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus is responsible for &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; of these deaths in any generation the reproductive capacity of the species will be &lt;math&gt;\prod \left( 1- d_i \right)&lt;/math&gt; of that of the optimal genotype, or &lt;math&gt;\exp \left ( -\sum d_i\right)&lt;/math&gt; nearly, if every &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is small. Thus the intensity of selection approximates to &lt;math&gt;\sum d_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparing to the above, we have that &lt;math&gt;d_i = s_{0i} - S&lt;/math&gt;, if we say that &lt;math&gt;s_{0i}&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of deaths for the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; selected locus and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is again the quotient of deaths for the entire population.

The problem statement is therefore that the [[allele]]s in question are ''not'' particularly beneficial under the previous circumstances; but a change in environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows for more than one gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.

The total cost of substitution of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; gene is the sum &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; of all values of &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; over all generations of selection; that is, until fixation of the gene. Haldane states that he will show that &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; depends mainly on &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;, the small frequency of the gene in question, as selection begins – that is, at the time that the environmental change occurs (or begins to occur).&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

== A mathematical model of the cost of diploids ==
Let '''A''' and '''a''' be two alleles with frequencies &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation. Their relative fitness is given by&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|-
| width=100 | Genotype
| width=70 | '''AA'''
| width=70 | '''Aa'''
| width=70 | '''aa'''
|-
| Frequency
| &lt;math&gt;p_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2p_nq_n&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;q_n^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Fitness
| 1
| &lt;math&gt;1 - \lambda K&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1 - K&lt;/math&gt;
|}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1.

If λ = 0, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''AA''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''AA''' ('''A''' dominant), and if λ = 1, then '''Aa''' has the same fitness as '''aa''', e.g. if '''Aa''' is phenotypically equivalent with '''aa''' ('''A''' recessive). In general λ indicates how close in fitness '''Aa''' is to '''aa'''.

The fraction of selective deaths in the &lt;math&gt;n^\mbox{th}&lt;/math&gt; generation then is

: &lt;math&gt;d_n = 2\lambda Kp_nq_n + Kq_n^2 = Kq_n[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n]&lt;/math&gt;

and the total number of deaths is the population size multiplied by

: &lt;math&gt;D =  K \sum_0^\infin q_n \; [2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q_n].&lt;/math&gt;

== Important number 300 ==
Haldane approximates the above equation by taking the continuum limit of the above equation.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt; This is done by multiplying and dividing it by dq so that it is in integral form

:&lt;math&gt; dq_n=-Kp_n q_n[\lambda + (1-2 \lambda  )q_n ] &lt;/math&gt;
substituting q=1-p, the cost (given by the total number of deaths, 'D', required to make a substitution) is given by

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{[2\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}{(1 - q)[\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q]}dq = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{\lambda(1 - 2\lambda)}{\lambda + (1 - 2\lambda)q}\right]dq.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming λ &amp;lt; 1, this gives

: &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda - (1 - 2\lambda) p_0}{\lambda}\right)\right] \approx \frac{1}{1 - \lambda} \left[-\mbox{ln } p_0 + \lambda \mbox{ ln }\left(\frac{1 - \lambda}{\lambda}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the last approximation assumes &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; to be small.

If λ = 1, then we have

: &lt;math&gt;D = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \frac{2 - q}{(1 - q)^2} = \int_0^{q_{_0}} \left[\frac{1}{1 - q} + \frac{1}{(1 - q)^2}\right]dq = p_0^{-1} - \mbox{ ln } p_0 + O(\lambda K).&lt;/math&gt;

In his discussion Haldane writes that the substitution cost, if it is paid by juvenile deaths, "usually involves a number of deaths equal to about 10 or 20 times the number in a generation" – the minimum being the population size (= "the number in a generation") and rarely being 100 times that number. Haldane assumes 30 to be the mean value.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

Assuming substitution of genes to take place slowly, one gene at a time over ''n'' generations, the fitness of the species will fall below the optimum (achieved when the substitution is complete) by a factor of about 30/''n'', so long as this is small – small enough to prevent extinction. Haldane doubts that high intensities – such as in the case of the peppered moth – have occurred frequently and estimates that a value of ''n'' = 300 is a probable number of generations. This gives a selection intensity of &lt;math&gt;I = 30/300 = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;.

Haldane then continues:&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The number of loci in a vertebrate species has been estimated at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at most of them are very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.&lt;ref name=Haldane/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number 300 of generations is a conservative estimate for a slowly evolving species not at the brink of extinction by Haldane's calculation. For a difference of at least 1,000 genes, 300,000 generations might be needed – maybe more, if some gene runs through more than one optimisation.

== Origin of the term "Haldane's dilemma" ==
Apparently the first use of the term "Haldane's dilemma" was by palaeontologist [[Leigh Van Valen]] in his 1963 paper "Haldane's Dilemma, Evolutionary Rates, and Heterosis".

Van Valen writes:&lt;ref name=VanValen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Valen | first1 = Leigh | year = 1963 | title = Haldane's Dilemma, evolutionary rates, and heterosis | url = | journal = Amer. Nat | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 185–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Haldane (1957 [= ''The Cost of Natural Selection'']) drew attention to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.&lt;ref name=VanValen/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is, since a high number of deaths are required to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane's model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are ''N'' such genes, then the reproductive capacity of the species will be lowered to 0.9&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; times the original capacity. Therefore, if it is necessary for the population to fix more than one gene, it may not have reproductive capacity to counter the deaths.

In 1967 J. A. Sved found that the dilemma was based on wrong calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=O'Donald |first=Peter |date=1969 |title=" Haldane's dilemma" and the rate of natural selection |journal=Nature |volume=221 | issue = 5183  |page=815 |pmid=5675622 |doi=10.1038/221815a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12053">{{math|}}The '''Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)''' is an alphanumerical [[classification scheme]] collaboratively produced by staff of, and based on the coverage of, the two major mathematical reviewing databases, [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. The MSC is used by many mathematics [[Academic journal|journals]], which ask authors of [[research papers]] and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The current version is MSC2010.

== Structure ==

The MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used.

The first level is represented by a two digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two digit number. For example:

* '''53''' is the classification for [[differential geometry]]
* '''53A''' is the classification for classical differential geometry
* '''53A45''' is the classification for [[Euclidean vector|vector]] and [[tensor]] analysis

=== First level ===
At the top level, 64 mathematical disciplines are labeled with a unique 2 digit number. As well as the typical areas of mathematical research, there are top level categories for "[[History]] and [[Biography]]", "[[Mathematics Education]]", and for the overlap with different sciences. [[Physics]] (i.e. mathematical physics) is particularly well represented in the classification scheme with a number of different categories including:
* [[Fluid mechanics]]
* [[Quantum mechanics]]
* [[Geophysics]]
* [[Optics]] and [[electromagnetic theory]]

All valid MSC classification codes must have at least the first level identifier.

=== Second level ===

The second level codes are a single letter from the Latin alphabet. These represent specific areas covered by the first level discipline. The second level codes vary from discipline to discipline.

For example, for differential geometry, the top-level code is '''53''', and the second-level codes are:
* '''A''' for classical differential geometry
* '''B''' for local differential geometry
* '''C''' for global differential geometry
* '''D''' for symplectic geometry and contact geometry

In addition, the special second level code "-" is used for specific kinds of materials. These codes are of the form:

* '''53-00''' General reference works (handbooks, dictionaries, bibliographies, etc.)
* '''53-01''' Instructional exposition (textbooks, tutorial papers, etc.)
* '''53-02''' Research exposition (monographs, survey articles)
* '''53-03''' Historical (must also be assigned at least one classification number from Section 01)
* '''53-04''' Explicit machine computation and programs (not the theory of computation or programming)
* '''53-06''' Proceedings, conferences, collections, etc.

The second and third level of these codes are always the same - only the first level changes. For example, it is not valid to use '''53-''' as a classification. Either '''53''' on its own or, better yet, a more specific code should be used.

=== Third level ===

Third level codes are the most specific, usually corresponding to a specific kind of mathematical object or a well-known problem or research area.

The third-level code '''99''' exists in every category and means ''none of the above, but in this section''

== Using the scheme ==

The AMS recommends that papers submitted to its journals for publication have one primary classification and one or more optional secondary classifications. A typical MSC subject class line on a research paper looks like

MSC Primary 03C90; Secondary 03-02;

=={{anchor|MOS|AMS Classification|MSC1990|MSC2000|MSC2010}}History==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
According to the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) help page about MSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/help/field_help.html#mscp]&lt;/ref&gt; the MSC has been revised a number of times since 1940. Based on a scheme to organize AMS's ''Mathematical Offprint Service'' (MOS scheme), the ''AMS Classification'' was established for the classification of reviews in ''Mathematical Reviews'' in the 1960s. It saw various ad-hoc changes. Despite its shortcomings, [[Zentralblatt für Mathematik]] started to use it as well in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, a jointly revised scheme with more formal rules was agreed upon by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik under the new name Mathematics Subject Classification. It saw various revisions as ''MSC1990'', ''MSC2000'' and ''MSC2010''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Wegner. ''Indexierung mathematischer Literatur Die Revision der Mathematics Subject Classification MSC''. Institute of Mathematics, TU Berlin. http://fidmath.de/fileadmin/download/graz_wegner.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH started collecting input from the mathematical community on the next revision of MSC, which is due to be released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://msc2020.org Announcement of the plan to revise the Mathematics Subject Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; The original classification of older items has not been changed. This can sometimes make it difficult to search for older works dealing with particular topics. Changes at the first level involved the subjects with (present) codes 03, 08, 12-20, 28, 37, 51, 58, 74, 90, 91, 92.

== Relation to other classification schemes ==

For physics papers the [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) is often used. Due to the large overlap between mathematics and physics research it is quite common to see both PACS and MSC codes on research papers, particularly for multidisciplinary journals and repositories such as the [[arXiv]].

The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] (CCS) is a similar hierarchical classification scheme for [[computer science]]. There is some overlap between the AMS and ACM classification schemes, in subjects related to both mathematics and computer science, however the two schemes differ in the details of their organization of those topics.

The classification scheme used on the arXiv is chosen to reflect the papers submitted. As arXiv is multidisciplinary its classification scheme does not fit entirely with the MSC, ACM or PACS classification schemes. It is common to see codes from one or more of these schemes on individual papers.

The '''media and American adolescent sexuality''' relates to the effect the media has on the [[Adolescent sexuality in the United States|sexuality of American adolescents]], and the portrayal thereof.

According to Sexual Teens, Sexual Media: Investigating Media's Influence on Adolescent Sexuality, adolescence can be divided into three different stages; early (ages 8–13 years), middle(ages 13–16 for girls, 14-17 for boys) and late (16 and older for girls, 17 and older for boys). Each stage focuses on different aspects of cognitive, physical, social and psychological development. Although not all teens develop through adolescence at the same rate the stages usually follow a specific pattern. For a teen in the early stages of adolescence they are in the beginning stages of puberty. In this stage of adolescence, relationships begin to become important as well as their physical appearance. Middle adolescence is characterized by independence from their family and increased activity with their peers. This is the stage where sexual activity may begin to occur. The last stage of adolescence the teenager begins to feel more secure in their bodies and their sexual behavior. With these aspects of adolescence in mind, media can play an important role in how teen shape their views about sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Teens, Sexual Media: Investigating Media's Influence on Adolescent Sexuality|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|pages=2|author1=Jane D. Brown |author2=Jeanne R. Steele |author3=Kim Walsh-Childers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers remain divided on the role of sexuality in the media on adolescent sexual health.  The American Academy of Pediatrics has argued that media representations of sexuality may influence teen sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="PED media"/&gt;  However some scholars have argued that such claims have been premature.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2010"&gt;Steinberg, L., &amp; Monahan, K.  2010.  Developmental Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increasing amounts of sexual media US Government statistic state that teens have delayed the onset of sexual intercourse in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;childstats.gov&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalism professor and media critic Jane Brown, the media is piquing teen interest in sex at ages younger than previous.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; Dr. Brown argues that research has "found a direct relationship between the amount of sexual content children see and their level of sexual activity or their intentions to have sex in the future."&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt;  However, the direction (and mechanism) of causality remains unclear.

==Sexuality in the media==
Some scholars argue that American media is the most sexually suggestive in the world.&lt;ref name="Strasburger"/&gt; According to this view, the sexual messages contained in film, television, and music are becoming more explicit in dialog, lyrics, and behavior. In addition, these messages may contain unrealistic, inaccurate, and misleading information. Some scholars argue that still developing teens may be particularly vulnerable to media effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruber|first=Enid|author2=Grube, Joel|title=Adolescent Sexuality and the Media|journal=Western Journal of Medicine|date=March 2000|volume=172|series=3|pages=210–214|doi=10.1136/ewjm.172.3.210|pmc=1070813}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 report found that teens rank the media second only to school sex education programs as a leading source of information about sex,&lt;ref name="PED media" /&gt; but a 2004 report found that "the media far outranked parents or schools as the source of information about birth control."&lt;ref name="Strasburger" /&gt;

Media often portray emotional side-effects of sexuality such as guilt, and disappointment, but less often physical risks such as pregnancy or STDs.&lt;ref name="Roberts et al."&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Roberts| author2=Henriksen| author3=Foehr| last-author-amp=yes| title=Adolescence,adolescents, and media| journal=Handbook of Adolescent Sexuality| edition=3rd| year=2009| volume=2| pages=314–344| doi=10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy002010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One media analysis found that sex was usually between unmarried couples and examples of using condoms or other contraception were "extremely rare."&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt; Many of programs or films do not depict consequence for sexual behavior. For example, only 10% programs that contain sexual scenes include any warnings to the potential risks or responsibilities of having sex such as sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; In television programming aimed at teens, more than 90% of episodes had at least one sexual reference in it with an average of 7.9 references per hour.&lt;ref name="aubrey"/&gt;

However, government statistics suggest that since 1991, both teen sex and teen pregnancy have declined dramatically despite the media generally becoming increasingly sexually explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childstats.gov/americaschildren/beh4.asp|title=Childstats.gov - America's Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 2017 - Sexual Activity|website=childstats.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of the media on beliefs about sex==
Some scholars feel that adolescents may turn to the media as a "sexual super peer" when seeking information about sexual norms and adult roles given the lack of information about sexuality readily available to them.&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt; For example, in one study of 13-and 14-year-olds, heavy exposure to sexually oriented television also increased acceptance of non-marital sex.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; Another study found that teens overestimate how many of their peers are sexually active, a problem contributed to by the media.&lt;ref name="media impact"/&gt;

Another study found that middle-school-aged boys who watch music videos or pro-wrestling one day a week are 10% more likely to have a higher acceptance rate for rape than boys who do not watch any.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;!--&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;--&gt; Boys who watch music videos four days a week and pro wrestling 1.7 days a week (the mean exposure rate for boys) have 70% higher odds of endorsing a greater level of rape acceptance.&lt;ref name="Kaestle"/&gt; "Both music videos and pro wrestling shows are popular with youth, combine violent and sexual content, and glorify individuals who behave violently."&lt;ref name="Kaestle"/&gt;

==Effects of the media on sexual behavior==

===Pregnancy===
Some researchers have found a correlation between the amount of television with high sexual content that teenagers watch and an increased likelihood of them becoming pregnant or fathering a child out of wedlock.&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; Some studies suggest teens exposed to the most sexual content on TV are twice as likely as teens watching less of this material to become pregnant before they reach age 20.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

These researchers believe that reducing the amount of sexual content adolescents watch on television could substantially reduce the teen pregnancy rate.&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; "It's a cumulative effect," Brown believes. "It's probably not any one portrayal that makes the difference, but it's a consistent, and now unhealthy, sexual script that adolescents do see as a depiction of appropriate behavior."&lt;ref name="brownusa"/&gt;

Several complementary studies have found that television viewing can influence multiple aspects of reproductive health among youths and that "earlier sexual initiation is associated with negative health outcomes."&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; Previous research has suggested two ways that glamorized perception of sex may contribute to teen pregnancy: by encouraging teens to become sexually active early in their adolescence and by promoting inconsistent use of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

===Early sexual activity===
Some studies have also found that adolescents whose [[media diet]] was rich in sexual content were more than twice as likely as others to have had sex by the time they were 16.&lt;ref name="truth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luscombe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watching sex"/&gt; In a Kaiser Family Foundation study, 76 percent of teens said that one reason young people have sex is because TV shows and movies make it seem normal for teens.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; In addition to higher likelihoods that an adolescent exposed to sexual content in the media will engage in sexual behaviors, they are also have higher levels of intending to have sex in the future and more positive expectations of sex.&lt;ref name="tv sex 2006"/&gt;

Some studies suggest that children who watch adult content on television are more likely to have sex earlier once they reach adolescence.&lt;ref name="early tv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt; For every hour of adult-targeted television or movies watched by children when they were 6 to 8 years old, there was a 33% increased risk of becoming sexually active in early adolescence.

"Children have neither the life experience nor the brain development to fully differentiate between a reality they are moving toward and a fiction meant solely to entertain," explained David Bickham, a staff scientist in the Center on Media and Child Health.&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt; "Children learn from the media, and when they watch media with sexual references and innuendos, our research suggests they are more likely to engage in sexual activity earlier in life."&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt;

Other research has suggested that linking sexuality in media with adolescent sexual behavior is premature.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2010"/&gt; Steinberg and Monahan reanalized a dataset of teen sexual behavior (Collins et al.) using [[propensity score matching]] and discovered that with other risk factors controlled, viewing sexual media did not predict early onset of sexual behavior in adolescents. The authors concluded that links between media viewing and adolescent sexuality are more tenuous than previous believed.

Researchers on both sides of the debate acknowledge that assigning causality to correlations between media use and sexual behavior are difficult, given the lack of experimental research, and difficulty controlling for all potential confounding variables.&lt;ref name="Steinberg &amp; Monahan 2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinberg |author2=Monahan |last-author-amp=yes |title=Premature Dissemination of Advice Undermines Our Credibility as Scientists : Reply to Brown (2011) and to Collins, Martino, and Elliott (2011) |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2011 |volume=47 |pages=582–584 |doi=10.1037/a0022562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that the relationship between exposure to sexual contact in the media and increased sexual activity among adolescents is more pronounced in white youths than black youths. Black teens are more likely to be influenced by their friends' sexual experiences and their parents' expectations than by what they see in the media.&lt;ref name="sexy media"/&gt;

==Pornography==
Between the 3rd and 10th grades more than 90% of children will be exposed to pornography.&lt;ref name="porn"/&gt; Psychiatrist Jerald says access, affordability and anonymity have made online sexual activity "extraordinarily common" among all ages, including adolescents.&lt;ref name="porn"/&gt; Adolescents who intentionally seek out pornography, both online and off, are overwhelmingly male.&lt;ref name="Ybarra"/&gt; Older youth are more likely than younger youth to seek porn.&lt;ref name="Ybarra"/&gt; Individuals who are already at risk of being attracted to sexual aggression are more likely to be influenced by pornographic exposure. This in turn explains that these individuals are more likely to believe in the various unusual sexual behaviors as common causing negative effects towards sexual experiences. However, it is important that once these negative attitudes have been formed, it was not easily reversed by education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malamuth|first=Neil|date=October 1993|title=Pornography's Impact on Male Adolescent|url=|journal=Adolescent Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medstar Television Inc.''' is a television production company based in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].

==History &amp; Founding==
Medstar was incorporated in the state of [[Pennsylvania]] in 1981 by Paul Dowling and William Ferretti to produce medical news and health information. &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/features/8501090015_1_medstar-humana-hospital-health-matters&lt;/ref&gt; From the start, Medstar financed, produced and distributed all of its own productions. ([http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/features/8501090015_1_medstar-humana-hospital-health-matters Health Matters: Independents Prescription Works])

==Productions==
One of its first was ''Health Matters'', a program on health and lifestyle issues, produced in cooperation with hospitals throughout the United States, which sponsor the program in their local areas with local and national content, along the same lines as ''[[PM Magazine]]''. ''Health Matters'' was [[television syndication|syndicated]] to various commercial and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations during the 1980s.  &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.mcall.com/1987-01-18/business/2567668_1_medstar-communications-health-matters-television&lt;/ref&gt;

Medstar later expanded to produce two medical news products, "MedstarSource" and "MedstarAdvances" syndicated to commercial television stations in the United States.  Production of these segments ended in August 2011.

In 1990 Medstar began to produce programming for cable television including the [[Discovery Channel]], [[HBO]] and [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]].

In 1995 the company created the ''Medical Detectives'' series on [[forensic science]], which premiered on TLC in April 1995. ([https://www.imdb.com/company/co0006447/ IMDB program listing])  It was the first reality based forensic series on television and used a 'murder mystery' approach to documentary storytelling. In 2000 the Medical Detectives series moved to the CourtTV network (now [[TruTV]]) where it was re-titled ''[[Forensic Files]]'' and quickly became the networks highest rated television series.  Internationally, the series was sold to stations and networks in over 142 countries where it remains enormously popular.  Peter Thomas narrates the series which is still in production, with more than 400 episodes. In 2002, ''Forensic Files'' would appear on [[NBC]] as the first prime time television series originally produced for cable to air on a commercial network, as a summer replacement series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">The '''{{Lang|de|Mendelssohn-Werkverzeichnis}}''' (MWV) (German for '''Mendelssohn Work Index''') is the first modern fully researched [[Catalogues of classical compositions#Comprehensive catalogues|music catalogue]] of the works of [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. It appeared in 2009 under the auspices of the [[Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] (SAW) under the leadership of the German music scholar Ralf Wehner, and is published by the firm of [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] as part of the "Leipzig Edition of the Works of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy".&lt;ref&gt;Wehner (2009), pp. 77-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendelssohn himself only allocated [[opus number]]s up to 72 for his published works, with further numbers up to 121 being added posthumously. Moreover, none of Mendelssohn's earlier works including his 12 [[String symphonies (Mendelssohn)|string symphonies]] or his operas, had any defined opus numbers. The MWV "conflates the known works into 26 groups and assigns a distinct MWV number to each of the works. Within each group, the works are ordered chronologically."&lt;ref&gt;Wehner (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airplane in-flight information.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Airplane in-flight information system has much lower criticality than flight control systems, yet both coexist in one "mixed criticality" machine.]]

A '''mixed criticality''' system is a system containing computer hardware and [[software]] that can execute several applications of different criticality, such as safety-critical and non-safety critical, or of different [[Safety Integrity Level]] (SIL). Different criticality applications are engineered to different levels of assurance, with high criticality applications being the most costly to design and verify. These kinds of systems are typically embedded in a machine such as an aircraft whose safety must be ensured.

==Principle==
Traditional safety-critical systems had to be tested and certified in their entirety to show that they were safe to use. However, many such systems are composed of a mixture of safety-critical and non-critical parts, as for example when an aircraft contains a passenger entertainment system that is isolated from the safety-critical flight systems. Some issues to address in mixed criticality systems include [[Real-time computing|real-time behaviour]], memory isolation, data and control coupling.

Computer scientists have developed techniques for handling systems which thus have mixed criticality, but there are many challenges remaining especially for multi-core hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~burns/RTSS.pdf | title=Response-Time Analysis for Mixed Criticality Systems | publisher=University of York | accessdate=19 February 2013 |author1=Baruah, SK |author2=Burns, A |author3=Davis, RI }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~nmegow/papers/mfcs10-mcscheduling.pdf | title=Scheduling real-time mixed-criticality jobs | accessdate=19 February 2013 |author1=Baruah, S |author2=Bonifaci, V |author3=D'Angelo, G |author4=Li, H |author5=Marchetti-Spaccamela, A |author6=Megow, N |author7=Stougie, L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vmars.tuwien.ac.at/documents/intern/3091/across-mpsoc-paper_submission.pdf | title=The ACROSS MPSoC – A New Generation of Multi-Core Processors designed for Safety-Critical Embedded Systems | accessdate=17 May 2013 |author1=El-Salloum, C. |author2=Elshuber, M. |author3=Höftberger, O. |author4=Isakovic, H. |author5=Wasicek, A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/burns/review.pdf | title=Mixed Criticality Systems - A Review | publisher=University of York | accessdate=4 March 2016 |author1=Burns, A |author2=Davis, R.I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Priority and Criticality ==
Basically, most errors are currently committed when making confusion between priority attribution and criticality management. As priority defines an order between different tasks or messages to be transmitted inside a system, criticality define classes of messages which can have different parameters depending on the current use case. For example, in case of car crash avoidance or obstacle anticipation, camera sensors can suddenly emit messages more often, and so create an overload in the system. That is when we need to make Mixed-Criticality operate : to select messages to absolutely guarantee on the system in these overload cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3238">In botanical terms, '''monandrous''' simply means to have a single [[stamen]].

== In orchids ==
A distinction between monandrous and other flowers is particularly relevant in the classification of [[orchid]]s. The monandrous orchids form a [[clade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = What does morphology tell us about orchid relationships?—a cladistic analysis | author = John V. Freudenstein and Finn N. Rasmussen | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/86/2/225 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 1999 | volume = 86 | pages = 225–248 | doi = 10.2307/2656939 | jstor = 2656939 | issue = 2 | publisher = Botanical Society of America | pmid = 21680361}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of the subfamilies [[Orchidoideae]], [[Vanilloideae]], and [[Epidendroideae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A phylogenetic analysis of the Orchidaceae: evidence from rbcL nucleotide sequences | author = Kenneth M. Cameron| journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 1999 | volume = 86 | pages = 208–224 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/86/2/208 | doi = 10.2307/2656938 | jstor = 2656938 | issue = 2 | publisher = Botanical Society of America | pmid = 21680360|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other subfamilies, [[Apostasioideae]] and [[Cypripedioideae]], have at least two stamens.

== In animals ==
In animals, a monandrous system occurs when females have one mate at a time. For example, a female [[Speckled Wood (butterfly)|speckled wood]] butterfly will typically only mate once within her short lifetime.&lt;ref name="Lauwers 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauwers|first=K.|author2=Van Dyck, H.|title=The Cost of Mating with a Non-Virgin Male in a Monandrous Butterfly: Experimental Evidence from the Speckled Wood, Pararge aegeria|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2006|volume=60|issue=1|pages=69–76|doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0142-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also common in certain bee species, like ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'' and ''[[Bombus pratorum]]'', where a female will only mate with one male during her nuptial flight and use the sperm reserves for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baer, B. and P. Schmid-Hempel | year = 2001 | title = Unexpected consequences of polyandry for parasitism and fitness in the bumblebee, ''Bombus terrestris'' | journal = Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 8 | pages = 1639–1643 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[1639:ucopfp]2.0.co;2 | pmid=11580023}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also seen in a few species of stingless bees, like ''[[Plebeia remota]]'', where the males will attempt to mate with the queen as she tries to leave the nest, but only one male will be successful in mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of workers, queens and males in Plebeia remota colonies (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini), a stingless bee with reproductive diapause|url = http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2009/vol8-2/pdf/kerr030.pdf|journal = Genetics and Molecular Research|pages = 672–683|volume = 8|issue = 2|doi = 10.4238/vol8-2kerr030|first = D.A.|last = Alves|first2 = V.L.|last2 = Imperatriz-Fonseca|first3 = P.S.|last3 = Santos-Filho|pmid=19554766|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renewable energy sources}}
The '''Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority''' (NELHA) administers the Hawaii Ocean Science and Technology Park (HOST Park). NELHA was founded in 1974. At {{convert|870|acre}}, HOST Park is perhaps the largest single green economic development project in the world solely devoted to growing a green economy. NELHA also administers a small site, {{convert|4|acre}}, in Puna on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii for geothermal research. The original mission was for research into the uses of [[Deep ocean water|Deep Ocean Water]] in [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]] (OTEC) [[renewable energy]] production and in [[aquaculture]]. It later added research into sustainable uses of natural energy sources such as [[solar energy]].
Its administration offices are located in the HOST Park [[Keahole Point]] in the [[Kona District, Hawaii|North Kona District]].
The entrance is on the [[Hawaii Belt Road]] at coordinates {{coord|19|42|58|N|156|02|01|W|display=title,inline|region:US-HI_type:landmark}}, just south of the [[Kona International Airport]].  The main administration office is in the 4 acre research campus at the end of the road along the coastline on Keahole Point.

The laboratory was founded in 1974 with {{convert|345|acre}}, associated with the [[University of Hawaii]]. Large pipelines pump cold sea water from a depth of {{convert|3000|ft}}. For three months in 1979, a small amount of electricity was generated. A larger plant was constructed in the &lt;ref name=april2009/&gt; Almost $250M was spent on Ocean thermal energy conversion, but by 1991, the research shifted to other areas. The adjacent Science and Technology Park was merged into the facility, expanding it to {{convert|877|acre}}. A [[neutrino]] detector was partially constructed in the 1990s called [[Project DUMAND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/dmnd/dumand.html DUMAND web site] at the University of Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, {{convert|50|acre}} were leased to a commercial company which filters and bottles the water for sale in Japan.&lt;ref name=dags&gt;[http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20090531/BUSINESS13/905310347 Natural Energy Lab ready for fresh start with DAGS] in [[Honolulu Advertiser]], May 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The pipelines were broken in the October 15, [[2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake|2006 earthquake]], but one of the three has been repaired over two years later.
Makai Ocean Engineering, working with [[Lockheed Martin]], restarted OTEC research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makai.com/p-otec.htm "Deep Pipelines for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion"] on Makai Ocean Engineering web site&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]], [[biofuel from algae]], [[solar thermal energy]], [[Solar concentrator|solar concentrating]] and [[wind power]] are some of the 40 tenants.&lt;ref name=april2009&gt;[http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/articles/2009/04/26/features/features01.txt Revisiting NELHA ] in [[West Hawaii Today]], April 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nearctic''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s constituting the Earth's land surface.

[[Image:Ecozone Nearctic.svg|thumb|400px|The Nearctic realm]]
The Nearctic realm covers most of [[North America]], including [[Greenland]], [[Central Florida]], and the highlands of [[Mexico]]. The parts of North America that are not in the Nearctic realm are Eastern Mexico, [[Southern Florida]], coastal [[Central Florida]], [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]] islands which are part of the [[Neotropical realm]], together with [[South America]].

==Major ecological regions==
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) divides the Nearctic into four '''[[bioregions]]''', defined as "geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)."

===Canadian Shield===
The [[Canadian Shield]] bioregion extends across the northern portion of the continent, from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It includes the Nearctic's [[Arctic Tundra]] and [[Boreal forest]] ecoregions.

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by part of the Canadian Province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].

===Eastern North America===

The Eastern North America bioregion includes the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] of the Eastern United States and southeastern Canada, the [[Great Plains]] [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grasslands]] of the Central United States and south-central Canada, the [[temperate coniferous forests]] of the Southeastern United States, including [[Central Florida]]. In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[North American Atlantic Region]] and part of the Canadian Province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].

===Western North America===
The Western North America bioregion includes the [[temperate coniferous forests]] of the coastal and mountain regions of southern Alaska, western Canada, and the Western United States from the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] and [[Northern California]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], as well as the cold-winter intermountain [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] and temperate grasslands and shrublands of the [[Western United States]].

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[Rocky Mountain region]].

===Northern Mexico and Southwestern North America===
The Northern Mexico bioregion includes the mild-winter to cold-winter deserts and xeric shrublands of northern Mexico, Southern [[California]], and the [[Southwestern United States]], including the [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]], [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]], and [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] Deserts. The [[Mediterranean climate]] [[ecoregion]]s of the [[Southern California|Southern]] and [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast of California]] include the [[California chaparral and woodlands]], [[California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion|California coastal sage and chaparral]], [[California interior chaparral and woodlands]], and [[California montane chaparral and woodlands]].

The bioregion also includes the warm temperate and subtropical pine and pine-oak forests, including the [[Arizona Mountains forests]] and the [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Occidental]], [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Oriental]], and [[Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests|Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir]] pine-oak forests.

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[Madrean Region]].

==History==
Although North America and South America are presently joined by the [[Isthmus of Panama]], these continents were separated for about 180 million years, and evolved very different plant and animal lineages. When the ancient supercontinent of [[Pangaea]] split into two about 180 million years ago, North America remained joined to [[Eurasia]] as part of the supercontinent of [[Laurasia]], while South America was part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. North America later split from Eurasia. North America has been joined by land bridges to both [[Asia]] and South America since then, which allowed an exchange of plant and animal [[species]] between the continents, the [[Great American Interchange]].

A former land bridge across the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America allowed many plants and animals to move between these continents, and the Nearctic realm shares many plants and animals with the [[Palearctic]]. The two realms are sometimes included in a single '''[[Holarctic]]''' realm.

Many large animals, or [[megafauna]], including [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s, [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodont]]s, [[ground sloth]]s, sabre-tooth cats (''[[Smilodon]]''), the giant short-faced [[bear]] (''[[Arctodus simus]]''), and the [[cheetah]], became extinct in North America at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch (ice ages), at the same time the first evidence of humans appeared, in what is called the [[Holocene extinction event]]. Previously, the megafaunal extinctions were believed to have been caused by the changing climate, but many scientists now believe, while the climate change contributed to these extinctions, the primary cause was hunting by newly arrived humans or, in the case of some large predators, extinction resulting from prey becoming scarce. The [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), [[brown bear]] or grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos''), [[moose]] or Eurasian elk (''Alces alces''), and [[elk]] or wapiti (''Cervus canadensis'') entered North America around the same time as the first humans, and expanded rapidly, filling ecological niches left empty by the newly extinct North American megafauna.

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora and fauna that originated in the Nearctic===
Animals originally unique to the Nearctic include:
*Family [[Canidae]], [[dog]]s, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, and [[coyote]]s 
*Family [[Camelidae]], [[camel]]s and their South American relatives including the [[llama]]. now extinct in the Nearctic
*Family [[Equidae]], [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and their relatives. now only found in the Nearctic as feral horses
*Family [[Tapiridae]], [[tapir]]s now extinct in the Nearctic
*Family [[Antilocapridae]], last survivor of which is the [[pronghorn]]
*Subfamily [[Tremarctinae]], or short-faced, [[bear]]s, including the giant short-faced bear (''Arctodus simius'')   One other member of the group is the [[spectacled bear]] (''Tremarctos ornatus'') of South America.  now extinct in the Nearctic
*The [[American cheetah]] (''Miracinonyx'') now extinct worldwide

===Flora and fauna endemic to the Nearctic===
One [[bird]] family, the [[wrentit]]s (Timaliinae), is endemic to the Nearctic region. The Holarctic has four endemic families: [[Loon|divers]] (Gaviidae), [[grouse]] (Tetraoninae), [[auk]]s (Alcidae), and the [[waxwing]]s (Bombycillidae). The scarab beetle families [[Pleocomidae]] and [[Diphyllostomatidae]] ([[Coleoptera]]) are also endemic to the Nearctic. The fly species ''[[Cynomya cadaverina]]'' is also found in high numbers in this area.

Plants families endemic or nearly endemic to the Nearctic include the  [[Crossosomataceae]], [[Simmondsiaceae]], and [[Limnanthaceae]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20431">'''Persuasive technology''' is broadly defined as [[technology]] that is designed to change attitudes or behaviors of the users through [[persuasion]] and [[social influence]], but not through [[coercion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such technologies are regularly used in [[sales]], [[diplomacy]], [[politics]], [[religion]], [[military|military training]], [[public health]], and [[management]], and may potentially be used in any area of human-human or human-computer interaction. Most self-identified persuasive technology research focuses on interactive, computational technologies, including desktop computers, Internet services, video games, and mobile devices,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oinas-Kukkonen2008|Oinas-Kukkonen et al. 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; but this incorporates and builds on the results, theories, and methods of [[experimental psychology]], [[rhetoric]],&lt;ref name="Bogost 2007"&gt;[[#Bogost2007|Bogost 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[human-computer interaction]]. The design of persuasive technologies can be seen as a particular case of design with intent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lockton2010|Lockton et al. 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomies==

===''Functional Triad''===
Persuasive technologies can be categorized by their functional roles. [[B. J. Fogg]] proposes the ''Functional Triad'' as a classification of three "basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies": persuasive technologies can function as tools, media, or social actors – or as more than one at once.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg1998|Fogg 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* As ''tools'', technologies can increase people's ability to perform a target behavior by making it easier or restructuring it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg 2002, ch. 3]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Wizard (software)|installation wizard]] can influence task completion – including completing tasks (such as installation of additional software) not planned by users.
* As ''media'', interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior, empathizing, or exploring causal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg 2002, ch. 4]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, simulations and games instantiate rules and procedures that express a point of view and can shape behavior and persuade; these use ''procedural rhetoric''.&lt;ref name="Bogost 2007"/&gt;
* Technologies can also function as ''social actors''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reeves1996|Reeves &amp; Nass 1996]], [[#Turkle1984|Turkle 1984]]&lt;/ref&gt; This "opens the door for computers to apply ... social influence".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg 2002, p. 90]]&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive technologies can cue social responses, e.g., through their use of language, assumption of established social roles, or physical presence. For example, computers can use [[embodied conversational agent]]s as part of their interface. Or a helpful or [[self-disclosure|disclosive]] computer can cause users to mindlessly [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg1997b|Fogg 1997b]], [[#Moon2000|Moon 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct interaction v. mediation===
Persuasive technologies can also be categorized by whether they change attitude and behaviors through direct interaction or through a mediating role:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oinas-Kukkonen_Harjumaa2008|Oinas-Kukkonen &amp; Harjumaa 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; do they persuade, for example, through [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) or [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC)? The examples already mentioned are the former, but there are many of the latter. Communication technologies can persuade or amplify the persuasion of others by transforming the social interaction,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Licklider1968|Licklider 1968]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bailenson2004|Bailenson et al. 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; providing shared feedback on interaction,&lt;ref&gt;[[#DiMicco2004|DiMicco 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; or restructuring communication processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Winograd1986|Winograd 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasion design===
Persuasion design is the design of messages by analyzing and evaluating their content, using established psychological research theories and methods. Andrew Chak&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chak2003|Chak 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the most persuasive web sites focus on making users feel comfortable about making decisions and helping them act on those decisions.

===Persuasion by social motivators===
Previous research has also utilized on social motivators like competition for persuasion. By connecting a user with other users,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Oliveira|first=Rodrigo|last2=Cherubini|first2=Mauro|last3=Oliver|first3=Nuria|date=2010-01-01|title=MoviPill: Improving Medication Compliance for Elders Using a Mobile Persuasive Social Game|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1864349.1864371|journal=Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing|series=UbiComp '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=251–260|doi=10.1145/1864349.1864371|isbn=9781605588438}}&lt;/ref&gt; his/her coworkers,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thieme|first=Anja|last2=Comber|first2=Rob|last3=Miebach|first3=Julia|last4=Weeden|first4=Jack|last5=Kraemer|first5=Nicole|last6=Lawson|first6=Shaun|last7=Olivier|first7=Patrick|date=2012-01-01|title="We'Ve Bin Watching You": Designing for Reflection and Social Persuasion to Promote Sustainable Lifestyles|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2207676.2208394|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=2337–2346|doi=10.1145/2207676.2208394|isbn=9781450310154}}&lt;/ref&gt; friends and families,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caraban|first=Ana|last2=Ferreira|first2=Maria José|last3=Gouveia|first3=Rúben|last4=Karapanos|first4=Evangelos|date=2015-01-01|title=Social Toothbrush: Fostering Family Nudging Around Tooth Brushing Habits|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2800835.2809438|journal=Adjunct Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers|series=UbiComp/ISWC'15 Adjunct|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=649–653|doi=10.1145/2800835.2809438|isbn=9781450335751}}&lt;/ref&gt; a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes. Social media such as Facebook, Twitter also facilitate the development of such systems. It has been demonstrated that social impact can result in greater behavior changes than the case where the user is isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=Meng-Chieh|last2=Chang|first2=Shih-Ping|last3=Chang|first3=Yu-Chen|last4=Chu|first4=Hao-Hua|last5=Chen|first5=Cheryl Chia-Hui|last6=Hsiao|first6=Fei-Hsiu|last7=Ko|first7=Ju-Chun|date=2009-01-01|title=Playful Bottle: A Mobile Social Persuasion System to Motivate Healthy Water Intake|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1620545.1620574|journal=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing|series=UbiComp '09|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=185–194|doi=10.1145/1620545.1620574|isbn=9781605584317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persuasive strategies ==
Halko and &amp;nbsp;Kientz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halko|first=Sajanee|last2=Kientz|first2=Julie A.|date=2010-06-07|title=Personality and Persuasive Technology: An Exploratory Study on Health-Promoting Mobile Applications|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13226-1_16|journal=Persuasive Technology|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=150–161|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13226-1_16}}&lt;/ref&gt; made an extensive search in the literature for persuasive strategies and methods used in the field of psychology to modify health-related behaviours. Their search concluded that there are 8 main types of persuasive strategies, which can be grouped into the following four categories, where each category has two complementary approaches:

=== 1 – Instruction style ===

'''Authoritative''': Persuade the technology user through an authoritative agent. For example, a strict personal trainer who instructing the user to perform the task that will meet their goal.

'''Non-Authoritative''': Persuade the user through a neutral agent, For example, a friend who encourage the user to meet their goals.

=== 2 – Social feedback ===

'''Cooperative''': Persuade the user through the notion of cooperating and teamwork. For example, allowing the user to team up with friends to complete their goals.

'''Competitive''': Persuade the user through the notion of competing. For example, users can play against friends or peers and be motivated to achieve their goal by winning the competition.

=== 3 – Motivation type ===

'''Extrinsic''': Persuade the user through external motivators. For example, &amp;nbsp;winning trophies, as a reward for completing a task.

'''Intrinsic''': Persuade the user through internal motivators. &amp;nbsp;For example, The good feeling a user would have for being healthy, or for achieving the goal.

=== 4 –&amp;nbsp;Reinforcement type ===

'''Negative Reinforcement:''' Persuade the user by removing an aversive stimulus. For example, turns a brown and dying nature scene green and healthy as the user conducts more healthy behaviors.

'''Positive Reinforcement:''' Persuade the user by adding a positive stimulus. For example, &amp;nbsp;adding flowers, butterflies, and other nice-looking elements to any empty nature scene, as the user conducts more healthy behaviors.

More recently, Lieto and &amp;nbsp;Vernero&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieto|first=Antonio|last2=Vernero|first2=Fabiana|date=2014-12-30|title=Influencing the o thers’ minds: An experimental evaluation of the use and efficacy of fallacious-reducible arguments in web and mobile technologies|url=http://www.psychnology.org/File/PNJ12(3)/PSYCHNOLOGY_JOURNAL_12_3_LIETO.pdf|journal=PsychNology Journal|language=en|publisher=University of Padova|pages=87–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also shown that arguments reducible to [[Logical Fallacies]] are a class of widely adopted persuasive techniques in both web and mobile technologies.

== Reciprocal equality ==

One feature that distinguishes persuasion technology from familiar forms of persuasion is that the individual being persuaded often cannot respond in kind. This is a lack of ''reciprocal equality''. For example, when a [[conversational agent]] persuades a user using social influence strategies, the user cannot also use similar strategies on the agent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fogg2002|Fogg, 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health behavior change ==
While persuasive technologies are found in many domains, considerable recent attention has focused on behavior change in health domains. Digital [[health coaching]] is the utilization of computers as persuasive technology to augment the personal care delivered to patients, and is used in numerous medical settings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elton2007|Elton 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous scientific studies show that online health behaviour change interventions can influence users' behaviours. Moreover, the most effective interventions are modelled on health coaching, where users are asked to set goals, educated about the consequences of their behaviour, then encouraged to track their progress toward their goals. Sophisticated systems even adapt to users who relapse by helping them get back on the bandwagon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cugelman2011|Cugelman et al. 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promote sustainable lifestyles ==
Previous work has also shown that people are receptive to change their behaviors for sustainable lifestyles. This result has encouraged researchers to develop persuasive technologies to promote for example, green travels,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Froehlich|first=Jon|last2=Dillahunt|first2=Tawanna|last3=Klasnja|first3=Predrag|last4=Mankoff|first4=Jennifer|last5=Consolvo|first5=Sunny|last6=Harrison|first6=Beverly|last7=Landay|first7=James A.|date=2009-01-01|title=UbiGreen: Investigating a Mobile Tool for Tracking and Supporting Green Transportation Habits|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1518701.1518861|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '09|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1043–1052|doi=10.1145/1518701.1518861|isbn=9781605582467}}&lt;/ref&gt; less waste,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; etc.

One common technique is to facilitate people's awareness of benefits for performing eco-friendly behaviors. For example, a review of over twenty studies exploring the effects of feedback on electricity consumption in the home showed that the feedback on the electricity consumption pattern can typically result in a 5–12% saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Corinna|date=2008-02-01|title=Feedback on household electricity consumption: a tool for saving energy?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12053-008-9009-7|journal=Energy Efficiency|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79–104|doi=10.1007/s12053-008-9009-7|issn=1570-646X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the environmental benefits such as CO2 savings, health benefit, cost are also often used to promote eco-friendly behaviors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research challenges ==
Despite the promising results of existing persuasive technologies, there are three main challenges that remain present.

=== Technical challenges ===

Persuasive technologies developed relies on self-report or automated systems that monitor human behavior using sensors and pattern recognition algorithms. Several studies in the medical field have noted that self-report is subject to bias, recall errors and low adherence rates. The physical world and human behavior are both highly complex and ambiguous. Utilizing sensors and machine learning algorithms to monitor and predict human behavior remains a challenging problem, especially that most of the persuasive technologies require just-in-time intervention.

=== Difficulty in studying behavior change ===

In general, understanding behavioral changes require long-term studies. As multiple internal and external factors can influence these changes, such as personality type, age, income, willingness to change and more. For that, it becomes difficult to understand and measure the effect of persuasive technologies.

=== Ethical challenges ===
The question of manipulating feelings and desires through persuasive technology remains an open ethical debate. User-centered design guidelines should be developed encouraging ethically and morally responsible designs, and provide a reasonable balance between the pros and cons of persuasive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IJsselsteijn|first=Wijnand|last2=Kort|first2=Yvonne de|last3=Midden|first3=Cees|last4=Eggen|first4=Berry|last5=Hoven|first5=Elise van den|date=2006-05-18|title=Persuasive Technology for Human Well-Being: Setting the Scene|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11755494_1|journal=Persuasive Technology|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=1–5|doi=10.1007/11755494_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polyphase coils''' are [[electromagnetic coil]]s  connected together in a [[polyphase system]] such as a [[electrical generator|generator]] or [[electric motor|motor]].  In modern systems, the number of phases is usually three or a multiple of three. Each phase carries a sinusoidal [[alternating current]] whose [[phase (waves)|phase]] is delayed relative to one of its neighbours and advanced relative to its other neighbour. The phase currents are separated in time evenly within each period of the alternating current. For example, in a three-phase system, the phases are separated from each other by one-third of the period.

==Coil construction==
Like all coils used in electrical machinery, polyphase coils (made from insulated conducting [[wire]]) are wound around [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] armatures with radial projections and maximum core-surface exposure to the magnetic field.

The windings are physically separated around the circumference of an electrical machine. The result of such an arrangement is a [[rotating magnetic field]] that is used to convert [[electric power|electrical power]] to rotary [[mechanical work]], or vice versa.

==Polyphase motors and generators==
Compared to single-phase motors and [[Single-phase generator|generators]], polyphase motors are simpler, because they do not require external circuitry (using [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s) to produce a starting [[torque]]. Polyphase machines can deliver constant power over each period of the alternating current, eliminating the pulsations found in a single-phase machine as the current passes through zero amplitude.

==History==
The use of polyphase coils in electrical power systems was pioneered by the engineers [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Galileo Ferraris]], and [[Michail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15591">'''Presence''' is a theoretical concept describing the extent to which media represent the world (in both physical and social environments).&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kwan Min|title=Presence, Explicated|journal=Communication Theory|date=February 2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=27–50|doi=10.1093/ct/14.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Presence is further described by Matthew Lombard and Theresa Ditton as “an illusion that a mediated experience is not mediated."&lt;ref name=lombard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lombard|author2=Ditton|title=At the heart of it all: the concept of presence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00072.x/full|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=1997|volume=3|series=2|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00072.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it often considers the effect that people experience when they interact with a [[Computer mediated environment|computer-mediated]] or [[computer graphics|computer-generated]] environment.&lt;ref name=sheridan5&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheridan|first=T. B.|title=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments (8)5|year=1999|pages=241–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptualization of presence borrows from multiple fields including [[communication]], [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[science]], [[engineering]], [[philosophy]], and the arts. The concept of presence accounts for a variety of computer applications and Web-based entertainment today that are developed on the fundamentals of the phenomenon, in order to give people the sense of, as Sheridan called it, “being there." &lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;

==Evolution of 'presence' as a concept==

[[File:Typology of human experience in virtual.png|thumb|right|Typology of human experience in the study of presence]]
The specialist use of the word “presence” derives from the term “[[telepresence]]”, coined by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] professor [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=minsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minsky|first=M|title=Telepresence|journal=MIT Press Journals|date=June 1980|pages=45–51|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/pres}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=steuer&gt;{{cite web|last=Steuer|first=J.|title=Defining virtual reality: Dimensions determining telepresence.|url=http://www.presence-research.org/papers/steuer92defining.pdf|accessdate=April 29, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924185705/http://www.presence-research.org/papers/steuer92defining.pdf|archivedate=September 24, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minsky's research explained telepresence as the manipulation of objects in the real world through remote access technology.&lt;ref name=minsky /&gt; For example, a surgeon may use a computer to control robotic arms to perform minute procedures on a patient in another room. Or a NASA technician may use a computer to control a rover to collect rock samples on Mars. In either case, the operator is granted access to real, though remote, places via televisual tools.

As technologies progressed, the need for an expanded term arose. Sheridan extrapolated Minsky’s original definition.&lt;ref name=sheridan1&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheridan|first=T. B.|title=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments (1)|year=1992|pages=120–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the shorter “presence,” Sheridan explained that the term refers to the effect felt when controlling real world objects remotely as well as the effect people feel when they interact with and immerse themselves in virtual reality or virtual environments.&lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;

[[File:Lombard conceptulization of presence.png|thumb|left|Lombard's conceptualization of presence]]

Lombard and Ditton went a step further and enumerated six conceptualizations of presence:&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;

# presence can be a sense of social richness, the feeling one gets from social interaction
# presence can be a sense of realism, such as computer-generated environments looking, feeling, or otherwise seeming real
# presence can be a sense of transportation. This is a more complex concept than the traditional feeling of one being there. Transportation also includes users feeling as though something is “here” with them or feeling as though they are sharing common space with another person together
# presence can be a sense of immersion, either through the senses or through the mind
# presence can provide users with the sense they are social actors within the medium. No longer passive viewers, users, via presence, gain a sense of interactivity and control
# presence can be a sense of the medium as a social actor.

Lombard's work discusses the extent to which 'presence' is felt, and how strong the perception of presence is regarded without the media involved.&lt;ref name=lombard/&gt;  The article reviews the contextual characteristics that contribute to an individual's feeling presence.  The most important variables that are important in the determinants of presence are those that involve sensory richness or vividness - and the number and consistency of sensory outputs.&lt;ref name=steuer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steuer|first=Jonathan|title=Defining virtual realities: Dimensions determining telepresence|journal=Communication in the Age of Virtual Reality|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers believe that the greater the number of human senses for which a medium provides stimulation, the greater the capability of the medium to produce a sense of presence.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;&lt;ref name=steuer /&gt;  Additional important aspects of a medium are visual display characteristics (image quality, image size, viewing distance, motion and color, dimensionality, camera techniques) as well as aural presentation characteristics, stimuli for other senses (interactivity, obtrusiveness of medium, live versus recorded or constructed experience, number of people), content variables (social realism, use of media conventions, nature of task or activity), and media user variables (willingness to suspend disbelief, knowledge of and prior experience with the medium).&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;  Lombard also discusses the effects of presence, including both physiological and psychological consequences of "the perceptual illusion of nonmediation." &lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;
Physiological effects of presence may include arousal, or vection and simulation sickness, while psychological effects may include enjoyment, involvement, task performance, skills training, desensitization, persuasion, memory and social judgement, or [[parasocial interaction]] and relationships.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;

[[File:Lee typology of virtual experience.png|thumb|right|Lee's typology of virtual experience]]

Presence has been delineated into subtypes, such as physical-, social-, and self-presence.&lt;ref name=lee /&gt; Lombard's working definition was "a psychological state in which virtual objects are experienced as actual objects in either sensory or nonsensory ways." &lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;  Later extensions expanded the definition of "virtual objects" to specify that they may be either para-authentic or artificial.  Further development of the concept of "psychological state" has led to study of the mental mechanism that permits humans to feel presence when using media or simulation technologies.&lt;ref name=lee /&gt;  One approach is to conceptualize presence as a cognitive feeling, that is, to take spatial presence as feedback from unconscious cognitive processes that inform conscious thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Thomas W.|title=A New Conception of Spatial Presence: Once Again, with Feeling|journal=Communication Theory|year=2009|volume=19|issue=2|pages=161–187|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2009.01340.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

Several studies provide insight into the concept of media influencing behavior.

*Cheryl Bracken and Lombard suggested that people, especially children, interact with computers socially.&lt;ref name=bracken&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bracken|first=C|author2=Lombard, M|title=Social presence and children: Praise, intrinsic motivation, and learning with computers|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2004|volume=54|pages=22–37|doi=10.1093/joc/54.1.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found, via their study, that children who received positive encouragement from a computer were more confident in their ability, were more motivated, recalled more of a story and recognized more features of a story than those children who received only neutral comments from their computer.
*Nan, Anghelcev, Myers, Sar, and Faber found that the inclusion of anthropomorphic agents that relied on artificial intelligence on a Web site had positive effect on people’s attitudes toward the site.&lt;ref name=nan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nan|first=X|author2=Anghelcev, G. |author3=Myers, J. R. |author4=Sar, S. |author5=Faber, R. J. |title=What if a website can talk? Exploring the persuasive effects of web-based anthropomorphic agents.|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2006|volume=83|issue=3|pages=615–631|doi=10.1177/107769900608300309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research of Bracken and Lombard and Nan et al. also speak to the concept of presence as transportation.&lt;ref name=lombard /&gt;&lt;ref name=bracken /&gt;&lt;ref name=nan /&gt; The transportation in this case refers to the computer-generated identity. Users, through their interaction, have a sense that these fabricated personalities are really “there”.
*Communication has been a central pillar of presence since the term’s conception.&lt;ref name=presence-research.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Presence-Research.org|url=http://www.presence-research.org/|work=Welcome|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many applications of the Internet today largely depend on virtual presence since its conception.&lt;ref name=ISPR&gt;{{cite web|title=International Society for Presence Research|url=http://www.ispr.info/|work=About ISPR|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheingold and Turkle offered MUDs, or multi-user dungeons, as early examples of how communication developed a sense of [[web presence|presence on the Web]] prior to the graphics-heavy existence it has developed today.&lt;ref name=rheingold /&gt;  “MUDs...[are] imaginary worlds in computer databases where people use words and programming languages to improvise melodramas, build worlds and all the objects in them, solve puzzles, invent amusements and tools, compete for prestige and power, gain wisdom, seek revenge, indulge greed and lust and violent impulses."&lt;ref name=rheingold&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheingold|first=H|title=The virtual community: Homesteading on the electronic frontier.|year=1993|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Rheingold focused on the environmental sense of presence that communication provided, Turkle focused on the individual sense of presence that communication provided.  “MUDs are a new kind of virtual parlor game and a new form of community. In addition, text-based MUDs are a new form of collaboratively written literature. MUD players are MUD authors, the creators as well as consumers of media content. In this, participating in a MUD has much in common with script writing, performance art, street theater, improvisational theater – or even commedia dell’arte." &lt;ref name=rheingold /&gt;&lt;ref name=turkle&gt;{{cite book|last=Turkle|first=S|title=Life on the screen: Identity in the age of the Internet.|year=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Further blurring the lines of behavioral spheres, Gabriel Weimann wrote that media scholars have found that virtual experiences are very similar to real-life experiences, and people can confuse their own memories and have trouble remembering if those experiences were mediated or not.&lt;ref name=weimann&gt;{{cite book|last=Weimann|first=G|title=Communicating unreality: Modern media and the reconstruction of reality.|year=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philipp, Vanman, and Storrs demonstrated that unconscious feelings of social presence in a virtual environment can be invoked with relatively impoverished social representations.&lt;ref name=philipp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philipp|first=MC|author2=Storrs, K|author3=Vanman, E|title=Sociality of facial expressions in immersive virtual environments: A facial EMG study|journal=Biological Psychology|year=2012|volume=91|pages=17–21|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The esearchers found that the mere presence of virtual humans in an immersive environment caused people to be more emotionally expressive than when they were alone in the environment. The research suggests that even relatively impoverished social representations can lead to people to behave more socially in an immersive environment.

==Presence in popular culture==
*Sheridan's view of presence earned its first pop culture reference in 1984 with [[William Gibson]]’s pre-[[World Wide Web]] science fiction novel "[[Neuromancer]]", which tells the story of a cyberpunk cowboy of sorts who accesses a virtual world to hack into organizations.&lt;ref name=sheridan1 /&gt;
*[[Joshua Meyrowitz]]'s 1986 "[[Joshua Meyrowitz#No Sense of Place|No Sense of Place]]" discusses the impact of electronic media on social behavior.&lt;ref name=meyrowitz&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyrowitz|first=Joshua|title=No sense of place : the impact of electronic media on social behavior|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-504231-3|edition=12. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel discusses how social situations are transformed by media.  Media, he claims, can change one's 'sense of place,'by mixing traditionally private versus public behaviors - or [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|back-stage and front-stage behaviors]], respectively, as coined by [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=goffman&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=The presentation of self in everyday life|year=1990|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=978-0140135718|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meyrowitz suggests that television alone will transform the practice of front-stage and back-stage behaviors, as television would provide increased information to different groups who may physically not have access to specific communities but through [[media consumption]] are able to determine a mental place within the program.  He references [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s concept that '[[the medium is the message]],' and that media provide individuals with access to information.&lt;ref name=mcluhan&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man|year=1964|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With new and changing media, Meyrowitz says that the patterns of information and shifting accesses to information change social settings, and help do determine a sense of place and behavior.  With the logic that behavior is connected to information flow, Meyrowitz states that front- and back-stage behaviors are blurred and may be impossible to untangle.

In the field of [[Big Bang]] theory, and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], '''reionization''' is the process that caused the matter in the [[universe]] to reionize after the lapse of the "[[Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|dark ages]]".

Reionization is the second of two major [[phase transition]]s of [[gas]] in the [[universe]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} While the majority of [[baryon#Baryonic matter|baryonic matter]] in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, reionization usually refers strictly to the reionization of [[hydrogen]], the element.

It's believed that the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|primordial]] [[helium]] also experienced the same phase of reionization changes, but at different points in the history of the universe. This is usually referred to as '''helium reionization'''.

== Background ==
[[Image:reion diagram.jpg|thumb|275px|Schematic timeline of the universe, depicting reionization's place in cosmic history.]]
{{Nature timeline}}
The first phase change of hydrogen in the universe was [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], which occurred at a [[redshift]] ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1089 (379,000 years after the Big Bang), due to the cooling of the universe to the point where the rate of recombination of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s to form neutral hydrogen was higher than the re[[ionize|ionization]] rate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The universe was opaque before the recombination, due to the [[Thomson scattering|scatter]]ing of photons (of all wavelengths) off free electrons (and, to a significantly lesser extent, free protons), but it became increasingly transparent as more electrons and protons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. While the electrons of neutral hydrogen can absorb photons of some wavelengths by rising to an [[Lyman series|excited state]], a universe full of neutral hydrogen will be relatively opaque only at those absorbed wavelengths, but transparent throughout most of the spectrum. The Dark Ages of the universe start at that point, because there were no light sources other than the gradually redshifting cosmic background radiation.

The second phase change occurred once objects started to condense in the early [[universe]] that were energetic enough to re-ionize neutral hydrogen. As these objects formed and [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiated]] energy, the universe reverted from being neutral,  to once again being an ionized [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This occurred between 150 million and one billion years after the Big Bang (at a redshift 6&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;20).{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} At that time, however, matter had been diffused by the expansion of the universe, and the scattering interactions of photons and electrons were much less frequent than before electron-proton recombination. Thus, the universe was full of low density ionized hydrogen and remained transparent, as is the case today.

== Detection methods ==
Looking back so far in the history of the universe presents some observational challenges. There are, however, a few observational methods for studying reionization.

===Quasars and the Gunn-Peterson trough===
One means of studying reionization uses the [[spectrum|spectra]] of distant [[quasar]]s. Quasars release an extraordinary amount of energy, meaning they are among the brightest objects in the universe. As a result, some quasars are detectable from as far back as the epoch of reionization. Quasars also happen to have relatively uniform spectral features, regardless of their position in the sky or distance from the [[Earth]]. Thus it can be inferred that any major differences between quasar spectra will be caused by the interaction of their emission with [[atom]]s along the line of sight. For [[wavelength]]s of light at the energies of one of the [[Lyman series|Lyman transitions]] of hydrogen, the [[scattering cross-section]] is large, meaning that even for low levels of neutral hydrogen in the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM), [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] at those wavelengths is highly likely.

For nearby objects in the universe, spectral absorption lines are very sharp, as only photons with energies just sufficient to cause an atomic transition can cause that transition. However, the distances between quasars and the telescopes which detect them are large, which means that the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] causes light to undergo noticeable redshifting. This means that as light from the quasar travels through the IGM and is redshifted, wavelengths which had been below the Lyman Alpha limit are stretched, and will in effect begin to fill in the Lyman absorption band. This means that instead of showing sharp spectral absorption lines, a quasar's light which has traveled through a large, spread out region of neutral hydrogen will show a [[Gunn-Peterson trough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.E. Gunn | author2=B.A. Peterson | last-author-amp=yes | date=1965 | title=On the Density of Neutral Hydrogen in Intergalactic Space | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=142 | pages=1633–1641 | bibcode=1965ApJ...142.1633G | doi=10.1086/148444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redshifting for a particular quasar provides temporal (time) information about reionization. Since an object's redshift corresponds to the time at which it emitted the light, it is possible to determine when reionization ended. Quasars below a certain redshift (closer in space and time) do not show the Gunn-Peterson trough (though they may show the [[Lyman-alpha forest]]), while quasars emitting light prior to reionization will feature a Gunn-Peterson trough. In 2001, four quasars were detected (by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]) with redshifts ranging from ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5.82 to ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6.28. While the quasars above ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 showed a Gunn-Peterson trough, indicating that the IGM was still at least partly neutral, the ones below did not, meaning the hydrogen was ionized. As reionization is expected to occur over relatively short timescales, the results suggest that the universe was approaching the end of reionization at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=R.H. Becker | display-authors=etal | date=2001 | title=Evidence For Reionization at z ~ 6: Detection of a Gunn-Peterson Trough In A z=6.28 Quasar | journal=Astronomical Journal | volume=122 | issue=6 | pages=2850–2857 | arxiv=astro-ph/0108097 | doi=10.1086/324231 | bibcode=2001AJ....122.2850B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, suggests that the universe must still have been almost entirely neutral at ''z''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;10.

===CMB anisotropy and polarization===

The anisotropy of the [[cosmic microwave background]] on different angular scales can also be used to study reionization. Photons undergo scattering when there are free electrons present, in a process known as [[Thomson scattering]]. However, as the universe expands, the density of free electrons will decrease, and scattering will occur less frequently. In the period during and after reionization, but before significant expansion had occurred to sufficiently lower the electron density, the light that composes the CMB will experience observable Thomson scattering. This scattering will leave its mark on the CMB [[anisotropy]] map, introducing secondary anisotropies (anisotropies introduced after recombination).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Manoj Kaplinghat | display-authors=etal | date=2003 | title=Probing the Reionization History of the universe using the Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=583 | issue=1 | pages=24–32 | bibcode=2003ApJ...583...24K | doi=10.1086/344927|arxiv = astro-ph/0207591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall effect is to erase anisotropies that occur on smaller scales. While anisotropies on small scales are erased, [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] anisotropies are actually introduced because of reionization.&lt;ref name=Dore_Patchy&gt;{{cite journal| author=O. Dore| display-authors=etal| title=Signature of patchy reionization in the polarization anisotropy of the CMB| year=2007| journal=Physical Review D| volume=76| issue=4| pages=043002| doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.76.043002| bibcode=2007PhRvD..76d3002D| arxiv=astro-ph/0701784v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By looking at the CMB anisotropies observed, and comparing with what they would look like had reionization not taken place, the electron column density at the time of reionization can be determined. With this, the age of the universe when reionization occurred can then be calculated.

The [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] allowed that comparison to be made. The initial observations, released in 2003, suggested that reionization took place from 11&amp;nbsp;&lt;''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=A. Kogut | display-authors=etal | year=2003 | title=First Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Temperature-Polarization Correlation | journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=148 | issue=1 | pages=161–173 | bibcode=2003ApJS..148..161K | doi=10.1086/377219|arxiv = astro-ph/0302213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This redshift range was in clear disagreement with the results from studying quasar spectra. However, the three year WMAP data returned a different result, with reionization beginning at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;11 and the universe ionized by ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D.N. Spergel | display-authors=etal | year=2007 | title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Implications for Cosmology | journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=170 | issue=2 | pages=377–408 | bibcode=2007ApJS..170..377S | doi=10.1086/513700|arxiv = astro-ph/0603449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in much better agreement with the quasar data.

Results in 2018 from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] mission, yield an instantaneous reionization redshift of z = 7.68 ± 0.79.&lt;ref name=Planck_Results_2018&gt;{{cite arxiv| author=Planck Collaboration| title=Planck 2018 results. VI. Cosmological parameters| date=2018|eprint=1807.06209| class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parameter usually quoted here is τ, the "optical depth to recombination," or alternatively, z&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;, the redshift of reionization, assuming it was an instantaneous event.  While this is unlikely to be physical, since reionization was very likely not instantaneous, z&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; provides an estimate of the mean redshift of reionization.

===21-cm line===
Even with the quasar data roughly in agreement with the CMB anisotropy data, there are still a number of questions, especially concerning the energy sources of reionization and the effects on, and role of, [[structure formation]] during reionization. The [[hydrogen line|21-cm line]] in hydrogen is potentially a means of studying this period, as well as the "dark ages" that preceded reionization. The 21-cm line occurs in neutral hydrogen, due to differences in energy between the spin triplet and spin singlet states of the electron and proton. This transition is [[forbidden line|forbidden]], meaning it occurs extremely rarely. The transition is also highly [[temperature]] dependent, meaning that as objects form in the "dark ages" and emit Lyman-alpha [[photon]]s that are absorbed and re-emitted by surrounding neutral hydrogen, it will produce a 21-cm line signal in that hydrogen through [[Wouthuysen-Field coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rennan Barkana | author2=Abraham Loeb | last-author-amp=yes | year=2005 | title=Detecting the Earliest Galaxies through Two New Sources of 21 Centimeter Fluctuations | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=626 | issue=1 | pages=1–11 | bibcode=2005ApJ...626....1B | doi=10.1086/429954|arxiv = astro-ph/0410129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alvarez_enhanced&gt;{{cite journal| author=M.A. Alvarez| author2=Ue-Li Pen| author3=Tzu-Ching Chang| title=Enhanced Detectability of Pre-reionization 21 cm Structure| date=2010| journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters| volume=723| issue=1| doi=10.1088/2041-8205/723/1/L17| bibcode=2010ApJ...723L..17A| arxiv=1007.0001v1| pages=L17–L21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying 21-cm line emission, it will be possible to learn more about the early structures that formed. Observations from the [[Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature]] (EDGES) points to a signal from this era, follow-up observations will be needed to confirm it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02616-8|title=Astronomers detect light from the Universe’s first stars|date= 28 February 2018|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other projects hope to make headway in this area in the near future, such as the [[Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization]] (PAPER), [[LOFAR|Low Frequency Array]] (LOFAR), [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA), [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT), the [[Dark Ages Radio Explorer]] (DARE) mission, and the [[Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages|Large-Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages]] (LEDA).

==Energy sources==
While observations have come in which narrow the window during which the epoch of reionization could have taken place, it is still uncertain which objects provided the photons that reionized the IGM. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter. This is in the [[ultraviolet]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], which means that the primary candidates are all sources which produce a significant amount of energy in the ultraviolet and above. How numerous the source is must also be considered, as well as the longevity, as protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart. Altogether, the critical parameter for any source considered can be summarized as its "emission rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons per unit cosmological volume."&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

=== Dwarf galaxies ===
[[Dwarf galaxies]] are currently the primary source of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization.&lt;ref name=Bouwens_LLG&gt;{{cite journal| author=R.J.Bouwens| display-authors=etal| title=Lower-luminosity Galaxies Could Reionize the Universe: Very Steep Faint-end Slopes to the UV Luminosity Functions at z &gt;= 5-8 from the HUDF09 WFC3/IR Observations| date=2012| journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|  volume=752| issue=1| doi=10.1088/2041-8205/752/1/L5| bibcode=2012ApJ...752L...5B| arxiv=1105.2038v4| pages=L5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most scenarios, this would require the log-slope of the UV galaxy [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]], often denoted α, to be steeper than it is today, approaching α = -2.&lt;ref name=Bouwens_LLG/&gt;

A new study shows that dwarf galaxies contributed nearly 30% of the ultraviolet light during the process of reionization. The dwarfs had such a big impact because a larger fraction of ionizing photons are able to escape dwarf galaxies (clocking in at 50%) as opposed to larger galaxies (clocking in at a mere 5%).&lt;ref name=Sky&amp;Tel&gt;{{cite web| author=Shannon Hall| title=Dwarf Galaxies Packed a Mighty Punch| url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/dwarf-galaxies-packed-mighty-punch-072320142|

Wise from an interview with [[Sky and Telescope]]: "The smallest galaxies first dominate at early times; however, they basically kill themselves off by blowing out their gas through their own supernovae and heating their environment. Afterwards, larger galaxies (but still much smaller than the Milky Way by about 100 times in mass) take over the job of reionizing the universe."&lt;ref name=Sky&amp;Tel/&gt;

===Quasars===
[[Quasars]], a class of [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN), were considered a good candidate source because they are highly efficient at converting [[mass]] to [[energy]], and emit a great deal of light above the threshold for ionizing hydrogen. It is unknown, however, how many quasars existed prior to reionization. Only the brightest of quasars present during reionization can be detected, which means there is no direct information about dimmer quasars that existed. However, by looking at the more easily observed quasars in the nearby universe, and assuming that the [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]] (number of quasars as a function of [[luminosity]]) during reionization will be approximately the same as it is today, it is possible to make estimates of the quasar populations at earlier times. Such studies have found that quasars do not exist in high enough numbers to reionize the IGM alone,&lt;ref name="qso_source1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qso_source0"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Paul Shapiro | author2=Mark Giroux | last-author-amp=yes | date=1987 | title=Cosmological H II regions and the photoionization of the intergalactic medium| journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=321 | pages=107–112 | bibcode=1987ApJ...321L.107S | doi=10.1086/185015}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "only if the ionizing background is dominated by low-luminosity AGNs can the quasar luminosity function provide enough ionizing photons."&lt;ref name="qso_source2"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Xiaohu Fan | display-authors=etal | date=2001 | title=A Survey of z&gt;5.8 Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

===Population III stars===

Yet quasar spectra have revealed the presence of heavy elements in the [[intergalactic medium]] at an early era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28927">The relationship between the level of '''religiosity''' and the level of '''education''' has been studied since the second half of the 20th century.

The parameters of the two components diverse: the "level of [[religiosity]]" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate [[Scientifically based research|scientifically]], while the "[[International Standard Classification of Education|level of education]]" is easier to compile, such as [[Educational measurement|official data]] on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries.

Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether "religiosity" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt; Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Souls" /&gt;

In terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities, were religious.&lt;ref name=gross2009 /&gt;

==Studies==

===Global studies===

A [[Pew Center]] study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that [[Jews]] are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling;&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jews]] also have the highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita (61%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Based on the study data, [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Christians]] ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Christians]] were found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the study, Christians in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Buddhists]] have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their [[Christian]] counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the [[Christian school|educational facilities]] that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

According to a 2015 global survey by [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]], the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

In one analysis of [[World Values Survey]] data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; They concluded that "these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, "education raises religious attendance at individual level," while "at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere." The authors suggest that "this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief," causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/w8080.pdf |title= Education and Religion |last1= Sacerdote |first1= Bruce |last2= Glaeser|first2= Edward L.|work= |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research|page=29|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical analysis of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prizes]] awarded between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of [[List of Christian Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates were Christians]], over 20% were Jewish, and 10.5% were atheists, agnostics, or freethinkers.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;Baruch A.

==By country==
===Britain===

Research in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David Voas and Siobhan McAndrew|editor1-last=Arweck|editor1-first=Elisabeth|editor2-last=Bullivant|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Lois|title=Secularity and Non-religion|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415710442|chapter=Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===India===

A survey conducted by the ''Times of India'' revealed that 22% of [[IIT Bombay]] graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.&lt;ref name=toi2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Less than half of passing IIT batch believes in God’s existence|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Less-than-half-of-passing-IIT-batch-believes-in-Gods-existence/articleshow/46938504.cms|publisher= Times Of India|accessdate=29 September 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population.&lt;ref name=Census.ie&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile 7 – Religion, Ethnicity and Irish Travellers|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile7/Profile%207%20Education%20Ethnicity%20and%20Irish%20Traveller%20entire%20doc.pdf|publisher=Census Statistics Office|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

In 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic.&lt;ref name= "congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scofield|first=James|title=Spain: Religion|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0062)|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

According to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%.&lt;ref name="CNN GSS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Jim|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwadel said, “With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God...But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’”&lt;ref name="CNN GSS" /&gt;

Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. "The irony" he states "is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education."

He found that [[Hindus]], [[Jews]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|title=US Religious Landscape Survey: Diverse and Dynamic|format=PDF|publisher=The Pew Forum|page=85|publication-date=February 2008|accessdate=2012-09-17|ref=refEducationLevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/|title=Faith, Education and Income|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2011|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]], [[Buddhists]], and [[Orthodox Christians]]&lt;ref name="Faith, Education and Income"&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/?_r=1 Faith, Education and Income]&lt;/ref&gt; have the highest levels of education. [[Catholics]], [[Mormons]], and [[Muslims]] are at about the national average.. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Bradley R.E.|title=Christians are hate-filled hypocrites-- and other lies you've been told : a sociologist shatters myths from the secular and christian media|year=2010|publisher=Bethany House|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=9780764207464|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college.&lt;ref name="Smith Souls"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=Souls in Transition: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of Emerging adults|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195371796|pages=248–251|author2=Patricia Snell |quote=However, something very interesting emerged when scholars took a second look at the question more recently. They found that the religiously undermining effect of higher education on recent generation of youth disappeared. Most of the older research was conducted on baby boomers for whom college did indeed corrode religious faith and practice. But many studies more recently have shown that conventional wisdom about baby boomers does not apply to today's youth. Higher education no longer seem to diminish religion in emerging adults." "In every case, emerging adults are slightly more religious than those who are not in college, although only the differences in overall religiousness and service attendance are statistically significant. In short, if anything, it is ''not'' attending college that is associated with lower levels of religious practice, though those differences are slight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winseman|first1=Albert L.|title=Does More Educated Really = Less Religious?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/7729/does-more-educated-really-less-religious.aspx|website=Gallup Poll|date=February 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher "public religiosity" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less "belief." Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.&lt;ref name="Post ARIS 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kosmin|first=Barry|title=Religion and the Intelligentsia: Post-graduate Educated Americans 1990-2008|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/religion-and-the-intelligentsia-post-graduate-educated-americans-1990-2008/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).&lt;ref name="Kosmin keysar College"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kosmin|first1=Barry|last2=Keysar|first2=Ariela|title=Religious, Spiritual and Secular: The emergence of three distinct worldviews among American college students|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/isssc/Documents/ARIS_2013_College%20Students_Sept_25_final_draft.pdf|publisher=Trinity College|pages=8–9|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At "elite" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, "religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities."&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

However, both groups were still a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Neil|title=How Religious are America’s College and University Professors?|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Gross_Simmons.pdf|publisher=SSRC|author2=Solon Simmons |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Phil | last1=Zuckerman | year=2009 | title=Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions | url=http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | journal=Sociology Compass | volume=3 | issue=6 | pages=949–971 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00247.x | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228104545/http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | archivedate=2014-12-28 | df= }}

[[Frank Sulloway]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Michael Shermer]] of the [[California State University]] conducted a study that found in their polling sample of "credentialed" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a [[correlation]] indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than [[mainline Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226764192|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt;

Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education "positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of "exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs, and Affiliations|last=Schwadel|first=Philip|year=2011|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=53|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|author=Jim Kavanagh|date=11 August 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|quote=With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God,’” he said. “But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=267–268|quote= The effects of income become insignificant, however, the impact of education actually reverses in the United States: ''it is the more educated who attend church most frequently.''

According to a [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American [[Hindus]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree, followed by [[Unitarian Universalists]] (67%), [[Jews]] (59%), [[Anglican]] (59%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (56%) and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (47%) and [[United Church of Christ]] (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cording to the same study about (43%) of American [[atheists]], and (42%) [[agnostics]], and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree.

==In specific religious denominations==

===Mormons===
Studies of [[Mormons]] in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending [[Church service|church]] regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity" Latter-Day Saint Social Life, Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members (Provo, Utah: BYU [[Religious Studies Center]], 1998), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical groups===
Edward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge —  factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton|first=Edward|title=Why does Jesus go to Oxford University? Conversion Experience, Creativity and Intelligence|url=http://www.jirrs.org/jirrs_nr_6/3-jirrs6-dutton.pdf|publisher=Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that "Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics." He used [[SAT]] scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.&lt;ref&gt;

===Christian fundamentalists===
Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and [[Christian fundamentalism]] was found by Burton et al. (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Burton; Stephen Johnson; Joseph Tamney, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3511296 Education and Fundamentalism], ''Review of Religious Research'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, [[Protestant]] residents of [[Delaware County, Indiana]].

{{Refimprove|date=July 2012}}
In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], '''reusability''' is the use of existing ''assets'' in some form within the [[Software development process|software product development process]]; these ''assets'' are products and by-products of the software development life cycle and include code, software components, test suites, designs and documentation. The opposite concept of ''reusability'' is '''leverage''', which modifies existing assets as needed to meet specific system requirements. Because reuse implies the creation of a {{clarify inline|text=separately maintained version of the assets|date=July 2015}}, it is preferred over leverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lombard Hill Group|title=What is Software Reuse|url=http://lombardhill.com/What_Reuse.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022010101/http://lombardhill.com/What_Reuse.htm|website=http://www.lombardhill.com|publisher=Lombard Hill Group|accessdate=22 October 2014|archivedate=2014-10-22|dead-url=yes|date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subroutine]]s or [[Function (programming)|function]]s are the simplest form of reuse. A chunk of code is regularly organized using [[Modular programming|modules]] or [[namespace]]s into [[Layer element|layer]]s. Proponents claim that [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[software component]]s offer a more advanced form of reusability, although it has been tough to objectively measure and define levels or scores of reusability.

The ability to reuse relies in an essential way on the ability to build larger things from smaller parts, and being able to identify [[commonality|commonalities]] among those parts. Reusability is often a required characteristic of [[platform (computing)|platform]] software. Reusability brings several aspects to [[software development]] that do not need to be considered when reusability is not required.

Reusability implies some explicit management of [[software build|build]], [[packaging]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]], [[installation (computer programs)|installation]], [[computer configuration|configuration]], [[Software deployment|deployment]], [[Software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[upgrade]] issues. If these issues are not considered, software may appear to be reusable from [[software design|design]] point of view, but will not be reused in practice.

Software reusability more specifically refers to design features of a software element (or collection of software elements) that enhance its suitability for reuse.

Many reuse design principles were developed at the WISR workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~ftp/wisr/SEN-pap/node1.html |title=Design for Reuse and Object Oriented Reuse Methods |publisher=Umcs.maine.edu |date=1995-01-20 |accessdate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970715093310/http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~ftp/wisr/SEN-pap/node1.html |archivedate=1997-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate design features for software reuse include:
* [[Adaptability|Adaptable]]
* Brief: small size
* [[Consistency]]
* [[Correctness (computer science)|Correctness]]
* [[Extensibility]]
* [[Speed|Fast]]
* Flexible
* [[Generic programming|Generic]]
* Localization of volatile ([[Changeable design|changeable]]) design assumptions ([[David Parnas]])
* [[Modularity (programming)|Modularity]]
* [[Orthogonality]]
* [[Parameterization]]
* Simple: low [[Complexity (disambiguation)|complexity]]
* [[Stability Model|Stability]] under changing [[requirements]]

Consensus has not yet been reached on this list on the relative importance of the entries nor on the issues which make each one important for a particular class of applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6270">'''SIGCSE''' is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s [[Special Interest Group]] on Computer Science Education, which provides a forum for educators to discuss issues related to the development, implementation, and/or evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy.  It is also the name of one of the three annual events organized by SIGCSE. This event, the ACM [[SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education]], is held annually in February or March in the USA. SIGCSE also sponsors an annual conference in or around Europe, named ITiCSE (Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education), usually in late June, and an annual research workshop named ICER (International Computing Education Research), at varied locations, usually in August.

The main focus of SIGCSE is higher education, and discussions include improving computer science education at high school level and below. The membership level has held steady at around 3300 members for several years. The current chair of SIGCSE is
[[Amber Settle]] for July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019.

==Conferences==

SIGCSE has three annual conferences.

* The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education conference is held in the United States with an average annual attendance of approximately 1300. The next conference will be held February 27 through March 2, 2019 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sigcse2019.sigcse.org/|title=SIGCSE 2019|website=sigcse2019.sigcse.org|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The annual conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). The next one will be held Monday 2 July through Wednesday 4 July 2018 in [[Larnaca, Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iticse.acm.org/|title=ITiCSE 2018|website=iticse.acm.org|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference is attended by about 200-300 and is mainly held in Europe, but has also been held in countries outside of Europe ([[Turkey]] - 2010), ([[Israel]] - 2012), and ([[Peru]] - 2016).
* The International Computing Education Research (ICER) Conference. This conference has about 70 attendees and is held in the United States every other year. On the alternate years it rotates between [[Europe]] and [[Australasia]].  The next conference will be held August 13 through August 15, 2018 in [[Espoo, Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icer.acm.org/|title=ICER Conference {{!}} International Computing Education Research|website=icer.acm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newsletter/Bulletin==
The SIGCSE Bulletin is a quarterly newsletter that was first published in 1969. It evolved from an informal gathering of news and ideas to a venue for columns, editor-reviewed articles, research announcements, editorials, symposium proceedings, etc.

In 2010, with the inception of ACM Inroads magazine, the Bulletin was transformed into an electronic newsletter sent to all SIGCSE members providing communications about SIGCSE: announcing activities, publicizing events, and highlighting topics of interest. In other words, it has returned to its roots.

[[File:Seashells living in Persian Gulf.ogv|thumb|Seashells living in the [[Persian Gulf]]]]

A '''seashell''' or '''sea shell''', also known simply as a '''shell''', is a hard, protective outer layer created by an animal that lives in the sea. The shell is part of the body of the animal. Empty seashells are often found washed up on [[beach]]es by [[beachcombing|beachcombers]]. The shells are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have been eaten by another animal or have [[decomposition|decomposed]].

A seashell is usually the [[exoskeleton]] of an [[invertebrate]] (an animal without a backbone), and is typically composed of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[chitin]]. Most shells that are found on beaches are the shells of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[mollusk]]s, partly because these shells are usually made of calcium carbonate, and endure better than shells made of chitin.

Apart from [[mollusk shell]]s, other shells that can be found on beaches are those of [[barnacle]]s, [[horseshoe crab]]s and [[brachiopod]]s. Marine [[annelid]] worms in the family [[Serpulidae]] create shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces. The shells of [[sea urchin]]s are called "[[test (zoology)|test]]s", and the moulted shells of [[crab]]s and [[lobster]]s are [[exuviae]]. While most seashells are external, some [[cephalopods]] have internal shells.

Seashells have been used by humans for many different purposes throughout history and pre-history. However, seashells are not the only kind of shells; in various habitats, there are shells from freshwater animals such as [[freshwater mussel]]s and [[freshwater snail]]s, and shells of [[land snail]]s.

== Terminology ==
When the word "seashells" refers only to the shells of marine mollusks, then studying seashells is part of [[conchology]]. Conchologists or serious collectors who have a scientific bias are in general careful not to disturb living populations and habitats: even though they may collect a few live animals, most responsible collectors do not often over-collect or otherwise disturb ecosystems.

The study of the entire molluscan animal (as well as the shell) is known as [[malacology]]; a person who studies mollusks is known as a [[malacologist]].
[[File:Shells on sand.jpg|thumb|Seashells on the beach]]

== Occurrence ==
Seashells are commonly found in beach drift, which is natural detritus deposited along strandlines on [[beach]]es by the [[wave]]s and the [[tide]]s. Shells are very often washed up onto a beach empty and clean, the animal having already died.

Empty seashells are often picked up by beachcombers. However, the majority of seashells which are offered for sale commercially have been collected alive (often in bulk) and then killed and cleaned, specifically for the commercial trade.{{citation needed|reason=The claim that seashell providers slaughter large populations of animals is a serious accusation. Support is needed.|date=February 2013}} This type of large-scale exploitation can sometimes have a strong negative impact on local [[ecosystem]]s, and sometimes can significantly reduce the distribution of [[rare species]].

== Molluscan seashells ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}

[[File:Seashells North Wales 1985.jpg|thumb|Seashells hand-picked from beach drift in [[North Wales]] at [[Shell Island (Wales)|Shell Island]] near [[Harlech Castle]], [[Wales]], [[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s, March/April 1985]]
{{main|Mollusc shell}}

The word ''seashell'' is often used to mean only the shell of a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[mollusk]]. Marine mollusk shells that are familiar to beachcombers and thus most likely to be called "seashells" are the shells of marine species of [[bivalves]] (or [[clam]]s), [[gastropod]]s (or [[snail]]s), [[scaphopod]]s (or [[tusk shell]]s), [[polyplacophora]]ns (or [[chiton]]s), and [[cephalopod]]s (such as [[nautilus]] and [[spirula]]). These shells are very often the most commonly encountered, both in the wild, and for sale as decorative objects.

Marine species of gastropods and bivalves are more numerous than land and freshwater species, and the shells are often larger and more robust. The shells of marine species also often have more [[sculpture (mollusc)|sculpture]] and more color, although this is  by no means always the case.

In the [[tropical]] and sub-tropical areas of the planet, there are far more species of colorful, large, shallow water shelled marine mollusks than there are in the temperate zones and the regions closer to the poles.

Although there are a number of species of shelled mollusks that are quite large, there are vast numbers of extremely small species too, see [[micromollusk]]s.

Not all mollusks are marine. There are numerous land and freshwater mollusks, see for example [[snail]] and [[freshwater bivalves]]. In addition, not all mollusks have an external shell: some mollusks such as some cephalopods (squid and octopuses) have an internal shell, and many mollusks have no shell, see for example [[slug]] and [[nudibranch]].

=== Bivalves ===
[[File:CoquillagesFadiouth.jpg|thumb|Single valves of the [[bivalve]] ''[[Senilia senilis]]'', plus two [[gastropod]]s, washed up on the beach at [[Fadiouth]], [[Senegal]]]]
Bivalves are often the most common seashells that wash up on large sandy beaches or in sheltered [[lagoon]]s. They can sometimes be extremely numerous. Very often the two [[valve (mollusc)|valves]] become separated.

There are more than 15,000 species of bivalves that live in both marine and freshwater.  Examples of bivalves are clams, scallops, mussels, and oysters. The majority of bivalves consist of two identical shells that are held together by a flexible hinge.  The animal's body is held protectively inside these two shells. Bivalves that do not have two shells either have one shell or they lack a shell altogether. The shells are made of calcium carbonate and are formed in layers by secretions from the mantle. Bivalves, also known as pelecypods, are mostly filter feeders; through their gills, they draw in water, in which is trapped tiny food particles.  Some bivalves have eyes and an open circulatory system.  Bivalves are used all over the world as food and as a source of pearls. The larvae of some freshwater mussels can be dangerous to fish and can bore through wood.

[[Shell Beach, Western Australia]], is a beach which is entirely made up of the shells of the [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] ''[[Fragum erugatum]]''.

=== Gastropods ===
[[File:Sea shells, playa grande, costa rica.jpg|thumb|Numerous ''[[Turritella]]'' gastropod shells washed up on a beach at [[Playa Grande, Costa Rica]]]]
Certain species of gastropod seashells (the shells of [[sea snail]]s) can sometimes be common, washed up on sandy beaches, and also on beaches that are surrounded by rocky marine habitat.

=== Polyplacophorans ===
[[File:Chiton tuberculatus plates.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Loose valves or plates from ''[[Chiton tuberculatus]]'' from the beachdrift on the southeast coast of [[Nevis]], [[West Indies]]]]
[[Chiton]] plates or valves often wash up on beaches in rocky areas where chitons are common. Chiton shells, which are composed of eight separate plates and a girdle, usually come apart not long after death, so they are almost always found as disarticulated plates. Plates from larger species of chitons are sometimes known as "butterfly shells" because of their shape.

=== Cephalopods ===
[[File:Cuttlebone.jpg|thumb|130px|Cuttlebone from a ''[[Sepia (genus)|Sepia]]'' sp.]]
[[File:Nautilus species shells.png|thumb|130px|Shells of 3 species of ''[[Nautilus]]'']]

Only a few species of [[cephalopod]]s have shells (either internal or external) that are sometimes found washed up on beaches.

Some cephalopods such as ''[[Sepia (genus)|Sepia]]'', the cuttlefish, have a large internal shell, the [[cuttlefish bone]], and this often washes up on beaches in parts of the world where cuttlefish are common.

''[[Spirula spirula]]'' is a deep water squid-like cephalopod. It has an internal shell which is small (about 1 in or 24&amp;nbsp;mm) but very light and buoyant. This chambered shell floats very well and therefore washes up easily and is familiar to beachcombers in the tropics.

''[[Nautilus]]'' is the only genus of cephalopod that has a well-developed external shell. Females of the cephalopod genus ''[[Argonaut (animal)|Argonauta]]'' create a papery egg case which sometimes washes up on tropical beaches and is referred to as a "paper nautilus".

The largest group of shelled cephalopods, the [[ammonite]]s, are extinct, but their shells are very common in certain areas as [[fossil]]s.

=== Molluscan seashells used by other animals ===
Empty molluscan seashells are a sturdy, and usually readily available, "free" resource which is often easily found on beaches, in the [[intertidal zone]], and in the shallow subtidal zone.  As such they are sometimes used [[second-hand]] by animals other than humans for various purposes, including for protection (as in [[hermit crab]]s) and for construction.

==== Mollusks ====
* Carrier shells in the family [[Xenophoridae]] are marine shelled gastropods, fairly large sea snails. Most species of xenophorids cement a series of objects to the rim of their shells as they grow. These objects are sometimes small pebbles or other hard detritus. Very often shells of bivalves or smaller gastropods are used, depending on what is available on the particular [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] where the snail itself lives. It is not clear whether these shell attachments serve as [[camouflage]], or whether they are intended to help prevent the shell sinking into a soft substrate.

[[File:Ocellated octopus.jpg|thumb|left|An ocellated (spotted) octopus using a clamshell as a shelter]]
* Small [[octopus]]es sometimes use an empty shell as a sort of cave to hide in, or hold seashells around themselves as a form of protection like a temporary fortress.

==== Invertebrates ====
[[File:Diogenes pugilator.jpg|thumb|Marine [[hermit crab]] ''[[Diogenes pugilator]]'', using a shell of the dog whelk ''[[Nassarius reticulatus]]'']]
* Almost all genera of [[hermit crab]]s use or "wear" empty marine gastropod shells throughout their lifespan, in order to protect their soft abdomens, and in order to have a strong shell to withdraw into if attacked by a predator. Each individual hermit crab is forced to find another gastropod shell on a regular basis, whenever it grows too large for the one it is currently using.

:Some hermit crab species live on land and may be found quite some distance from the sea, including those in the tropical genus ''[[Coenobita]]''.

=== Conchology ===
{{main|Conchology}}

There are numerous popular books and [[field guide]]s on the subject of shell-collecting. Although there are a number of books about land and freshwater mollusks, the majority of popular books emphasize, or focus exclusively on, the shells of marine mollusks. Both the science of studying mollusk shells and the hobby of collecting and classifying them are known as [[conchology]]. The line between professionals and amateur enthusiasts is often not well defined in this subject, because many amateurs have contributed to, and continue to contribute to, conchology and the larger science of [[malacology]]. Many shell collectors belong to "shell clubs" where they can meet others who share their interests. A large number of amateurs collect the shells of marine mollusks, and this is partly because many shells wash up empty on beaches, or live in the [[intertidal]] or sub-tidal zones, and are therefore easily found and preserved without much in the way of specialized equipment or expensive supplies. Some shell collectors find their own material and keep careful records, or buy only "specimen shells", which means shells which have full collecting [[data]]: information including how, when, where, in what habitat, and by whom, the shells were collected. On the other hand, some collectors buy the more widely available commercially imported exotic shells, the majority of which have very little data, or none at all. To [[museum]] scientists, having full collecting data (when, where, and by whom it was collected) with a specimen is far more important than having the shell correctly identified. Some owners of shell collections hope to be able to donate their collection to a major natural history or zoology museum at some point, however, shells with little or no collecting data are usually of no value to science, and are likely not to be accepted by a major museum. Apart from any damage to the shell that may have happened ''before'' it was collected, shells can also suffer damage when they are stored or displayed. For an example of one rather serious kind of damage see [[Byne's disease]].

==== Shell clubs ====
There are a number of clubs or societies which consist of people who are united by a shared interest in shells. In the US, these clubs are more common in southerly coastal areas, such as [[Florida]] and [[California]], where the marine fauna is rich in species.

==== Identification ====
Seashells are usually identified by consulting general or regional shell-collecting [[field guide]]s, and specific scientific books on different taxa of shell-bearing mollusks ([[monograph]]s) or "iconographies" (limited text - mainly photographs or other illustrations). (For a few titles on this subject in the US, see the list of books at the foot of this article.) Identifications to the species level are generally achieved by examining illustrations and written descriptions, rather than by the use of [[Identification key]]s, as is often the case in identifying plants and other phyla of invertebrates. The construction of functional keys for the identification of the shells of marine mollusks to the species level can be very difficult, because of the great variability within many species and families. The identification of certain individual species is often very difficult, even for a specialist in that particular family. Some species cannot be differentiated on the basis of shell character alone.

Numerous smaller and more obscure mollusk species (see [[micromollusk]]) are yet to be discovered and named. In other words, they have not yet been differentiated from similar species and assigned scientific (binomial) names in articles in journals recognized by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN). Large numbers of new species are published in the scientific literature each year. There are currently an estimated 100,000 species of mollusks worldwide.

==== Non-marine "seashells" ====
[[File:Shells01.jpg|thumb|A group of purchased (mostly marine) shells includes the shell of a large tropical land snail (upper right), and a shiny freshwater apple snail shell (center)]]

The term ''seashell'' is also applied loosely to mollusk shells that are not of marine origin, for example by people walking the shores of lakes and rivers using the term for the [[freshwater mollusc|freshwater mollusk]] shells they encounter.  Seashells purchased from tourist shops or dealers may include various freshwater and terrestrial shells as well.  Non-marine items offered may include large and colorful tropical [[snail|land snail]] shells, freshwater [[apple snail]] shells, and pearly freshwater [[unionid mussel]] shells.  This can be confusing to collectors, as non-marine shells are often not included in their reference books.

==== Currency ====
{{main|shell money}}

Seashells have been used as a medium of exchange in various places, including many Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean islands, also in North America, Africa and the Caribbean.
[[Image:Cypraea-moneta-001.jpg|thumb|1742 drawing of shells of the money cowry, ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'']]
* The most common species of shells to be used as currency have been ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'', the "money [[cowry]]",&lt;ref name="Poutiers"&gt;Poutiers, J. M. (1998). Gastropods in: [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/w7191e/w7191e42.pdf '''FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes: The living marine resources of the Western Central Pacific Volume 1.''']{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Seaweeds, corals, bivalves and gastropods.

* Many of the tribes and nations all across the continent of Africa have historically used the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160323070635/http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/cowrie.php cowry] as their media of exchange. The cowry circulated, historically, alongside metal coins and goods, and foreign currencies. Being durable and easy to carry the cowry made a very favorable currency.
* Some tribes of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] used shells for [[wampum]] and [[hair pipe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Ewers|Ewers, John C.]] "[http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/BAE/Bulletin164/section2.htm#Shell%20hp Hair Pipes in Plains Indian Adornment]", ''Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 164'', pp. 29-85.  United States Government Printing Office, Washington : 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; The Native American ''[[wampum]] belts'' were made of the shell of the [[quahog]] clam.

==== Tools ====
Seashells have often been used as [[tool]]s, because of their strength and the variety of their shapes.
* [[Giant clam]]s (Family Tridacnidae) have been used as bowls, and when big enough, even as bathtubs and [[baptism]]al fonts.
* ''[[Melo melo]]'', the "bailer [[Volutidae|volute]]", is so named because Native Australians used it to bail out their canoes.
* Many different species of bivalves have been used as scrapers, blades, clasps, and other such tools, due to their shape.
* Some marine gastropods have been used for [[oil lamp]]s, the oil being poured in the aperture of the shell, and the [[siphonal canal]] serving as a holder for the wick.

==== Horticulture ====
Because seashells are in some areas a readily available bulk source of calcium carbonate, shells such as [[oyster]] shells are sometimes used as soil conditioners in [[horticulture]]. The shells are broken or ground into small pieces in order to have the desired effect of raising the [[pH]] and increasing the [[calcium]] content in the soil.

==== Religion and spirituality ====
[[File:Travancore State Flag.png|thumb|A sacred chank shell on the flag of [[Travancore]], India]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Strombuslarcomuseum.jpg|thumb|right|Moche Shell, 200 A.D. [[Larco Museum|Larco Museum Collection]] Lima, Peru.]] --&gt;

Seashells have played a part in religion and spirituality, sometimes even as ritual objects.
* In Christianity, the [[scallop]] shell is considered to be the symbol of [[Saint James the Great]], see ''[[Pecten jacobaeus]]''.
* In [[Hinduism]], left-handed shells of ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'' (the sacred [[shankha]]) are considered to be sacred to the god [[Vishnu]]. The person who finds a left-handed chank shell (one that coils to the left) is sacred to Vishnu, as well. The chank shell also plays an important role in [[Buddhism]].
* [[Cowries]] have often been considered to be symbols of female fertility. They were often treated as actual fertility [[amulet|charms]]. The dorsum of the shell resembles a pregnant belly, and the underside of the shell resembles a [[vulva]]. In the South Indian state of Kerala, cowries are used for making astrological predictions.
* In the [[Santería]] religion, shells are used for [[divination]].
* The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture of ancient [[Peru]] worshipped animals and the sea, and often depicted shells in their art.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Christianity, the top  of the [[sand dollar]] represents the Star of Bethlehem that led the Wise Men to the manger of Christ. Outside the "star" you will see the Easter Lily, a sign of Jesus' Resurrection. There are four holes that represent the holes in the Lord's hands and feet. The center hole is the Wound to His Sacred Heart by the spear of Longinus. On the other side of the sand dollar, you will see Poinsettia. Lastly, if you break open the sand dollar, five doves will come out, the doves of Peace and Joy.&lt;ref&gt;The Legend of the Sand Dollar&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Musical instruments ====
{{main|Conch (musical instrument)}}
[[File:Hindu priest blowing conch during punja.jpg|thumb|Hindu priest sounding a ritual trumpet made from ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'']]
[[File:Gyeonbokgung-March-01.jpg|thumb|Korean military procession with ''[[Charonia]]'' trumpets]]

Seashells have been used as musical instruments, [[wind instruments]] for many hundreds if not thousands of years. Most often the shells of large sea snails are used, as trumpets, by cutting a hole in the [[spire (mollusc)|spire]] of the shell or cutting off the tip of the spire altogether. Various different kinds of large marine gastropod shells can be turned into "blowing shells", however the most commonly encountered species used as "[[conch]]" trumpets are:
* The sacred chank, ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'', known in India as the [[shankha]]. In [[Tibet]] it is known as "dung-dkar".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/shells.html |title=Some Basics on Shell Trumpets and some very Basics on how to make them |author=Clark, Mitchell |year=1996 |publisher=furious.com |accessdate=24 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021010404/http://www.furious.com/perfect/shells.html |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Triton (mollusk)|Triton shell]] also known as "Triton's trumpet" ''[[Charonia tritonis]]'' which is used as a trumpet in Melanesian and Polynesian culture and also in [[Korea]] and Japan. In Japan this kind of trumpet is known as the [[horagai]]. In Korea it is known as the [[nagak]]. In some Polynesian islands it is known as "''pu''".&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;
* The [[Queen Conch]] ''[[Strombus gigas]]'', has been used as a trumpet in the Caribbean.

Children in some cultures are often told the myth that you can hear the sound of the ocean by holding a seashell to ones ear. This is due to the effect of [[seashell resonance]].

==== Personal adornment ====
[[File:Kikuyu woman traditional dress.jpg|thumb|Use of [[gastropod shell]]s, specifically [[cowries]], in traditional dress of the [[Kikuyu people]] of [[Kenya]], Africa]]
[[File:Pearlykingandqueen.jpg|right|thumb|A Pearly King and Queen in London]]
Whole seashells or parts of sea shells have been used as jewelry or in other forms of adornment since prehistoric times. [[Mother of pearl]] was historically primarily a seashell product, although more recently some mother of pearl comes from freshwater mussels. Also see [[pearl]].
* Shell necklaces have been found in Stone Age graves as far inland as the [[Dordogne]] Valley in France.
* Seashells are often used whole and drilled, so that they can be threaded like [[bead]]s, or cut into pieces of various shapes. Sometimes shells can be found that are already "drilled" by predatory snails of the family [[Naticidae]]. Fine whole shell necklaces were made by [[Tasmanian Aboriginal]] women for more than 2,600 years. The necklaces represent a significant cultural tradition which is still practised by [[Tasmanian Aboriginal|Palawa]] women elders. The shells used include pearly green and blue-green maireener (rainbow kelp) shells, brown and white rice shells, black cats' teeth shells and pink button shells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/dulcie_greeno_necklaces Tasmanian Aboriginal shell necklaces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612010907/http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/dulcie_greeno_necklaces/ |date=12 June 2011 }}, [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Naturally-occurring, beachworn, [[cone shell]] "tops" (the broken-off spire of the shell, which often has a hole worn at the tip) can function as beads without any further modification. In [[Hawaii]] these natural beads were traditionally collected from the beach drift in order to make [[puka shell]] jewelry. Since it is hard to obtain large quantities of naturally-occurring beachworn cone tops, almost all modern puka [[shell jewelry]] uses cheaper imitations, cut from thin shells of other species of mollusk, or even made of plastic.
* Shells historically have been and still are made into, or incorporated into, necklaces, pendants, beads, earrings, [[button (clothing)|buttons]], [[brooch]]es, [[ring (finger)|rings]], [[comb|hair combs]], belt buckles and other uses.
* The shell of the large  "bullmouth helmet" sea snail, scientific name ''[[Cypraecassis rufa]]'', was historically, and still is, used to make valuable [[Cameo (carving)|cameos]].
* [[Nacre|Mother of pearl]] from many seashells including species in the family [[Trochidae]], [[Turbinidae]], [[Haliotidae]], and various pearly bivalves, has often been used in jewelry, buttons, etc.
* In London, [[Pearly Kings and Queens]] traditionally wear clothing covered in patterns made up of hundreds of "pearl [[Button (clothing)|buttons]]", in other words, buttons made of [[mother-of-pearl]] or [[nacre]]. In recent years however, the majority of "pearl buttons" are imitations that are made of pearlescent plastic.

==== Crafts ====
{{main|Sailor's Valentines}}

"[[Sailor's Valentines]]" were late 19th-century decorative keepsakes which were made in the Caribbean, and which were often purchased by sailors to give to their loved ones back home for example in England. These valentines consisted of elaborate arrangements of small seashells glued into attractive symmetrical designs, which were encased on a wooden (usually octagonal) hinged box-frame. The patterns used often featured heart-shaped designs, or included a sentimental expression of love spelled out in small shells.

The making of shellwork artifacts is a practice of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal women]] from [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]] in [[Sydney]], dating back to the 19th century. Shellwork objects include baby shoes, jewelry boxes and replicas of famous landmarks, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The shellwork tradition began as an Aboriginal women's craft which was adapted and tailored to suit the tourist souvenir market, and which is now considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/shell_work_sydney_harbour_bridge/ Shellwork Sydney Harbour Bridge, National Museum of Australia Collections, accessed 18 April 201.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317131323/http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/shell_work_sydney_harbour_bridge/ |date=17 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Architectural decoration ====
Small pieces of colored and iridescent shell have been used to create [[mosaic]]s and [[inlay]]s, which have been used to decorate walls, furniture and boxes. Large numbers of whole seashells, arranged to form patterns, have been used to decorate mirror frames, furniture and man-made [[grotto]]s.

==== Art ====
[[File:Akkulam shanku.jpg|thumb|Enormous seashell sculpture at [[Akkulam]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], India]]

[[File:Albertus Seba Muscheln.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from an 18th-century book, edited by [[Albertus Seba]]. These decorative arrangements were a popular way to display seashells at the time]]

A very large outdoor sculpture at [[Akkulam]] of a gastropod seashell is a reference to the sacred chank shell ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'' of India. In 2003, [[Maggi Hambling]] designed a striking 13&amp;nbsp;ft (4 m) high sculpture of a [[scallop]] shell which stands on the beach at [[Aldeburgh]], in England. The goddess of love, [[Venus]] or [[Aphrodite]] is often traditionally depicted rising from the sea on a seashell.  In ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', [[Botticelli]] depicted the goddess [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] rising from the ocean on a [[scallop]] shell.

==== Poultry feeds ====
Sea shells found in the creek and backwater of the coast of west India are used as an additive to poultry feed. They are crushed and mixed with jawar maaze and dry fish.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Shells of other marine invertebrates ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
=== Arthropods ===
[[File:Crab from Long Island.jpg|thumb|The moulted [[carapace]] of a [[lady crab]] found on the beach at [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach, Long Island, New York State]]]]
[[File:Horseshoe Crab remains.jpg|thumb|left|Shell of [[horseshoe crab]] on a beach]]

Many [[arthropod]]s have [[sclerite]]s, or hardened body parts, which form a stiff exoskeleton made up mostly of [[chitin]].  In [[crustacean]]s, especially those of the class [[Malacostraca]] (crabs, shrimps and lobsters, for instance), the plates of the exoskeleton may be fused to form a more or less rigid [[carapace]]. Moulted carapaces of a variety of marine malacostraceans often wash up on beaches. The [[horseshoe crab]] is an arthropod of the family [[Limulidae]]. The shells or [[exuviae]] of these arachnid relatives are common in beach drift in certain areas of the world.

=== Sea urchins ===
[[File:Sea Urchin test 5629 03 22.jpg|thumb|[[Sea urchin]] test]]
Some [[echinoderm]]s such as [[sea urchin]]s, including [[heart urchin]]s and [[sand dollar]]s, have a hard "test" or shell. After the animal dies, the flesh rots out and the spines fall off, and then fairly often the empty test washes up whole onto a beach, where it can be found by a beachcomber. These tests are fragile and easily broken into pieces.

=== Brachiopods ===
[[File:LingulaanatinaAA.JPG|thumb|A whole animal of the brachiopod ''[[Lingula anatina]]'' from Australia with the shell showing on the left]]
The [[brachiopod]]s, or lamp shells, superficially resemble clams, but the phylum is not closely related to mollusks. Most lines of brachiopods ended during the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], and their ecological niche was filled by bivalves. A few of the remaining species of brachiopods occur in the low [[intertidal zone]] and thus can be found live by beachcombers.

=== Annelids ===
Some [[polychaetes]], marine annelid worms in the family [[Serpulidae]], secrete a hard tube made of calcium carbonate, adhering to stones or other shells. This tube resembles, and can be confused with, the shell of marine gastropod mollusks in the family [[Vermetidae]], the worm snails.

== Other more atypical kinds ==
A few other categories of marine animals leave remains which might be considered "seashells" in the widest possible sense of the word.

=== Chelonians ===
[[Sea turtle]]s have a [[carapace]] and [[plastron]] of bone and [[cartilage]] which is developed from their [[rib]]s. Infrequently a turtle "shell" will wash up on a beach.

=== Hard corals ===
[[Image:Shells stones and other curios.JPG|thumb|Dish with beachworn coral pieces, marine gastropod shells, and echinoderm tests, from the Caribbean and the Mediterranean]]

Pieces of the hard skeleton of [[coral]]s commonly wash up on beaches in areas where corals grow.

The construction of the shell-like structures of corals are aided by a [[symbiotic]] relationship with a class of [[algae]], [[zooxanthella]]e. Typically a coral polyp will harbor particular species of algae, which will [[photosynthesis]]e and thereby provide energy for the coral and aid in calcification,&lt;ref name=MilneBay&gt;

=== Soft corals ===
[[File:1-Gorgone.jpg|thumb|An x-ray photograph of a [[gorgonian]]]]
The skeletons of soft corals such as [[gorgonian]]s, also known as [[sea fan]]s and [[sea whip]]s, commonly wash ashore in the [[tropics]] after storms.

=== Plankton and protists ===
[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Marine [[diatom]]s form hard silicate shells]]
Plant-like [[diatom]]s and animal-like [[radiolarian]]s are two forms of [[plankton]] which form hard [[silica]]te shells. [[Foraminifera]] and [[coccolithophore]] create shells known as "[[test (biology)|tests]]" which are made of calcium carbonate. These shells and tests are usually microscopic in size, though in the case of foraminifera, they are sometimes visible to the naked eye, often resembling miniature mollusk shells.

A '''sex position''' is a position of the body that an individual or couple people may use for [[sexual intercourse]] or other [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. Sexual acts are generally described by the positions the participants adopt in order to perform those acts. Though sexual intercourse generally involves [[Sexual penetration|penetration]] of the body of one person by another, sex positions commonly involve penetrative or [[non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] sexual activities.

Three categories of sexual intercourse are commonly practiced: [[vagina]]l intercourse (involving vaginal penetration), [[anal sex|anal penetration]], and [[oral sex]] (especially mouth-on-genital stimulation).&lt;ref name="health.discovery.com"&gt;{{cite web|title= Sexual Intercourse| publisher=[[Discovery Channel|Discovery.com]]| accessdate=2008-01-12|url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/intercourse.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822040701/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/intercourse.html|archivedate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex acts may also involve other forms of genital stimulation, such as solo or mutual [[masturbation]], which may involve rubbing or penetration by [[Fingering (sexual act)|the use of fingers or hands]] or by a device ([[sex toy]]), such as a [[dildo]] or [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]. The act may also involve [[anilingus]]. There are numerous sex positions that participants may adopt in any of these types of sexual intercourse or acts; some authors have argued that the number of sex positions is essentially limitless.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
[[Sex manual]]s usually present a guide to sex positions. Sex manuals have a long history. In the Graeco-Roman era, a sex manual was written by
[[Philaenis|Philaenis of Samos]], possibly a [[hetaira]] ([[courtesan]]) of the [[Hellenistic period]] (3rd–1st century BC).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Erôs in Ancient Greece|author1=Sanders, E.|author2=Thumiger, C.|author3=Carey, C.|author4=Lowe, N.|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199605507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qt7JkvxScSkC|page=287|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], believed to have been written in the 1st to 6th centuries, has a notorious reputation as a sex manual. Different sex positions result in differences in the depth of sexual penetration and the angle of penetration. Many attempts have been made to categorize sex positions. [[Alfred Kinsey]] categorized six primary positions,&lt;ref&gt;6 Positions For Sexual Intercourse - In Order Of Popularity - Sex, Love And Marriage - Book of Lists - Canongate Home&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known European medieval text dedicated to sexual positions is the ''[[Speculum al foderi]]'', sometimes known as "The Mirror of Coitus" (or literally{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} "a mirror for fuckers"), a 15th-century [[Catalan language|Catalan]] text discovered in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Solomon, editor (1986). ''Text and Concordance of Speculum al foderi, Biblioteca Nacional MS. 3356''. {{ISBN|0-942260-60-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Solomon (1990). ''The Mirror of coitus : a translation and edition of the fifteenth-century Speculum al foderi''. Spanish. {{ISBN|0-940639-48-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusively penetrative==
These positions involve the insertion of a phallic object(s) (such as a penis, [[strap-on dildo]], plug, or other [[Sex toy#Flesh-like materials used in sex toys|nonporous object(s)]]) into a vagina, anus or mouth.

[[File:Wiki-dstyle.png|thumb|A rear-penetration position, commonly referred to as '[[doggy style]]'. The receiving partner can be penetrated either vaginally or anally.]]

===Penetrating partner on top with front entry===
{{See also|Missionary position}}
The most used sex position is the [[missionary position]]. In this position, the participants face each other. The receiving partner lies on their back with legs apart, while the penetrating partner lies on top. This position and the following variations may be used for [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[Anal sex|anal intercourse]].

*The penetrating partner stands in front of the receiving partner, whose legs dangle over the edge of a bed or some other platform like a table.&lt;ref name="coville"&gt;Nafzawi, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al, and Jim Colville (trans.). ''The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight''. The Kegan Paul Arabia library, vol. 7. London: Kegan Paul, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; With the receiving partner's legs lifted towards the ceiling and resting against the penetrating partner, this is sometimes called the ''butterfly position''. This can also be done as a kneeling position.
*The receiving partner lies on their back. The penetrating partner stands and lifts the receiving partner's pelvis for penetration. A variant is for the receiving partner to rest their legs on the penetrating partner's shoulders.
*The receiving partner lies on their back, legs pulled up straight and knees near to the head. The penetrating partner holds the receiving partner's legs and penetrates from above.
*Similarly to the previous position, but the receiving partner's legs need not be straight and the penetrating partner wraps their arms around the receiving partner to push the legs as close as possible to the chest. Called ''the stopperage'' in Burton's translation of ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]''.&lt;ref name="perfumed garden"&gt;''The Perfumed Garden'', Shaykh Nefwazi {{sic}}, translated by Sir Richard Francis Burton, 1886. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/sex/garden/ full text available at Internet Sacred Text Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[coital alignment technique]]'', a position where a woman is vaginally penetrated by a man, and the penetrating partner moves upward along the woman's body until the penis is pointing down, the dorsal side of the penis now rubbing against the clitoris.
*The receiving partner crosses their feet behind their head (or at least puts their feet next to their ears), while lying on their back. The penetrating partner then holds the receiving partner tightly around each instep or ankle and lies on the receiving partner full-length. A variation is to have the receiving partner cross their ankles on their stomach, knees to shoulders, and then have the penetrating partner lie on the receiving partner's crossed ankles with their full weight. Called the ''Viennese oyster'' by ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''.&lt;ref name="joy"&gt;Comfort, Alex, ''The Joy of Sex: Fully Revised &amp; Completely Updated for the 21st Century''. Crown. Fully rev. ed., 2002. {{ISBN|1-4000-4614-9}}, 256 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penetrating from behind===
[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n1.jpg|thumb|1st century AD depiction of 'spooning']]
{{See also|Doggy style}}
Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration. Variants of the ''[[doggy style]]'' or ''doggy position'' include:
*The receiving partner is on all fours with their torso horizontal and the penetrating partner inserts either their penis or sex toy into either the vagina or anus from behind.&lt;ref name= Rogiere&gt;Rogiere, Jean, ''The Little Book of Sex''. Ulysses Press, 2001. {{ISBN|1-56975-305-9}}, 96 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The receiving partner's torso is angled downwards and the penetrating partner raises their own hips above those of the receiving partner for maximum penetration.
*The penetrating partner places their feet on each side of the receiving partner while keeping their knees bent and effectively raising up as high as possible while maintaining penetration. The penetrating partner's hands usually have to be placed on the receiving partner's back to keep from falling forward.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*The receiving partner kneels upright while the penetrating partner gently pulls the receiving partner's arms backwards at the wrists towards them.

In the ''[[spoons sex position|spoons position]]'' both partners lie on their side, facing the same direction.&lt;ref name="sex for dummies"&gt;Westheimer, Ruth K., ''Sex for Dummies''. For Dummies. 2nd ed., 2000. {{ISBN|0-7645-5302-X}}, 432 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Variants of this technique include the following:
*The receiving partner lies on their side. The penetrating partner kneels and penetrates from behind. Alternatively, the penetrating partner can stand if the receiving partner is on a raised surface.
*The receiving partner lies facing down, possibly with their legs spread. The penetrating partner lies on top of them.&lt;ref name="little book"&gt;Rogiere, Jean, ''The Little Book of Sex''. Ulysses Press. 2001. {{ISBN|1-56975-305-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The placement of a pillow beneath the receiving partner's hips can help increase stimulation in this position.
*The receiving partner lies face down, knees together. The penetrating partner lies on top with spread legs.
*The receiving partner lies on their side with their uppermost leg forward. The penetrating partner kneels astride the receiver's lowermost leg.

[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|Woman on top position in the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'']]

===Receiving partner on top===
{{See also|Woman on top}}
[[File:Wiki-cowgirl.png|thumb|The [[cowgirl sex position|'cowgirl' position]]]]

Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration.
When the receiving partner is a woman, these positions are sometimes called the ''woman on top'', ''cowboy'' or ''cowgirl'' positions.

A feature of these positions is that the penetrating partner lies on their back with the receiving partner on top:
*The receiving partner can [[kneel]] while straddling the penetrating partner, with the participants facing each other.
*Alternatively, the receiving partner can face away from the penetrating partner. This position is sometimes called the ''reverse cowboy'' or ''reverse cowgirl'' position.
*The receiving partner can arch back with hands on the ground.
*The receiving partner can [[Squatting position|squat]] (instead of kneel) facing the penetrating partner.
*The receiving partner can bring forward their knees against the ground.
*The penetrating partner lies with their upper back on a low table, couch, chair or edge of bed, keeping their feet flat on the floor and back parallel to floor. The receiving partner straddles them, also keeping their feet on the floor. Receiving partner can assume any of various positions.
*The ''[[lateral coital position]]'' was recommended by [[Masters and Johnson]], and was preferred by three quarters of their heterosexual study participants after having tried it. The position involves the male on his back, with the female rolled slightly to the side so that her pelvis is atop his, but her weight is beside his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher= Little Brown and Company | edition=1st | year=June 1970 | isbn=0-316-54985-1 | title=Human Sexual Inadequacy | last=Masters | first=Johnson | page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position can also be used for anal penetration, and is not limited to heterosexual partners.

[[File:Wiki-sitting-sp.png|thumb|A couple performing sexual intercourse from a seated position]]

===Sitting and kneeling===
Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration.
*The penetrating partner sits on an area surface, legs outstretched. The receiving partner sits on top and wraps their legs around the penetrating partner. Called ''pounding on the spot'' in the Burton translation of ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]''.&lt;ref name="perfumed garden"/&gt; If the penetrating partner [[Lotus position|sits cross-legged]], it is called the ''lotus position'' or ''lotus flower''. The position can be combined with fondling of [[erogenous zone]]s.
*The penetrating partner sits in a chair. The receiving partner straddles penetrating partner and sits, facing the penetrating partner, feet on floor. This is sometimes called a ''[[lap dance]]'', which is somewhat erroneous as a lap dance typically does not involve penetration. The receiving partner may also sit in reverse, with their back to the penetrating partner.
*The penetrating partner sits on a couch or in a chair that has armrests. The receiving partner sits in the penetrating partner's lap, perpendicular to penetrating partner, with their back against the armrest.
*The penetrating partner kneels while the receiving partner lies on their back, ankles on each side of penetrating partner's shoulders.&lt;ref name="perfumed garden"/&gt;

[[File:Wiki-standing.png|right|thumbnail|One partner stands while holding up the other without a support]]

===Standing===
Most of these positions can be used for either vaginal or anal penetration. In the basic standing position, both partners stand facing each other. The following variations are possible:
*In the basic standing position, both partners stand facing each other and engage in vaginal sex. In order to match heights, the shorter partner can, for instance, stand on a stair or wear high heels. It may be easier to maintain solid thrusts if the woman has her back to a wall. With such a support, the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' calls this position the ''Suspended Congress''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamasutra-sex.org/text/ |title=Kama Sutra – the ancient art of love |publisher=Kamasutra-sex.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is most often used in upright places, such as a wall in a bedroom or a [[shower]].
*The penetrating partner stands, and the receiving partner wraps their arms around his neck, and their legs around his waist, thereby exposing either the [[vagina]] or [[Human anus|anus]] to the man's [[Human penis|penis]]. This position is made easier with the use of a solid object behind the receiver, as above. To assume this position, it can be easier to start with the receiving partner laying on their back on the edge of a bed; the penetrating partner puts his elbows under their knees, enters them, and then lifts them as he rises to a standing position. In Japan, this is colloquially called the ''Ekiben'' position, after a specific bento lunch box sold at train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jslang.com/details.php?slangn=145|title=ekiben|publisher=JSlang]|accessdate=2011-10-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425015152/http://www.jslang.com/details.php?slangn=145|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alternatively, the receiving partner can face away from the penetrating partner which allows for anal sex. This position is varied by having the receiving partner assume different semi-standing positions. For instance, they may bend at the waist, resting their hands or elbows on a table.

===Anal sex positions===
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril anal sex detail.jpg|thumb|19th century depiction of anal penetration; detail of a painting by [[Édouard-Henri Avril|Paul Avril]]]]
{{See also|Anal sex}}
These positions involve [[anal sex|anal penetration]]: 
*[[Doggy style]] penetration maximizes the depth of penetration, but can pose the risk of pushing against the [[sigmoid colon]]. If the receiving partner is male, this increases the chances of stimulating the prostate. The penetrating partner controls the [[thrust]]ing rhythm. A variation is the ''leapfrog position'', in which the receiving partner angles their torso downward. The receiving partner may also lie flat and face down, with the penetrating partner straddling their thighs. [[File:Wiki-anal missionary.png|thumb|Anal sex between two men in the missionary position]]
*In the [[missionary position|missionary]] positions, to achieve optimal alignment, the receiving partner's legs should be in the air with the knees drawn towards their chest. Some sort of support (such as a pillow) under the receiving partner's hips can also be useful. The penetrating partner positions themselves between the receiving partner's legs. The penetrating partner controls the [[thrusting]] rhythm. This position is often cited as good for beginners, because it allows them to relax more fully than is usual in the doggy style position.
*The [[spoons sex position|spoons position]] allows the receiving partner to control initial penetration and the depth, speed and force of subsequent thrusting.
*The ''[[Reverse missionary position|receiving partner on top]]'' positions allow the receiving partner more control over the depth, rhythm and speed of penetration. More specifically, the receiving partner can slowly push their anus down on the penetrating partner, allowing time for their muscles to relax.

===Less common positions===
&lt;!-- T-square position redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Wiki-T-square.png|thumb|The T-square position]]

These positions are more innovative, and perhaps not as widely known or practiced as the ones listed above.

*The receiving partner lies on their back with knees up and legs apart. The penetrating partner lies on their side perpendicular to the receiver, with the penetrating partner's hips under the arch formed by receiver's legs. This position is sometimes called the ''T-square''.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2015-01-05 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*The receiving partner's legs are together turning to one side while looking up towards the penetrator, who has spread legs and is kneeling straight behind the other's hips. The penetrator's hands are on the other's hips. This position can be called the ''modified T-square''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensualinteractive.com |title=Welcome to Sensual Interactive – Your Sensual Resource Network |publisher=Sensualinteractive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Seventh Posture]]'' of Burton's translation of ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]'' is an unusual position not described in other classical [[sex manual]]s.&lt;ref name="perfumed garden"/&gt; The receiving partner lies on their side. The penetrating partner faces the receiver, straddling the receiver's lower leg, and lifts the receiver's upper leg on either side of the body onto the crook of penetrating partner's elbow or onto the shoulder. While some references describe this position as being "for acrobats and not to be taken seriously",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hooper|first= Anne J. |title= Anne Hooper's Kama Sutra|publisher= DK Publishing|edition= 1st|year= 1998| isbn= 1-56458-649-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have found it very comfortable, especially during [[pregnancy]].
*The ''[[piledriver (sexual)|piledriver]]'' is a difficult position sometimes seen in porn videos. It is described in many ways by different sources. In a heterosexual context, the woman lies on her back, then raises her hips as high as possible, so that her partner, standing, can enter her vaginally or anally. The position places considerable strain on the woman's neck, so firm cushions should be used to support her.
*The receiver lies face down legs spread on the edge of the bed and parallel to the floor, while the penetrator stands behind, holding both legs.
*The ''rusty bike pump'' is similar to a piledriver where penetration is achieved from above at a downward angle with the receiving partner bottom side up.
*[[Autopederasty]], inserting one's own penis into their anus

====Others====
*The receiving partner is on the bottom. The penetrating partner lies on top perpendicularly to them.
*The penetrating partner lies on their back, legs spread. The receiving partner is on their back on top of the penetrator, legs spread, facing the opposite direction.
*The penetrator and the receiver lie on their backs, heads pointed away from one another. Each places one leg on the other's shoulder (as a brace) and the other leg out somewhat to the side.
*The receiving partner lies on their back with the penetrating partner lying perpendicular. The receiving partner bends the knee closest to the penetrating partner's head enough so that there is room for the penetrating partner's waist to fit beneath it, while the penetrating partner's legs straddle the receiving partner's other leg. The in-and-out thrusting action will move more along a side-to-side rather than top-to-bottom axis. This is sometimes called the ''[[Tribadism#Sex positions and other aspects|scissors position]]''. This position allows for breast stimulation during sex, for partners to maintain eye contact if they wish, and for a good view of both partners as they reach orgasm.
*The penetrating partner sits on edge of a bed or chair with feet spread wide on floor. The receiving partner lies on their back on the floor and drapes their legs and thighs over the legs of the penetrating partner. The penetrating partner holds the knees of the receiving partner and controls thrusts.

===Using furniture or special apparatus===
Most sex acts are typically performed on a bed or other simple platform. As the range of supports available increases, so does the range of positions that are possible. Ordinary furniture can be used for this purpose. Also, various forms of [[erotic furniture]] and other apparatus such as [[Sling (furniture)#Slings for sexual activity|fisting sling]]s and [[trapeze]]s have been used to facilitate even more exotic sexual positions.

===Positions to promote or prevent conception===
{{See also|Birth control#Misconceptions}}

Pregnancy is a potential result of any form of sexual activity where [[sperm]] comes in contact with the vagina; this is typically during vaginal sex, but pregnancy can result from anal sex, digital sex (fingering), oral sex, or by another body part, if sperm is transferred from one area to the vagina between a [[Fertility|fertile]] female and a fertile male. Men and women are typically fertile during [[puberty]]. Though certain sexual positions are believed to produce more favorable results than others, none of these are effective means of contraception.

===Positions during pregnancy===
The goal is to prevent excessive pressure on the belly and to restrict penetration as required by the particular partners. Some of the positions below are popular positions for [[sex during pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnancy-info.net/sex_positions.html |title=Pregnancy Resource: Comfortable Sex Positions|publisher=Pregnancy-info.net|date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Woman on top: takes the pressure off of the woman's abdomen and allows her to control the depth and frequency of thrusting.
*Woman on back: like the missionary, but with less pressure on abdomen or uterus. The woman lies on her back and raises her knees up towards her chest. The partner kneels between her legs and enters from the front. A pillow is placed under her bottom for added comfort.
*Sideways: also keeps pressure off of her abdomen while supporting her uterus at the same time.
*Spooning: very popular positions to use during the late stages of pregnancy; allowing only shallow penetration and relieves the pressure on the stomach.
*Sitting: she mounts the sitting partner, relieving her stomach of pressure.
*[[Doggy style|From behind]]: allowing her to support stomach and breasts.

==Non-exclusively penetrative==

===Oral sex positions===
[[Oral sex]] is genital stimulation by the mouth. It may be penetrative or non-penetrative, and may take place before, during, as, or following intercourse. It may also be performed [[69 (sex position)|simultaneously]] (for example, when one partner performs cunnilingus, while the other partner performs fellatio), or only one partner may perform upon the other; this creates a multitude of variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexinfo101.com/sp_oralsex.shtml |title=Oral Sex Positions|publisher=Sexinfo101.com|date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fellatio====
[[File:Wiki-fellatio02.png|thumb|Modern drawing of fellatio]]
''[[Fellatio]]'' is oral sex performed on a penis. Possible positions include:
* '''Sitting'''
** The receiver lies on his back while the partner kneels between his legs.
** The receiver lies on his back while the partner lies off to the side of their legs.
** The receiver sits in a chair the partner kneels in front of them between their legs.
* '''Standing'''
** The receiver stands while the partner either kneels in front of them or sits (in a chair or on the edge of a bed, etc.) and bends forward.
** The receiver stands while the partner, also standing, bends forward at the waist.
** The receiver stands or crouches at the edge of the bed, facing the bed. The active partner lies on the bed with their head hanging over the edge of the bed backward. The receiver inserts their penis into the partner's mouth, usually to achieve ''[[deep throat (sexual act)|deep throat]]'' penetration.
* '''Lying'''
** While the active partner lies on their back, the receiver assumes the missionary position but adjusted forward.
** The active partner (with breasts) lies on their back, and the receiver inserts their penis between the breasts, and into the mouth.

====Cunnilingus====
[[File:Detail of Édouard-Henri Avril (23).jpg|thumb|19th-century depiction of cunnilingus (detail) by [[Paul Avril]]]]
''[[Cunnilingus]]'' is oral sex performed on the vulva and vagina. Possible positions include:
*The receiver lies on her back as in the missionary position. The active partner lies on their front between their legs.
*The active partner sits. The receiver stands facing away and bends at the hips.
*The active partner sits. The receiver stands or squats facing towards partner and may arch her back, to create further stimulation.
*The active partner lies on their back while the receiver kneels with their legs at their sides and their genitals on their mouth. In other words, the receiver sits on the face of her partner.
*The receiver rests on all fours as in the doggy style position. The partner lies on their back with his head under their genitalia. Their feet may commonly extend off the bed and rest on the floor.
*The receiver services their own genitals. Although rarer, some people still find this possible{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}; see [[autofellatio]].
*The receiver stands, possibly bracing themself against a wall. The active partner kneels in front of them.
*The receiver sits on the bed with her their open, the active partner kneels in front of them.
*The receiver is upside-down (standing on hands, held by partner, or using support, such as bondage or furniture), with the active partner standing or kneeling (depending on elevation) in front or behind. Such a position may be difficult to achieve, or maintain for extended time periods, but the rush of blood to the brain can alter stimulation's effect.
*The receiver stands on hands, resting each leg on either side of the active partner's head, with the active partner standing or kneeling facing them. Depending on which way up the receiver is facing, different stimulation and levels of comfort may be available.

====Sixty-nine====
[[File:Wiki-sixtynine.png|thumb|235x235px|The 69 position]]

Simultaneous oral sex between two people is called ''[[69 (sex position)|69]]''. Partners may be female or male. They can lie side-by-side, lie one on top of the other, or stand with one partner holding the other upside down.

====Anilingus====
[[Image:Wiki-analoral.svg|thumb|Woman performing anilingus on another woman]]

Positions for ''[[anilingus]]'', also known as ''butt licking'', ''rimming'', ''anal-oral sex'', ''rimjob'', or ''tossing the salad'', are often variants on those for genital-oral sex. Anilingus can be performed in a number of sex positions including:

===Other positions===
*''[[Fingering (sexual act)|Fingering]]'' of the [[vulva]], vagina or anus.
*''[[Shocker (hand gesture)|Shocker]]'': simultaneous fingering of the vagina and anus using one hand. The index and middle finger are inserted in the vagina, and the pinky in the anus. A number of variations are possible by using different combinations of fingers in each orifice. This act figures prominently in the ''[[Story of O]]'': shortly after O's arrival at the Chateau, a man grabs her in this way. O is shocked, but she learns to accept this and ruder intrusions. Sometimes colloquially referred to as "Two in the pink, one in the stink."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
*''[[Fisting]]'': inserting the entire hand into the vagina or anus. This usually requires large amounts of lubricant and relaxation. The hand is usually not actually made into a fist, but instead the thumb is placed between the middle and ring fingers.

==Non-penetrative==
{{Main|Non-penetrative sex}}
[[Image:Franz von Bayros 003.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Drawing]] by [[Franz von Bayros]] showing an act of fingering]]

''Non-penetrative sex'' or ''frottage'' is generally sexual activity that excludes penetration, and often includes rubbing one's genitals on one's sexual partner. This may include the partner's genitals or buttocks, and can involve different sex positions. As part of [[foreplay]] or to avoid penetrative sex, people engage in a variety of non-penetrative sexual behavior, which may or may not lead to orgasm.

*''[[Mutual masturbation]]'': The manual stimulation of the penis or scrotum in males and the [[clitoris]] or entire vulva in females.  Partners simultaneously stimulating each other's genitals by mutual or simultaneous masturbation, rhythmic inter-genital contact friction or actual penetrative intercourse can lead to orgasm in one partner or the other (or sometimes simultaneously in both).  
*''Dry humping'': frottage while clothed. This act is common, although not essential, in the dance style known as "[[grinding (dance)|grinding]]".
*''[[Handjob]]'' or ''[[fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]'': Manual stimulation of a partner's penis, scrotum, clitoris or entire vulva. Known as "wanking" in the UK, and "fapping" in modern colloquial terms.
*''[[Footjob]]'': using the feet to stimulate the penis.
*''[[Mammary intercourse]]'': using the breasts together to stimulate the penis through the cleavage. (Should not be confused with a "boob job" meaning to have [[Plastic surgery|augmentive surgery]] done on the breasts.) Also called a ''titjob'', ''titty-fucking'', a ''tit-wank''; several other [[slang]] terms exist.
*''[[Axillary intercourse]]'': with the penis in the armpit. Commonly known as "bagpiping".
*''[[Edging (sexual practice)|Orgasm control]]'': By self or by a partner managing the physical stimulation and sensation connected with the emotional and physiologic excitement levels.  Through the practice of masturbation an individual can learn to develop control of their own body's orgasmic response and timing.  In partnered stimulation either partner can control their own orgasmic response and timing.  With mutual agreement either partner can similarly learn to control or enhance their partner's orgasmic response and timing.  Partner stimulation orgasm techniques referred to as expanded orgasm, extended orgasm or orgasm control can be learned and practiced for either partner to refine their control of the orgasmic response of the other.  Partners mutually choose which is in control or in response to the other.
*''[[Orgasmic meditation]]'',&lt;ref name="New York Times: Orgasmic Meditation"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29wwln-safire-t.html|title=Orgasmic &amp; Orgasmic Meditation |publisher=The New York Times|author=William Safire|accessdate=2009-05-05 | date=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mindfulness practice where the object of [[meditation]] is conscious finger to genital contact.  "OMing" is practiced in pairs, with one partner, gently holding the genitals with both hands, and that partner's index finger gently, precisely, slowly stroking the female’s clitoris specifically and with both parties placing their complete [[awareness]] mindfully on that localized point of contact between them.  Both practitioners focus their fullest attention on their sensitive [[nerve endings]] and on their finest muscle control in stroking movement to develop connective ([[limbic]]) resonance between practitioners. The outcome, is not simply orgasm but interpersonal connection.

The [[Sexual slang|slang]] term ''humping'' may refer to masturbation—thrusting one's genitals against the surface of non-sexual objects, clothed or unclothed; or it may refer to penetrative sex.

===Genital-genital rubbing===

''Genital-genital rubbing'' (often termed ''GG rubbing'' by [[Primatology|primatologists]] to describe the behavior among female [[bonobo]]s&lt;ref name="songweaver"&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Waal FB |title=Bonobo sex and society |journal=[[Scientific American|Sci.

*''Intercrural sex'', or ''interfemoral sex'': the penis is placed between the partner's thighs, perhaps rubbing the [[vulva]], [[scrotum]] or [[perineum]].
*''Frot'' or ''frottage'': two males mutually rubbing penises together.
*''Tribadism'' or ''tribbing'': two females mutually rubbing vulvae together.

{{Main|Group sex}}

Various people of gender and orientation may participate in [[group sex]]. While group sex does not imply that all participants must be in sexual contact with all others simultaneously, some positions are only possible with three or more people.&lt;ref name="Swinger Orgies and Group Sex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swingersocial.com/swinger-blog/?page_id=1248 |title=Differences Between Threesomes, Group Sex and Orgies |publisher=The Swinger Blog |date=October 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2012 |author=Wojick, Helen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207203029/http://swingersocial.com/swinger-blog/?page_id=1248 |archivedate=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the positions listed above, more group sex positions become practical if [[erotic furniture]] is used.

===Threesomes===
{{Main|Threesome}}

When three people have sex with each other, it is called a ''threesome''. Possible ways of having all partners in sexual contact with each include some of the following:
*One person performs oral sex on one partner while they engage in receptive anal or vaginal intercourse with the other partner. Sometimes called a ''spit roast''.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Slang"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/s.htm | title=Spit Roast Threesome | date=November 1996 | accessdate=April 14, 2012 | author=Duckworth, Ted}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''369'' position is where two people engage in oral sex in the 69 position while a third person positions himself to penetrate one of the others; usually a man engaging in sex doggie-style with the woman on top in the 69 position.&lt;ref name="Sex Position 369"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions | title=Lifestyle Definitions - 369 | publisher=Swinger Social Network | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A man has vaginal or anal sex with one partner, while himself being anally penetrated by another (possibly with a [[strap-on dildo]]).
*Three partners lie or stand in parallel, with one between the other two. Sometimes called a ''sandwich''. This term may specifically refer to the ''double penetration'' of a woman, with one penis in her anus, and the other in her vagina or of a male, with two penises in his anus.
*Two participants have vaginal/anal sex with each other, and one/both perform oral sex on a third.
*Three people perform oral/vaginal/anal sex on one another simultaneously, commonly called a ''daisy chain''.
*The slang term ''lucky Pierre'' is sometimes used in reference to the person playing the middle role in a threesome, being anally penetrated while engaging in penetrative anal or vaginal sex.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foursomes===
*A ''469'' is a four-person sexual position where two individuals engage in 69 oral sex while a third and a fourth person both position themselves on each end to penetrate the two engaged in simultaneous oral sex; similar to a 369, with the addition of a fourth person.&lt;ref name="469 Sex Position"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions | title=Lifestyle Definitions - 469 position | publisher=Swinger Social Network | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With many participants===
These positions can be expanded to accommodate any number of participants:
*A group of males [[masturbation|masturbating]] is called a ''[[circle jerk (sexual practice)|circle jerk]]''.
*A group of males masturbating and ejaculating on one person's face is known as ''[[bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]]''.&lt;ref name="Lifestyle Definitions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/b | title=Lifestyle Definitions - Bukkake | publisher=Swinger Social Network | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bukkake | title=Bukkake | publisher=dictionary.com | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A group of men, women, or both, each performing oral, anal or vaginal sex on the next, is called a ''daisy chain''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/d | title=Daisy Chain | publisher=Swinger Social Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/daisy+chain?s=t | title=Daisy Chain | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When one woman or man is given the serial or parallel attention of many, often involving a queue (''pulling a train''), it is often termed a ''[[gangbang]]''.

===Multiple penetration===&lt;!-- Linked to by the redirects Double penetration &amp; Triple penetration --&gt;
{{commons category|Multiple penetration}}

A person may be sexually penetrated multiple times simultaneously. Penetration may involve use of fingers, toes, [[sex toy]]s, or penises. Scenes of multiple penetration are common in [[pornography]].

If one person is penetrated by two objects, it is generically called ''double penetration'' (''DP'').&lt;ref name="DP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/d |title=Double-penetration|publisher=Swinger Social Network|work=Lifestyle Definitions|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double penetration of the [[vagina]], [[Human anus|anus]], or mouth can involve:
*Simultaneous penetration of the anus by two penises or other objects. This is commonly called ''double anal penetration (DAP)'' or ''double stuffing''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
*Simultaneous penetration of the vagina by two penises or other objects. This is commonly called ''double vaginal penetration (DVP)'' or ''double stuffing''.&lt;ref name="DVP"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/d |title=Double vaginal penetration|publisher=Swinger Social Network|work=Lifestyle Definitions|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Simultaneous penetration of the vagina and anus. If this is done using penises and/or [[strap-on dildo]]s, this is sometimes called the ''sandwich'' or ''BigMac''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The ''[[shocker (hand gesture)|shocker]]'' (see above) accomplishes this using several fingers of one hand.{{anchor|Spit roast}}
*Simultaneous penetration of the mouth and either the vagina or anus. If the penetrating objects are penises, this is sometimes called the ''spit roast'', the ''Chinese finger trap'', or the ''Eiffel tower''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Number of positions, and effects on physical abilities==
In 1974, [[Alex Comfort]] categorized more than 600&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1974) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gershon Legman]] categorized 3,780.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1974) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; However, the suggestion that the number of positions that can be used for sex is essentially limitless also exists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Rogiere, Jean, "	
The little bit naughty book of sex". Ulysses Press. 2001. {{ISBN|1569753059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people are limited by physical [[disability|disabilities]] in the sex positions which they may use without pain or other discomfort. Other physical limitations of one or both participants also limit the sex positions which they may adopt. For example, the spoons position is recommended when either partner has back problems; the ''starfish position'' is recommended to achieve orgasms more easily and the missionary position may be uncomfortable for the receiving partner if the weight of the inserting partner, relative to the receiving partner's, is a problem. Also, the standing positions may be unsuitable if there is a significant height difference between the participants, unless the female is being carried.

{{About-distinguish|Social Practice as a minor psychological theory|Practice Theory}}

{{For|the art medium of Social Practice|Social practice (art)}}

'''Social practice''' is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations. Emphasized as a commitment to change, social practice occurs in two forms: activity and inquiry. Most often applied within the context of human development, social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smolka, A. L. B. (2001). Social practice and social change: activity theory in perspective. Human Development, 44(6), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background in psychology==
Through research, [[Sylvia Scribner]] sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position, race, gender, and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Hedegaard, M. (1998). A cultural-historical approach to mind. Human Development, 41(3), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation, Scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings. She therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development.

==Social practice as activity==
Social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner-community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills, knowledge, and understanding of people in their private, family, community, and working lives.&lt;ref&gt;“What is social practice?” (n.d.). Retrieved April 25, 2013, from http://spiritstorelimerick.weebly.com/what-is-social-practice.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to social practice, activity is used for social change without the agenda of research. Activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hung, D., Tan, S. C., &amp; Koh, T. S. (2006). From traditional to constructivist epistemologies: a proposed theoretical framework based on activity theory for learning communities. Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 17(1), 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social practice as inquiry==
Within research, social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual. Just as social practice is an activity itself, inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes. It has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers' commitments to specific forms of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Herndl, C. G., &amp; Nahrwold, C. A. (2000). Research as social practice: a case study of research on technical and professional communication. Written Communication, 17(2), 158-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
===Education===
In education, social practice refers to the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D. W. (2010). Directions for studying early literacy as social practice. Language Arts, 88(2), 134-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Under social practice, [[literacy]] is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda.  In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and [[numeracy]] are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.

===Literature===
As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse, many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions. Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other. As such, they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text, institution, and individual. Overall, literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction, poetry, politics, and history.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, P., Ferguson, P. P., &amp; Griswold, W. (Eds.). (1989). Literature and social practice, 1st Ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Text Encoding Initiative''' ('''TEI''') is a [[written language|text-centric]] [[community of practice]] in the [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] of [[digital humanities]], operating continuously since the 1980s. The community currently runs a mailing list, meetings and conference series, and maintains an [[eponymous]] [[technical standard]], a [[Scientific journal|journal]], a [[wiki]], a [[GitHub]] repository and a [[toolchain]].

==TEI guidelines==

The ''TEI Guidelines'', which collectively define an XML format, are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known [[open formats]] for text (such as [[HTML]] and [[OpenDocument]]) in that it's primarily semantic rather than presentational; the semantics and interpretation of every tag and attribute are specified.
Some 500 different textual components and concepts
(&lt;tt&gt;word&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element w (word)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;sentence&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-s.html|title=Element s (s-unit)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;character&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-c.html|title=Element c (character)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html|title=Element g (character or glyph)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;person&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-person.html|title=Element person (person)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
etc.); each is grounded in one or more academic discipline and examples are given.

===Technical details===

The standard is split into two parts, a discursive textual description with extended examples and discussion and set of tag-by-tag definitions. Schemata in most of the modern formats ([[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[RELAX NG]] and [[W3C Schema]]) are generated automatically from the tag-by-tag definitions. A number of tools support the production of the guidelines and the application of the guidelines to specific projects.

A number of special tags are used to circumvent restrictions imposed by the underlying [[Unicode]]; &lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt; to allow representation of characters that don't qualify for Unicode inclusion&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; to allow overcome the required strict linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html|title=Element choice  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most users of the format do not use the complete range of tags but produce a customisation, using a project-specific subset of the tags and attributes defined by the Guidelines. The TEI defines a sophisticated customization mechanism known as ODD for this purpose. In addition to documenting and describing each TEI tag, an ODD specification specifies its content model and other usage constraints, which may be expressed using [[schematron]].

''TEI Lite'' is an  example of such a customization. It defines an [[XML]]-based [[file format]] for exchanging texts.  It is a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements available in the full TEI Guidelines.

===Examples===

The text of the TEI guidelines is rich in examples. There is also a samples page on the TEI wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples_of_TEI_texts |title=Samples of TEI texts |work=wiki.tei-c.org |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives examples of real-world projects which expose their underlying TEI.

====Prose tags====

TEI allows texts to be marked up syntactically at any level of granularity, or mixture of granularities. For example, this paragraph (p) has been marked up into sentences (s) and clauses (cl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILCW |title=17 Simple Analytic Mechanisms - TEI P5: — Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;

 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It was about the beginning of September, 1664,
  &lt;cl&gt;that I, among the rest of my neighbours,
       heard in ordinary discourse
   &lt;cl&gt;that the plague was returned again to Holland; &lt;/cl&gt;
   &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;for it had been very violent there, and particularly at
     Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;whither, &lt;cl&gt;they say,&lt;/cl&gt; it was brought,
  &lt;cl&gt;some said&lt;/cl&gt; from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods
  &lt;cl&gt;which were brought home by their Turkey fleet;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;others said it was brought from Candia;
     others from Cyprus. &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It mattered not &lt;cl&gt;from whence it came;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;but all agreed &lt;cl&gt;it was come into Holland again.&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Verse====

TEI has tags for marking up verse. This example (taken from the French translation of the TEI Guidelines) shows a sonnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/fr/html/ref-lg |title=TEI element lg (groupe de vers) |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;div type="sonnet"&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Les amoureux fervents et les savants austères&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Aiment également, dans leur mûre saison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux sédentaires.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Amis de la science et de la volupté&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Ils cherchent le silence et l'horreur des ténèbres ;&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; L'Érèbe les eût pris pour ses coursiers funèbres,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; S'ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fierté.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudes&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Des grands sphinx allongés au fond des solitudes,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Qui semblent s'endormir dans un rêve sans fin ;&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Leurs reins féconds sont pleins d'étincelles magiques,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Et des parcelles d'or, ainsi qu'un sable fin,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Étoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Choice tag====

The &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; tag is used to represent sections of text which might be encoded or tagged in more than one possible way. In the following example, based on one in the standard, &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; is used twice, once to indicate an original and a corrected year and once to indicate an original and regularised spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html |title=TEI element &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;p xml:id="p23"&gt;Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above
articles, the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of &lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;sic&gt;1724&lt;/sic&gt;
  &lt;corr&gt;1728&lt;/corr&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt; of our subjects,
with free access to our royal person, and other marks of our
&lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;orig&gt;favour&lt;/orig&gt;
  &lt;reg&gt;favor&lt;/reg&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt;.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==ODD==

'''One Document Does it all''' ("ODD") is a [[literate programming]] language for [[XML schema]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Bauman|first1=Syd|last2=Flanders|first2=Julia|contribution=ODD customizations|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Bauman01/EML2004Bauman01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Burnard|first1=Lou|author2-link=Sebastian Rahtz|last2=Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|contribution=RelaxNG with Son of ODD|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Burnard01/EML2004Burnard01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Literate Documentation for XML|last=Reiss|first=Kevin M.|publisher=Digital Humanities 2007|location=Urbana-Champaign, Illinois|year=2007|url=http://dhcommons.tamu.edu/sites/default/files/poster_208_reiss.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A complete schema definition language for the Text Encoding Initiative|first1=Lou|last1=Burnard|author2-link=Sebastian Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|last2=Rahtz|date=June 2013|journal=XML London 2013|doi=10.14337/XMLLondon13.Rahtz01|url=http://xmllondon.com/2013/presentations/rahtz/|pages=152–161|isbn=978-0-9926471-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In literate-programming style, ODD documents combine human-readable documentation and machine-readable models using the  Documentation Elements module of the Text Encoding Initiative. Tools generate [[Internationalization and localization|localised and internationalised]] [[HTML]], [[ePub]], or [[PDF]] human-readable output and [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]s, [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax machine-readable output.

The Roma web application&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/ Roma web application].&lt;/ref&gt; is built around the ODD format and can use it to  generate schemas in [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax formats, as used by many XML validation tools and services.

ODD is the format used internally by the Text Encoding Initiative for their [[eponymous]] [[Technical Standards and Safety Authority|technical standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2007|editor1-first=Lou|editor1-last=Burnard|editor2-first=Syd|editor2-last=Bauman|title=TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange|publisher=TEI Consortium|location=Charlottesville, Virginia, USA|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ODD files generally describe the difference between a customized XML format and the full TEI model, ODD also can be used to describe XML formats that are entirely separate from the TEI.  One example of this is the [[W3C| W3C's]] [[Internationalization Tag Set]] which uses the ODD format to generate schemas and document its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/its/ W3C ITS] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/its/itstagset.xml TEI ODD file].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best Practices for XML Internationalization|editor1-last=Savourel|editor1-first=Yves|editor2-last=Kosek|editor2-first=Jirka|editor3-last=Ishida|editor3-first=Richard|publisher=W3C Working Group|year=2008|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-i18n-bp/|contribution=5.2 ITS and TEI}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEI customizations==

TEI customizations are specializations of the TEI XML specification for use in particular fields or by specific communities.

* [[EpiDoc]] (Epigraphic Documents)
* [http://www.cei.lmu.de/ Charters Encoding Initiative]
* [http://www.menota.org/ Medieval Nordic Text Archive (Menota)]

Customization in the TEI is done through the ODD mechanism mentioned above. In truth since its P5 version, all so-called 'TEI Conformant' uses of the TEI Guidelines are based on a TEI customization documented in a TEI ODD file. Even when users choose one of the off-the-shelf pre-generated schemas to validate against, these have been created from freely available customization files.

==Projects==
The format is used by many projects worldwide. Practically all projects are associated with one or more universities. Some well-known projects that encode texts using TEI include:

==History==
Prior to the creation of TEI, humanities scholars had no common standards for encoding electronic texts in a manner which would serve their academic goals ([[Susan Hockey|Hockey]] 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;41).  In 1987, a group of scholars representing fields in humanities, linguistics, and computing convened at Vassar College to put forth a set of guidelines known as the “Poughkeepsie Principles”. These guidelines directed the development of the first TEI standard, "P1"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahronheim|first=J.R.|title=Descriptive metadata: Emerging standards.|journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship|year=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantara |first=L.|title=The text-encoding initiative: Part 1|journal=OCLC Systems &amp; Services|year=2005|volume=21|issue=1|pages=36–39|doi=10.1108/10650750510578136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1987''' Work on what would become the TEI started by  the  [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ach.org/ ach.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]], and the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Historical background", [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AB.html#ABTEI section iv.2] of TEI P5:  Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange.&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the ''Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/SC/teipcp1.txt |title= Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference |work=tei-c.org |year=2009 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1994''' TEI P3 released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/|title=TEI Guidelines|accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  co-edited by  Lou Burnard (at [[Oxford University]]) and [[Michael Sperberg-McQueen]] (then at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], later at the [[W3C]]).
* '''1999''' TEI P3 updated.
* '''2002''' TEI P4 released, moving from SGML to XML; adoption of [[Unicode]], which XML parsers are required to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=XML Basics|chapter=2|url=http://www.xmlnews.org/docs/xml-basics.html |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2007''' TEI P5 released, including integration with the &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xml:id&lt;/code&gt; attributes from the W3C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)|work=w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (these had previously been attributes in the TEI namespace), regularization of local pointing attributes to use the hash (as used in HTML) and unification of the ptr and xptr tags. Together these changes with many more new additions make P5 more regular and bring it closer to current xml practice as promoted by the [[W3C]] and as used by other XML variants. Maintenance and feature update versions of TEI P5 have been released at least twice a year since 2007.
* '''2011''' TEI P5 v2.0.1 released with support for [[Genetic editing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-2.0.1.html |title=P5 version 2.0.1 release notes |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (among many other additions the [[Genetic editing]] features allow encoding of texts without interpretation as to their specific semantics.)

TAMER}}&lt;/ref&gt; where P is a possibly empty and Q is a non-empty conjunction of relational atoms. A relational atom has the form R(w1, ..., wh) where each of the w, ..., wh, wi, wj, are variables or constants. An algorithm known as [[Chase (algorithm)|the chase]] takes as input an instance that may or may not satisfy a set of TGDs (or more generally EDs), and, if it terminates (which is a priori undecidable), outputs an instance that does satisfy the TGDs.

A '''''Vorlage''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfoːɐ̯laːɡə|}}; from the [[German language|German]] for ''prototype'' or ''template'') is a prior version or manifestation of a text under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online: vorlage, n.
Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. &lt;[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679 http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679]&gt;; accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular [[manuscript]] of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Jonathan D. H., ''Contours in the Text'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a [[translation]] is called the ''Vorlage'' of that translation.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman &amp; Kuhlken, ''What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter?'' (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Luther Bible]] is a translation of the [[Textus Receptus]]. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the ''Vorlage'' of the Luther Bible.  

Sometimes the ''Vorlage'' of a translation may be lost to history.  In some of these cases the ''Vorlage'' may be reconstructed from the translation.  Such a reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may be called a ''retroversion'', and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, the ''Vorlage'' may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of [[textual criticism]].  This reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.  Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed ''Vorlage'' of the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] at parts to correct the Hebrew [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.&lt;ref&gt;Albrektson, B., "Masoretic or Mixed" in ''Text, Translation, Theology'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as another example, the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] fragments of Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] included among the [[Nag Hammadi library]] are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Slings, S. R., ''Platonis Rempublicam'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the bulk of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the ''Vorlage'' exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.&lt;ref&gt;Plisch, Uwe-Karsten ''Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar''. (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, women in the [[United States]] have been represented at lower rates than men in both [[science]] and [[engineering]] [[college]] programs and careers.  Over time, this pattern has led to a significantly higher concentration of male professional engineers compared to women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Rossi, Alice 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Polacheck, Soloman 1978&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, this disparity has led to careers in [[Education]], [[History]], [[English language|English]], [[Humanities]] and the like to be seen as “feminine” careers and areas of study.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; Some Feminist theorists suggest that these social and historical factors have perpetuated women’s low participation rates in engineering over time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; Numerous explanations and points of view have been offered to explain women's participation rates in this field. These explanations include beliefs regarding women's lack of interest in science and engineering, their physiological inability to succeed as engineers, and environmental factors in women's [[childhood]]s that discourage them from entering science and engineering fields.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;

Negative perceptions of female engineers may play a role in explaining their low numbers within the field.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Graham, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent statistics, college-educated women are less than half as likely as men to be employed in science and engineering jobs.

Two forms of [[activism]] tasked with raising awareness include both organizations on college campuses and those geared towards society at large.

==History==

In the early 1960s, a President’s Commission on the Status of Women emphasized the need for women to fill a shortage of jobs in [[teaching]], science, and engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; In 1960, however, less than 1% of recorded engineers were women. Furthermore, female engineers that were employed were less likely to have obtained advanced degrees in their field than men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; Research has shown that these trends were reflective of both men's and women's dominant opinions regarding women's role in the workforce throughout this period. At the time, both groups largely emphasized women’s roles as traditional homemakers and mothers rather than as serious scientists or engineers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pendleton, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite changing political views towards women and minorities during the [[civil rights movement]], college women’s enrollment rates into engineering were still relatively low when compared to men's.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; For example, in a study of over 440 college campuses nationwide throughout 1971-72, approximately 17% of polled Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors were women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Montinelli, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the fact that, throughout this period, there was little recorded formal discrimination in the American educational system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Cole, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Women who actually applied to engineering programs were enrolled at similar rates to men. Early increases in these numbers did occur, though, throughout 1968-78. During this period, there was an estimated 100% increase in the number of female science and engineering majors throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated11/&gt; However, it was also estimated that they still accounted for less than 4.9% of such majors throughout this period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11/&gt;

Despite women’s increasing numbers in science and engineering fields, [[affirmative action]] and similar efforts were implemented throughout the U.S. to increase STEM enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Cummings,1970&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed, among other factors, that early socialization by elementary schools and social stereotyping was to blame for this issue.  In the mid 1980s, a shortage of qualified engineers was predicted by the year 2000, further instigating efforts to both recruit and retain women in these fields.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Freckman, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  Existing groups that promote women in engineering: ASCE Task force Committee on Women in Civil Engineering, Extraordinary Women Engineers Project Coalition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dKptTDl6eUcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=changing+our+world++hatch&amp;ots=bwbqjKQJTG&amp;sig=KktAZNNjtdSF8EqIbchgJKGNvM8|title=Changing Our World: True Stories of Women Engineers|last=Hatch|first=Sybil E.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=9780784408353|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics and relevant data==
[[File:Percentage of Engineering Bachelor’s Degrees Awarded to Women by School.png|right|300px|Percentage of Engineering Bachelor’sDegrees Awarded to Womenby School]]
According to the [[National Science Foundation]], overall, women have higher college graduation rates compared to men. However, men disproportionately outnumber women in the number of Science and Engineering (STEM) degrees received.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;National Science Foundation, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1989 and 2008, the approximate percentages of women receiving their [[Bachelor’s degree]] in any engineering field were 17% and 19.6%, respectively. The percentage increase in the computer science industry displayed was larger, increasing from approximately 10% in 1989 to 21% in 2008.

Concerning [[ethnic group|minority]] ([[African American]], [[Hispanic]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]) women, the percentages of engineering bachelor’s recipients increased from approximately 7% in 1989 to 12% in 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14/&gt; The percentages of minority  women with engineering [[doctoral degrees]] were much lower, however, barely increasing from 1% throughout this period. [[Southeast Asians|Asian]] women actually accounted for a lower rate of engineering bachelor's degree during this time period, from approximately 2.5% to 5%. PhD  recipient rates from 1989 to 2008 were nearly identical to minority women’s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14/&gt;

According to the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] in 2004, there were approximately 192,900 female engineers throughout the country, compared with over 1,515,000 men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;National Society of Professional Engineers, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Of these women, approximately 1/3 of them were [[software engineers]] (62,900). Women were also employed in higher rates than men in [[environmental engineering]] (9% to 4%) and [[chemical engineering]] (7% to 4%). However, they were less likely than men to be employed in [[mechanical engineering]] (8% to 17%) and [[electrical engineering]] (12% to 18%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated15/&gt;

In 1999, women made up approximately one quarter of all engineers under the age of 25, whereas they constituted one-twentieth of those over age 49. This age discrepancy has been attributed to women's notable, but recent, movement into engineering within the past few decades.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15/&gt; According to the Society of Women Engineers, women and other minorities constituted approximately 16%-17% of engineering graduate students from 1990-2003. Furthermore, in 2003 approximately 20% (approximately 12,000)of new engineers were women, compared with about 80% of men (approximately 49,000).&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;Society of Women Engineers, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations for low participation rates==

Numerous explanations have come forth to account for the lack of women engineering majors in college. Historically, women have both majored and remained in college engineering programs at lower rates than men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26&gt;Corell, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons used to explain this trend has been a supposed overemphasis on the traditional "male breadwinner" household model when it comes to organizing families today.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Although the percentage of families organized according to this model has declined considerably in recent decades, many individuals, including women, still see adult men as the primary [[wage]] earners in households where men were present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27&gt;Seymore, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Even if this is the case women represent close to  60% of university graduates, including biology mayors. [https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=72 IES:  What is the percentage of degrees conferred by race and sex?]

Recently, greater emphasis has been given to women’s socialization throughout their childhoods and [[adolescence]]s. Socialized early in their childhoods, girls are said to be raised in societies where science, engineering, and mathematics are largely promoted as “male [[professions]]”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt; The [[media (communication)|media]] has also been criticized for giving little representation of prominent female engineers.  Instead, some scholars feel the media is guilty of perpetuating [[gender stereotype]]s by representing women in traditionally “female occupations” such as [[nurses]], school teachers, [[housewives]], etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has suggested that subjects such as Engineering may be less popular among women because they do not accommodate some of their typical interests: caring for/interaction with living beings may be one example. This is not necessarily to suggest, with [[Lawrence Summers]], that women are incapable, or less fundamentally capable than men at Engineering, but rather that they tend to be less interested in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6usiN4uoA&amp;list=PLytTJqkSQqtr7BqC1Jf4nv3g2yDfu7Xmd&amp;index=19&lt;/ref&gt; The principle strength of this argument is that it explains the phenomenon without drawing tenuous links with difficult-to-measure influences such as 'culture' and 'role-models', but it is also to some degree reinforced by academic consensus, which was identified in the 'Social and Political views of American Professors' paper as 75% in favor of the claim that differing interests between men and women caused the disparity, rather than discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.147.6141&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[role model]]s, and especially female role models, has also been emphasized as a means of increasing women’s numbers in engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"&gt;Seymore, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Women with one or two engineering parents are said to be moderately more likely to major in such a field themselves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Additionally, encouragement from teachers, [[school counselor|counselor]]s, [[Academic administration|administrator]]s, etc. are all said to positively impact women's chances at moving into engineering. Better high school preparation in mathematics, [[biology]], and [[chemistry]] were also said to better women's chances for an engineering career. However, according to some scholars, the above factors do not occur in a great enough number to compensate for women's current disadvantages.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated28/&gt; Thus, generally speaking, it is said that hopeful women engineers will remain largely [[discriminate]]d against and have inadequate resources at improving their outlook unless substantial [[social change]]s are made.

==Socialization and societal outcomes==

===Educational outcomes===
It has been suggested that, due to the social and environmental factors described above, [[high school]] and college women tend to have lower [[confidence]] levels in their mathematical ability compared to men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt; Shelley Correll's observations using the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS) revealed that, on average, women who positively assessed their math ability before testing had a higher average score than women who did not rate themselves well. Moreover, [[longitudinal studies]] on both sets of women also revealed that the ones who did rate themselves highly were more likely to subsequently enroll in college-level [[calculus]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt;

Goldman later discovered that positive [[math]] assessments played an important role in women's choices to enroll in engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt; However, other studies have before and since emphasized women’s early life experiences in shaping their career aspirations. Feeling they are not skilled enough to successfully complete an engineering program or other advanced mathematical and/or science courses, some women perform poorly and thus complete a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt; If at all, differences in men’s and women’s innate spatial memories were reported to account for about a 2:1 ratio of male-female engineers. Instead, in the U.S [[labor force]], there is approximately less than 1 female engineer for every 10 males.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&amp;#x5D;&lt;/sup&gt; According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2011, 13.6% of those employed in Architecture and engineering occupations were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-databook-2012.pdf|title=Women in the Labor Force: A Databook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have also shown that a lack of pre-degree training in high school did not sufficiently explain women engineer's [[dropping out|dropout]] rates later in college.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Analyses of males' and females' grades revealed that, on average, women who had dropped out of engineering programs were either approximately as qualified or even more qualified than their male peers who continued their studies. Additionally, surveyed female dropouts revealed that very few (approximately 9.8% to 11.5%) actually dropped out because they viewed the work as too difficult.&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated28/&gt; Among their primary reasons for dropping were: loss of interest in the field, the inability to see themselves as professional engineers, inappropriate behavior from male [[peer group|peer]]s, and the highly pressured environment professional engineers worked under.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; A phenomenon called "[[stereotype threat]]" may also help explain women's educational outcomes. Because of existing stereotypes regarding women's ability to excel in mathematics-intensive coursework, they are sometimes said to perform worse than they originally would have had the stereotypes not existed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated34&gt;Ceci and Williams, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace outcomes===

According to Hersch, a significant number of [[corporation]]s have increased the number of women engineers hired in the past couple of decades in response to [[political]] and social pressures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30&gt;Hersh, Marion 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their engineering expertise, women engineers are said to bring unique [[ethics of care|caring]] and non-technical problem solving skills along with an enlarged customer support base. Typically preceding these management changes were other policy shifts such as: 1) a company move from heavy to light [[manufacturing]]; 2) a greater emphasis on service and professional jobs; 3) improved working conditions, and 4) a general improvement of women’s status on the job.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated31&gt;Preston, Anne 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, however, engineering is said to remain a highly gender-stratified occupation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated16/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt; Among the engineers currently employed, men substantially outnumber women. On average, men are also said to hold higher supervisory and [[management]] positions than females, whose [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] prospects are usually more limited.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated32&gt;Devine, Fiona 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This reason, family and child obligations, and [[layoff]]s combined to account for a drop-out rate of approximately 20% among all female engineers from 1982-1990—a statistic over twice of that of men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;

It has been suggested by Crompton and Sanderson that discrimination in high-level technical jobs is actually ''decreasing'' on the whole.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;  Moreover, they suggest that [[equal opportunity|equal-opportunities]] legislation ensures that men and women with appropriate [[human capital]] are treated equally in recruitment chances. Direct and indirect forms of exclusion were no longer said to be significant in sustaining gender segregation in engineering positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt; Statistically, [[gender pay gap]]s in engineering are actually lower than the national average. In STEM jobs, female wages are approximately 84% of men’s, compared to 71% in non-STEM jobs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated12/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt; Moreover, it has also been stated that traditionally stereotypical images of engineering as “dirty”, “rugged”, or “manly” jobs are gradually being eroded—opening employment opportunities for prospective women nationwide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated23/&gt;

However, recent evidence suggests that gender discrimination is still a significant issue affecting women’s confidence and performance in STEM careers. According to Logel, interacting with [[sexist]] men may trigger a stressed-induced phenomenon called “social identity threat” in women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33&gt;Logel, Christine 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Women engineers who faced regular exposure to sexist men on the job were said perform worse on aptitude tests than women who weren’t exposed to such individuals. While women who worked in low-[[stress (psychological)|stress]] environments reported higher levels of confidence and [[self-actualization|self-fulfillment]], discriminated women were reportedly more likely to suppress their feelings and/or let their problems go unannounced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33/&gt; Such behavior is said to be detrimental to both the women engineers themselves and the workplace, where sexist behavior is likely to persist.

==Initiatives to promote engineering to women==

As science and engineering have become more pervasive in [[society]], women's participation rates in these fields have not seen a proportionate increase.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;Cuny and Aspray, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cuny and Aspray, this may potentially result in a lack of women's [[aptitude|talent]] in the fields, which may further reduce employment opportunities for both employer and employee &lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; In order to make engineering more appealing to young women, a broader acceptance criteria into such programs has been proposed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; Specifically, admissions boards are encouraged to take other admissions factors into account such as: [[extracurricular]] accomplishments, applicants' desire to be admitted into the program, and [[communication skills]]. Additionally, it has been strongly suggested that admissions boards prioritize ethnic diversity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated19&gt;Milgrim, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has revealed that [[high school]]- and college-age women commonly see the STEM environment as a "chilly, male-dominated" environment that is highly impersonal and unsympathetic to women's unique needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22&gt;Vrcelj and Krishnan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated21&gt;Morganson and Jones, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated23&gt;Bona and Kelly, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Social [[coping (psychology)|coping]]" has thus been a mechanism which has been cited to help women deal with the challenges and [[stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with engineering's rigorous coursework and careers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt; [[Multiple regression]] analysis has revealed that high levels of social coping were a stronger predictor of commitment to staying in engineering studies for women than men. Put more simply, women who used social coping were less likely than men (who were actually found to be ''more'' likely) to drop out of college engineering programs. Consequently, school [[teacher]]s, staff, parents, and other figures have been encouraged to provide a more accommodating environment for social coping.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated19/&gt;

An increase in influential female role models has also been cited as a way to increase women's engineering enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23/&gt; [[Survey methodology|survey]]s collected among 141 female engineering students across the country have shown that many women who placed high confidence levels in their math and science ability also had parents who modeled less traditional [[gender roles]]. Thus, to increase women's enrollment and retention rates in engineering, scholars have suggested that a de-emphasis away from the highly popularized "[[nuclear family]]" model is crucial.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated25&gt;Haines and Wallace,2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24&gt;Goldman and Hewitt, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) was established in May 27, 1950&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by [[Elsie Eaves]] as a non-profit educational and service organization that attempted both to raise awareness of female engineers and increase their enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16/&gt; SWE held their first meeting with 50 engineers at Cooper Union in NJ.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With membership now exceeding 17,000 members in over 300 student organizations across the United States, the SWE's principal aims are to inform female students about opportunities in the field of engineering and to encourage female engineers to attain high levels of achievement.

==Notable American women engineers (in alphabetical order)==

Historically and presently, in many parts of the world, women's participation in the profession of medicine (as [[physician]]s or [[surgeons]] for instance) has been significantly restricted. However, women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers or as [[allied health professions|allied health professionals]] has been widespread. Most countries of the world now provide women with equal access to [[medical education]]. However, not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;See generally, "Women's Human Rights", 1998, [[Human Rights Watch]] (available [https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/women/women3.html online]).&lt;/ref&gt; and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical [[Specialty (medicine)|specialties]] and around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichenbach|first=Laura|last2=Brown|first2=Hilary|date=2004-10-02|title=Gender and academic medicine: impacts on the health workforce|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=329|issue=7469|pages=792–795|issn=0959-8138|pmid=15459056|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7469.792|pmc=521007}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite studies suggesting that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsugawa|first=Yusuke|last2=Jena|first2=Anupam B.|last3=Figueroa|first3=Jose F.|last4=Orav|first4=E.

They continued to practice without formal training or recognition in England and eventually North America for the next several centuries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The History of Women in Surgery, by Debrah A. Wirtzfeld, MD&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's participation in the medical professions was generally limited by legal and social practices during the decades while medicine was [[professionalization|professionalizing]].&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches"&gt;See generally [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] &amp; [[Deirdre English]], ''Witches, Midwives, and Nurses'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However, women openly practiced medicine in the [[allied health professions]] ([[nursing]], [[midwifery]], etc.), and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women made significant gains in access to [[medical education]] and medical work through much of the world. These gains were sometimes tempered by setbacks; for instance, [[Mary Roth Walsh]] documented a ''decline'' in women physicians in the US in the first half of the twentieth century, such that there were fewer women physicians in 1950 than there were in 1900.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977"&gt;Walsh, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, through the latter half of the twentieth century, women made gains generally across the board. In the United States, for instance, women were 9% of total US medical school enrollment in 1969; this had increased to 20% in 1976.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977" /&gt;  By 1985, women constituted 16% of practicing US physicians.&lt;ref name="Morantz-Sanchez-2001-preface"&gt;Morantz-Sanchez, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the twenty-first century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession.  Women have achieved parity in medical school in some industrialized countries, since 2003 forming the majority of the United States medical student body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/pressrel/2003/031104.htm "Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools Increase; Women the Majority for the First Time"],  [[Association of American Medical Colleges]], Nov. 3, 2003, press release ("Women made up the majority of medical school applicants for the first time ever").&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007-2008, women accounted for 49% of medical school applicants and 48.3% of those accepted.&lt;ref name="aamc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aamc.org/download/153708/data/ |format=PDF |title=U.S. Medical School Applicants and Students 1982-1983 to 2011-2012 |work=aamc.org |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;!--dead link: http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/charts1982to2007.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) 48.3% (16,838) of medical degrees awarded in the US in 2009-10 were earned by women, an increase from 26.8% in 1982-3.&lt;ref name="aamc" /&gt; While more women are taking part in the medical field, a 2013-2014 study reported that there are significantly fewer women in leadership positions within the academic realm of medicine. This study found that women accounted for 16% of deans, 21% of the professors, and 38% of faculty, as compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rebecca M. "Gender Inequality in Medicine: Too Much Evidence to Ignore." Psychiatric Times, vol. 34, no. 5, September 2017, pp. 1–5., http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/early-career-psychiatry/gender-inequality-medicine-too-much-evidence-ignore&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice of medicine remains disproportionately male overall. In industrialized nations, the recent parity in gender of medical students has not yet trickled into parity in practice. In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity.

Moreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated,&lt;ref&gt;Dixie Mills, "Women in Surgery - Past, Present, and Future" (2003 presentation), [[Association of Women Surgeons]]; available at [http://www.womensurgeons.org/about/items/womeninsurgery2003c.ppt AWS website].&lt;/ref&gt; while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so. In the United States, female physicians outnumber male physicians in pediatrics and female residents outnumber male residents in family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16229.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102101755/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/16229.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 November 2007 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 16 - Physician Specialties by Gender- 2006 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12915.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022162222/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/12915.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 October 2004 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 4 - Women Residents by Specialty - 2005 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to dominate in nursing. In 2000, 94.6% of registered nurses in the United States were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030212144558/http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archivedate=2003-02-12 |deadurl=yes |title=The Registered Nurse Population |date=March 2000 |work=bhpr.hrsa.gov |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In health care professions as a whole in the US, women numbered approximately 14.8 million, as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the "leaky pipeline" by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, [[postdoc]], faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work.&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined by S.E. Berryman in "Who Will Do Science?", 1983; see Louise Luckenbill-Edds, [http://www.ascb.org/index.cfm?id=1584&amp;navid=112&amp;tcode=nws3 "2000 WICB / Career Strategy Columns (Archive)"], Nov. 1, 2000, WICB Newsletter, ''American Society for Cell Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

=== Glass ceiling ===
The [[glass ceiling]] is used as a metaphor to convey the undefined obstacles that women and minorities face in the workplace.

One study surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career. This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s. The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"&gt;Shrier, Diane K.; Zucker, Alyssa N.; Mercurio, Andrea E.; Landry, Laura J.; Rich, Michael; Shrier, Lydia A. (2007). "Generation to Generation: Discrimination and Harassment Experiences of Physician Mothers and Their Physician Daughters".&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Women's Health''.&amp;nbsp;'''16'''&amp;nbsp;(6): 1–13.&amp;nbsp;{{doi|10.1089/jwh.2006.0127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to this study, one third of physician daughters reported experiencing a form of gender discrimination in medical school, field training, and the work environment. This study also stated that both generations equally experienced gender discrimination within their work environments.

This article provided an overview on the history of gender discrimination, claiming that gender initiated the systematic exclusion of women from medical schools. This was the case until 1970, when the National Organization for Women (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States. &amp;nbsp;More specifically, this lawsuit was successful in forcing medical schools to comply to the civil rights legislation. This success was seen by 1975 when the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and continued to grow as the years progressed. By 2005, over 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Within this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their [[Intersectionality|race and gender]].&amp;nbsp;

In an article titled "I'm too used to it”: A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education," the author described how confidence in ability varies based upon gender. According to this article, females tend to have lessened confidence in their abilities as a doctor, yet their performance is equivalent to that of their male counterparts. This study also commented on the impact of power dynamics within medical school, which is established as a hierarchy that ultimately shapes the educational experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Specifically, this article described how power dynamics led to the formation of a “hidden curriculum” in medical school, which revolves around understanding the contribution of gender roles in regards to being a female doctor. According to this article, this position holds females more accountable for their actions as a result of unrealistic expectations set forth by these gender roles, which expects female doctors to take on a nurturing and matronly persona when dealing with patients. The hidden curriculum, according to this article, is an integral aspect of a female's medical education that must be learned in order to tolerate instances of gender discrimination.

On the topic of power dynamics, another study commented on the nature of sexual harassment, stating that it was most commonly perpetrated within career training stages, by people in positions of power. According to this article, instances of sexual harassment attribute to the high attrition rates of females in the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clancy K. H., Nelson R.

Another study describes sexual harassment as a growing problem due to the fact that it goes widely underreported, which is said to be caused by the transient nature of career training, alongside weak policies and the perpetrators holding positions of power over the victim.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babaria|first=Palav|last2=Abedin|first2=Sakena|last3=Berg|first3=David|last4=Nunez-Smith|first4=Marcella|date=2012-04-01|title="I'm too used to it": A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612000780|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1013–1020|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Contributions to Medicine in the United States==

Women have successfully provided the world with information not previously known. A few women who provided knowledge were:
 
'''Helen Brooke Taussig:''' ''The First Female President of the American Heart Association''

[[Helen B. Taussig|Helen Brooke Taussig]] was born on May 24, 1898, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. She is most commonly known as the first female president of the American Heart Association&lt;ref name=TaussigEB&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Helen-Brooke-Taussig|title=Helen Brooke Taussig {{!}} American physician|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taussig was diagnosed with [[Dyslexia]] when she was young. Around the same time, her mother, Edith Guild Taussig (1861-1909) died.&lt;ref name=TaussigEB/&gt; Her father, [[Frank William Taussig]] (1859-1940), was an economist and educator in the United States. He was also known for creating the "Foundation of Modern [[International trade|Trade Theory"]].  Taussig earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B]] from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1921. In 1922 she applied at [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard University's Medical School]], and was denied. The University was not accepting women at the time. Instead she graduated from [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] in 1927. In her 30s, Taussig grew deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/013500/013565/html/13565bio.html|title=Helen Brooke Taussig|last=Morton|first=Lauren|date=2005|website=Archives of Maryland|archive-url=|archive-date=December 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Taussig was appointed the Head of he Children's Hear Clinic at the Harriet Lane home, which was part of Johns Hopkins University. Due to her inability to hear, Taussig found an alternative method to studying the heartbeat in children by feeling the beat with her hands. This method lead her to discover [[Blue baby syndrome|"Blue Baby Syndrome]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Alfred|date=1945-05-19|title=THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF MALFORMATIONS OF THE HEART|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|language=en|volume=128|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|issn=0002-9955|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was termed so due to the cyanotic hue resembling babies who were thought to be ill. In 1947, a surgeon named [[Alfred Blalock]] teamed up with Taussig and wrote an article called,&lt;ref&gt;"Congenital Malformations of the Heart",&lt;/ref&gt; which explored their creation and alternative approach for a stunt-"[[Blalock–Taussig shunt|Blalock-Taussig Shunt]]"- that would help circulate blood from the lungs to the heart. In the article it states, "The operation here reported and the studies leading thereto were undertaken with the conviction that even though the structure of the heart was grossly abnormal, in many instances it might be possible to alter the course of the circulation in such a manner as to lessen the 'cyanosis' and the resultant disability." (Read before the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] Medical Society, March 12, 1945.) Taussig received multiple awards after 1950. In 1954, Taussig received the Albert Lasker award, which is awarded for outstanding contributions to medicine. In 1959, Taussig was acknowledged for being one of the first women who received full professorship to Johns Hopkins University. In 1964, Taussig was awarded the [[Medal of Freedom|medal of freedom]] from President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Finally, in 1965, Taussig was known as the first women of the [[American Heart Association]], for which she is so prominently known for. To further her interest in pediatrics, nearly a decade and a half later in the 1960s, Taussig remained to advocate for children's&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; health. She was "responsible for investigating the epidemic of serious congenital limb malformations". This investigation focused on European children and Taussig had a theory that the malformations were caused by the use of [[Thalidomide]]. She resolved this ongoing issue by persuading the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to discontinue the use and sale of Thalidomide in the U.S

'''Helen Flanders Dunbar:''' ''The "Mother" of Holistic Medicine''

[[Helen Flanders Dunbar]] was born in [[Chicago]] on May 14, 1902, and Dunbar was the oldest child. Dunbar's mother, Edith Vaughn Flanders (1871-1963), was an Episcopalian clergyman's daughter as well as a professional [[Genealogy|Genealogist]]. Dunbar's father, Francis William Dunbar (1868-1939), was very much established as well due to his standing as an electrical engineer, as well as a patent attorney. In her early life, Dunbar's education was strictly limited to tutors and attending private schools. She graduated from [[Brearley School]], which was located in [[New York City]], in 1919, which lead to her enrollment in [[Bryn Mawr College]]. At this particular point in her life her interest in [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and medicine. Dunbar met [[James H. Leuba|James Henry Leuba]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]], which sparked her interest due to his standing as a psychologist of religion at the college. In the summer of 1929, after successfully receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics and psychology from [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], Dunbar continued her education by spending five weeks in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts receiving clinical training. In 1927, Dunbar received a [[bachelor's degree]] as [[Latin honors|"Magna Cum Laude]]" from Union Theological Seminar. This achievement was awarded primarily due to her thesis, "Methods Training in the Devotional Life Emphasized in the American Churches".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Dunbar also won a travelling Fellowship due to this particular piece of writing. From 1931 until 1936, Dunbar held the position as director of Joint Committee of the [[New York City]] Religion and Health of the Federal Council and Churches of the Academy of Medicine. From 1943 until the year before she died, Dunbar wrote an assortment of books including: [http://www.womeninmedicinemagazine.com/profile-of-women-in-medicine/helen-flanders-dunbar-pioneer-in-psychosomatic-medicine "Psychosomatic Diagnosis]" in 1943, "Mind, Body: Psychosomatic Medicine"&lt;ref name=Dunbar&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/helen-flanders-dunbar/|title=Helen Flanders Dunbar|last=Young|first=Tracy L.|date=2010|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|archive-url=|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947, "Your Child's Mind and Body; A practical guide for parents" in 1949, and "Illness: the realization of an infant's fantasy with special reference to testing methods" in 1951. During the year of her death, Dunbar wrote "Accidents of Life Experience", "Basic aspects and applications of the psychology of safety", and "Psychiatry in medicine specialties".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Helen Flanders Dunbar died in 1959.

==Midwifery in 18th Century America==
As per the documentary “A Midwife’s Tale”, historian of 18th century America, [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]], follows the diary of [[Martha Ballard]], which proves to be a telling source of women's roles as medical practitioners. Out of the different occupations women took on around this time, [[midwifery]] was the best paid of them all.&lt;ref name="Ulrich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ulrich|first1=Laurel Thatcher|title=A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812|date=1990|publisher=Knopf|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[18th century]], households tended to have an abundance of children largely in part to have a helping hand in responsibilities and to combat high mortality rates.&lt;ref name="McMillen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillen|first1=Sally Gregory|title=Motherhood in the Old South: Pregnancy, Childbirth and Infant Rearing|date=1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high chance of complications in labor, Martha Ballard, specifically, had high success rates in delivering healthy babies to healthy mothers.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt;

==Competition Between Midwifery and Obstetrics==
A shift from women midwifery to male obstetrics occurs in the growth of medical practices such as the founding of the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="Feldhusen" /&gt; Instead of assisting labor in the basis of an emergency, there were doctors such as Dr. Benjamin Page who wanted to take over the delivery of babies completely; putting midwifery second.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt; This is an example of the growing sense of competition between male physicians and female midwives as a rise in obstetrics took hold. The education of women on the basis of midwifery was stunted by both physicians and public-health reformers, driving midwifery to be seen as out of practice.&lt;ref name="Brodsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Phyllis L|title=Where have all the midwives gone?|journal=Journal of Perinatal Education|date=2008|volume=17|issue=4|doi=10.1624/105812408X324912|pmid=19436438|pmc=2582410|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Societal roles also played a fact in the downfall of the practice in midwifery because women were unable to obtain the education needed for licensing and once married, women were to embrace a domestic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Feldhusen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://midwiferytoday.com/web-article/history-midwifery-childbirth-america-time-line/|last1=Feldhusen|first1=Adrian E|title=The History of Midwifery and Childbirth in America: A Time Line|website=Midwifery Today|publisher=Midwifery Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient medicine===
The involvement of women in the field of [[medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] or [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Merit-Ptah]], described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest woman named in the [[history of science]]. [[Agamede]] was cited by [[Homer]] as a healer in [[ancient Greece]] before the [[Trojan War]]. [[Agnodice]] was the first female [[physician]] to practice legally in 4th century BC [[Athens]].  [[Metrodora]] was a physician and generally regarded as the first [[medical writing|medical writer]]. Her book, ''On the Diseases and Cures of Women'', was the oldest medical book written by a female and was often referenced by many other female physicians. She credited much of her writings to the ideologies of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Influential Women In Medicine: From The Past To The Present|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-influential-women-medicine-past-present-270560|website=Medical Daily|accessdate=24 September 2017|language=en|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly [[research]]. An example is the [[Germans|German]] [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]], whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including [[medicine]], [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c.1151-58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |title=Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) |author=Sabina Flanagan |publisher=University of Adelaide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406172530/http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |archivedate=2005-04-06 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered Germany's first female [[physician]].&lt;ref name=hildegard&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Hildegard von Bingen | encyclopedia = Key Figures in Medieval Europe - An Encyclopedia | editor = Richard K.

Women in the Middle Ages participated in many healing techniques and capacities. According to historical documents, small numbers of women occupied almost all ranks of medical personnel during the period.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs|date=1989|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|jstor=3174557}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked as [[herbalists]], [[midwives]], [[surgeons]], [[barber-surgeons]], nurses, and traditional [[empirics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=William L.|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=1992|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–295|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288|pmid=1739168|pmc=1694293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women treated everyone, not only women as historians once thought. The names of 24 women described as surgeons in Naples between 1273 and 1410 are known, and references have been found to 15 women practitioners, most of them Jewish and none described as midwives, in Frankfurt between 1387 and 1497.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siraisi|first1=Nancy G.|title=Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine: An Introduction to Knowledge and Practice|date=2009-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-76131-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women also engaged in midwifery and healing arts without leaving any trace of their activities in written records, and practiced in rural areas or where there was little access to medical care.
Society in the Middle Ages limited women's role as physician. Once universities established faculties of medicine during the thirteenth century, women were excluded from advanced medical education.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Licensure began to require clerical vows for which women were ineligible, and healing as a profession became male dominated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In many occasions, women had to fight against accusation of illegal practice done by males, putting into question their real motives. If they were not accused of malpractice, then women were considered "witches" by both clerical and civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=WL|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history|date=1992|journal=Am J Public Health|pmc=1694293|pmid=1739168|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–95|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because surgeons and barber-surgeons were often organized into guilds, they could hold out longer against the pressures of licensure. Like other guilds, a number of the barber-surgeon guilds allowed the daughters and wives of their members to take up membership in the guild, generally after the man's death. According to documents, Katherine la surgiene of London, daughter of Thomas the surgeon and sister of William the Surgeon belonged to a guild in 1286.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rawcliffe|first1=Carole|title=Medicine and Society in Later Medieval England|date=1997|publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0-7509-1497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation of female members in the guilds of Lincoln, Norwich, Dublin and York continue until late in the period. Midwives, those who assisted pregnant women through childbirth and some aftercare, included only women. Midwives constituted roughly one third of female medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Men did not involve themselves in women's medical care, likewise, women did not involve themselves in men's health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|jstor=3174557|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The southern [[Italy|Italian]] coastal town of Salerno was an important center of medical learning and practice in the 12th century.  There, the physician [[Trota of Salerno]] gathered a number of her medical practices in several written collections.  One work on women's medicine that was associated with her, the ''De curis mulierum'' ("On Treatments for Women") formed the core of what came to be known as the ''[[Trotula]]'' ensemble, a compendium of three texts that circulated throughout medieval Europe.  Trota herself gained a reputation that spread as far as France and England.  There are also references in the writings of other Salernitan physicians to the ''mulieres Salernitane'' ("Salernitan women"), which give some idea of local empirical practices.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The 'Trotula': A Medieval Compendium of Women’s Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorotea Bucca]] was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite journal| author= JS Edwards |title= A Woman Is Wise: The Influence of Civic and Christian Humanism on the Education of Women in Northern Italy and England during the Renaissance |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume =XI | year=2002 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~epf/2002/edwards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RoqNOWuNa8oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22dorotea+bucca%22 Howard S.

===Medieval Islamic world===
For the medieval Islamic world, little specific information is known about female medical practitioners although it is likely that women were regularly involved in medical practice in some capacity.  Male medical writers refer to the presence of female practitioners (singular, ''ṭabība'') in describing certain procedures or situations.  For example, the late 10th/early 11th century Andalusi physician and surgeon [[al-Zahrawi]], in explaining how to excise bladder stones, notes that the procedure is difficult for male doctors practicing on female patients: because of the need to touch the genitalia, the male practitioner must either find a female doctor who can perform the procedure, or a eunuch physician, or a midwife who takes instruction from the male surgeon.  In other words, even though direct evidence for female practitioners is rare, their existence can be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, "History of Science," ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures''.  Volume I: ''Methodologies, Paradigms and Sources'', Suad Joseph, general editor (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2003), pp. 358-61; Peter Pormann, "Female Patients and Practitioners in Medieval Islam," ''The Lancet'' 373 (May 9, 2009), pp. 1598-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As al-Zahrawi's example also suggests, midwives played an important role in the delivery of women's healthcare.  For these practitioners, there is more detailed information, both in terms of the prestige of their craft ([[ibn Khaldun]] calls it a noble craft, "something necessary in civilization") and in terms of biographical information on historic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giladi Avner | year = 2010 | title = Liminal Craft, Exceptional Law:  Preliminary Notes on Midwives in Medieval Islamic Writings | url = | journal = International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 185–202 | doi=10.1017/s0020743810000012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Molénat, "Priviligiées ou poursuivies: quatre sages-femmes musulmanes dans la Castille du XVe siècle," ''Identidades marginales'', ed.

===Western medicine in China===
[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] based on the use of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Traditional Chinese massage|massage]] and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years.  However, Western Medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church]] (US). [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816-1873), a medical missionary sent by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifeng.com/article/46027.html |title=回眸：当年传教士进羊城_MW悦读室之岭南话廊_凤凰博报- 博采众家之言 报闻公民心声-凤凰网 |publisher=Blog.ifeng.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |title=合信的《全体新论》与广东士林-《广东史志》1999年01期-中国知网 |publisher=Mall.cnki.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Guangzhou, China. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]] (孫中山).  Sun later led the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], which changed China from an empire to a republic. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which started in 1911.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, women of China were reluctant to be treated by Western male doctors. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors. One of these was [[Sigourney Trask]] of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who set-up a hospital in [[Fuzhou]] during the mid-19th century. Trask also arranged for a local girl, [[Hü King Eng]], to study medicine at [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], with the intention that Hü would return to practise western medicine in Fuzhou. After graduation, Hü became the resident physician at Fuzhou's [[Woolston Memorial Hospital]] in 1899 and trained several female physicians.&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite book | title=Notable Women of Modern China | last1=Burton | first1=Margaret E. | author-link=Margaret E.

===Women's health movement in the 1970s===
The 1970s marked a great increase of women entering and graduating from [[medical school]]{{where|date=August 2015}}. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, about 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi, Michele A. and Gertrude A. Streuernage, ed., Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1990), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes.

Two laws in the United States lifted restrictions for women in the medical field -- [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the [[Public Health Service Act]] of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the [[women's movement]].

A sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was [[gynecology]]. Wendy Kline &lt;ref&gt;Kline, Wendy. ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave'' (University of Chicago Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; talks about the blurring of "clinical" and "sexual" that occurred in the medical field in the late 40s into the 60s, particularly in gynecology. Kline says that "to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, they [doctors] used the [[pelvic exam]] as a form of sex instruction ."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave,'' p 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ellen Frankfort's book ''Vaginal Politics'', Frankfort talks about the "shame" and "humiliation" felt during a pap test; "I was naked, he was dressed; I was lying down, he was standing up; I was quiet, he was giving orders "&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, Ellen. ''Vaginal Politics'' (New York: Vintage, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

With higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and changed.  One medical student is quoted in Kline's book as saying, "Since I experienced my own exams as a humiliating procedure, I feared inflicting the same humiliation on another person."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination. This method was quite different from the previous practice in which doctors were taught to assert their power over patients. With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

With women entering the medical field and women's rights movements came also the women's health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]: A Book by and for Women''.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Women’s Health Book Collective Staff, ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' (Boston: Simon and Schuster Trade, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This book gave women a "manual" to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctors' practices. Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by [[midwives]], safe [[abortion]] centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies, all with the aim of providing non-judgmental, warm, and comfortable care for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, Bruce J. The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and politics. (Da Capo Press, 2002), 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Kline speaks to this claim women were taking on their body in relation to the medical world; women felt that "not only should women have access to information about their bodies... they should also help to create this knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The women's health movement, along with women involved in the medical field, opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].

While scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—the study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the [[women's movement]] in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the [[women's health movement]].  Two publications in 1973 were critical in establishing the women's health movement and scholarship about women in medicine: First, the publication of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' in 1973 by the Boston Women's Health Collective,&lt;ref&gt;''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; and second, "Witches, Midwives, and Nurses: A History of Female Healers", a short paper by [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]] also in 1973.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches" /&gt; The Ehrenreich/English paper examined the history of women in medicine as the professionalization of the field excluded women, particularly [[midwifery|midwives]], from the practice.  Ehrenreich and English later expanded the work into a full-length book, ''[[For Her Own Good]]'', which connected the exclusion of women from the practice of medicine to [[sexism|sexist]] medical practices; this text and ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' became key texts in the women's health movement. The English/Ehrenreich text laid out some early insights about the professionalization of medicine and the exclusion of women from the profession, and numerous scholars, such as [[Diana Elizabeth Long]], have greatly built upon and expanded this work.
