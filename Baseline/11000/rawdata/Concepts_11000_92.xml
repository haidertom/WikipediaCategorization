'''Abnormality''' (or '''dysfunctional behavior''') is a behavioral characteristic assigned to those with conditions regarded as rare or dysfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;Psychology: Core Concepts, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior is considered abnormal when it is atypical or out of the ordinary, consists of undesirable behavior, and results in impairment in the individual's functioning.&lt;ref&gt;A Cross-sectional Study in Iranian Population, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Abnormality is that which is considered deviant from specific societal, cultural and ethical expectations. These expectations are broadly dependent on age, gender, traditional and societal categorizations. The definition of abnormal behavior is an often debated issue in [[abnormal psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification and Assessment of Abnormal Behavior|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcpsy002/Nevid_ch03.pdf|website=csun.edu|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of these subjective variables.  

''Abnormal'' behavior should not be confused with ''unusual'' behavior. Behavior that is out of the ordinary is not necessarily indicative of a mental or psychological disorder. Abnormal behavior, on the other hand, while not a mental disorder in itself, is often indicative of mental and psychological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118625392.wbecp308|title=The Encyclopedia of Clinical Psychology|last=Marty|first=Meghan A.|last2=Segal|first2=Daniel L.|publisher=American Cancer Society|pages=1–6|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118625392.wbecp308}}&lt;/ref&gt; A psychological disorder is defined as an "ongoing dysfunctional pattern of thought, emotion, and behavior that causes significant distress, and is considered deviant in that person's culture or society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abnormal Psychology and Modern Life (13th ed)|last=Butcher|first=James|last2=Mineka|first2=Susan|last3=Hooley|first3=Jill|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important to note is that abnormal behavior, as it relates to psychological disorders, would be "ongoing" and a cause of "significant distress". A [[mental disorder]] describes a patient who has a medical condition whereby the medical practitioner makes a judgement that the patient is exhibiting abnormal behavior based on the DSM-5 criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/medical-model.html|title=The Medical Model|last=McLeod|first=Saul|date=2014|website=Simply Psychology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, simply because a behavior is unusual does not make it abnormal; it is only considered abnormal if it meets these criteria.

==Several conventional criteria==
There are five main criteria of abnormality. They are: 
# Statistical Criterion
# Social Criterion
# Personal Discomfort
# Maladaptive Behaviour
# Deviation from Ideal

Abnormal behaviors are "actions that are unexpected and often evaluated negatively because they differ from typical or usual behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Durand, V., &amp; Barlow, D. (2016). Essentials of Abnormal Psychology.  Boston, MA: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''The following Criteria are subjective:'''

* [[maladaptivity|Maladaptative]] and Malfunctional behaviors. Behaviors which, due to circumstance, are not fully adapted to the environment become malfunctional and detrimental to the individual or others. For example, a mouse continuing to attempt an escape when escape is obviously impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-05-02|title=Medical paradigms for the study of problem behaviour: a critical review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159102002861|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|language=en|volume=81|issue=3|pages=265–277|doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00286-1|issn=0168-1591}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

*Behavior that violates the standards of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-35465-1_2|title=First Responder’s Guide to Abnormal Psychology|date=2007|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9780387351391|pages=13–18|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-35465-1_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people do not follow the conventional social and moral rules of their society, the behavior is considered abnormal. (See Deviation from Social Norms)
*Observer discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;David Rosenhan &amp; Martin Seligman (1984) ''Abnormal Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's behavior brings discomfort to those in observation, it is likely to be considered abnormal. 

The standard criteria in psychology and [[psychiatry]] is that of [[mental illness]] or [[mental disorder]]. Determination of abnormality is based upon [[medical diagnosis]].

'''Other Criteria'''

*'''Statistical Infrequency''': Statistically rare behaviors are called abnormal. Though not always the case, the presence of abnormal behavior in people should be rare or statistically unusual. Any specific abnormal behavior may be unusual, but it is not uncommon for people to exhibit some form of prolonged abnormal behavior at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/numbers.cfm | title=Mental Illness in America | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991009122407/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/numbers.cfm | archivedate=1999-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Deviation from Social Norms''' defines the departure or deviation of an individual from society's unwritten rules (norms). For example, if one was to witness a man jumping around, nude, on the streets, the man would be perceived as abnormal, as he has broken society's norms about wearing clothing. There are also a number of criteria for one to examine before reaching a judgment as to whether someone has deviated from society's norms. The first of these criterion being ''culture''; what may be seen as normal in one culture, may be seen as abnormal in another. The second criterion being the ''situation &amp; context'' one is placed in; for example, going to the toilet is a normal human act, but going in the middle of a supermarket would be seen as highly abnormal, i.e., defecating or urinating in public is illegal as a misdemeanor act of indecent public conduct. The third criterion is ''age''; a child at the age of three could get away with taking off clothing in public, but not a man at the age of twenty. The fourth criterion is gender: a male responding with behavior normally reacted to as female, and vice versa, is retaliated against, not just corrected. The fifth criterion is historical context; standards of normal behavior change in some societies, sometimes very rapidly.
*'''FF: Failure to Function Adequately.''' A behavior is abnormal if the individual is unable to cope with the demands of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/abnormal-psychology.html|title=Abnormal Psychology {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists can disagree on the boundaries that define what is 'functioning' and what is 'adequately', however, as some behaviors that can cause 'failure to function' are not seen as bad. For example, a firemen risking their lives to save people in a blazing fire. 
*'''DIM: Deviation from Ideal Mental health''' defines abnormality by determining if the behavior the individual is displaying is affecting their mental well-being. As with the Failure to Function definition, the boundaries that stipulate what 'ideal mental health' is are not clearly defined. A frequent problem with the definition is that all individuals at some point in their life deviate from ideal mental health, but it does not mean the behavior is abnormal. For example, someone who has lost a relative is distressed and deviates from "ideal mental health" for a time, but their distress is not defined as abnormal, as distress is an expected reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/53659.php|title=Complicated Grief Needs Specific Treatment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common approach to defining abnormality is a '''Multi-Criteria''' approach, where all definitions of abnormality are used to determine whether an individual's behavior is abnormal. For example, psychologists would be prepared to define an individual's behavior as "abnormal" if the following criteria are met. 

* The individual is engaging in behavior that is preventing them from functioning. 

* The individual is engaging in behavior that breaks a social norm. 

* The individual is engaging in behavior that is statistically infrequent. 

A good example of an abnormal behavior assessed by a multi-criteria approach is [[depression (mood)|depression]]: it is commonly seen as a deviation from ideal mental stability, it often stops the individual from 'functioning' a normal life, and, though it is a relatively common mental disorder, it is still statistically infrequent. Most people do not experience significant [[major depressive disorder]] in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/25766.php|title=How prevalent is mental illness in the USA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, depression and its associated behaviors would be considered abnormal. 

Though not mentioned by many psychologists a lot of abnormal people can all agree that they were bullied into social ostracism when they were in school or by their families, they would tell you how people were consistently angry with them. For example: 

Kid A: Loves things that are the social norms, loves the expected interests that Kid A was told to love by parents and loved ones, has a group of friends that loves everything Kid A loves and respects.  

Kid B: Sees Kid A and his group of friends and wants to fit in with Kid A’s friends, he does everything he can to fit in to the social norms and expected interests Kid A loves, Kid A sees Kid B takes an interest in Kid A, Kid A gets ferociously offended and yells at Kid B to NEVER do those things again. Kid B then, feels alone,sad and empty and eventually finds something NOT liked by everyone and then LOVES it.

The '''Association for Civil Rights in Israel''' (ACRI) ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|האגודה לזכויות האזרח בישראל}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|جمعية حقوق المواطن في اسرائيل}}) was created in 1972&lt;ref name="founded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/to-each-his-own-justice-1.224169|title=To Each His Own Justice|publisher= Ha'aretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an independent, non-partisan [[not-for-profit organization]] with the mission of protecting [[human rights]] and [[civil rights]] in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories| territories]] under its control. ACRI is Israel’s oldest and largest human rights organization. Headquartered in [[Tel Aviv]], with offices in [[Jerusalem]], [[Nazareth]] and [[Be'er Sheva]], the organization promotes transparency and accountability in government.&lt;ref&gt;International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations, "[https://www.inclo.net/members/acri.html The Association for Civil Rights in Israel]," retrieved 9 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

ACRI has been accused by critics, including former Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], of defending terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=האגודה לזכויות האדם יוצאת מהקונסנסוס|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.789329|date=25 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Established in 1972, ACRI views itself as being "committed to promoting the universality of human rights and defending the human rights and civil liberties of all, regardless of religion, nationality, gender, ethnicity, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic background."&lt;ref name="mission"/&gt;  The association established its views based on the basic rights recognized in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948, and the values in [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1981, ACRI instituted a human rights award to be given to "individuals and organizations that have made a outstanding contribution to the advancement of [[human rights]] in [[Israel]]". The award was renamed in 1983 as the "[[Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award]]."&lt;ref name="award"&gt;The Association For Civil Rights in Israel. ''The Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award: The First 30 Years 1981-2011''. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ACRI organized what has become an annual "Human Rights March" to mark [[International Human Rights Day]] (December 10) in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="march1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=293479|date=November 26, 2012|title=Thousands expected at fourth annual Human Rights March|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130020813/http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=293479|archive-date=30 November 2012|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity ==

ACRI’s Legal Department argues cases before the [[Supreme Court of Israel]], and also seeks redress before district and labor courts, government ministries, and [[Knesset]] committees.

ACRI’s Education Department conducts human rights training programs, produces educational curricula in [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]], and organizes conferences and lectures on human rights education. Additionally, ACRI operates a program on [[International Humanitarian Law]] (IHL) and offers IHL educational workshops to [[Activism| social activists]], students, educators, youth movement counselors, and students at pre-military academies to "enhance the participants’ knowledge of IHL, and to provide opportunities for discussion and for developing their positions on the issues involved."

ACRI publishes reports and information leaflets; organizes lectures, conferences, film screenings and other public and community events covering a wide range of human rights issues; and runs a public hotline to assist people whose rights have been infringed.

Internationally, ACRI submits shadow reports and provides information to UN committees and representatives regarding Israel’s compliance with its human rights obligations; meets with foreign diplomats and government representatives; participates in international conferences and NGO networks; and raises awareness of human rights issues by generating ongoing international media coverage.

ACRI focus on issues pertaining to Arab Minority Rights, Anti-Democratic Initiatives, Freedom of Expression, LGBT Rights, [[East Jerusalem]], Human Rights Defenders in the [[Occupied Palestinian Territories]] (OPT), Migrant Workers, Child Rights, [[Negev Bedouins]], [[Refugees]] and [[Asylum Seekers]], Right to Health, Women's Rights, and the Right to Housing.&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acri.org.il/en/all-issues/|title=All Issues|publisher=Association for Civil Rights in Israel|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Though ACRI does not identify itself politically, activities of the association has been criticized as assisting organizations that harm Israel's [[national security]]. Such criticism was made by prime-minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] over an appeal about exiling 400 [[Hamas]] activists to [[Lebanon]] in 1992. Rabin Called ACRI - "Association for Rights of Hamas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=האגודה לזכויות האדם יוצאת מהקונסנסוס|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.789329|date=25 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other right-wing activists have called it "Association for Palestinian Civil Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=הצד ההומניסטי של האנטישמיות - בגליון השבוע|url=http://www.inn.co.il/Besheva/Article.aspx/2454|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Education Minister [[Naftali Bennett]] cancelled a conference to be held in cooperation with ACRI following a letter sent by a group of bereaved families accusing ACRI of defending [[terrorism| terrorists]]. ACRI denied the allegations and stated that it does not defend terrorists during their criminal proceedings, rather only in regards to their rights in prison and matters of citizenship and residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Minister Axes Workshop With Biggest Civil Rights Group Over Claim It 'Defends Terrorists'|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.825541|website=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Emil Grunzweig human rights award ==

The [[Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award]] is awarded annually by Association for Civil Rights in Israel to "individuals and organizations that have made a outstanding contribution to the advancement of [[human rights]] in [[Israel]]". The award was established in 1981 as an initiative by Professor Jacob Lorch, but was renamed in 1983 after the murder of activist [[Emil Grunzweig]] by a grenade thrown by a right-wing Israeli extremist during a [[Peace Now]] demonstration against the [[1982 Lebanon war|war in Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="award"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2001">In [[general relativity]] and [[differential geometry]], the '''Bel–Robinson tensor''' is a tensor defined in the [[abstract index notation]] by:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{abcd}=C_{aecf}C_{b} {}^{e} {}_{d} {}^{f} + \frac{1}{4}\epsilon_{ae}{}^{hi} \epsilon_{b}{}^{ej}{}_{k} C_{hicf} C_{j}{}^{k}{}_{d}{}^{f}&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively,
:&lt;math&gt;T_{abcd}=C_{aecf}C_{b} {}^{e} {}_{d} {}^{f} - \frac{3}{2} g_{a[b} C_{jk]cf} C^{jk}{}_{d}{}^{f}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Weyl tensor]].  It was introduced by Lluís Bel in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=L.|last1=Bel|title=Introduction d'un tenseur du quatrième ordre|journal=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences|volume=248|page=1297|year=1959|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k32002/f1321.image.langEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=J. M. M.|last1=Senovilla|title=Editor's Note: Radiation States and the Problem of Energy in General Relativity by Louis Bel|journal=General Relativity and Gravitation|volume=32|page=2043|year=2000|doi=10.1023/A:1001906821162|bibcode=2000GReGr..32.2043S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bel–[[Ivor Robinson (physicist)|Robinson]] tensor is constructed from the Weyl tensor in a manner analogous to the way the [[electromagnetic stress–energy tensor]] is built from the [[electromagnetic tensor]]. Like the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor, the Bel–Robinson tensor is totally symmetric and traceless:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{abcd}=T_{(abcd)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T^{a}{}_{acd} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
In general relativity, there is no unique definition of the local energy of the gravitational field. The Bel–Robinson tensor is a possible definition for local energy, since it can be shown that whenever the [[Ricci tensor]] vanishes (i.e. in vacuum), the Bel–Robinson tensor is divergence-free:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^{a} T_{abcd} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

'''BioMA''' is a software framework developed focusing on platform-independent, re-usable components, including multi-model implementations at fine granularity.

== BioMA - Biophysical Model Applications ==

BioMA (Biophysical Model Applications) is a [[public domain]] [[software framework]] designed and implemented for developing, parameterizing and running [[Modeling and simulation|modelling solutions]] based on biophysical models in the domains of agriculture and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Donatelli M., Cerrani I., Fanchini D., Fumagalli. D., Rizzoli A. 2012. Enhancing Model Reuse via Component-Centered Modeling Frameworks: the Vision and Example Realizations. In: International Environmental Modelling and Software Society (iEMSs), 2012 International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software, Managing Resources of a Limited Planet, Sixth Biennial Meeting, Leipzig, Germany, R. Seppelt, A.A. Voinov, S. Lange, D. Bankamp (Eds.) [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2012/proceedings/D3_1_0847_Donatelli_et_al.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on discrete conceptual units codified in freely extensible [[software components]] .&lt;ref&gt;Donatelli M., Rizzoli A. 2008 A design for framework-independent model components of biophysical systems International Congress onEnvironmental Modelling and Software iEMSs 2008 Proceedings of theiEMSs Fourth Biennial Meeting, Barcelona, Catalonia 7–10 July 2008: 727-734 [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2008/uploads/Main/Vol2-iEMSs2008-Proceedings.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of this framework is to rapidly bridge from prototypes to operational applications, enabling running and comparing different modelling solutions. A key aspect of the framework is the transparency which allows for quality evaluation of outputs in the various steps of the modelling workflow. The framework is based on framework-independent components, both for the modelling solutions and the [[Graphical user interface|graphical user's interfaces]]. The goal is not only to provide a framework for model development and operational use but also, and of no lesser importance, to provide a loose collection of objects re-usable either standalone or in different frameworks. The software is developed using Microsoft C# language in the [[.NET Framework|.NET framework]].

The framework is a development of the work carried out under the APES &lt;ref&gt;Donatellli M., G. Russell, A.E Rizzoli, et al. 2010 A component-based framework for simulating agricultural production and externalities.

BioMA applications and modelling solutions are the simulation tools used by the [http://mars.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ MARS unit] of the European Commission to simulate agricultural production under scenarios of [[Global warming|climate change]].  BioMA is also used in the EU FP7 project [http://www.modextreme.org/ MODEXTREME].

=== The architecture ===

The simulation system is discretized in layers, each with its own features and requirements. Such layers are the Model Layer (ModL), where fine granularity models are implemented as discrete units,&lt;ref&gt;Donatelli M., Rizzoli A., 2008. A design for framework-independent model components of biophysical systems. International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software, Proceedings of the iEMSs Fourth Biennial Meeting, Barcelona, Catalonia 7–10 July 2008: 727-734 [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236120180_A_Design_for_Framework-Independent_Model_Components_of_Biophysical_Systems/file/3deec5162982e7cbe6.pdf? PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; the Composition Layer (CompL), where basic models are linked into more complex, aggregated models, and the Configuration Layer (ConfL), which allows providing context specific parameterization (in the software sense) for operational use. Applications can span from simple console applications to user-interacting applications based on the [[Software design pattern|model-view-controller pattern]], in the simplest cases linking either directly to either the ModL or the CompL, or accessing model ConfL. In all cases, the component oriented architecture allows implementing a set of functionalities which impact on the richness of functionality of the system and on its transparency. Layers implement no top-down dependency among them, hence facilitating the independent reuse of tools, utilities, and model components in different applications and frameworks.

=== Applications ===

[[File:BioMA libraries nologo.png|thumbnail|Model libraries used in BioMA to build modelling solutions]]
Advanced applications can be grouped under two categories:
* BioMA-Spatial, were models are run iteratively against spatially explicit units, as either grid cells or polygons. These application can include a layer to model interaction among the spatial units;
* BioMA-Site, were models are run against specific sites. These applications can be specialized for specific crops, and in general allow a more detailed access to model constituent blocks and outputs.

Applications can be built based on the libraries as in the following figure. The libraries can be extended implementing new models, as shown in the software development kits, and new libraries can be added.

=== Availability ===

Model components and tools can be autonomously downloaded with the SDK at the components' portal.  Same for modelling solutions (starting from 2016).

Applications must be requested by email, and, similarly to components, applications will be made available for free autonomous download during 2016.

In [[statistical mechanics]], '''Boltzmann's equation''' is a probability equation relating the [[entropy]] ''S'' of an ideal gas to the quantity ''W'', 
the number of real [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] corresponding to the gas' [[macrostate]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;S = k_\mathrm{B} \ln W&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (also written as simply ''k'') and equal to 1.38065 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K.

In short, the Boltzmann formula shows the relationship between entropy and the number of ways the [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s of a [[thermodynamic system]] can be arranged.
== History ==
[[Image:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Boltzmann.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Boltzmann's grave in the [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna, with bust and entropy formula.]] 
The equation was originally formulated by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] between 1872 and 1875, but later put into its current form by [[Max Planck]] in about 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/BoltzmannEquation.html Boltzmann equation]. Eric Weisstein's World of Physics (states the year was 1872).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | isbn=0-19-856552-6}} (states the year was 1875)&lt;/ref&gt;  To quote Planck, "the [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by L. Boltzmann in his [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases".

The value of {{mvar|W}} was originally intended to be proportional to the ''Wahrscheinlichkeit'' (the German word for probability) of a [[macroscopic]] state for some probability distribution of possible [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]—the collection of (unobservable) "ways" the (observable) [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] state of a system can be realized by assigning different [[coordinate system|positions]](x) and [[momentum|momenta]](p) to the various molecules.  Interpreted in this way, Boltzmann's formula is the most general formula for the thermodynamic [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|entropy]].  However, Boltzmann's [[Paradigm#Paradigm shifts|paradigm]] was an [[ideal gas]] of {{mvar|N}} ''identical'' particles, of which &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; are in the {{mvar|i}}-th microscopic condition (range) of position and momentum.  For this case, the probability of each microstate of the system is equal, so it was equivalent for Boltzmann to calculate the number of microstates associated with a macrostate.  {{mvar|W}} was historically misinterpreted as literally meaning the number of microstates, and that is what it usually means today.  {{mvar|W}} can be counted using the formula for [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics#Derivation of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|permutations]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; W = \frac{N!}{\prod_i N_i!} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where ''i'' ranges over all possible molecular conditions and {{mvar|!}} denotes [[factorial]]. The "correction" in the denominator is due to the fact that identical particles in the same condition are [[Identical particles|indistinguishable]]. {{mvar|W}} is sometimes called the "thermodynamic probability" since it is an [[integer]] greater than one, while [[probability theory|mathematical probabilities]] are always [[number]]s between zero and one.

== Generalization ==

Boltzmann's formula applies to microstates of the universe as a whole, each possible microstate of which is presumed to be equally probable.

But in thermodynamics it is important to be able to make the approximation of dividing the universe into a [[thermodynamic system|system]] of interest, plus its surroundings; and then to be able to identify the entropy of the system with the system entropy in classical thermodynamics.  The microstates of such a thermodynamic system are ''not'' equally probable—for example, high energy microstates are less probable than low energy microstates for a thermodynamic system kept at a fixed temperature by allowing contact with a heat bath.
For thermodynamic systems where microstates of the system may not have equal probabilities, the appropriate generalization, called the [[Gibbs entropy]], is:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; S = - k_\mathrm{B} \sum p_i \ln p_i &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

This reduces to equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) if the probabilities ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are all equal.

Boltzmann used a &lt;math&gt;\rho\ln\rho&lt;/math&gt; formula as early as 1866.&lt;ref name="wt" &gt;{{cite journal | author=Ludwig Boltzmann | year = 1866 | title=Über die Mechanische Bedeutung des Zweiten Hauptsatzes der Wärmetheorie | journal=Wiener Berichte | volume=53 | pages=195–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He interpreted {{mvar|&amp;rho;}} as a density in phase space—without mentioning probability—but since this satisfies the axiomatic definition of a probability measure we can retrospectively interpret it as a probability anyway.  [[J. Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] gave an explicitly probabilistic interpretation in 1878.

Boltzmann himself used an expression equivalent to ({{EquationNote|3}}) in his later work&lt;ref name="vorlesungen" &gt;{{cite book | author=Ludwig Boltzmann | title=Vorlesungen über Gastheorie, vol. I | publisher=J.A. Barth, Leipzig | year=1896 }};
 {{cite book | author=Ludwig Boltzmann | title=Vorlesungen über Gastheorie, vol. II | publisher=J.A. Barth, Leipzig | year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recognized it as more general than equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).  That is, equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is a corollary of
equation ({{EquationNote|3}})—and not vice versa.  In every situation where equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is valid,
equation ({{EquationNote|3}}) is valid also—and not vice versa.

== Boltzmann entropy excludes statistical dependencies ==

The term '''Boltzmann entropy''' is also sometimes used to indicate entropies calculated based on the approximation that the overall probability can be factored into an identical separate term for each particle—i.e., assuming each particle has an identical independent probability distribution, and ignoring interactions and correlations between the particles.  This is exact for an ideal gas of identical particles, and may or may not be a good approximation for other systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[E.T. Jaynes|Jaynes, E. T.]] (1965). [http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/gibbs.vs.boltzmann.pdf Gibbs vs Boltzmann entropies]. ''American Journal of Physics'', '''33''', 391-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boltzmann entropy is obtained if one assumes one can treat all the component particles of a [[thermodynamic system]] as statistically independent.  The probability distribution of the system as a whole then factorises into the product of ''N'' separate identical terms, one term for each particle; and the Gibbs entropy simplifies to the Boltzmann entropy

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;S_B = - N k_\mathrm{B} \sum_i p_i \ln p_i&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

where the summation is taken over each possible state in the 6-dimensional [[phase space]] of a ''single'' particle (rather than the 6''N''-dimensional phase space of the system as a whole).

This reflects the original statistical entropy function introduced by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in 1872.  For the special case of an [[ideal gas]] it exactly corresponds to the proper [[entropy|thermodynamic entropy]].

However, for anything but the most dilute of real gases, it leads to increasingly wrong predictions of entropies and physical behaviours, by ignoring the interactions and correlations between different molecules.  Instead one must follow Gibbs, and consider the [[statistical ensemble|ensemble]] of states of the system as a whole, rather than single particle states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25024">In [[cognitive science]], '''choice-supportive bias''' or '''post-purchase rationalization''' is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected. It is a [[cognitive bias]]. For example, if a person chooses option A instead of option B, they are likely to ignore or downplay the faults of option A while amplifying those of option B. Conversely, they are also likely to notice and amplify the advantages of option A and not notice or de-emphasize those of option B.

What is remembered about a decision can be as important as the decision itself, especially in determining how much regret or satisfaction one experiences.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; Research indicates that the process of making and remembering choices yields [[Memory|memories]] that tend to be distorted in predictable ways.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; In cognitive science, one predictable way that memories of choice options are distorted is that positive aspects tend to be remembered as part of the chosen option, whether or not they originally were part of that option, and negative aspects tend to be remembered as part of rejected options.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; Once an action has been taken, the ways in which we evaluate the effectiveness of what we did may be biased.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; It is believed this may influence our future decision-making. These biases may be stored as memories, which are attributions that we make about our mental experiences based on their subjective qualities, our prior knowledge and beliefs, our motives and goals, and the social context. True and [[false memories]] arise by the same mechanism because when the brain processes and stores information, it cannot tell the difference where they came from.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==General definition==
The tendency to remember one's choices as better than they actually were, where people tend to over attribute positive features to options they chose and negative features to options not chosen.&lt;ref name= "Mather" /&gt;

==Theory==
Experiments in cognitive science and [[social psychology]] have revealed a wide variety of biases in areas such as statistical reasoning, [[social attribution]], and [[memory]].&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt;

Choice-supportive memory distortion is thought to occur during the time of memory retrieval and was the result of the belief that, "I chose this option, therefore it must have been the better option."&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt;  It is also possible that choice-supportive memories arise because an individual is only paying attention to certain pieces of information when making a decision or to post-choice [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt; In addition,  biases can also arise because they are closely related to the high level [[cognitive operations]] and complex [[social interactions]].&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;

Memory distortions may sometimes serve a purpose because it may be in our interest to not remember some details of an event or to forget others altogether.&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt;

==Making a selection==
The objective of a choice is generally to pick the best option. Thus, after making a choice, a person is likely to maintain the belief that the chosen option was better than the options rejected. Every choice has an upside and a downside. The process of making a decision mostly relies upon previous experiences. Therefore, a person will remember not only the decision made but also the reasoning behind making that decision.

===Motivation===
Motivation may also play a role in this process because when a person remembers the option that they chose as being the best option, it should help reduce regret about their choice. This may represent a positive illusion that promotes well-being.

===Cases when individual is not in control===
There are cases where an individual is not always in control of which options are received. People often end up with options that were not chosen but, instead were assigned by others, such as job assignments made by bosses, course instructors assigned by a registrar, or vacation spots selected by other family members.&lt;ref name="Mather3" /&gt; However, being assigned (random or not) to an option leads to a different set of cognitions and memory attributions that tend to favor the alternative (non-received) option and may emphasize regret and disappointment.&lt;ref name="Stoll" /&gt;
*'''Assigned options''': Making a choice or having a choice made for you by other people in your best interest can prompt memory attributions that support that choice.  Current experiments show no choice-supportive memory bias for assigned options.&lt;ref name="Mather3" /&gt; However, choices which are made on a person's behalf in their best interest do show a tendency for choice-supportive memory bias.
*'''Random selection''': People do not show choice-supportive biases when choices are made randomly for them.&lt;ref name="Henkel" /&gt;  This is because choice-supportive memory bias tends to arise during the act of making the decision.

==How it relates to self==
People's conception of who they are can be shaped by the memories of the choices they make; the college favored over the one renounced, the job chosen over the one rejected, the candidate elected instead of another one not selected.&lt;ref name="Mather2" /&gt; Memories of chosen as well as forgone alternatives can affect one's sense of well-being. Regret for options not taken can cast a shadow, whereas satisfaction at having made the right choice can make a good outcome seem even better.&lt;ref name="Mather2" /&gt;

===Positive illusions===
Choice-supportive bias often results in memories that depict the self in an overly favorable light. In general, cognitive biases loosen our grasp on reality because the line between reality and fantasy can become fuzzy if one's brain has failed to remember a particular event.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;
Positive illusions are generally mild and are important contributors to our sense of well being. However, we all need to be aware that they do exist as part of human nature.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;

==Memory storage==
Human beings are blessed with having an intelligent and complex mind, which allows us to remember our past, be able to optimize the present, and plan for the future. Remembering involves a complex interaction between the current environment, what one expects to remember, and what is retained from the past.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt; The mechanisms of the brain that allow memory storage and retrieval serves us well most of the time, but occasionally gets us into trouble.

===Memories change over time===
There is now abundant evidence that memory content can undergo systematic changes. After some period of time and if the memory is not used often, it may become forgotten.
*'''Memory retention''': It is recognized that retention is best for experiences that are pleasant, intermediate for experiences that are unpleasant, and worst for experiences that are neutral. Generic memories provide the basis for inferences that can bring about distortions. These distortions in memory do not displace an individual's specific memories, but they supplement and fill in the gaps when the memories are lost.&lt;ref name="Bahrick" /&gt; It has been shown that a wide variety of strategic and systematic processes are used to activate different areas of the brain in order to retrieve information.
*'''Credibility of a memory''': People have a way to self-check memories, in which a person may consider the plausibility of the retrieved memory by asking themselves is this event even possible.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; For example, if a person remembers seeing a pig fly, they must conclude that it was from a dream because pigs cannot fly in the real world. Memory does not provide people with perfect reproductions of what happened, it only consists of constructions and reconstructions of what happened.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==Brain areas of interest==
There is extensive evidence that the [[amygdala]] is involved in effectively influencing memory.&lt;ref name="McGaugh" /&gt;  Emotional arousal, usually fear based, activates the amygdala and results in the modulation of memory storage occurring in other brain regions.
The [[forebrain]] is one of the targets of the [[amygdala]]. The forebrain receives input from amygdala and calculates the emotional significance of the stimulus, generates an emotional response, and transmits it to [[cerebral cortex]]. This can alter the way neurons respond to future input, and therefore cognitive biases, such as choice-supportive bias can influence future decisions.

===Stress hormones affect memory===
Effects of stress-related [[hormones]], such as [[epinephrine]] and [[glucocorticoids]] are mediated by influences involving the amygdala.&lt;ref name="McGaugh" /&gt; It has been shown in experiments with rats that when they are given systemic injections of epinephrine while being trained to perform a task, they show an enhanced memory of performing the task. In effect the stronger the emotion that is tied to the memory, the more likely the individual is to remember. Therefore, if the memory is stored and retrieved properly it is less likely to be distorted.

==Brain mapping==

A [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scan or [[fMRI]] can be used to identify different regions of the brain that are activated during specific memory retrieval.

===fMRI study===
*'''True versus False Memories''': One study asked subjects to remember a series of events while being monitored by an [[fMRI]] to see which areas "light up." When an individual remembered a greater number of true memories than false memories, it showed a cluster spanning the right [[superior temporal gyrus]] and lateral [[occipital cortex]]. However, when the reverse occurred (when an individual remembered a greater number of false memories than true) the brain area that showed activation was the left [[Insular cortex|insula]].&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;  These findings may provide some insight as to which areas of the brain are involved with storing memories and later retrieving them.

==Increase with age==
Studies now show that as people age, their process of memory retrieval changes. Although general memory problems are common to everyone because no memory is perfectly accurate, older adults are more likely than younger adults to show choice-supportive biases.

===Aging of the brain===
Normal aging may be accompanied by [[neuropathy]] in the frontal brain regions. Frontal regions help people encode or use specific memorial attributes to make source judgments, controls personality and the ability to plan for events. These areas can attribute to memory distortions and regulating emotion.

===Regulation of emotion===
In general, older adults are more likely to remember [[emotional]] aspects of situations than are younger adults. For example, on a memory characteristic [[questionnaire]], older adults rated remembered events as having more associated thoughts and feelings than did younger adults. As a person ages, regulating personal emotion becomes a higher priority, whereas knowledge acquisition becomes less of a powerful motive. Therefore, choice-supportive bias would arise because their focus was on how they felt about the choice rather than on the factual details of the options. Studies have shown that when younger adults are encouraged to remember the emotional aspect of a choice, they are more likely to show choice-supportive bias.  This may be related to older adults' greater tendency to show a [[positivity effect]] in memory.

===Rely on familiarity===
Older adults rely more than younger adults on categorical or general knowledge about an event to recognize particular elements from the event.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; Older adults are also less likely to correctly remember contextual features of events, such as their color or location. This may be because older adults remember (or rely on) fewer source identifying characteristics than the young. Consequently, older adults must more often guess or base a response on less specific information, such as [[wikt:familiar|familiarity]].&lt;ref name="Dodson" /&gt; As a result, if they can't remember something, they are more likely to fill in the missing gaps with things that are familiar to them.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;

===Getting the 'gist'===
Older adults are more reliant on gist-based retrieval. A number of studies suggest that using [[stereotypes]] or general knowledge to help remember an event is less cognitively demanding than relying on other types of memorial information and thus might require less reflective activity. This shift towards gist-based processes might occur as a compensation for age decrements in [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] memory.&lt;ref name="Lovden" /&gt;

===Inhibition===
The [[episodic memory|episodic]] memory and inhibition accounts of age-related increases in [[false memories]].  Inhibition of a memory may be related to an individual's hearing capacity and attention span. If the person cannot hear what is going on around them or is not paying much attention, the memory cannot be properly stored and therefore cannot be accurately retrieved.

==Examples==

===Deciding between two used cars===
Henkel and Mather tested the role of beliefs at the time of retrieval about which option was chosen by giving participants several hypothetical choices like deciding between two used cars.&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt;
After making several choices, participants left and were asked to return a week later. At that point, Henkel and Mather reminded them which option they had chosen for each choice and gave them a list of the features of the two options; some new positive and negative features were mixed in with the old features. Next, participants were asked to indicate whether each option was new, had been associated with the option they chose, or had been associated with the option they rejected. Participants favored whichever option Henkel and Mather had told them they had chosen in their memories.&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt; These findings show that beliefs at the time of retrieval about which option was chosen shape both which features are attributed to the options and how vividly they are remembered.

===Remembering high school grades===
One study looked at the accuracy and distortion in memory for high school grades. The relation between accuracy and distortion of [[autobiographical memory]] content was examined by verifying 3,220 high school grades recalled by 99 freshman college students.&lt;ref name="Bahrick" /&gt;  It was shown that most errors inflated the actual high school grade, meaning that these distortions are attributed to memory reconstructions in a positive and emotionally gratifying direction. In addition, their findings indicate that the process of distortion does not cause the actual unpleasant memory loss of getting the bad grade.&lt;ref name="Bahrick" /&gt; This is because there was no correlation found between the percentage of accuracy recall and the degree of asymmetry, or distortion. This shows that the distortion in memories of high school grades arises after the content has been forgotten by another mechanism.

===A 50 year study of college grades===
Many similar studies have been performed, such as a fifty-year study of remembering college grades. In this study one to 54 years after graduating, 276 alumni correctly recalled 3,025 of 3,967 college grades. The number of omission errors increased with the retention interval and better students made fewer errors.&lt;ref name="Bahrick2" /&gt; The accuracy of recall increased with confidence in recall. Eighty-one percent of [[errors of commission]] inflated the actual grade. These data suggested that distortions occur soon after graduation, remain constant during the retention interval, and are greater for better students and for courses students enjoyed most. Therefore, sometime in between when the memory is stored and when it is retrieved some time later, the distortion may arise.&lt;ref name="Bahrick2" /&gt;

==Methods for testing==

===Written scenario memory tests===
Researchers have used written scenarios in which participants are asked to make a choice between two options. Later, on a memory test, participants are given a list of positive and negative features, some of which were in the scenario and some of which are new. A choice-supportive bias is seen when both correct and incorrect attributions tend to favor the chosen option, with positive features more likely to be attributed to the chosen option and negative features to the rejected option.
*'''Deception''': Henkel and Mather (2007) found that giving people false reminders about which option they chose in a previous experiment session led people to remember the option they were told they had chosen as being better than the other option. This reveals that choice-supportive biases arise in large part when remembering past choices, rather than being the result of biased processing at the time of the choice.

===Deese/Roediger–McDermott paradigm===
The [[Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm]] (DRM) consists of a participant listening to an experimenter read lists of thematically related words (e.g. table, couch, lamp, desk); then after some period of time the experimenter will ask if a word was presented in the list.  Participants often report that related but non-presented words (e.g. chair) were included in the encoding series, essentially suggesting that they 'heard' the experimenter say these non-presented words (or critical lures). Incorrect 'yes' responses to critical lures, often referred to as false memories, are remarkably high under standard DRM conditions.&lt;ref name="Foley" /&gt;

==Relation to cognitive dissonance==
The theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonance]]. Choice-supportive bias is potentially related to the aspect of [[cognitive dissonance]] explored by Jack Brehm (1956) as postdecisional dissonance. Within the context of cognitive dissonance, choice-supportive bias would be seen as reducing the conflict between "I prefer X" and "I have committed to Y".

==Debiasing==

A study of the [[Lady Macbeth effect|''Lady Macbeth'' effect]] showed reduced choice-supportive bias by having participants engage in [[washing]].&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

'''Compartmental modelling of dendrites''' deals with [[multi-compartment model]]ling of the [[dendrite]]s, to make the understanding of the electrical behavior of complex dendrites easier. Basically, compartmental modelling of dendrites is a very helpful tool to develop new [[biological neuron model]]s. Dendrites are very important because they occupy the most membrane area in many of the neurons and give the neuron an ability to connect to thousands of other cells. Originally the dendrites were thought to have constant [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] and [[Electric current|current]] but now it has been understood that they may have active [[Voltage-gated ion channel]]s, which influences the firing properties of the neuron and also the response of [[neuron]] to [[Synapse|synaptic]] inputs.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ermentrout|first=Bard|title=Mathematical Foundations of Neuroscience|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-87707-5|pages=29–45|author2=Terman H. David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mathematical models have been developed to understand the electric behavior of the dendrites. Dendrites tend to be very branchy and complex, so the compartmental approach to understand the electrical behavior of the dendrites makes it very useful.

==Introduction==
* Compartmental modelling is a very natural way of modelling dynamical systems that have certain inherent properties with conservation principles. The compartmental modelling is an elegant way, a state space formulation to elegantly capture the dynamical systems that are governed by the conservation laws. Whether it is the conservation of mass, energy, fluid flow or information flow. Basically, they are models whose [[state variables]] tend to be [[non-negative]] (such as mass, concentrations, energy). So the equations for mass balance, energy, concentration or fluid flow can be written. It ultimately goes down to networks in which the brain is the largest of them all, just like [[Avogadro number]], very large amount of molecules that are interconnected. The brain has very interesting interconnections. On a microscopic level [[thermodynamics]] is virtually impossible to understand but from a [[macroscopic]] view we see that these follow some universal laws. In the same way brain has numerous interconnections, which is almost impossible to write a [[differential equation]] for. (These words were said in an interview by [http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/people/whaddad/ Dr. Wassim Haddad] )
* General observations about how the brain functions can be made by looking at the first and second [[thermodynamic laws]], which are universal laws. [[Brain]] is a very large-scale interconnected system; the [[neurons]] have to somehow behave like the chemical reaction system, so, it has to somehow obey the chemical thermodynamic laws. This approach may lead to more generalized model of brain. (These words were said in an interview by [http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/people/whaddad/ Dr. Wassim Haddad] )

==Multiple compartments ==
[[File:Dendrites Modelling.jpg|thumb|a) Branched dendrites viewed as cylinders for modelling. b) Simple model with three compartments]]

* Complicated dendritic structures can be treated as multiple compartments interconnected. The dendrites are divided into small compartments and they are linked together as shown in the figure.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;
* It is assumed that the compartment is isopotential and spatially uniform in its properties. Membrane non-uniformity such as diameter changes, and voltage differences are occurred in between the compartments but not inside them.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;
* An example of a simple two-compartment model:
Consider a two-compartmental model with the compartments viewed as isopotential cylinders with radius &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt; L_i &lt;/math&gt;. 
:&lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane potential of ith compartment.
:&lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the specific membrane capacitance.
:&lt;math&gt;r_{Mi}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific membrane resistivity.
:The total electrode current, assuming that the compartment has it, is given by &lt;math&gt;I^i_{electrode}&lt;/math&gt;.
:The longitudinal resistance is given by &lt;math&gt;r_L&lt;/math&gt;.
:Now according to the balance that should exist for each compartment, we can say
:  &lt;math&gt;  i^i_{cap} + i^i_{ion} = i^i_{long} + i^i_{electrode}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(1)
: Where &lt;math&gt; i^i_{cap}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^i_{ion}&lt;/math&gt; are the capacitive and ionic currents per unit area of ith compartment membrane. i.e. they can be given by
: &lt;math&gt; i^i_{cap} = c_i \frac{dV_i}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^i_{ion} = \frac{V_i}{r_{Mi}}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(2)
: If we assume the resting potential is 0. Then to compute &lt;math&gt;i^i_{long}&lt;/math&gt;, we need total axial resistance. As the compartments are simply cylinders we can say
: &lt;math&gt;R_{long} = \frac{r_LL_1}{2 \pi a_1^2} + \frac{r_LL_2}{2 \pi a_2^2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(3)
: Using ohms law we can express current from ith to jth compartment as
: &lt;math&gt; i^1_{long} = g_{1,2}(V_2-V_1) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i^2_{long} = g_{2,1}(V_1-V_2) &lt;/math&gt; .....eq(4)
: The coupling terms &lt;math&gt; g_{1,2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g_{2,1} &lt;/math&gt; are obtained by inverting eq(3) and dividing by surface area of interest.
: So we get,
: &lt;math&gt;g_{1,2} = \frac{a_1a_2^2}{r_LL_1(a_2^2L_1+a_1^2L_2)} &lt;/math&gt;
: and
: &lt;math&gt;g_{2,1} = \frac{a_2a_1^2}{r_LL_1(a_1^2L_2+a_2^2L_1)} &lt;/math&gt;
: Finally, &lt;math&gt; i_{electrode}^I = \frac {I_{electrode}^i}{A_i}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; A_i = 2 \pi a_iL_i &lt;/math&gt; is the surface area of the compartment i.
: If we put all these together we get
: &lt;math&gt; c_1 \frac{dV_1}{dt} + \frac{V_1}{r_{M1}} = g_{1,2}(V_2 - V_1) + \frac {I_{electrode}^1}{A_1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; c_2 \frac{dV_2}{dt} + \frac{V_2}{r_{M2}} = g_{2,1}(V_1 - V_2) + \frac {I_{electrode}^2}{A_2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(5)
: If we use &lt;math&gt; r_1 = 1/g_{1,2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; r_2 = 1/g_{2,1} &lt;/math&gt; then eq(5) will become
: &lt;math&gt; c_1 \frac{dV_1}{dt} + \frac{V_1}{r_{M1}} = \frac {V_2 - V_1}{r_1} + \frac {I_{electrode}^1}{A_1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; c_2 \frac{dV_2}{dt} + \frac{V_2}{r_{M2}} = \frac {V_1 - V_2}{r_2}  + \frac {I_{electrode}^2}{A_2}&lt;/math&gt;.....eq(6)

: Now if we inject current in cell 1 only and each cylinder is identical then &lt;math&gt; r_1 = r_2 \equiv r &lt;/math&gt;
: Without loss in generality we can define &lt;math&gt; r_M = r_{M1} = r_{M2} &lt;/math&gt;
:After some algebra we can show that
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{V_1}{i_1} = \frac {r_M(r+r_M)}{r+2r_M} &lt;/math&gt;
: also
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{R_{input,coupled}}{R_{input,uncoupled}} = 1- \frac{r_M}{r+2r_M} &lt;/math&gt;
: i.e. the input resistance decreases. For increment in the potential, coupled system current should be greater than that is required for uncoupled system. This is because the second compartment drains some current.
: Now, we can get a general compartmental model for a treelike structure and the equations are
: &lt;math&gt; C_j \frac{dV_j}{dt} = - \frac{V_j}{R_j} + \sum_{k connected j}{} \frac{V_k - V_j}{R_{jk}}+I_j &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;

===Increased computational accuracy in multi-compartmental cable models===

* Input at the center
Each dendridic section is subdivided into segments, which are typically seen as uniform circular cylinders or tapered circular cylinders. In the traditional compartmental model, point process location is determined only to an accuracy of half segment length. This will make the model solution particularly sensitive to segment boundaries. The accuracy of the traditional approach for this reason is [[Big O notation|O]](1/n) when a point current and synaptic input is present. Usually the trans-membrane current where the membrane potential is known is represented in the model at points, or nodes and is assumed to be at the center. The new approach partitions the effect of the input by distributing it to the boundaries of the segment. Hence any input is partitioned between the nodes at the proximal and distal boundaries of the segment. Therefore, this procedure makes sure that the solution obtained is not sensitive to small changes in location of these boundaries because it affects how the input is partitioned between the nodes. When these compartments are connected with continuous potentials and conservation of current at segment boundaries then a new compartmental model of a new mathematical form is obtained. This new approach also provides a model identical to the traditional model but an order more accurate. This model increases the accuracy and precision by an order of magnitude than that is achieved by point process input.&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt;

==Cable Theory==
{{Main|Cable theory}}
Dendrites and axons are considered to be continuous (cable-like), rather than series of compartments.&lt;ref name="Mathematical foundations of neuroscience" /&gt;

==Some applications==

=== Information processing ===

* A theoretical framework along with a technological platform are provided by [[computational model]]s to enhance the understanding of [[nervous system]] functions. There was a lot of advancement in the [[molecular]] and [[biophysical]] mechanisms underlying the neuronal activity. The same kind of advances have to be made in understanding the structure-functional relationship and rules followed by the information processing.&lt;ref name = "Information Processing"&gt;Poirazi, P. (2009). Information Processing in Single Cells and Small Networks: Insights from Compartmental Models. In G. Maroulis &amp; T. E. Simos (Eds.), Computational Methods in Science and Engineering, Vol 1 (Vol. 1108, pp. 158–167).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Previously a neuron used to be thought as a transistor. However, it is shown recently that morphology and ionic composition of different neurons provide the cell with enhanced computational capabilities. These abilities are far more advanced than those captured by a point neuron.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
* Some findings:
** Different outputs given by the individual apical [[oblique dendrite]]s of [http://www-lnc.usc.edu/CA1-pyramidal-cell-model/ CA1 pyramidal neurons] are linearly combined in the cell body. The outputs that come from these dendrites actually behave like individual computational units that use [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] activation function to combine inputs.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** The thin dendritic branches each act as a typical point neuron, which are capable of combining the incoming signals according to the [[Threshold potential|threshold]]ing [[non-linearity]].&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Considering the accuracy in prediction of different input patterns by a two-layer [[artificial neural network|neural network]], it is assumed that a simple mathematical equation can be used to describe the model. This allows the development of network models in which each neuron, instead of being modelled as a full blown compartmental cell, it is modelled as a simplified two layer neural network.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** The firing pattern of the cell might contain the temporal information about incoming signals. For example, the delay between the two simulated pathways.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Single CA1 has a capability of encoding and transmitting spatio-temporal information on the incoming signals to the recipient cell.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;
** Calcium-activated nonspecific cationic ([[Calcium-activated nonspecific cationic|CAN]]) mechanism is needed for giving constant activity and the synaptic [[stimulation]] alone does not induce persistent activity using the increasing conductance of [[NMDA]] mechanism. NMDA/ [[AMPA]] positively expands the range of persistent activity and negatively regulates the amount of CAN needed for constant activity.&lt;ref name="Information Processing" /&gt;

=== Midbrain dopaminergic neuron===

* [[:wikt:movement|Movement]], [[motivation]], [[attention]], neurological and [[psychiatric disorders]] and addictive behavior have a strong influence by [[Dopaminergic]] signalling.&lt;ref name = "Midbrain neuron"&gt;Kuznetsova, A. Y., Huertas, M. A., Kuznetsov, A. S., Paladini, C. A., &amp; Canavier, C. C. (2010). Regulation of firing frequency in a computational model of a midbrain dopaminergic neuron. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 28(3), 389–403.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The dopaminergic neurons have a low irregular basal firing frequency in 1–8&amp;nbsp;Hz range ''in vivo'' in the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) and [[substantia nigra pars compacta]] (SNc). This frequencies can dramatically increase in response to a cue predicting reward or unpredicted reward. The actions that preceded the reward are reinforced by this burst or phasic signal.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;
* The low safety factor for action potential generation gives a result of low maximal steady frequencies. The transient initial frequency in response to depolarizing pulse is controlled by rate of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation in distal dendrites.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;
* Results obtained from a mulch-compartmental model realistic with reconstructed morphology were similar. So, the salient contributions of the dendritic architecture have been captures by simpler model.&lt;ref name="Midbrain neuron" /&gt;

===Mode locking ===

* There are many important applications in neuroscience for [[Mode-locking]] response of excitable systems to periodic forcing. For example, The theta rhythm drives the spatially extended place cells in the [[hippocampus]] to generate a code giving information about spatial location. The role of neuronal dentrites in generating the response to periodic current injection can be explored by using a compartmental model (with linear dynamics for each compartment) coupled to an active soma model that generates action potentials.&lt;ref name = "Mode Locking"&gt;Svensson, C. M., &amp; Coombes, S. (2009). MODE LOCKING IN A SPATIALLY EXTENDED NEURON MODEL: ACTIVE SOMA AND COMPARTMENTAL TREE. International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 19(8), 2597–2607.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some findings:
** The response of whole neuron model i.e. soma and dendrites, can be written in closed form. The response of the spatially extended model to periodic forcing is described by [[Poincaré map|stroboscopic map]]. A [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArnoldTongue.html Arnol'd tongue] [[quasi-active]] model can be constructed with a [[linear stability]] [[analysis]] of the map with carefully treating the non-[[differentiability]] of [[soma (biology)|soma]] model.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The shape of the tongues is influenced by the presence of the quasi-active membrane.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The windows in parameter space for chaotic behavior can be enlarged with the resonant dendritic membrane.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;
** The response of the spatially extended neuron model to global forcing is different from that of point forcing.&lt;ref name="Mode Locking" /&gt;

===Compartmental neural simulations with spatial adaptivity===

* The computational cost of the method scales not with the physical size of the system being simulated but with the amount of activity present in the simulation. Spatial adaptivity for certain problems reduces up to 80%.&lt;ref name = "Compartmental neural simulations"&gt;Rempe, M. J., Spruston, N., Kath, W. L., &amp; Chopp, D. L. (2008). Compartmental neural simulations with spatial adaptivity. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 25(3), 465–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action potential (AP) initiation site===
* Establishing a unique site for AP initiation at the axon initial segment is no longer accepted. The APs can be initiated and comdected by different sub-regions of the neuron morphology, which widened the capabilities of individual neurons in computation.&lt;ref name = "axosomatodendritic"&gt;Ibarz, J. M., &amp; Herreras, O. (2003). A study of the action potential initiation site along the axosomatodendritic axis of neurons using compartmental models. In J. Mira &amp; J. R. Alvarez (Eds.), Computational Methods in Neural Modeling, Pt 1 (Vol. 2686, pp. 9–15).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Findings from a study of the Action Potential Initiation Site Along the Axosomatodendritic Axis of Neurons Using Compartmental Models:
** Dendritic APs are initiated  more effectively by synchronous spatially clustered inputs than equivalent disperse inputs.&lt;ref name=axosomatodendritic /&gt;
** The initiation site can also be determined by the average electrical distance from the dendritic input to the axon trigger zone, but it may be strongly modulated by the relative excitability of the two trigger zones and a number of factors.&lt;ref name=axosomatodendritic /&gt;

===A finite-state automaton model===

=== Multi-compartmental model of a CA1 pyramidal cell===

* To study changes in hippocampal excitability that result from aging-induced alterations in calcium-dependent membrane mechanisms, the multi-compartmental model of CA1 pyramidal cell can be used. We can model the aging-induced alterations in CA1 excitability can be  with simple coupling mechanisms that selectively link specific types of calcium channels to specific calcium-dependent potassium channels.&lt;ref name = "CA1 pyramidal cell"&gt;Markaki, M., Orphanoudakis, S., &amp; Poirazi, P. (2005). Modelling reduced excitability in aged CA1 neurons as a calcium-dependent process. Neurocomputing, 65, 305–314.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28217">'''Domestic terrorism''' or '''homegrown terrorism''' is [[terrorism]] targeting victims "within a country by a perpetrator with the same citizenship" as the victims.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Gary M. Jackson, ''Predicting Malicious Behavior: Tools and Techniques for Ensuring Global Security'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many [[definitions of terrorism]], and no universally  accepted definition. The [[United States Department of State]] defined terrorism in 2003 as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience."&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

==Definition==
While there are many potential definitions of domestic terrorism, it is largely defined as terrorism in which the perpetrator targets his/her own country. Enders &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Enders, Walter, Todd Sandler, and Khusrav Gaibulloev| title=Domestic versus transnational terrorism: Data, decomposition, and dynamics.|journal=Journal of Peace Research|edition=3|year=2011|pages=319–337|volume=48|doi=10.1177/0022343311398926}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines domestic terrorism as “homegrown in which the venue, target, and perpetrators are all from the same country. The term “homegrown terrorism” stems from [[Jihadism|jihadi]] terrorism against [[Western world|Westerners]]. Wilner and Dobouloz described homegrown terrorism as "autonomously organized radicalized Westerners with little direct assistance from transnational networks, usually organized within the home or host country, and targets fellow nationals." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Wilner, Alex S., and Claire-Jehanne Dubouloz. "Homegrown terrorism and transformative learning: an interdisciplinary approach to understanding radicalization." Global Change, Peace &amp; Security 22.1 (2010): 33-51.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Congressional Research Service]] report, ''American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'' describes homegrown terrorism as a “terrorist activity or plots perpetuated within the United States or abroad by American citizens, permanent legal residents, or visitors radicalized largely within the United States.”&lt;ref name="Bjelopera"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/R41416.pdf |title=p. 1. - Jerome P. Bjelopera and Mark A. Randol, '&amp;#39;American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'&amp;#39; (Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, December 7, 2010) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 2001 [[USA Patriot Act]], domestic terrorism is defined as "activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S."

==Facts &amp; Studies==
Homegrown terrorism is not new to the world. Security analysts have argued that after the end of the [[Cold War]], military conflicts have increasingly involved [[violent non-state actors]] carrying out [[asymmetric warfare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2011/08/29/non-state-conflict-and-the-transformation-of-war/|title=Non-State Conflict and the Transformation of War|work=E-International Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which terror attacks are one part.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/nic/nonstate_actors_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has uncovered a number of alleged terrorist plots that have been successfully suppressed through domestic intelligence and law enforcement. The United States has begun to account for the threat of homegrown terrorism, as shown by increased volume of literature on the subject in recent years and increased number of terrorist websites since [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the leader of al-Qaeda in [[Iraq]], began posting beheading videos in 2003.  A July 2009 document by the [[FBI]] estimated that there were roughly 15,000 websites and web forums that support terrorist activities, with around 10,000 of them actively maintained.  80% of these sites are on U.S.-based servers.&lt;ref name="J Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/suspected-american-terrorists-islamic-ties-causing-concern-law/story?id=11230885&amp;page=1 |title=Jason Ryan, Pierre Thomas, and Xorje Olivares, "American-bred Terrorism Causing Alarm for Law Enforcement," ABC News.com July 22, 2010 |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Congressional Research Service’s study, ''American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat,'' between May 2009 and November 2010, law enforcement made arrests related to 22 homegrown jihadist-inspired terror plots by American citizens or legal residents of the U.S.  This is a significant increase over the 21 plots caught in the seven interim years after the [[September 11 attacks]]. During these seven years, two plots resulted in attacks, compared to the two attacks between May 2009 and November 2010, which resulted in 14 deaths.  This spike post-May 2009 shows that some Americans are susceptible to ideologies that support a violent form of jihad.&lt;ref name="Bjelopera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/terrorism/threat-homegrown-islamist-terrorism/p11509#p4 |title=Toni Johnson, "Threat of Homegrown Islamist Terrorism," Council on Foreign Relations, December 10, 2010 |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly one-quarter of these plots have been linked to major international terrorist groups but an increasing number of Americans are holding high-level operational roles in these terrorist groups, especially [[al-Qaeda]] and its affiliated groups.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bipartisan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/NSPG%20Final%20Threat%20Assessment.pdf |title=Peter Bergen and Bruce Hoffman, "Assessing the Terrorist Threat," Bipartisan Policy Center, September 10, 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;[https://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/2010/RAND_OP292.pdf Brian Michael Jenkins, "Terrorist Radicalization in the United States Since September 11, 2001," RAND Corporation, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] called homegrown terrorism the more serious threat faced by American citizens today.&lt;ref name="Hayden"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yager |first=Jordy |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/110759-former-intel-chief-homegrown-terrorism-is-a-devil-of-a-problem |title=Jordy Yager, "Former intel chief: Homegrown terrorism is a ‘devil of a problem,’" '&amp;#39;The Hill'&amp;#39;, July 25, 2010 |publisher=Thehill.com |date=2010-07-25 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK, likewise, considers homegrown terrorism to be a considerable threat.  On June 6, 2011, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] announced a wide-ranging strategy to prevent British citizens from being radicalized into becoming terrorists while at university.  The strategy is intended to prevent extremist speakers or groups from coming to universities.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/uk/cameron-plans-to-crack-down-on-home-grown-terrorism-1.817900 |title=Brendan Carlin and Abul Taher, "Cameron plans to crack down on home-grown terrorism," gulfnews.com, June 6, 2011 |publisher=Gulfnews.com |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lone Wolf ===
Domestic terrorism is often linked to "lone wolf" terrorism. Sociologist Ramón Spaaij defines lone wolf terrorism as an act of terrorism committed by one person who "acts on his or her own without orders from—or even connections to an organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spaaij|first=Ramón|date=2010|title=The enigma of lone wolf terrorism: An assessment.|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2010.501426|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|volume=33|issue=9|pages=854–870.|doi=10.1080/1057610X.2010.501426}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 20th to early 21st century lone wolf terrorism in the United States has been primarily associated with white supremacy, Islamic fundamentalism, anti-social, and anti-government extremists in the United States such as [[Charles Whitman]], [[Timothy McVeigh|Tim McVeigh]], [[Dylann Roof]], [[Ted Kaczynski]], [[Eric Rudolph]], [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris]], [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold#Dylan Klebold|Dylan Klebold]], [[James Holmes (mass murderer)|James Holmes]], [[Omar Mateen]], and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev|Tamerlan]] and [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]]. Many lone wolves share a common trait in that they seek acceptance from other groups but are typically met with rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Springer|first=Nathan R.|date=2009|title=Patterns of radicalization: Identifying the markers and warning signs of domestic lone wolf terrorists in our midst.|url=http://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/4340|journal=Naval Postgraduate School (thesis)|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2007 book ''Hunting the American Terrorist'' former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Terry Turchie and former FBI special agent Kathleen Puckett described six criteria to define a lone wolf:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hunting_the_American_Terrorist.html?id=vXl1AAAACAAJ|title=Hunting the American Terrorist: The FBI's War on Homegrown Terror|last=Turchie|first=Terry D.|last2=Puckett|first2=Kathleen M.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=History Publishing Company|isbn=9781933909349|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The act of terrorism was organized by few or only one person that was not operating with an organized group
# The individual is willing to use lethal violence to achieve their goal
# Their primary goal is ideological, political, or religious in scope
# The individual is willing to accept that [[collateral damage]] may occur
# The individual is not intending to commit suicide, unless the situation calls for it
# The individual is intending to commit homicide in order to get their message public

== Radicalization ==
There is no one path toward violence.  Homegrown terrorists have been high school dropouts, college graduates, members of the military, and cover the range of financial situations. Recent research by Matt Qvortrup in the British ''Journal of Politics and International Relations'' has suggested that domestic terrorism is a result of lack of opportunities for meaningful political engagement. Some domestic terrorists studied overseas and were exposed to radical Islamist thought, while others took their inspiration from the [[internet]].&lt;ref name="Congressional Panel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110310/NEWS08/110310022/2067/Saudi-police-open-fire-during-protest/Congressional-panel-homegrown-terrorism-divided-discussion-?odyssey=mod_sectionstories|title=Associated Press, "Congressional Panel on Homegrown Terrorism Divided on Discussion," March 10, 2011|date=|publisher=Tennessean.com|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marc Sageman]] writes in his book, ''Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century'' that, contrary to popular belief, radicalization into terrorism is not the product of poverty, various forms of brainwashing, youth, ignorance, lack of education, lack of employment, lack of social responsibility, criminality, or mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Sageman, ''Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century,'' (Philadelphia, PA: University Of Pennsylvania Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He says that intermediaries and English-speaking imams, such as the late Yemeni-American cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] (d. 2011), who are often found through the internet on forums, provide key roles in the [[radicalization]] process.  Social networks provided in forums support and build upon an individual’s radical beliefs.  Prison systems are also a concern as a place of radicalization and jihadist recruiting; nearly three dozen ex-convicts who attended training camps in Yemen were believed to have been radicalized in prison.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;  The only constant appears to be "a newfound hatred for their native or adopted country, a degree of dangerous malleability, and a religious fervor justifying or legitimizing violence that impels these very impressionable and perhaps easily influenced individuals toward potentially lethal acts of violence," according to Peter Bergen and Bruce Hoffman's September 2010 paper for the Bipartisan Policy Center.&lt;ref name="Bipartisan" /&gt;

==Training==
Training for potential homegrown terrorists is often very fast paced, or rushed, as some groups under attack by U.S. forces may feel the need to implement operations “more precipitously than they might otherwise occur,” according to [[Bruce Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Hoffman, Bruce. "Rethinking terrorism and counterterrorism since 9/11." Studies in Conflict and Terrorism 25.5 (2002): 303-316.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the case with the failed [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt|Times Square plot]] carried out by [[Faisal Shazad]]. [[Pakistani Taliban]] (TPP) was on record as providing financing and four months of training for Shazad directly prior to his actions in Times Square. Shazad reportedly received only three to five days of training in bomb-making.

Some individuals go abroad to a region containing extremism, predominantly Pakistan, but also Iraq, Afghanistan,Yemen or Somalia.  In the case of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London Underground bombers]], [[Mohammad Sidique Khan]], the operational leader of the cell, received military and explosives training at a camp in [[Malakand District|Malakand]], [[Pakistan]] in July 2003. Later he took [[Shezad Tanweer]] to Karachi, Pakistan, in late 2004 to February 2005 where they crossed the border to receive training at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homelandsecurity.org/hsireports/Reasons_for_Terrorist_Success_Failure.pdf p. 33 - Edward McCleskey, Diana McCord, and Jennifer Leetz, “Underlying Reasons for the Success and Failure of Terrorist Attacks.” (Arlington, VA: Homeland Security Institute, June 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719234840/http://www.homelandsecurity.org/hsireports/Reasons_for_Terrorist_Success_Failure.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training and usage of recruits is varied.  Some, such as Shahzad, received little training and ultimately failed in their goals. Others, like the sleeper agent [[David Headley]]’s reconnaissance efforts, were essential towards [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]]’s (LeT) success in the November [[2008 Mumbai attacks]].

Scholars say that some lone wolves may achieve objectives, but the vast majority of individual operators fail to execute their plans because of lack of training and planning. There is also a question as to whether such individuals are radical, or suffering other problems. The American convert, Abdulhakim Muhammad (née Carlos Bledsoe), who [[2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting|killed a U.S. military recruiter]] in Little Rock, Arkansas, and wounded another, had many other targets and plans, which went awry. It was not until some time after his arrest that he first claimed to have been working for [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP). But, investigators found no evidence of this. The lead county prosecutor said that, aside from Muhammad's self-serving statements, it was "just an awful killing", like others he had seen.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dao |first=James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/us/17convert.html |title=A Muslim Son, a Murder Trial and Many Questions |location=Arkansas;Yemen |publisher=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bledsoe's father described his son as "unable to process reality."&lt;ref name=nytterror&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp|title=Man Claims Terror Ties in Little Rock Shooting|last=Dao|first=James|date=January 21, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100125152356/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22littlerock.html?hp| archivedate= 25 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with capital murder and related charges, not terrorism, and pleaded guilty.

The American [[Nidal Hasan]], the US Army major and psychiatrist charged in the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]], had come to the attention of colleagues and superiors years before the shootings; they documented their concerns about his mental state. The Department of Defense has classified the event as "workplace violence" rather than terrorism, pending Hasan's court martial. Some observers believe that his personal characteristics are more like those of other [[mass murder]]ers than terrorists; he did not belong to any group.

The Somalian [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabab]] (“the youth”) have recruited strongly in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.  The 30+ Somali-Americans received training by senior al-Qaeda leaders in [[Somalia]].  Hoffman believes this indicates that radicalization and recruitment is not an isolated, lone-wolf phenomenon unique to Somali-Americans, but that there is terrorist recruitment infrastructure in the United States.&lt;ref name="Hoffmantestimony"&gt;[http://www.homelandsecurity.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20100526101502-95237.pdf Hoffman, Bruce, “Internet Terror Recruitment And Tradecraft: How Can We Address An Evolving Tool While Protecting Free Speech?,”  House Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment, May 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a dozen of 20 American recruits were killed in fighting in Somalia, the number of Americans going to join Al-Shabab has declined since 2007-2008.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmitt |first=Eric |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/nyregion/07shabaab.html?src=mv |title=Al Shabab Recruits Americans for Somali Civil War |publisher= The New York Times |date= June 6, 2010|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the internet==
“The Internet is a driver and enabler for the process of radicalization”, says a report of the Police Department of the City of New York of 2007.&lt;ref name=NYP,2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/files/NYPD_Report-Radicalization_in_the_West.pdf |title="Radicalization in the West: The Homegrown Threat." (New York Police Department, 2007) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=23 November 2014}} (pages 8-9)&lt;/ref&gt; The internet has a wide appeal as it provides an anonymous way for like-minded, conflicted individuals to meet, form virtual relations, and discuss the radical and extremist ideology they encounter.  The virtual network created in message boards or private forums further radicalizes and cements the jihadi-Salafi/racial supremacist message individuals have encountered as they build a community.
The internet acts as an enabler, providing the aspiring jihadist/supremacist with a forum in which they may plan, share information on targets, weapons, and recruit others into their plans.  Much of the resources needed to make weapons can be found on-line.&lt;ref name=NYP,2007/&gt;

===''Inspire''===
''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'' is an online English-language propaganda magazine published by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).  Purported to be created by Samir Khan, a U.S. citizen and cyber-jihadist, the magazine uses American idioms and phrasing and does not appear to have British or South Asian influences in its language.&lt;ref name="stratfor"&gt;{{cite web|author=Security Weekly |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100721_fanning_flames_jihad |title=Scott Stewart, "Fanning the Flames of Jihad." STRATFOR (July 22, 2010) |publisher=Stratfor.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine contains messages calling for western jihadists, like this one from AQAP leader Nasir al-Wahayshi, "to acquire weapons and learn methods of war. They are living in a place where they can cause great harm to the enemy and where they can support the Messenger of Allah... The means of harming them are many so seek assistance from Allah and do not be weak and you will find a way.”&lt;ref name="stratfor" /&gt;

STRATFOR suggests that the magazine is meant to "fan the flames of Jihad."&lt;ref name="stratfor" /&gt;

In [[psychology]], a '''dual process theory''' provides an account of how thought can arise in two different ways, or as a result of two different processes. Often, the two processes consist of an implicit (automatic), [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] process and an explicit (controlled), [[consciousness|conscious]] process. Verbalized explicit processes or attitudes and actions may change with persuasion or education; though implicit process or attitudes usually take a long amount of time to change with the forming of new habits. Dual process theories can be found in social, personality, cognitive, and clinical psychology. It has also been linked with economics via [[prospect theory]] and [[behavioral economics]], and increasingly in [[sociology]] through cultural analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaisey|first=Stephen|date=2009-05-01|title=Motivation and Justification: A Dual‐Process Model of Culture in Action|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/citedby/10.1086/597179|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=114|issue=6|pages=1675–1715|doi=10.1086/597179|issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lizardo|first=Omar|last2=Mowry|first2=Robert|last3=Sepulvado|first3=Brandon|last4=Stoltz|first4=Dustin S.|last5=Taylor|first5=Marshall A.|last6=Ness|first6=Justin Van|last7=Wood|first7=Michael|date=2016-12-30|title=What Are Dual Process Models?

==History==
The foundations of dual process theory likely comes from [[William James]]. He believed that there were two different kinds of thinking: associative and true reasoning. James theorized that empirical thought was used for things like art and design work. For James, images and thoughts would come to mind of past experiences, providing ideas of comparison or abstractions. He claimed that associative knowledge was only from past experiences describing it as "only reproductive". James believed that true reasoning was useful for "unprecedented situations" in which using reasoning to overcome obstacles such as navigation could be overcome with reasoning power of being able to use a map.

There are various dual process theories that were produced after William James's work. Dual process models are very common in the study of [[social psychology|social psychological]] variables, such as [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] change. Examples include Petty and Cacioppo's [[elaboration likelihood model]] explained briefly below and Chaiken's [[Heuristic-systematic model of information processing|heuristic systematic model]]. According to these models, persuasion may occur after either intense scrutiny or extremely superficial thinking. In [[cognitive psychology]], attention and working memory have also been conceptualized as relying on two distinct processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = L.

W. | year = 2004 | title = Individual differences in working memory capacity and dual-process theories of the mind | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 130 | issue = | pages = 553–573 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.4.553 | pmid=15250813 | pmc=1351135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the focus be on social psychology or cognitive psychology, there are many examples of dual process theories produced throughout the past. The following just show a glimpse into the variety that can be found.

Jonathan Evans suggested dual process theory in 1975. In his theory, there are two distinct types of processes: heuristic processes and analytic processes. He suggested that during heuristic processes, an individual chooses which information is relevant to the current situation. Relevant information is then processed further whereas irrelevant information is not. Following the heuristic processes come analytic processes. During analytic processes, the relevant information that is chosen during the heuristic processes is then used to make judgments about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=Jonathan|title=Heuristic and analytic processes in reasoning|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=1984|volume=75|pages=451–468|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1984.tb01915.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard E. Petty]] and [[John Cacioppo]] proposed a dual process theory focused in the field of social psychology in 1986. Their theory is called the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion. In their theory, there are two different routes to persuasion in making decisions. The first route is known as the central route and this takes place when a person is thinking carefully about a situation, elaborating on the information they are given, and creating an argument. This route occurs when an individual's motivation and ability are high. The second route is known as the peripheral route and this takes place when a person is not thinking carefully about a situation and uses shortcuts to make judgments. This route occurs when an individual's motivation or ability are low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petty|first=Richard|author2=Cacioppo, John|title=The Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|year=1986|volume=19|pages=123–181|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60214-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Sloman produced another interpretation on dual processing in 1996. He believed that associative reasoning takes stimuli and divides it into logical clusters of information based on statistical regularity. He proposed that how you associate is directly proportional to the similarity of past experiences, relying on temporal and similarity relations to determine reasoning rather than an underlying mechanical structure. The other reasoning process in Sloman's opinion was of the Rule-based system. The system functioned on logical structure and variables based upon rule systems to come to conclusions different from that of the associative system.  He also believed that the  Rule-based system had control over the associative system, though it could only suppress it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sloman | first1 = S.A. | year = 1996 | title = The empirical case for two systems of reasoning | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 3–22 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interpretation corresponds well to earlier work on computational models of dual processes of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, R. (1994). "Integrating Rules and Connectionism for Robust Commonsense Reasoning." John Wiley and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Kahneman]] provided further interpretation by differentiating the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning in 2003. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahneman | first1 = D | year = 2003 | title = A perspective on judgement and choice | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 697–720 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.58.9.697 | pmid=14584987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fritz Strack and Roland Deutsch proposed another dual process theory focused in the field of social psychology in 2004. According to their model, there are two separate systems: the reflective system and the impulsive system. In the reflective system, decisions are made using knowledge and the information that is coming in from the situation is processed. On the other hand, in the impulsive system, decisions are made using schemes and there is little or no thought required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strack|first=Fritz|author2=Deutsch, Roland|title=Reflective and Impulsive Determinants of Social Behavior|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=220–247|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Dual process learning model===
[[Ron Sun]] proposed a dual process model of learning (both implicit learning and explicit learning). The model (named [[CLARION]]) re-interpreted voluminous behavioral data in psychological studies of implicit learning and skill acquisition in general. The resulting theory is two-level and interactive, based on the idea of the interaction of one-shot explicit rule learning (i.e., explicit learning) and gradual implicit tuning through reinforcement (i.e. implicit learning), and it accounts for many previously unexplained cognitive data and phenomena based on the interaction of implicit and explicit learning.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, R. (2002). ''Duality of the Mind''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual coding===
Using a somewhat different approach, [[Allan Paivio]] has developed a [[dual-coding theory]] of information processing. According to this model, cognition involves the coordinated activity of two independent, but connected systems, a nonverbal system and a verbal system that is specialized to deal with language. The nonverbal system is hypothesized to have developed earlier in [[evolution]]. Both systems rely on different areas of the brain. Paivio has reported evidence that nonverbal, visual images are processed more efficiently and are approximately twice as memorable. Additionally, the verbal and nonverbal systems are additive, so one can improve memory by using both types of information during learning.&lt;ref&gt;Paivio, A. (2007). ''Mind and its evolution: A dual coding theoretical approach''. Mahwah, NJ. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual-process accounts of reasoning===

====Background====
The dual-process accounts of reasoning posits that there are two systems or minds in one brain. The theory of two distinct kinds of reasoning has been around for as long as documentations about theories of reasoning go. The current theory is that there are two distinctively separate cognitive systems underlying thinking and reasoning and that these different systems were developed through evolution.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=J.|title=In two minds: dual-process accounts of reasoning|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2003|volume=7|issue=10|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2003.08.012|pages=454–459}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are often referred to as "implicit" and "explicit" or by the more neutral "System 1" and "System 2," as coined by Stanovich and West.&lt;ref name="Stanovich&amp;West"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanovich|first=K E.|author2=West, R F.|title=Individual difference in reasoning: implications for the rationality debate?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=2000|volume=23|pages=645–726|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00003435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systems====
The systems have multiple names by which they can be called, as well as many different properties.

=====System 1=====
Bargh (1994) reconceptualized the notion of an automatic process by breaking down the term "automatic" into four components: awareness, intentionality, efficiency, and controllability.  One way for a process to be labeled as automatic is for the person to be unaware of it.  There are three ways in which a person may be unaware of a mental process: they can be unaware of the presence of the stimulus (subliminal), how the stimulus is categorized or interpreted (unaware of the activation of stereotype or trait constructs), or the effect the stimulus has on the person's judgments or actions (misattribution).  Another way for a mental process to be labeled as automatic is for it to be unintentional.  Intentionality refers to the conscious "start up" of a process.  An automatic process may begin without the person consciously willing it to start.  The third component of automaticity is efficiency.  Efficiency refers to the amount of cognitive resources required for a process.  An automatic process is efficient because it requires few resources.  The fourth component is controllability, referring to the person's conscious ability to stop a process.  An automatic process is uncontrollable, meaning that the process will run until completion and the person will not be able to stop it.  Bargh (1994) conceptualizes automaticity as a component view (any combination awareness, intention, efficiency, and control) as opposed to the historical concept of automaticity as an all-or-none dichotomy.&lt;ref name="Bargh"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bargh |first=J.A.|date=1994| title=The Four Horsemen of Automaticity: Awareness, Intention, Efficiency, and Control in Social Cognition | journal=Handbook of Social Cognition | publisher=R. Wyer &amp; T. Srull| pages=1–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One takeaway from the psychological research on dual process theory is that our System 1 (intuition) is more accurate in areas where we’ve gathered a lot of data with reliable and fast feedback, like social dynamics.&lt;ref name="Conceptually"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://conceptually.org/concepts/dual-processing-theory/ |access-date = October 23, 2018| title=What is dual process theory? | publisher=Conceptually.org| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====System 2 in humans=====
System 2 is evolutionarily recent and specific to humans. It is also known as the ''explicit'' system, the ''rule-based'' system, the ''rational'' system,&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt; or the ''analytic'' system.&lt;ref name=Tsujii&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsujii|first=T.|author2=Watanabe, S.|title=Neural correlates of dual-task effect on belief-bias syllogistic reasoning: a near-infrared spectroscopy study|journal=Brain Research|year=2009|volume=1287|pages=118–125|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2009.06.080|pmid=19577547}}&lt;/ref&gt; It performs the more slow and sequential thinking. It is domain-general, performed in the central working memory system. Because of this, it has a limited capacity and is slower than System 1 which correlates it with general intelligence.  It is known as the rational system because it reasons according to logical standards.&lt;ref name=Tsujii /&gt; Some overall properties associated with System 2 are that it is rule-based, analytic, controlled, demanding of cognitive capacity, and slow.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;

==Social psychology==
The dual process has impact on social psychology in such domains as stereotyping, categorization, and judgment. Especially, the study of [[automaticity]] and of implicit in dual process theories has the most influence on a person's perception. People usually perceive other people's information and categorize them by age, gender, race, or role. According to Neuberg and Fiske (1987) a perceiver who receives a good amount of information about the target person then will use their formal mental category (Unconscious) as a basis for judging the person. When the perceiver is distracted, the perceiver has to pay more attention to target information (Conscious).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jonathan | first1 = St. Evans | year = 2007 | title = Dual-processing accounts of reasoning, judgment, and social cognition | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 268–269 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093629 | pmid=18154502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Categorization is the basic process of stereotyping in which people are categorized into social groups that have specific stereotypes associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macrae | first1 = C.N. | last2 = Bodenhausen | first2 = G.V. | year = 2000 | title = Social cognition: Thinking categorically about others | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 93–120 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.93 | pmid=10751966}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to retrieve people's judgment automatically without subjective intention or effort. Attitude can also be activated spontaneously by the object. [[John Bargh]]'s study offered an alternative view, holding that essentially all attitudes, even weak ones are capable of automatic activation. Whether the attitude is formed automatically or operates with effort and control, it can still bias further processing of information about the object and direct the perceivers' actions with regard to the target. According to [[Shelly Chaiken]], heuristic processing is the activation and application of judgmental rules and heuristics are presumed to be learned and stored in memory. It is used when people are making accessible decisions such as "experts are always right" (system 1) and systematic processing is inactive when individuals make effortful scrutiny of all the relevant information which requires cognitive thinking (system 2).&lt;ref&gt;Eliot R. Smith and Jamie DeCoster (2000) Personality and Social Psychology Review. Society for Personality and Social Psychology, 119&lt;/ref&gt; The [[heuristic]] and [[systematics|systematic]] processing then influence the domain of attitude change and social influence.
[[Unconscious thought theory]] is the counterintuitive and contested view that the unconscious mind is adapted to highly complex decision making. Where most dual system models define complex reasoning as the domain of effortful conscious thought,  UTT argues complex issues are best dealt with unconsciously.

===Stereotyping===
Dual process models of stereotyping  propose that when we perceive an individual, salient [[stereotypes]] pertaining to them are activated automatically. These activated representations will then guide behavior if no other motivation or cognition take place. However, controlled cognitive processes can inhibit the use of stereotypes when there is motivation and cognitive resources to do so. Devine (1989) provided evidence for the dual process theory of stereotyping in a series of three studies. Study 1 linked found prejudice (according to the Modern Racism Scale) was unrelated to knowledge of cultural stereotypes of African Americans. Study 2 showed that subjects used automatically-activated stereotypes in judgments regardless of prejudice level (personal belief). Participants were primed with stereotype relevant or non-relevant words and then asked to give hostility ratings of a target with an unspecified race who was performing ambiguously hostile behaviors. Regardless of prejudice level, participants who were primed with more stereotype-relevant words gave higher hostility ratings to the ambiguous target. Study 3 investigated whether people can control stereotype use by activating personal beliefs. Low-prejudice participants asked to list African Americans listed more positive examples than did those high in prejudice.&lt;ref name = "Devine"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Devine |first=Patricia |date=1989 |title=Stereotypes and Prejudice: Their Automatic and Controlled Components |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=58 |pages=5–18|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terror management theory and the dual process model===
According to psychologists Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &amp; Solomon, the dual process model, in relation to [[terror management theory]], identifies two systems by which the brain manages fear of death: distal and proximal.&lt;ref name="Pyszczynski1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | year = 1999 | title = A dual-process model of defense against conscious and unconscious death-related thoughts: An extension of terror management theory | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 835–845 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distal defenses fall under the system 1 category because it is unconscious whereas proximal defenses fall under the system 2 category because it operates with conscious thought.

|}

===Dual process and habituation===
Habituation can be described as decreased response to a repeated stimulus. According to Groves and Thompson, the process of habituation also mimics a dual process. The dual process theory of behavioral habituation relies on two underlying (non-behavioral) processes; depression and facilitation with the relative strength of one over the other determining whether or not habituation or sensitization is seen in the behavior. Habituation weakens the intensity of a repeated stimulus over time subconsciously. As a result, a person will give the stimulus less conscious attention over time. Conversely, sensitization subconsciously strengthens a stimulus over time, giving the stimulus more conscious attention. Though these two systems are not both conscious, they interact to help people understand their surroundings by strengthening some stimuli and diminishing others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groves | first1 = P. M. | last2 = Thompson | first2 = R.

===Dual process and steering cognition===
According to Walker, system 1 functions as a serial cognitive steering processor for system 2, rather than a parallel system. In large-scale repeated studies with school students, Walker tested how students adjusted their imagined self-operation in different curriculum subjects of maths, science and English. He showed that students consistently adjust the biases of their heuristic self-representation to specific states for the different curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name="Human Ecology Education UK"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Simon|year=2015|title=Thinking, straight or true?|url=http://simonpwalker.com/#/research-publications/4587873262|publisher=Human Ecology Education UK|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model of cognitive steering proposes that, in order to process epistemically varied environmental data, a heuristic orientation system is required to align varied, incoming environmental data with existing neural algorithmic processes. The brain's associative simulation capacity, centered around the imagination, plays an integrator role to perform this function. Evidence for early-stage concept formation and future self-operation within the hippocampus supports the model,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Addis|first1=Donna R|last2=Schacter|first2=Daniel L|title=The Hippocampus and Imagining the Future: Where Do We Stand?|journal=Front. Hum. Neurosci.|date=2012|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00173}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumaran|first1=Dharsan|last2=Summerfield|first2=Jennifer J|last3=Hassabis|first3=Demis|last4=Maguire|first4=Eleanor A|title=Tracking the Emergence of Conceptual Knowledge during Human Decision Making.|journal=Neuron|date=2009|volume=63|issue=6|pages=889–901|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.07.030|pmid=19778516|pmc=2791172}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the cognitive steering model, a conscious state emerges from effortful associative simulation, required to align novel data accurately with remote memory, via later algorithmic processes. By contrast, fast unconscious automaticity is constituted by unregulated simulatory biases, which induce errors in subsequent algorithmic processes. The phrase ‘rubbish in, rubbish out' is used to explain errorful heuristic processing: errors will always occur if the accuracy of initial retrieval and location of data is poorly self-regulated.

===Application in economic behavior===
According to Alos-Ferrer and Strack the dual-process theory has relevance in economic decision-making through the multiple-selves model, in which one person's self-concept is composed of multiple selves depending on the context. An example of this is someone who as a student is hard working and intelligent, but as a sibling is caring and supportive.  Decision-making involves the use of both automatic and controlled processes, but also depends on the person and situation, and given a person's experiences and current situation the decision process may differ.  Given that there are two decision processes with differing goals one is more likely to be more useful in particular situations. For example, a person is presented with a decision involving a selfish but rational motive and a social motive. Depending on the individual one of the motives will be more appealing than the other, but depending on the situation the preference for one motive or the other may change. Using the dual-process theory it is important to consider whether one motive is more automatic than the other, and in this particular case the automaticity would depend on the individual and their experiences. A selfish person may choose the selfish motive with more automaticity than a non-selfish person, and yet a controlled process may still outweigh this based on external factors such as the situation, monetary gains, or societal pressure.  Although there is likely to be a stable preference for which motive one will select based on the individual it is important to remember that external factors will influence the decision.  Dual process theory also provides a different source of behavioral heterogeneity in economics.  It is mostly assumed within economics that this heterogeneity comes from differences in taste and rationality, while dual process theory indicates necessary considerations of which processes are automated and how these different processes may interact within decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alos-Ferrer | first1 = C. | last2 = Strack | first2 = F. | year = 2014 | title = From dual processes to multiple selves: Implications for economic behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 1–11 | doi=10.1016/j.joep.2013.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

===Belief bias effect===
A [[belief bias]] is the tendency to judge the strength of [[argument]]s based on the plausibility of their conclusion rather than how strongly they support that conclusion.&lt;ref name="SternbergLeighton2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert J. Sternberg|author2=Jacqueline P. Leighton|title=The Nature of Reasoning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujoNZNZrZcoC&amp;pg=PA300|accessdate=3 September 2013|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00928-7|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence suggests that this bias results from competition between logical (System 2) and belief-based (System 1) processes during evaluation of arguments.

Studies on belief-bias effect were first designed by Jonathan Evans to create a conflict between logical reasoning and prior knowledge about the truth of conclusions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Participants are asked to evaluate [[syllogism]]s that are: valid arguments with believable conclusions, valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, invalid arguments with believable conclusions, and invalid arguments with unbelievable conclusions.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt; Participants are told to only agree with conclusions that logically follow from the premises given. The results suggest when the conclusion is believable, people erroneously accept invalid conclusions as valid more often than invalid arguments are accepted which support unpalatable conclusions. This is taken to suggest that System 1 beliefs are interfering with the logic of System 2.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;

===Tests with working memory===
De Neys&lt;ref name="De Neys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Neys|first=W.|title=Dual processing in reasoning: two systems but one reasoner|journal=Psychological Science|year=2006|volume=17|issue=5|pages=428–433|jstor=40064560|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01723.x|pmid=16683931}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study that manipulated [[working memory]] capacity while answering syllogistic problems. This was done by burdening executive processes with secondary tasks. Results showed that when System 1 triggered the correct response, the distractor task had no effect on the production of a correct answer which supports the fact that System 1 is automatic and works independently of working memory, but when belief-bias was present (System 1 belief-based response was different from the logically correct System 2 response) the participants performance was impeded by the decreased availability of working memory. This falls in accordance with the knowledge about System 1 and System 2 of the dual-process accounts of reasoning because System 1 was shown to work independent of working memory, and System 2 was impeded due to a lack of working memory space so System 1 took over which resulted in a belief-bias.&lt;ref name="De Neys" /&gt;

===fMRI studies===
[[File:Researcher-test.jpg|thumb|right|alt=researcher looking at fMRI test|Researcher conducting ''[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]]'' test.]]
Vinod Goel and others produced neuropsychological evidence for dual-process accounts of reasoning using [[fMRI]]&lt;ref name="Goel et al." /&gt; studies. They provided evidence that anatomically distinct parts of the brain were responsible for the two different kinds of reasoning. They found that content-based reasoning caused left temporal hemisphere activation whereas abstract formal problem reasoning activated the parietal system. They concluded that different kinds of reasoning, depending on the semantic content, activated one of two different systems in the brain.&lt;ref name="Goel et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goel|first1=V.|last2=Bruchel|first2=C. |last3=Frith|first3=C. |last4=Dolan|first4=R.|title=Dissociation of mechanisms underlying syllogistic reasoning |journal=NeuroImage |year=2000 |volume=12 |issue=5 |doi=10.1006/nimg.2000.0636 |pages=504–514 |pmid=11034858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar study incorporated fMRI during a belief-bias test.&lt;ref name="Goel&amp;Dolan" /&gt; They found that different mental processes were competing for control of the response to the problems given in the belief-bias test. The prefrontal cortex was critical in detecting and resolving conflicts, which are characteristic of System 2, and had already been associated with that System 2. The ventral medial prefrontal cortex, known to be associated with the more intuitive or heuristic responses of System 1, was the area in competition with the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name="Goel&amp;Dolan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goel|first=V.|author2=Dolan, R.|title=Explaining modulation of reasoning by belief|journal=Cognition|year=2003|volume=87|issue=1|pages=B11-B22|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00185-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-infrared spectroscopy===
Tsujii and Watanabe&lt;ref name=Tsujii /&gt; did a follow-up study to Goel and Dolan's&lt;ref name="Goel&amp;Dolan" /&gt; fMRI experiment. They examined the neural correlates on the inferior frontal cortex (IFC) activity in belief-bias reasoning using [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] (NIRS). Subjects performed a syllogistic reasoning task, using congruent and incongruent syllogisms, while attending to an attention-demanding secondary task. The interest of the researchers was in how the secondary-tasks changed the activity of the IFC during congruent and incongruent reasoning processes. The results showed that the participants performed better in the congruent test than in the incongruent test (evidence for belief bias); the high demand secondary test impaired the incongruent reasoning more than it impaired the congruent reasoning. NIRS results showed that the right IFC was activated more during incongruent trials. Participants with enhanced right IFC activity performed better on the incongruent reasoning than those with decreased right IFC activity. This study provided some evidence to enhance the fMRI results that the right IFC, specifically, is critical in resolving conflicting reasoning, but that it is also attention-demanding; its effectiveness decreases with loss of attention. The loss of effectiveness in System 2 following loss of attention makes the automatic heuristic System 1 take over, which results in belief bias.&lt;ref name=Tsujii /&gt;

===Matching bias===
Matching bias is a non-logical heuristic.&lt;ref name="Evans matching bias"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=J.St.B.T.|author2=P. Legrenzi |author3=V. Girotto |title=The influence of linguistic form on reasoning: the case of matching bias|journal=[[The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology]]|year=1999|volume=52|issue=1|pages=185–216|doi=10.1080/713755805}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matching bias is described as a tendency to use lexical content matching of the statement about which one is reasoning, to be seen as relevant information and do the opposite as well, ignore relevant information that doesn't match. It mostly affects problems with abstract content. It doesn't involve prior knowledge and beliefs but it is still seen as a System 1 heuristic that competes with the logical System 2.&lt;ref name="Evans matching bias" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Wason selection task cards.png|thumb|left|alt=Wason selection card test|Example of the ''[[Wason selection task]]''.]]
The [[Wason selection task]] provides evidence for the matching bias.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt; The test is designed as a measure of a person's logical thinking ability.&lt;ref name="F&amp;S book"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Friedenberg, J.|author2=Silverman, G.|title=Cognitive Science|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications Inc.|location=L.A.|isbn=978-1-4129-7761-6|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance on the Wason Selection Task is sensitive to the content and context with which it is presented. If you introduce a negative component into the conditional statement of the Wason Selection Task, e.g. 'If there is an A one side of the card then there is not a 3 on the other side', there is a strong tendency to choose cards that match the items in the negative condition to test, regardless of their logical status. Changing the test to be a test of following rules rather than truth and falsity is another condition where the participants will ignore the logic because they will simply follow the rule, e.g. changing the test to be a test of a police officer looking for underaged drinkers.&lt;ref name="Evans matching bias" /&gt; The original task is more difficult because it requires explicit and abstract logical thought from System 2, and the police officer test is cued by relevant prior knowledge from System 1.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;

Studies have shown that you can train people to inhibit matching bias which provides neuropsychological evidence for the dual-process theory of reasoning.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; When you compare trials before and after the training there is evidence for a forward shift in activated brain area. Pre-test results showed activation in locations along the ventral pathway and post-test results showed activation around the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate.&lt;ref name="Houde"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houde|first1=O.|last2=Zago|first2=L. |last3=Mellet|first3=E. |last4=Moutier|first4=S. |last5=Pineau|first5=A. |last6=Mazoyer|first6=B. |last7=Tzourio|first7=N.-Mazoyer|title=Shifting from the perceptual brain to the logical brain: the neural impact of cognitive inhibition training|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2000|volume=12|issue=5|pages=721–728|doi=10.1162/089892900562525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matching bias has also been shown to generalise to syllogistic reasoning.&lt;ref name="Stupple"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stupple|first=E.|author2=Waterhouse|title=Negations in syllogistic reasoning: Evidence for a heuristic–analytic conflict|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2009|volume=62|issue=8|DOI=10.1080/17470210902785674|pages=1533–1541|url=https://derby.openrepository.com/derby/bitstream/10545/575927/1/Negations_in_syllogistic_reasoning_evidence_for_a_heuristic_analytic_conflict.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
Dual-process theorists claim that System 2, a general purpose reasoning system, evolved late and worked alongside the older autonomous sub-systems of System 1.&lt;ref name=Mithen&gt;{{cite book|last=Mithen|first=S.|title=The Cognitive Basis of Science|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0521812291|pages=23–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''Homo sapiens'' lends evidence to their higher cognitive abilities above other hominids. Mithen theorizes that the increase in cognitive ability occurred 50,000 years ago when representational art, imagery, and the design of tools and artefacts are first documented. She hypothesizes that this change was due to the adaptation of System 2.&lt;ref name=Mithen /&gt;

Most evolutionary psychologists do not agree with dual-process theorists. They claim that the mind is modular, and domain-specific, thus they disagree with the theory of the general reasoning ability of System 2. They have difficulty agreeing that there are two distinct ways of reasoning and that one is evolutionarily old, and the other is new.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt; To ease this discomfort, the theory is that once System 2 evolved, it became a 'long leash' system without much genetic control which allowed humans to pursue their individual goals.&lt;ref name="Stanovich&amp;West" /&gt;

===Issues with the dual-process account of reasoning===
The dual-process account of reasoning is an old theory, as noted above. But according to Evans&lt;ref name="Evans Q"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=J.|title=Questions and challenges for the new psychology of reasoning|journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning|year=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=5–31|doi=10.1080/13546783.2011.637674}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has adapted itself from the old, logicist paradigm, to the new theories that apply to other kinds of reasoning as well. And the theory seems more influential now than in the past which is questionable. Evans outlined 5 "fallacies":
# All dual-process theories are essentially the same.  There is a tendency to assume all theories that propose two modes or styles of thinking are related and so they end up all lumped under the umbrella term of "dual-process theories".
# There are just two systems underlying System 1 and System 2 processing. There are clearly more than just two cognitive systems underlying people's performance on dual-processing tasks. Hence the change to theorizing that processing is done in two minds that have different evolutionary histories and that each have multiple sub-systems.
# System 1 processes are responsible for cognitive biases; System 2 processes are responsible for normatively correct responding. Both System 1 and System 2 processing can lead to normative answers and both can involve cognitive biases.
# System 1 processing is contextualised while System 2 processing is abstract.&lt;ref name="Evans Q" /&gt; Recent research has found that beliefs and context can influence System 2 processing as well as System 1.&lt;ref name="Weidenfeld et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weidenfeld|first=A.|author2=Oberauer, K. |author3=Hornig, R. |title=Causal and non causal conditionals: an integrated model of interpretation and reasoning|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2005|volume=58A|issue=8|pages=1479–1513|doi=10.1080/02724980443000719}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Fast processing indicates the use of System 1 rather than System 2 processes. Just because a processing is fast does not mean it is done by System 1. Experience and different heuristics can influence System 2 processing to go faster.&lt;ref name="Evans Q" /&gt;
Another argument against dual-process accounts for reasoning which was outlined by Osman is that the proposed dichotomy of System 1 and System 2 does not adequately accommodate the range of processes accomplished.&lt;ref name=Osman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osman|first=M.|title=An evaluation of dual-process theories of reasoning|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|year=2004|volume=11|issue=6|pages=988–1010|doi=10.3758/bf03196730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moshman proposed that there should be four possible types of processing as opposed to two. They would be implicit heuristic processing, implicit rule-based processing, explicit heuristic processing, and explicit rule-based processing.&lt;ref name=Moshman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moshman|first=D.|title=Diversity in reasoning and rationality: metacognitive and developmental considerations|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=2000|volume=23|pages=689–690|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00483433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another fine-grained division is as follows: implicit action-centered processes, implicit non-action-centered processes, explicit action-centered processes, and explicit non-action-centered processes (that is, a four-way division reflecting both the implicit-explicit distinction and the procedural-declarative distinction).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = R. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = X. | last3 = Mathews | first3 = R. | year = 2009 | title = Capturing human data in a letter counting task: Accessibility and action-centeredness in representing cognitive skills | url = | journal = Neural Networks | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 15–29 | doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2008.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the question as to whether there are dichotomous processing types, many have instead proposed a single-system framework which incorporates a continuum between implicit and explicit processes.&lt;ref name=Osman /&gt;

==Alternative model==
The dynamic graded continuum (DGC), originally proposed by Cleeremans and Jiménez is an alternative single system framework to the dual-process account of reasoning. It has not been accepted as better than the dual-process theory; it is instead usually used as a comparison with which one can evaluate the dual-process model. The DGC proposes that differences in representation generate variation in forms of reasoning without assuming a multiple system framework. It describes how graded properties of the representations that are generated while reasoning result in the different types of reasoning. It separates terms like implicit and automatic processing where the dual-process model uses the terms interchangeably to refer to the whole of System 1. Instead the DGC uses a continuum of reasoning that moves from implicit, to explicit, to automatic.&lt;ref name=Osman /&gt;

==Fuzzy-trace theory==
According to Charles Brainerd and Valerie Reyna's [[fuzzy-trace theory]] of memory and reasoning, people have two memory representations: verbatim and gist. Verbatim is memory for surface information (e.g. the words in this sentence) whereas gist is memory for semantic information (e.g. the meaning of this sentence).

This dual process theory posits that we encode, store, retrieve, and forget the information in these two traces of memory separately and completely independently of each other. Furthermore, the two memory traces decay at different rates: verbatim decays quickly, while gist lasts longer.

In terms of reasoning, fuzzy-trace theory posits that as we mature, we increasingly rely more on gist information over verbatim information. Evidence for this lies in framing experiments where framing effects become stronger when verbatim information (percentages) are replaced with gist descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=Valerie|title=A new intuitionism: Meaning, memory, and development in Fuzzy-Trace Theory|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=332–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments rule out predictions of prospect theory (extended and original) as well as other current theories of judgment and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=V.F.|author2=Chick, C.F. |author3=Corbin, J.C.|author4=Hsia, A.N.|title=Developmental reversals in risky decision-making: Intelligence agents show larger decision biases than college students|journal=Psychological Science|year=2014|volume=25|issue=1|pages=76–84|doi=10.1177/0956797613497022|pmid=24171931|pmc=4076289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=V.F.|author2=Estrada, S.M.|author3=DeMarinis, J.A.|author4=Myers, R.M.|author5=Stanisz, J.M.|author6=Mills, B.A.|title=Neurobiological and memory models of risky decision making in adolescents versus young adults|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2011|volume=37|issue=5|pages=1125–1142|doi=10.1037/a0023943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kühberger|first=A.|author2 = Tanner, C.|title=Risky choice framing: task versions and a comparison of prospect theory and fuzzy-trace theory|journal=Journal of behavioral decision making|year=2010|volume=23|issue=3|pages=314–329|doi=10.1002/bdm.656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evaluation''' is a
[[system]]atic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of [[Standardization|standards]]. It can assist an organization, program, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and [[Goal|objectives]] and results of any such action that has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2.

Partnership.|publisher=International Center for Alcohol Policies|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=1995–2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504022520/http://www.icap.org/PolicyTools/Toolkits/EvaluationToolkit/2WhatIsEvaluation/tabid/441/Default.aspx|archive-date=2012-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining [[insight]] into prior or existing [[Initiative (enterprise)|initiatives]], is to enable [[Human self-reflection|reflection]] and assist in the identification of future change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHAT is evaluation?|url=http://www.evaluationtrust.org/evaluation/evaluate|work=Evaluation Trust|publisher=The Evaluation Trust|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Sarah del Tufo|date=13 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the [[arts]], [[criminal justice]], [[foundation (charity)|foundations]], [[non-profit organization]]s, [[government]], [[health care]], and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.

==Definition==

Evaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be '''[[formative assessment|formative]]''', that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be '''[[summative assessment|summative]]''', drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.&lt;ref name="Scriven 1967"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Michael Scriven]]|year=1967|chapter=The methodology of evaluation|editor=Stake, R. E.|title=Curriculum evaluation|at=American Educational Research Association (monograph series on evaluation, no. 1|publisher=Rand McNally|place=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its context{{spaced ndash}}the theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:
* A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross, P.H.|author2=Ellipse, M.W. |author3=Freeman, H.E.  |year=2004 |title=Evaluation: A systematic approach |edition=7th|location=Thousand Oaks |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-0894-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell).&lt;ref name=Reverberation&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reeve, J|author2=Paperboy, D. |year=2007 |title=Evaluating the evaluation: Understanding the utility and limitations of evaluation as a tool for organizational learning |journal=Health Education Journal |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=120–131 |doi=10.1177/0017896907076750}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}} The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.
* "A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth" (Stufflebeam).&lt;ref name=Reverberation /&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}} In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.

===Purpose===
The main purpose of a program evaluation can be to "determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009).&lt;ref name=HHM2009&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hurteau, M.|author2=Houle, S. |author3=Mongiat, S. |year=2009|url=http://evi.sagepub.com/content/15/3/307.abstract|title=How Legitimate and Justified are Judgments in Program Evaluation?| journal=Evaluation| volume=15|issue=3| pages=307–319|doi=10.1177/1356389009105883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view is that "projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value."&lt;ref name=Reverberation /&gt;
From this perspective, evaluation "is a contested term", as "evaluators" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.

There are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation Purpose|url=http://www.edtech.vt.edu/edtech/id/eval/eval_purpose.html|work=designshop – lessons in effective teaching|publisher=Learning Technologies at Virginia Tech|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530230306/http://www.edtech.vt.edu/edtech/id/eval/eval_purpose.html|archive-date=2012-05-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile.&lt;ref name=Reverberation /&gt; This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alkin |author2=Ellett |year=1990 |page=454 |title=not given}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on a number of disciplines, which include [[management]] and [[organisational theory]], [[policy analysis]], [[education]], [[sociology]], [[social anthropology]], and [[social change]].&lt;ref name=Potter2006&gt;{{cite journal|author=Potter, C.|year=2006 |title=Psychology and the art of program evaluation| journal=South African Journal of Psychology |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=82HGGFGYR–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discussion===

However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face.&lt;ref name=Potter2006 /&gt;

It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the '''evaluand''' (client) (Datta, 2006).&lt;ref name=HHM2009 /&gt; One justification of this is that "when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing" (Fournier and Smith, 1993).&lt;ref name=HHM2009 /&gt; Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process.&lt;ref name=Reverberation /&gt;

None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably{{By whom|date=May 2011}} due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980).&lt;ref name=HHM2009 /&gt;

The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.

==Standards==
{{cleanup|section|date=March 2012}}

Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and [[Rigour|rigor]] of evaluation processes.

Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be [[Ethics|ethically]] challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter "[[conflict of interest|conflict of interest (COI)]]" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.

General professional [[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]], as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter-[[Collegiality|collegial]] relations (such as respect for [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and [[privacy]]), operational issues (due [[Competence (human resources)|competence]], documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ([[nepotism]], accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism).&lt;ref name="GEF"&gt;{{cite book|title=GEF Evaluation Office Ethical Guidelines|year=2007|publisher=Global Environment Facility Evaluation Office|location=Washington, DC, United States|url=http://www.thegef.org/gef/sites/thegef.org/files/documents/EthicalGuidelines.pdf|author=David Todd|access-date=2011-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324082500/http://www.thegef.org/gef/sites/thegef.org/files/documents/EthicalGuidelines.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]] has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News and Events |url=http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ |work=Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation |publisher=Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Staff |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044732/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ |archivedate=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding [[Principle]]s for evaluators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMERICAN EVALUATION ASSOCIATION GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR EVALUATORS|url=http://www.eval.org/Publications/GuidingPrinciples.asp|work=American Evaluation Association|publisher=American Evaluation Association|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|date=July 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429201744/http://www.eval.org/Publications/GuidingPrinciples.asp|archivedate=29 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:

* Systematic [[Inquiry]]: evaluators conduct systematic, [[data]]-based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings.&lt;ref name="UNEG"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNEG Home|url=http://www.uneval.org|work=United Nations Evaluation Group|publisher=United Nations Evaluation Group|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of [[methodology]] employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;
* Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;
* [[Integrity]]/[[Honesty]]: evaluators ensure the honesty and [[integrity]] of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation
conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of
interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of
interest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies
with a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the
independence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with
agencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have
been involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should
be made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is
required to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by
project funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than
findings can verify.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Impartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and
weaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved
and findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link
between findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to
evidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is
required of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is
based on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings
and recommendations.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Transparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria
by which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the
evaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear
explanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs
incurred.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* [[Respect]] for People: Evaluators respect the [[security]], [[dignity]] and [[Self-esteem|self-worth]] of the respondents, [[Program (management)|program]] [[Participation (decision making)|participants]], [[Consumer|clients]], and other stakeholders with whom they [[Social interaction|interact]].This is particularly pertinent with regards to those who will be impacted upon by the evaluation findings.&lt;ref name="UNEG" /&gt; Protection of people includes ensuring informed consent from those involved in the evaluation, upholding confidentiality, and ensuring that the identity of those who may provide sensitive information towards the program evaluation is protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitoring &amp; Evaluation for Results Evaluation Ethics What to expect from your evaluators|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTUKRAINE/Resources/328335-1212401346836/5Ethics.pdf|work=World Bank Institute|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=World Bank Institute|format=PDF|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluators are ethically required to respect the customs and beliefs of those who are impacted upon by the evaluation or program activities. Examples of how such respect is demonstrated is through respecting local customs e.g. dress codes, respecting peoples privacy, and minimizing demands on others' time.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt; Where stakeholders wish to place objections to evaluation findings, such a process should be facilitated through the local office of the evaluation organization, and procedures for lodging complaints or queries should be accessible and clear.
* [[Social responsibility|Responsibilities]] for General and [[Public welfare|Public]] [[Quality of life|Welfare]]: Evaluators articulate and take into account the diversity of [[interest]]s and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] that may be related to the general and public welfare. Access to evaluation documents by the wider public should be facilitated such that discussion and feedback is enabled.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;

Furthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide [[United Nations Evaluation Group|UN Evaluation Group]] (UNEG),&lt;ref name="UNEG" /&gt; that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DAC Network On Development Evaluation|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/0,2865,en_21571361_34047972_1_1_1_1_1,00.html|work=OECD - Better Policies For Better Lives|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation Cooperation Group|url=http://www.ecgnet.org|work=Evaluation Cooperation Group website|publisher=ECG|accessdate=31 May 2013|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.

==Perspectives==
The word "evaluation" has various [[connotations]] for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness?

There are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program. [[Michael Quinn Patton]] motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:

* Activities
* Characteristics
* Outcomes
* The making of judgments on a program
* Improving its effectiveness,
* Informed programming decisions

Founded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation

==Approaches==
There exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.

===Classification of approaches===
Two classifications of evaluation approaches by House&lt;ref&gt;House, E. R. (1978). Assumptions underlying evaluation models. ''Educational Researcher''. 7(3), 4-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stufflebeam and Webster&lt;ref name=Stufflebeam&gt;Stufflebeam, D. L., &amp; Webster, W. J. (1980). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1163593 "An analysis of alternative approaches to evaluation"]. ''[[Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis]]''. 2(3), 5-19. {{oclc|482457112}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}

House considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common [[ideology]] entitled [[liberal democracy]]. Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the [[individual]] and [[Empiricism|empirical]] inquiry grounded in [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]]. He also contends that they are all based on [[Subject (philosophy)#Subjectivism|subjectivist]] ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]], in which "[[Goodness and value theory|the good]]" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is [[Ethical intuitionism|intuitionist]]/[[Value pluralism|pluralist]], in which no single interpretation of "the good" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.

These ethical positions have corresponding [[Epistemology|epistemologies]]—[[Philosophy|philosophies]] for obtaining [[knowledge]]. The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed [[Methodology|methods]] and [[data]]. The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on [[consumer]]s and [[Participation (decision making)|participatory]] approaches.

Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be&amp;mdash;they call this [[pseudo-]]evaluation. The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object&amp;mdash;they call this [[wikt:quasi|quasi]]-evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object&amp;mdash;they call this true evaluation.

When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation.&lt;ref name=Stufflebeam/&gt; Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them—[[experiment]]al research, management [[information systems]], testing programs, objectives-based studies, and [[content analysis]]—take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and [[policy]] studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and [[connoisseur]] studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and [[Person-centered therapy|client-centered]] studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.

===Summary of approaches===
The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four [[Abstraction|attributes]]—organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired [[Outcome (Game theory)|outcome]] for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together.

===Pseudo-evaluation===
[[Politics|Politically]] controlled and [[public relations]] studies are based on an [[Objectivist epistemology#Epistemology: reason|objectivist epistemology]] from an [[elite]] perspective.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} Although both of these approaches seek to misrepresent value interpretations about an object, they function differently from each other. [[Information]] obtained through politically controlled studies is released or withheld to meet the special interests of the holder, whereas public relations information creates a positive image of an object regardless of the actual situation. Despite the application of both studies in [[Reality|real]] scenarios, neither of these approaches is acceptable evaluation practice.

===Objectivist, elite, quasi-evaluation===
As a group, these five approaches represent a highly respected collection of disciplined inquiry approaches. They are considered quasi-evaluation approaches because particular studies legitimately can focus only on questions of knowledge without addressing any questions of value. Such studies are, by definition, not evaluations. These approaches can produce characterizations without producing appraisals, although specific studies can produce both. Each of these approaches serves its intended purpose well. They are discussed roughly in order of the extent to which they approach the objectivist ideal.
* '''[[Experiment|Experimental research]]''' is the best approach for determining [[Causality|causal relationships]] between [[variable (math)|variables]]. The potential problem with using this as an evaluation approach is that its highly controlled and stylized [[methodology]] may not be sufficiently responsive to the dynamically changing needs of most human service programs.
* '''[[Management information system]]s''' (MISs) can give detailed information about the dynamic operations of complex programs. However, this information is restricted to readily [[Numerical data|quantifiable]] data usually available at regular intervals.
* '''[[Educational assessment|Testing]] programs''' are familiar to just about anyone who has attended school, served in the military, or worked for a large company. These programs are good at comparing individuals or groups to selected norms in a number of subject areas or to a set of standards of performance. However, they only focus on testee performance and they might not adequately sample what is taught or expected.
* '''[[Project objective|Objectives]]-based''' approaches relate outcomes to prespecified objectives, allowing judgments to be made about their level of attainment. Unfortunately, the objectives are often not proven to be important or they focus on outcomes too narrow to provide the basis for determining the value of an object.
* '''[[Content analysis]]''' is a quasi-evaluation approach because content analysis judgments need not be based on value statements. Instead, they can be based on knowledge. Such content analyses are not evaluations. On the other hand, when content analysis judgments are based on values, such studies are evaluations.

===Objectivist, mass, quasi-evaluation===
* '''[[Accountability]]''' is popular with [[Constituent (politics)|constituents]] because it is intended to provide an accurate accounting of results that can improve the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of [[Product (project management)|products]] and [[Service (economics)|services]]. However, this approach quickly can turn practitioners and [[consumer]]s into adversaries when implemented in a heavy-handed fashion.

===Objectivist, elite, true evaluation===
* '''[[Decision making|Decision]]-oriented''' studies are designed to provide a knowledge base for making and defending decisions. This approach usually requires the close [[collaboration]] between an evaluator and decision-maker, allowing it to be susceptible to [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[bias]].
* '''[[Policy analysis|Policy studies]]''' provide general guidance and direction on broad issues by identifying and assessing potential [[Cost-benefit analysis|costs and benefits]] of competing [[policy|policies]]. The drawback is these studies can be corrupted or subverted by the politically motivated actions of the participants.

===Objectivist, mass, true evaluation===
* '''[[Customer|Consumer]]-oriented''' studies are used to judge the relative merits of goods and services based on generalized needs and values, along with a comprehensive range of effects. However, this approach does not necessarily help practitioners improve their work, and it requires a very good and credible evaluator to do it well.

===Subjectivist, elite, true evaluation===
* '''[[Accreditation of Certification Body|Accreditation]] / [[Professional certification|certification]]''' programs are based on self-study and peer review of organizations, programs, and personnel. They draw on the insights, experience, and expertise of qualified individuals who use established guidelines to determine if the applicant should be approved to perform specified functions. However, unless performance-based standards are used, attributes of applicants and the processes they perform often are overemphasized in relation to measures of outcomes or effects.
* '''[[Connoisseur]]''' studies use the highly refined skills of individuals intimately familiar with the subject of the evaluation to critically characterize and appraise it. This approach can help others see programs in a new light, but it is difficult to find a qualified and unbiased connoisseur.

===Subject, mass, true evaluation===
* The '''[[Adversary evaluation|adversary approach]]''' focuses on drawing out the pros and cons of [[Controversy|controversial]] issues through quasi-[[Lawsuit|legal proceedings]]. This helps ensure a balanced presentation of different perspectives on the issues, but it is also likely to discourage later [[Co-operation|cooperation]] and heighten animosities between contesting parties if "winners" and "losers" emerge.

===Client-centered===
* '''Client-centered''' studies address specific concerns and issues of practitioners and other clients of the study in a particular setting. These studies help people understand the activities and values involved from a variety of perspectives. However, this responsive approach can lead to low external [[credibility]] and a favorable bias toward those who participated in the study.

==Methods and techniques==
Evaluation is methodologically diverse. Methods may be [[qualitative methods|qualitative]] or [[quantitative methods|quantitative]], and include [[case studies]], [[survey research]], [[statistical analysis]], model building, and many more such as:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27512">'''Free will in antiquity''' was not discussed in the same terms as used in the modern [[free will]] debates, but historians of the problem have speculated who exactly was first to take positions as [[determinism|determinist]], [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]], and [[compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien, ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy''; Timothy O'Keefe, ''Epicurus on Freedom'', R. W. Sharples, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate '', David Furley, ''Two Studies in the Greek Atomists'', Richard Sorabji, "Necessity, Cause, and Blame "&lt;/ref&gt; There is wide agreement that these views were essentially fully formed over 2000 years ago. Candidates for the first thinkers to form these views, as well as the idea of a non-physical "agent-causal" libertarianism, include [[Democritus]] (460–370), [[Aristotle]] (384–322), [[Epicurus]] (341–270), [[Chrysippus]] (280–207), and [[Carneades]] (214–129).

==Pre-Socratic thought==
Early religious accounts of man's fate explored the degree of human freedom permitted by superhuman gods. A strong fatalism is present in tales that foretell the future, based on the idea that the gods have foreknowledge of future events. Anxious not to annoy the gods, the myth-makers rarely challenged the idea that the gods' foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom.

The first thinkers to look for explanatory causes (ἀιτία) in natural phenomena (rather than gods controlling events) were the Greek [[Pre-Socratic]] philosophers (''physiologoi''). The reasons or rules (λόγοι) behind the physical (φύσις) world became the ideal "laws" governing material phenomena. [[Anaximander]] (610-546) coined the term physis (φύσις) and perhaps even the cosmological combination of cosmos (κόσμος), as organized nature, and logos (λόγος), as the law behind nature. The Greeks had a separate word for the laws (or conventions) of society, nomos (νόμος). [[Heraclitus]] (535–475) claimed that everything changes ("you can't step twice into the same river") but that there were laws or rules (the logos) behind all the change. The early cosmologists imagined that the universal laws were all-powerful and must therefore explain the natural causes behind all things, from the regular motions of the heavens to the mind (νοῦς) of man. These ''physiologoi'' transformed pre-philosophical arguments about gods controlling the human will into arguments about pre-existing causes controlling it.

==Democritus and Leucippus==
The materialist philosophers [[Democritus]] and his mentor [[Leucippus]] were the first [[determinism|determinists]]. They claimed that all things, including humans, were made of atoms in a void, with individual atomic motions strictly controlled by causal laws. Democritus said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    By convention (nomos) color, by convention sweet, by convention bitter, but in reality atoms and a void.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    νόμῳ χροιή, νόμῳ γλυκύ, νόμῳ πικρόν, ἑτεῇ δ’ ἄτομα καὶ κενόν&lt;ref&gt;Diels Kranz, fragment B125&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Democritus wanted to wrest control of man's fate from arbitrary gods and make us more responsible for our actions. But ironically, he and Leucippus originated two of the great dogmas of determinism, [[physical determinism]] and [[logical truth|logical necessity]], which lead directly to the traditional and modern problem of free will and determinism.

Leucippus dogmatically declared an absolute necessity which left no room in the cosmos for chance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;

    Nothing occurs at random (maten), but everything for a reason (logos) and by necessity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    οὐδὲν χρῆμα μάτην γίνεται, ἀλλὰ πάντα ἐκ λόγου τε καὶ ὑπ’ ἀνάγκης&lt;ref&gt;Leucippus, Fragment 569 – from Fr. 2 Actius I, 25, 4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consequence is a world with but one possible future, completely determined by its past.

==Socrates==
In Plato's Gorgias (and in the Protagoras 345c4-e6), Socrates argues that no one does wrong willingly, one of the most famous doctrines to be associated with him. When framed in modern (Western) terms, the implication is that it is ignorance, rather that free individual agency, that is responsible for morally wrong actions.

==Aristotle==
[[File:Aristotle Bust White Background Transparent.png|thumb|right|Aristotle]]

Michael Frede typifies the prevailing view of recent scholarship, namely that Aristotle did not have a notion of free-will.&lt;ref&gt; http://philpapers.org/archive/BOB_FW.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] elaborated the four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was ἀιτία, which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic "every event has a (single) cause" idea that was to come later.
Then, in his ''Physics'' and ''Metaphysics'', Aristotle also said there were "accidents" caused by "chance (τυχή)". In his ''Physics'', he noted that the early physicists had found no place for chance among their causes.

Aristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (τυχόν), namely an indefinite (ἀόριστον) cause.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book V, 1025a25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; otherwise not.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', Book VI, 1027a29&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tracing any particular sequence of events back in time will usually come to an accidental event – a "starting point" or "fresh start" (Aristotle calls it an origin or arche (ἀρχή) – whose major contributing cause (or causes) was itself uncaused.

Whether a particular thing happens, says Aristotle, may depend on a series of causes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    goes back to some starting-point, which does not go back to something else. This, therefore, will be the starting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing else is the cause of its generation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' Book VI 1027b12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In general, many such causal sequences contribute to any event, including human decisions. Each sequence has a different time of origin, some going back before we were born, some originating during our deliberations. Beyond causal sequences that are the result of chance or necessity, Aristotle felt that some breaks in the causal chain allow us to feel our actions "depend on us" (ἐφ' ἡμῖν). These are the causal chains that originate within us (ἐv ἡμῖν).

[[Richard Sorabji]]'s 1980 ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'' surveyed Aristotle's positions on causation and necessity, comparing them to his predecessors and successors, especially the Stoics and Epicurus. Sorabji argues that Aristotle was an indeterminist, that real chance and uncaused events exist, but never that human actions are uncaused in the extreme libertarian sense that some commentators mistakenly attribute to Epicurus.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aristotle accepted the past as fixed, in the sense that past events were irrevocable. But future events cannot be necessitated by claims about the present truth value of statements about the future. Aristotle does not deny the excluded middle (either p or not p), only that the truth value of p does not exist yet. Indeed, although the past is fixed, the truth value of past statements about the future can be changed by the outcome of future events. This is the problem of [[future contingents]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he thinks Aristotle was not aware of the "problem" of free will vis-a-vis determinism (as first described by Epicurus), Sorabji thinks Aristotle's position on the question is clear enough. Voluntariness is too important to fall before theoretical arguments about necessity and determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I come now to the question of how determinism is related to involuntariness. Many commentators nowadays hold one or more parts of the following view. Determinism creates a problem for belief in the voluntariness of actions. Regrettably, but inevitably, Aristotle was unaware of this problem, and so failed to cope with it. Indeed, the problem was not discovered until Hellenistic times, perhaps by Epicurus, who was over forty years junior to Aristotle, and who reached Athens just too late to hear his lectures. In Aristotle's time no one had yet propounded a universal determinism, so that he knew of no such theory. His inevitable failure to see the threat to voluntariness is all the more regrettable in that he himself entertained a deterministic account of actions, which exacerbated the problem of how any could be voluntary. I shall argue that this account misrepresents the situation&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ''Necessity, Cause, and Blame'', p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Epicurus==
[[File:Epicurus-PergamonMuseum.png|thumb|right|Epicurus]]
It is with Epicurus and the Stoics that clearly indeterministic and deterministic positions are first formulated. Writing one generation after Aristotle, [[Epicurus]] argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would "swerve" (''[[clinamen]]'') from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions (''[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]]''), something impossible if every action was deterministically caused.

Epicurus did not say the swerve was directly involved in decisions. But following Aristotle, Epicurus thought human agents have the autonomous ability to transcend necessity and chance (both of which destroy responsibility), so that praise and blame are appropriate. Epicurus finds a ''tertium quid'', beyond necessity (Democritus' physics) and beyond chance. His ''tertium quid'' is agent autonomy, what is "up to us".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...some things happen of necessity (ἀνάγκη), others by chance (τύχη), others through our own agency (παρ’ ἡμᾶς).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...necessity destroys responsibility and chance is inconstant; whereas our own actions are autonomous, and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach.&lt;ref&gt;Epicurus, ''Letter to Menoeceus'', §133&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lucretius]] (1st century [[BCE]]), a strong supporter of Epicurus, saw the randomness as enabling free will, even if he could not explain exactly how, beyond the fact that random swerves would break the causal chain of determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Again, if all motion is always one long chain, and new motion arises out of the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this freedom (''libera'') in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will (''voluntas'') wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just where our mind has taken us? For undoubtedly it is his own will in each that begins these things, and from the will movements go rippling through the limbs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967, [[Pamela Huby]] suggested that Epicurus was the original discoverer of the "freewill problem". Huby noted that there had been two main free will problems, corresponding to different determinisms, namely theological determinism (predestination and foreknowledge) and the physical causal determinism of Democritus.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is unfortunate that our knowledge of the early history of the Stoics is so fragmentary, and that we have no agreed account of the relations between them and Epicurus. On the evidence we have, however, it seems to me more probable that Epicurus was the originator of the freewill controversy, and that it was only taken up with enthusiasm among the Stoics by Chrysippus, the third head of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Huby, "The First Discovery of the Freewill Problem", ''Philosophy'', 42 (1967), p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2000 [[Susanne Bobzien]] challenged Pamela Huby's 1967 assertion that Epicurus discovered the "free will problem".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    In 1967 Epicurus was credited with the discovery of the problem of free will and determinism. Among the contestants were Aristotle and the early Stoics. Epicurus emerged victorious, because – so the argument went – Aristotle did not yet have the problem, and the Stoics inherited it from Epicurus. In the same year David Furley published his essay 'Aristotle and Epicurus on Voluntary Action', in which he argued that Epicurus' problem was not the free will problem. In the thirty-odd years since then, a lot has been published about Epicurus on freedom and determinism. But it has only rarely been questioned whether Epicurus, in one way or another, found himself face to face with some version of the free will problem.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bobzien thinks Epicurus did not have a model of what she calls "two-sided freedom," because she believes that Epicurus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"assumed....a gap in the causal chain immediately before, or simultaneously with, the decision or choice, a gap which allows the coming into being of a spontaneous motion. In this way every human decision or choice is directly linked with causal indeterminism....To avoid misunderstandings, I should stress that I do believe that Epicurus was an indeterminist of sorts – only that he did not advocate indeterminist free decision or indeterminist free choice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[A. A. Long]] and [[David Sedley|D. N. Sedley]], however, agree with Pamela Huby that Epicurus was the first to notice the modern problem of free will and determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Epicurus' problem is this: if it has been necessary all along that we should act as we do, it cannot be up to us, with the result that we would not be morally responsible for our actions at all. Thus posing the problem of determinism he becomes arguably the first philosopher to recognize the philosophical centrality of what we know as the Free Will Question. His strongly libertarian  approach to it can be usefully contrasted with the Stoics' acceptance of determinism.&lt;ref&gt;Long and Sedley, ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'', section 20, "Free Will," p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question remains how random swerves can help to explain free action. In her 1992 book, ''The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'', [[Julia Annas]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...since swerves are random, it is hard to see how they help to explain free action. We can scarcely expect there to be a random swerve before every free action. Free actions are frequent, and (fairly) reliable. Random swerves cannot account for either of these features. This problem would be lessened if we could assume that swerves are very frequent, so that there is always likely to be one around before an action. However, if swerves are frequent, we face the problem that stones and trees ought to be enabled to act freely. And even in the case of humans random swerves would seem to produce, if anything, random actions; we still lack any clue as to how they could produce actions which are free.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, ''The Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'', p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One view, going back to the 19th century historian [[Carlo Giussani]], is that Epicurus' atomic swerves are involved directly in every case of human free action, not just somewhere in the past that breaks the causal chain of determinism.&lt;ref&gt;"The complete conception of the will according to Epicurus comprises two elements, a complex atomic movement which has the characteristic of spontaneity, that is, is withdrawn from the necessity of mechanical causation: and then the sensus, or self-consciousness in virtue of which the will, illuminated by previous movements of sensation, thought, and emotion, profits by the peculiar liberty or spontaneity of the atomic motions, to direct or not to direct these in a direction seen or selected." — Carlo Giussani, ''Studi Lucreziani'' 1896 (p. 126) (Cyril Bailey translation)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 [[Cyril Bailey]] agreed with Giussani that the atoms of the mind-soul provide a break in the continuity of atomic motions, otherwise actions would be necessitated. Bailey imagined complexes of mind-atoms that work together to form a consciousness that is not determined, but also not susceptible to the pure randomness of individual atomic swerves, something that could constitute Epicurus' idea of actions being "up to us" (πὰρ' ἡμάς).&lt;ref&gt;It is a commonplace to state that Epicurus, like his follower Lucretius, intended primarily to combat the 'myths' of the orthodox religion, to show by his demonstration of the unfailing laws of nature the falseness of the old notions of the arbitrary action of the gods and so to relieve humanity from the terrors of superstition. But it is sometimes forgotten that Epicurus viewed with almost greater horror the conception of irresistible 'destiny' or 'necessity', which is the logical outcome of the notion of natural law pressed to its conclusion. This conclusion had been accepted in its fulness by Democritus, but Epicurus conspicuously broke away from him: 'it were better to follow the myths about the gods than to become a slave to the "destiny" of the natural philosophers: for the former suggests a hope of placating the gods by worship, whereas the latter involves a necessity which knows no placation'. — Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey states that Epicurus did not ''identify'' freedom of the will with chance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It may be that [Giussani's] account presses the Epicurean doctrine slightly beyond the point to which the master had thought it out for himself, but it is a direct deduction from undoubted Epicurean conceptions and is a satisfactory explanation of what Epicurus meant: that he should have thought that the freedom of the will was chance, and fought hard to maintain it as chance and no more, is inconceivable.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus'' p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1967 [[David Furley]] de-emphasized the importance of the swerve in both Epicurus and Lucretius so as to defend Epicurus from the "extreme" libertarian view that our actions are caused directly by random swerves. (Bailey had also denied this "traditional interpretation".) Furley argues for a strong connection between the ideas of Aristotle and Epicurus on autonomous actions that are "up to us".
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    If we now put together the introduction to Lucretius' passage on ''voluntas'' and Aristotle's theory of the voluntary, we can see how the swerve of atoms was supposed to do its work. Aristotle's criterion of the voluntary was a negative one: the source of the voluntary action is in the agent himself, in the sense that it cannot be traced back beyond or outside the agent himself. Lucretius says that voluntas must be saved from a succession of causes which can be traced back to infinity. All he needs to satisfy the Aristotelian criterion is a ''break in the succession of causes'', so that the source of an action cannot be traced back to something occurring before the birth of the agent.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The swerve, then, plays a purely negative part in Epicurean psychology. It saves ''voluntas'' from necessity, as Lucretius says it does, but it does not feature in every act of ''voluntas''.&lt;ref&gt;David Furley, ''Two Studies in the Greek Atomists'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, in his 1983 thesis, "Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'", [[Don Paul Fowler]] defended the ancient claim that Epicurus proposed random swerves as directly causing our actions.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I turn to the overall interpretation. Lucretius is arguing from the existence of ''voluntas'' to the existence of the ''clinamen''; nothing comes to be out of nothing, therefore ''voluntas'' must have a cause at the atomic level, viz. the ''clinamen''. The most natural interpretation of this is that every act of ''voluntas'' is caused by a swerve in the atoms of the animal's mind....There is a close causal, physical relationship between the macroscopic and the atomic. Furley, however, argued that the relationship between ''voluntas''  and the ''clinamen'' was very different; not every act of volition was accompanied by a swerve in the soul-atoms, but the ''clinamen'' was only an occasional event which broke the chain of causation between the σύστασις of our mind at birth and the 'engendered' state (τὸ ἀπογεγεννημένον) which determines our actions.Its role in Epicureanism is
merely to make a formal break with physical determinism, and it has no real effect on the outcome of particular actions. (p. 338).&lt;ref&gt;Don Fowler, "Lucretius on the Clinamen and 'Free Will'", Συζήτησισ: ''Studi sull'epicureismo greco e romano offerti a Marcello Gigante'', (Naples, 1983) 329–52&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a 1999 ''Phronesis'' article, Purinton agreed with Fowler that random swerves directly cause volitions and actions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"since they do not make volition itself a fresh start of motion, and Sedley's view does not do justice to his atomism...It seems to me, therefore, that there is no good reason to reject the thesis that Epicurus held that swerves cause volitions from the bottom up. And there are a number of good reasons to accept it."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Purinton, "Epicurus on 'Free Volition' and the Atomic Swerve,'" ''Phronesis'', 44, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stoicism==
It was the [[Stoicism|Stoic school of philosophy]] that solidified the idea of natural laws controlling all things, including the mind. [[Zeno of Citium]], the original founder of Stoicism, had a simple but powerful idea of the causal chain compared to Aristotle. Zeno said that every event has a cause, and that cause necessitates the event. Given exactly the same circumstances, exactly the same result will occur.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is impossible that the cause be present yet that of which it is the cause not obtain.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ἀδύνατον δ’ εἴναι τὸ μὲν αἴτιον παρεῖναι, οὖ δέ ἐστιν αἴτιον μὴ ὑπάρχειν.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Chrysippus bust.jpg|thumb|right|Chrysippus]]
The major developer of Stoicism, [[Chrysippus]], took the edge off strict necessity. Like Democritus, Aristotle, and Epicurus before him, he wanted to strengthen the argument for moral responsibility, in particular defending it from Aristotle's and Epicurus' indeterminate chance causes.

Whereas the past is unchangeable, Chrysippus argued that some future events that are possible do not occur by necessity from past external factors alone, but might (as Aristotle and Epicurus maintained) depend on us. We have a choice to assent or not to assent to an action. Chrysippus said our actions are determined (in part by ourselves as causes) and fated (because of God's foreknowledge), but he also said that they are not necessitated, i.e., pre-determined from the distant past. Chrysippus would be seen today as a [[compatibilism|compatibilist]].

[[Robert Sharples (classicist)|R. W. Sharples]] describes the first compatibilist arguments to reconcile responsibility and determinism by Chrysippus
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Stoic position, given definitive expression by Chrysippus  (c. 280–207 BC), the third head of the school, represents not the opposite extreme from that of Epicurus but an attempt to compromise, to combine determinism and responsibility. Their theory of the universe is indeed a completely deterministic one; everything is governed by fate, identified with the sequence of causes; nothing could happen otherwise than it does, and in any given set of circumstances one and only one result can follow – otherwise an uncaused motion would occur.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chrysippus was concerned to preserve human responsibility in the context of his determinist system. His position was thus one of 'soft determinism', as opposed on the one hand to that of the 'hard determinist' who claims that determinism excludes responsibility, and on the other to that of the libertarian who agrees on the incompatibility but responsibility by determinism. The Greek to eph' hemin (ἐφ΄ ἡμῖν), 'what depends on us', like the English 'responsibility', was used both by libertarians and by soft determinists, though they differed as to what it involved; thus he occurrence of the expression is not a safe guide to the type of position involved. The situation is complicated by the fact that the debate is in Greek philosophy conducted entirely in terms of responsibility (to eph' hemin) rather than of freedom or free will; nevertheless it can be shown that some thinkers, Alexander among them, have a libertarian rather than a soft-determinist conception of responsibility, and in such cases I have not hesitated to use expressions like 'freedom'.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Alexander of Aphrodisias==
[[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (c. 150–210), the most famous ancient commentator on Aristotle, wrote in the age of Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics. He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today. Greek philosophy had no precise term for "free will" as did Latin (''liberum arbitrium'' or ''libera voluntas''). The discussion was in terms of responsibility, what "depends on us" (in Greek ἐφ ἡμῖν).

Alexander believed that Aristotle was not a strict determinist like the Stoics, and Alexander himself argued that some events do not have pre-determined causes. In particular, man is responsible for self-caused decisions, and can choose to do or not to do something, as Chrysippus argued. However, Alexander denied the foreknowledge of events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature.

[[Robert Sharples (classicist)|R. W. Sharples]] described Alexander's ''De Fato'' as perhaps the most comprehensive treatment surviving from classical antiquity of the problem of responsibility (τὸ ἐφ’ ἡμίν) and determinism. It especially shed a great deal of light on Aristotle's position on free will and on the Stoic attempt to make responsibility compatible with determinism.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sharples, translation and commentary ''Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], a '''Heisenberg cut''' is the hypothetical interface between quantum events and an [[Observer (quantum physics)|observer]]'s [[Physical information|information]], [[knowledge]], or [[Consciousness|conscious awareness]]. Below the cut everything is governed by the [[wave function]]; above the cut a [[classical physics|classical]] description is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~stapp/BCC.pdf Quantum Mechanical Theories of Consciousness], Henry P. Stapp&lt;/ref&gt; The Heisenberg cut is a theoretical construct; it is not known whether actual Heisenberg cuts exist, where they might be found, or how they could be detected experimentally. However, the concept is useful for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.utoronto.ca/see/pages/heisenberg_cutdef.html "Heisenberg Cut"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02604027.1997.9972639 | volume=49 | title=Cartesian cut, Heisenberg cut, and the concept of complexity | year=1997 | journal=World Futures | pages=333–355 | last1 = Atmanspacher | first1 = Harald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0206147 "Are classical probabilities instances of quantum amplitudes?"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~stapp/BCC.pdf "Quantum Mechanical Theories of Consciousness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cut is named after [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s work on the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics in which it is associated with [[wave function collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnap.umd.edu/philphysics/crull.htm "Something Old, Something New: Heisenberg's Response to EPR"]&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretations of quantum mechanics that do not recognise wave function collapse (such as [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|De Broglie–Bohm]] or [[many-worlds interpretation|many-worlds]] interpretations) do not require Heisenberg cuts.

Heisenberg stated the concept in many different ways in his work, for one example he wrote: "In this situation it follows automatically that, in a mathematical treatment of the process, a dividing line must be drawn between, on the one hand, the apparatus which we use as an aid in putting the question and thus, in a way, treat as part of ourselves, and on the other hand, the physical systems we wish to investigate. The latter we represent mathematically as a wave function. This function, according to quantum theory, consists of a differential equation which determines any future state from the present state of the function... The dividing line between the system to be observed and the measuring apparatus is immediately defined by the nature of the problem but it obviously signifies no discontinuity of the physical process. For this reason there must, within limits, exist complete freedom in choosing the position of the dividing line."&lt;ref&gt;[http://proceedings.aip.org/resource/2/apcpcs/1327/1/26_1?bypassSSO=1 "What classicality? Decoherence and Bohr's classical concepts."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvisation, in the [[performing arts]] is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines; see [[Applied improvisation]].

Improvisation also exists outside the arts. Improvisation in engineering is to solve a problem with the tools and materials immediately at hand. [[Improvised weapon]]s are often used by guerrillas, insurgents and criminals.

==Performing arts==

Improvisation can be thought of as an "on the spot" or "off the cuff" spontaneous moment of sudden inventiveness that can just come to mind, body and spirit as an inspiration. [[Viola Spolin]] created [[theater games]] as a method of training improvisational acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater|last=Spolin|first=Viola|authorlink=Viola Spolin|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1963|isbn=0-8101-4008-X|location=Evanston, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, [[Paul Sills]] popularized improvisational theater, or IMPROV, by using Spolin's techniques to train [[The Second City]] in Chicago, the first totally improvisational theater company in the US. However, for some particularly gifted performers, no preparation or training is needed. Improvisation in any life or art form, can occur more often if it is practiced as a way of encouraging creative behavior. That practice includes learning to use one's [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], as well as learning a technical understanding of the necessary skills and concerns within the domain in which one is improvising. This can be when an individual or group is acting, dancing, singing, playing [[musical instrument]]s, talking, creating artworks, problem solving, or reacting in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one's immediate environment and inner feelings. This can result in the invention of new thought patterns, new practices, new structures or symbols, and/or new ways to act.

Improvisation was originally rarely used on dramatic television. A major exception was the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' where star [[Robin Williams]] was allotted specific sections in each episode where he was allowed to perform freely.

==Skills and techniques==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
The skills of improvisation can apply to many different abilities or forms of communication and expression across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. For example, improvisation can make a significant contribution in music, dance, cooking, presenting a speech, sales, personal or romantic relationships, sports, flower arranging, martial arts, psychotherapy, and much more.

Techniques of improvisation are widely used in training for performing arts or entertainment; for example, music, theatre and dance. To "''extemporize''" or "ad lib" is basically the same as improvising. Colloquial terms such as "let's play it by the ear", "take it as it comes", and "make it up as we go along" are all used to describe "improvisation".

The simple act of speaking requires a good deal of improvisation because the mind is addressing its own thought and creating its unrehearsed delivery in words, sounds and gestures, forming unpredictable statements that feed back into the thought process (the performer as listener), creating an enriched process that is not unlike instantaneous composition [with a given set or repertoire of elements].&lt;ref&gt;''The Speech Chain: The Physics and Biology of Spoken Language'' (paperback), Peter B. Denes and Elliot N. Pinson. 1966. Worth Publishers; Second Edition (February 15, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the improvisation is intended to solve a problem on a temporary basis, the "proper" solution being unavailable at the time, it may be known as a "stop-gap". This applies to the field of engineering. Another improvisational, group problem-solving technique being used in organizations of all kinds is ''brainstorming'', in which any and all ideas that a group member may have are permitted and encouraged to be expressed, regardless of actual practicality. As in all improvisation, the process of brainstorming opens up the minds of the people involved to new, unexpected and possibly useful ideas. The colloquial term for this is "thinking outside the box."

==Music==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is usually defined as the composition of music while simultaneously singing or playing an instrument. In other words, the art of improvisation can be understood as composing music "on the fly". There have been previous experiments by Charles Limb, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], that show the brain activity during musical improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peabody.jhu.edu/past_issues/fall08/the_science_of_improv.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625073946/http://www.peabody.jhu.edu/past_issues/fall08/the_science_of_improv.html |archivedate=2016-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limb was able to show an increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, which is an area associated with an increase in self-expression. Further, there was decreased activity in the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]], which is an area associated with self-monitoring. This change in activity is thought to reduce the inhibitions that normally prevent individuals from taking risks and improvising.

Improvisation can take place as a solo performance, or interdependently in ensemble with other players. When done well, it often elicits gratifying emotional responses from the audience. One notable improvisational pianist is [[Franz Liszt]]. The origins of Liszt's improvisation in an earlier tradition of playing variations on a theme were mastered and epitomized by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].

Notable improvisational musicians from the modern era include: [[Keith Jarrett]], an improvisational jazz pianist and multi-instrumentalist who has performed many completely improvised concerts all over the world; [[W. A. Mathieu]] aka William Allaudin Mathieu, was the musical director for [[The Second City]] in Chicago, the first on-going improvisational theatre troupe in the United States, and later was musical director for another improv theatre, [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]], an offshoot of The Second City in San Francisco; [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], an improvisational guitarist; [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]], an improvisational violinist; and [[Eugene Friesen]], an improvisational cellist.

Improvised [[freestyle rap]] is commonly practiced as a part of [[rappers]]' creative processes, as a "finished product" for release on recordings (when the improvisation is judged good enough), as a spiritual event, as a means of verbal combat in [[battle rap]], and, simply, for fun. It often incorporates insults similar to those in the African-American game [[The Dozens]], and complex rhythmic and sometimes melodic forms comparable to those heard in jazz improvisation.

In the realm of [[silent film]] music, there are also a small number of musicians whose work has been recognized as exceptional by critics, scholars and audiences alike; these include [[Neil Brand]] and [[John Sweeney (pianist)|John Sweeney]], among others who are all performers at the [[Pordenone Silent Film Festival]] in Italy. Their performances must match the style and pacing of those films which they accompany and the knowledge of a wide range of musical styles is required, as well as the stamina to play for films which occasionally run more than three hours in length, without a pause.

== Theatre ==
{{Main|Improvisational theatre}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Improvisation, in theatre, is the playing of dramatic scenes without written dialogue and with minimal or no predetermined dramatic activity. The method has been used for different purposes in theatrical history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/improvisation-theatre|title=Improvisation {{!}} theatre|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ligue d'improvisation montréalaise (LIM) 20101031-01.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The {{Interlanguage link multi|Ligue d'improvisation montréalaise|fr}} (LIM) is a league of improvisational theatre based in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada]]

=== Comedy ===
Improvisational comedy is a theatre art performed throughout the world and has had on-again, off-again status throughout history.

Some of the more famous improv theatres and training centers in the world include: [[IO Theater|i.O.]] (formerly ImprovOlympic) in Chicago and Los Angeles, [[The Second City]] in Chicago and Toronto, [[The Players Workshop]] in Chicago, [[National Comedy Theatre]] in San Diego, New York and Phoenix, [[Upright Citizens Brigade]], the [[Peoples Improv Theater]], the [[Magnet Theater]] in New York, [[The Groundlings]] in Los Angeles, [[BATS Improv]] (Bay Area Theatre Sports) in San Francisco, [[Wing-It Productions]] in Seattle, [[Philly Improv Theater]] in Philadelphia, [[Brave New Workshop]] in Minneapolis, [[ComedySportz]] in Milwaukee, and [[Theatresports]] in Calgary.

There are also many well known university improv teams, including [[Theatre Strike Force]] at the [[University of Florida]], Gigglepants at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and [[Erasable Inc.]] at the [[University of Maryland]]. Improvisation found a home at universities. The origins of [[the Second City]] was the [[Compass Players]], an offshoot of theatre programs at the [[University of Chicago]] in the 50's. Later, once improv had been established as an art form, improv groups sprung up on college campuses, starting in the 80's where crowds were easy to find and teams could perform frequently. Now an improv group is a common staple of college extra curricular activities.

Notable pioneers in the field of improvisation, comedic or otherwise, include [[Mike Myers]], [[Neil Mullarkey]], [[Paul Merton]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[John Sessions]], [[Josie Lawrence]], [[Viola Spolin]], [[Paul Sills]], [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], [[Del Close]], [[Josephine Forsberg]], [[Gary Austin]], [[Martin de Maat]], and [[Keith Johnstone]]. Notable performers include: [[Paul Merton]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Harold Ramis]], [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]], [[Colin Mochrie]], [[Ryan Stiles]], [[Ross Noble]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Tony Slattery]], [[Mike McShane]], [[Sandi Toksvig]], [[Wayne Brady]], [[Jonathan Winters]], [[T. J. Jagodowski]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[David Pasquesi]].

===Dance===
[[Dance improvisation]] as a [[choreography|choreographic]] tool: Improvisation is used as a choreographic tool in [[dance composition]]. Experimenting with the concepts of shape, space, time, and energy while moving without inhibition or cognitive thinking can create unique and innovative movement designs, spatial configuration, dynamics, and unpredictable rhythms. Improvisation without inhibition allows the choreographer to connect to their deepest creative self, which in turn clears the way for pure invention.This cognitive inhibition is similar to the inhibition described by Limb for musical improvisation, which can be found in the music section above.

[[Contact improvisation]]: a form developed in 1973, that is now practiced around the world. Contact improvisation originated from the movement studies of Steve Paxton in the 1970s and developed through the continued exploration of the [[Judson Dance Theater]]. It is a dance form based on weight sharing, partnering, playing with weight, exploring negative space and unpredictable outcomes.

==Artificial intelligence==
{{main|Machine improvisation}}
==Sculpture==
Sculpture often relies on the enlargement of a small model or [[maquette]] to create the final work in a chosen material. Where the material is ''plastic'' such as [[clay]], a working structure or [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] often needs to be built to allow the pre-determined design to be realized. [[Alan Thornhill]]'s method for working with clay abandons the maquette,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2uNhbq6mk4 Alan Thornhill on the tradition of pre-conceiving sculpture 1989 studio archive footage], [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; seeing it as ''ultimately deadening to creativity''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanthornhill.co.uk/Spirit%20in%20Mass%20film.htm Film: Spirit in Mass – Journey into Sculpture (2007)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512005743/http://www.alanthornhill.co.uk/Spirit%20in%20Mass%20film.htm |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the restrictions of the armature, a clay matrix of elements allows that when recognisable forms start to emerge, they can be essentially disregarded by turning the work, allowing for infinite possibility and the chance for the unforeseen to emerge more powerfully at a later stage.

Moving from ''adding and taking away'' to purely reductive working, the architectural considerations of turning the work are eased considerably but continued removal of material through the rejection of forms deemed ''too obvious'' can mean one ends up with nothing. Former pupil [[Jon Edgar]] uses Thornhill's method as a creative extension to [[direct carving]] in stone and wood.

== Film ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The director [[Mike Leigh]] uses lengthy improvisations developed over a period of weeks to build characters and story lines for his films. He starts with some sketch ideas of how he thinks things might develop but does not reveal all his intentions with the cast who discover their fate and act out their responses as their destinies are gradually revealed, including significant aspects of their lives which will not subsequently be shown onscreen. The final filming draws on dialogue and actions that have been recorded during the improvisation period.

==Writing==
Improvisational writing is an exercise that imposes limitations on a writer such as a time limit, word limit, a specific topic, or rules on what can be written. This forces the writer to work within [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] and write without judgment of the work they produce. This technique is used for a variety of reasons, such as to bypass [[writer's block]], improve creativity, strengthen one's writing instinct and enhance one's flexibility in writing.

Some improvisational writing is collaborative, focusing on an almost [[dadaist]] form of [[collaborative fiction]]. This can take a variety of forms, from as basic as passing a notebook around a circle of writers with each writing a sentence, to coded environments that focus on collaborative novel-writing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harrigan | first = Pat | title = First person: new media as story, performance, and game | publisher = MIT Press| year = 2002| isbn = 978-0-262-23232-6| pages = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; like ''[[OtherSpace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Platt | first = Wes | authorlink = Wes Platt| title = OtherSpace: End of the World, Arcs IV–V| publisher = [[iUniverse]]| year = 2002| isbn = 978-0595230464| pages = ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improvised weapons==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:TireNail1-2.jpg|thumb|Improvised [[tire]] puncturing device (slang term "Ninja") – iron nail inserted into a rubber disc (from used tire)]]

[[Improvised weapon]]s are often used by guerrillas, insurgents and criminals as conventional weapons may be unavailable. Such weapons vary in sophistication from simple sharpened sticks, to petrol bombs and homemade napalm, to [[improvised explosive device]]s and makeshift [[bomber]] aircraft. Weapons are also improvised by regular military organizations and formations as "stop-gap" measures when purpose-built equipment is either not on hand or is simply not yet available.

'''Industrial computed tomography''' ('''CT''') '''scanning''' is any computer-aided [[tomography|tomographic]] process, usually [[X-ray computed tomography]], that uses [[irradiation]] to produce three-dimensional internal and external representations of a scanned object. Industrial CT scanning has been used in many areas of industry for internal inspection of components. Some of the key uses for industrial CT scanning have been flaw detection, failure analysis, metrology, assembly analysis and [[reverse engineering]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Flisch, A., et al. Industrial Computer Tomography in Reverse Engineering Applications. DGZfP-Proceedings BB 67-CD Paper 8, Computerized Tomography for Industrial Applications and Image Processing in Radiology, March 15–17, 1999, Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Susan. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110821224332/http://micromanufacturing.com/showthread.php?t=876 "3-D CT inspection offers a full view of microparts"], November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as in [[medical imaging]], industrial imaging includes both nontomographic radiography ([[industrial radiography]]) and computed tomographic radiography (computed tomography).

==Types of scanners==
[[File:CT Scanner Line Beam.jpg|thumb|alt=CT Scanner Beamline|right|Line beam scanner]]

''Line beam scanning'' is the traditional process of industrial CT scanning.&lt;ref name="Hofmann"&gt;Hofmann, J., Flisch, A., Obrist, A., Adaptive CT scanning-mesh based optimisation methods for industrial X-ray computer tomography applications. NDT&amp;E International (37), 2004, pp. 271–278.&lt;/ref&gt; X-rays are produced and the beam is collimated to create a line. The X-ray line beam is then translated across the part and data is collected by the detector.  The data is then reconstructed to create a 3-D v[[Volume rendering|olume rendering]] of the part.

In ''cone beam scanning'', the part to be scanned is placed on a rotary table.&lt;ref name="Hofmann" /&gt; As the part rotates, the cone of X-rays produce a large number of 2D images that are collected by the detector. The 2D images are then processed to create a 3D [[volume rendering]] of the external and internal geometries of the part.

[[File:Cone Beam CT Scanner.png|thumb|alt=CT Scanner Beamline|right|Cone beam scanner]]

==History==
Industrial CT scanning technology was introduced in 1972 with the invention of the [[CT scan|CT scanner]] for medical imaging by [[Godfrey Hounsfield]]. The invention earned him a Nobel Prize in medicine, which he shared with [[Allan McLeod Cormack]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoofan, Bahman. [http://www.3dscanningtechnologies.com/ComputedTomographyPage.php?3D_Micro-Tomography_-_A_Powerful_Engineering_Tool-4/ "3D Micro-Tomography – A Powerful Engineering Tool"]. 3D Scanning Technologies. July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3dscanningtechnologies.com/pdfs/parts.pdf Noel, Julien. "Advantages of CT in 3D Scanning of Industrial Parts]. August 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many advances in CT scanning have allowed for its use in the industrial field for metrology in addition to the visual inspection primarily used in the medical field (medical [[CT scan]]).

==Analysis and inspection techniques==
Various inspection uses and techniques include part-to-CAD comparisons, part-to-part comparisons, assembly and defect analysis, void analysis, wall thickness analysis, and generation of CAD data. The CAD data can be used for [[reverse engineering]], geometric dimensioning and tolerance analysis, and production part approval.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714085255/http://www.micromanu.com/x/guideArchiveArticle.html?id=1695 "Reducing Preproduction Inspection Costs with Industrial (CT) Computed Tomography."] Micro Manufacturing Magazine for the global micro manufacturing technology industry, August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly===
One of the most recognized forms of analysis using CT is for assembly, or visual analysis. CT scanning provides views inside components in their functioning position, without disassembly. Some software programs for industrial CT scanning allow for measurements to be taken from the CT dataset volume rendering. These measurements are useful for determining the clearances between assembled parts or the dimension of an individual feature.[[File:Industrial Computed Tomography - Failures - Void.jpg|thumb|An industrial computed tomography (CT) scan conducted on an aluminum casting to identify internal failures such as voids. All color coordinated particles within casting are voids/porosity/air pockets, which can additionally be measured and are color coordinated according to size.]]

===Void, crack and defect detection===
[[File:Peppergrinder 3D-flight-through microCT.OGG|thumb|Flight through a 3D reconstruction of a disposable pepper grinder. Glass in blue.]]

Traditionally, determining defects, voids and cracks within an object would require destructive testing. CT scanning can detect internal features and flaws displaying this information in 3D without destroying the part. Industrial CT scanning (3D X-ray) is used to detect flaws inside a part such as porosity,&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lambert | first1 = J. | last2 = Chambers | first2 = A.

Metal casting and moulded plastic components are typically prone to porosity because of cooling processes, transitions between thick and thin walls, and material properties. Void analysis can be used to locate, measure, and analyze voids inside plastic or metal components.

===Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing analysis===
Traditionally, without destructive testing, full metrology has only been performed on the exterior dimensions of components, such as with a [[coordinate-measuring machine]] or with a vision system to map exterior surfaces. Internal inspection methods would require using a 2D X-ray of the component or the use of destructive testing. Industrial CT scanning allows for full non-destructive metrology.

===Image-based finite element methods===
Image-based finite element method converts the 3D image data from X-ray computed tomography directly into meshes for [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]]. Benefits of this method include modelling complex geometries (e.g. composite materials) or accurately modelling "as manufactured" components at the micro-scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transient thermal finite element analysis of CFC–Cu ITER monoblock using X-ray tomography data|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277338941_Transient_thermal_finite_element_analysis_of_CFCCu_ITER_monoblock_using_X-ray_tomography_data|journal = Fusion Engineering and Design|date = 2015-05-28|pages = 100–111|volume = 100|doi = 10.1016/j.fusengdes.2015.04.048|first = Ll.

{{Functions}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''injective function''' or '''injection''' or '''one-to-one function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that preserves [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinctness]]: it never maps distinct elements of its [[Domain of a function|domain]] to the same element of its [[codomain]]. In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''at most'' one element of its domain. The term ''one-to-one function'' must not be confused with ''one-to-one correspondence'' (a.k.a.  [[bijective function]]), which uniquely maps all elements in both domain and codomain to each other (see figures).

Occasionally, an injective function from ''X'' to ''Y'' is denoted {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' ↣ ''Y''}}, using an arrow with a barbed tail ({{unichar|21A3|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of injective functions from ''X'' to ''Y'' may be denoted ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;''X''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; using a notation derived from that used for [[falling factorial power]]s, since if ''X'' and ''Y'' are finite sets with respectively ''m'' and ''n'' elements, the number of injections from ''X'' to ''Y'' is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;''m''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (see the [[Twelvefold way#case i|twelvefold way]]).

A function ''f'' that is not injective is sometimes called many-to-one. However, the injective terminology is also sometimes used to mean "single-valued", i.e., each argument is mapped to at most one value.

A [[monomorphism]] is a generalization of an injective function in [[category theory]].

== Definition ==
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
Let ''f'' be a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[Domain of a function|domain]] is a set ''X''. The function ''f'' is said to be '''injective''' provided that for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', whenever {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}; that is, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b'')}} implies {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}.&amp;nbsp; Equivalently, if {{nowrap|''a'' ≠ ''b''}}, then {{nowrap|''f''(''a'') ≠ ''f''(''b'')}}.

Symbolically,

: &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in X, \;\; f(a)=f(b) \Rightarrow a=b&lt;/math&gt;

which is logically equivalent to the [[Contraposition|contrapositive]],

: &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in X, \;\; a \neq b \Rightarrow f(a) \neq f(b)&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
*For any set ''X'' and any subset ''S'' of ''X'' the [[inclusion map]] {{nowrap|''S'' → ''X''}} (which sends any element ''s'' of ''S'' to itself) is injective. In particular the [[identity function]] {{nowrap|''X'' → ''X''}} is always injective (and in fact bijective).
*If the domain {{nowrap|1=''X'' = [[∅]]}} or ''X'' has only one element, the function {{nowrap|''X'' → ''Y''}} is always injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1}} is injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is ''not'' injective, because (for example) {{nowrap|1=''g''(1) = 1 = ''g''(−1)}}. However, if ''g'' is redefined so that its domain is the non-negative real numbers &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,+∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt;, then ''g'' is injective.
*The [[exponential function]] {{nowrap|exp : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=exp(''x'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is injective (but not [[surjective]] as no real value maps to a negative number).
*The [[natural logarithm]] function {{nowrap|ln : (0, ∞) → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ ln ''x''}} is injective.
*The function {{nowrap|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''}} is not injective, since, for example, {{nowrap|1=''g''(0) = ''g''(1) = 0}}.

More generally, when ''X'' and ''Y'' are both the [[real line]] '''R''', then an injective function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} is one whose graph is never intersected by any horizontal line more than once. This principle is referred to as the ''[[horizontal line test]]''.

That is, only one ''x'' in ''X'' maps to one ''y'' in ''Y''.]]

== Injections can be undone ==
Functions with [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|left inverses]] are always injections. That is, given {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}, if there is a function {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} such that, for every {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}},

:''g''(''f''(''x'')) = ''x'' (''f'' can be undone by ''g'')
 
then ''f'' is injective. In this case, ''g'' is called a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of ''f''. Conversely, ''f'' is called a [[Retract (category theory)|section]] of ''g''.

Conversely, every injection ''f'' with non-empty domain has a left inverse ''g'', which can be defined by fixing an element ''a'' in the domain of ''f'' so that ''g''(''x'') equals the unique preimage of ''x'' under ''f'' if it exists and ''g''(''x'') = ''a'' otherwise.{{refn|Unlike the corresponding statement that every surjective function has a left inverse, this does not require the [[axiom of choice]], as the existence of ''a'' is implied by the non-emptiness of the domain. However, this statement may fail in less conventional mathematics such as [[constructive mathematics]]. In constructive mathematics, the inclusion {{nowrap|{0,1} → '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals cannot have a left inverse, as it would violate [[indecomposability]], by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {0,1}.}} 

The left inverse ''g'' is not necessarily an [[inverse function|inverse]] of ''f'' because the composition in the other order, {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}}, may differ from the identity on ''Y''. In other words, an injective function can be  "reversed" by a left inverses, but is not necessarily [[inverse function|invertible]], which requires that the function is [[bijective]].

== Injections may be made invertible ==

In fact, to turn an injective function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} into a [[bijective function|bijective]] (hence [[Inverse function|invertible]]) function, it suffices to replace its codomain ''Y'' by its actual range {{nowrap|1=''J'' = ''f''(''X'')}}. That is, let {{nowrap|''g'' : ''X'' → ''J''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'')}} for all ''x'' in ''X''; then ''g'' is bijective. Indeed, ''f'' can be factored as {{nowrap|incl&lt;sub&gt;''J'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''g''}}, where {{nowrap|incl&lt;sub&gt;''J'',''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[inclusion function]] from ''J'' into ''Y''.

More generally, injective [[partial function]]s are called [[partial bijection]]s.

== Other properties ==
* If ''f'' and ''g'' are both injective, then {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is injective.
[[Image:Injective composition2.svg|thumb|300px|The composition of two injective functions is injective.]]
* If {{nowrap|''g'' ∘ ''f''}} is injective, then ''f'' is injective (but ''g'' need not be).
* {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective if and only if, given any functions ''g'', {{nowrap|''h'' : ''W'' → ''X''}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''f'' ∘ ''g'' = ''f'' ∘ ''h''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''h''}}. In other words, injective functions are precisely the [[monomorphism]]s in the [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of sets.
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective and ''A'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', then {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''(''A'')) = ''A''}}. Thus, ''A'' can be recovered from its [[image (function)|image]] ''f''(''A'').
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective and ''A'' and ''B'' are both subsets of ''X'', then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''A'' ∩ ''B'') = ''f''(''A'') ∩ ''f''(''B'')}}.
* Every function {{nowrap|''h'' : ''W'' → ''Y''}} can be decomposed as {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''f'' ∘ ''g''}} for a suitable injection ''f'' and surjection ''g''. This decomposition is unique [[up to isomorphism]], and ''f'' may be thought of as the [[inclusion function]] of the range ''h''(''W'') of ''h'' as a subset of the codomain ''Y'' of ''h''.
* If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is an injective function, then ''Y'' has at least as many elements as ''X'', in the sense of [[cardinal number]]s. In particular, if, in addition, there is an injection from ''Y&lt;'' to ''X'', then ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same cardinal number. (This is known as the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]].)
* If both ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set|finite]] with the same number of elements, then {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is injective if and only if ''f'' is [[surjective]] (in which case ''f'' is [[bijective]]).
*An injective function which is a [[homomorphism]] between two algebraic structures is an [[embedding]].
*Unlike surjectivity, which is a relation between the graph of a function and its codomain, injectivity is a property of the graph of the function alone; that is, whether a function ''f'' is injective can be decided by only considering the graph (and not the codomain) of ''f''.

==Proving that functions are injective==
A proof that a function ''f'' is injective depends on how the function is presented and what properties the function holds.
For functions that are given by some formula there is a basic idea.
We use the contrapositive of the definition of injectivity, namely that if {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Peter|title=Proving Functions One-to-One|url=http://www.math.csusb.edu/notes/proofs/bpf/node4.html|archivedate= 4 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604162511/http://www.math.csusb.edu/notes/proofs/bpf/node4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is an example:
: ''f'' = 2''x'' + 3

Proof: Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}.  Suppose {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')}}.  So {{nowrap|1=2''x'' + 3 = 2''y'' + 3}} ⇒ {{nowrap|1=2''x'' = 2''y''}} ⇒ {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}.  Therefore, it follows from the definition that ''f'' is injective.

There are multiple other methods of proving that a function is injective.  For example, in calculus if ''f'' is a differentiable function defined on some interval, then it is sufficient to show that the derivative is always positive or always negative on that interval.  In linear algebra, if ''f'' is a linear transformation it is sufficient to show that the kernel of ''f'' contains only the zero vector.  If ''f'' is a function with finite domain it is sufficient to look through the list of images of each domain element and check that no image occurs twice on the list.

An '''inquisitorial system''' is a [[legal system]] where the [[court]] or a part of the court is actively involved in investigating the facts of the case, as opposed to an [[adversarial system]] where the role of the court is primarily that of an impartial referee between the [[prosecution]] and the [[defendant|defense]]. Inquisitorial systems are used primarily in countries with [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal systems]] as opposed to [[common law]] systems. Countries using common law, including the [[United States]], may use an inquisitorial system for summary hearings in the case of [[misdemeanor]]s such as minor traffic violations. The distinction between an adversarial and inquisitorial system is theoretically unrelated to the distinction between a civil legal and common law system. Some legal scholars consider ''inquisitorial'' misleading, and prefer the word '''nonadversarial'''.&lt;ref&gt;Glendon MA, Carozza PG, Picker CB. (2008) ''Comparative Legal Traditions'', p. 101. Thomson-West.&lt;/ref&gt; The function is often vested in the office of the [[public procurator]], as in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], and [[Scotland]].

==Overview==
In an inquisitorial system, the trial judges (mostly plural in serious crimes) are inquisitors who actively participate in fact-finding public inquiry by questioning defense, prosecutors and witnesses. They could even order certain pieces of evidence to be examined if they find presentation by the defense or prosecution to be inadequate.

The inquisitorial system applies to questions of [[criminal procedure]], not [[substantive law]]; that is, it determines how criminal inquiries and trials are conducted, not the kind of crimes for which one can be prosecuted or the sentences that they carry. It is most readily used in some [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal systems]]. However, some jurists do not recognize this dichotomy and see procedure and substantive legal relationships as being interconnected and part of a theory of [[justice]] as applied differently in various legal cultures.

In an [[adversarial system]], judges focus on the issues of [[law]] and [[procedural law|procedure]] and act as a referee in the contest between the [[defendant|defense]] and the [[prosecutor]]. [[Jury|Juries]] decide matters of fact, and [[Jury nullification|sometimes matters of the law]]. Neither [[judge]] nor jury can initiate an inquiry, and judges rarely ask [[witness]]es questions directly during [[trial]]. In some American jurisdictions, it is common practice for jurors to submit questions to the court that they feel were not resolved in [[direct examination|direct]] or [[cross-examination]]. After [[testimony]] and other [[evidence (law)|evidence]] are presented and summarized in arguments, the jury will declare a [[verdict]] (literally: "the spoken truth") and in some jurisdictions the reasoning behind the verdict. However, the discussions among jurors cannot be made public except in extraordinary circumstances.  Appeals on the basis of factual issues, such as sufficiency of the sum total of evidence that was properly admitted, are subject to a [[standard of review]] that is in most jurisdictions heavily deferential to the judgment of the fact-finder at trial, be that a judge or a jury. The failure of a prosecutor to disclose evidence to the defense, for example, or a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights ([[right to counsel|legal representation]], [[right to silence|right to remain silent]], [[right to a fair trial|an open and public trial]]) can trigger a dismissal or [[new trial|re-trial]]. In some adversarial jurisdictions (e.g., the [[United States]]), a prosecutor cannot appeal a [[acquittal|"not guilty" verdict]] (absent corruption or gross [[malfeasance]] by the court).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1420701.html|title=FindLaw's United States Seventh Circuit case and opinions.|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adversarial systems, the defendant may plead "[[guilt (law)|guilty]]" or "[[nolo contendere|no contest]]" in exchange for reduced sentences, a practice known as [[plea bargain]]ing, which is an extremely common practice in the United States. In theory, the defendant must allocute or "voice" his or her crimes in open court, and the judge must believe the defendant is telling the truth about his or her guilt. In an inquisitorial system, a mere [[confession (law)|confession]] of guilt would not be regarded as ground for a guilty verdict, and the prosecutor is required to provide evidence supporting a guilty verdict; however, this requirement is not unique to inquisitorial systems, as many or most adversarial systems impose a similar requirement under the name ''[[corpus delicti]]''.

==History==
{{see also|Canon law of the Catholic Church|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
Until the development of the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in the 12th century, the legal systems used in medieval [[Europe]] generally relied on the adversarial system to determine whether someone should be tried and whether a person was guilty or innocent.  Under this system, unless people were caught in the act of committing crimes, they could not be tried until they had been formally accused by their victim, the voluntary accusations of a sufficient number of witnesses, or by an [[inquest]] (an early form of [[grand jury]]) convened specifically for that purpose. A weakness of this system was that because it relied on the voluntary accusations of witnesses, and because the penalties for making a false accusation were severe, victims and would-be witnesses could be hesitant to actually make their accusations to the court, for fear of implicating themselves. Because of the difficulties in deciding cases, procedures such as [[trial by ordeal]] or [[trial by combat|combat]] were accepted.

Beginning in 1198, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a series of decretals that reformed the ecclesiastical court system.  Under the new {{lang|la|processus per inquisitionem}} (inquisitional procedure) an ecclesiastical magistrate no longer required a formal accusation to summon and try a defendant. Instead, an [[ecclesiastical court]] could summon and interrogate witnesses of its own initiative, and if the (possibly secret) testimony of those witnesses accused a person of a crime, that person could then be summoned and tried. In 1215, the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] affirmed the use of the inquisitional system.  The council also forbade clergy from conducting trials by ordeal or combat.  As a result, in parts of continental Europe, the ecclesiastical courts operating under the inquisitional procedure became the dominant method by which disputes were adjudicated. In France, the {{lang|fr|[[parlement]]s}} — lay courts — also employed inquisitorial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;See:

In England, however, King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] had established separate secular courts during the 1160s.  While the ecclesiastical courts of England, like those on the continent, adopted the inquisitional system, the secular [[common law]] courts continued to operate under the adversarial system.  The adversarial principle that a person could not be tried until formally accused continued to apply for most criminal cases.  In 1215 this principle became enshrined as article 38 of the [[Magna Carta]]: "No bailiff for the future shall, upon his own unsupported complaint, put anyone to his law, without credible witnesses brought for this purposes."

The first territory to wholly adapt the inquisitional system was the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The new [[History of the principle of inquisition in German criminal law|German legal process]] was introduced as part of the {{lang|de|Wormser Reformation}} of 1498 and then the {{lang|la|Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis}} of 1507.  The adoption of the {{lang|la|[[Constitutio Criminalis Carolina]]}} ({{lang|de|peinliche Gerichtsordnung}} of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]) in 1532 made inquisitional procedures empirical law. It was not until [[Napoleon]] introduced the {{lang|fr|code d'instruction criminelle}} of the French code of criminal procedure on November 16, 1808, that the classical procedures of inquisition were ended in all German territories.

In the development of modern legal institutions which occurred in the 19th century, for the most part jurisdictions did not only codify their [[private law]] and [[criminal law]], but the rules of [[civil procedure]] were reviewed and [[codification (law)|codified]] as well.  It was through this movement that the role of an inquisitorial system became enshrined in most European civilian legal systems. However, there exist significant differences of operating methods and procedures between 18th century {{lang|fr|[[ancien régime]]}} courts and 19th-century courts. In particular, limits on the powers of investigators were typically added, as well as increased rights of the defense.

It would be too much of a generalization to state that the civil law is purely inquisitorial and the common law adversarial. Indeed, the ancient [[Roman law|Roman]] [[custom (law)|custom]] of [[arbitration]] has now been adapted in many common law jurisdictions to a more inquisitorial form. In some mixed civil law systems such as those in [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Quebec law|Quebec]], and [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]], while the substantive law is civil in nature and evolution, the procedural codes that have developed over the last several hundred years are based upon the English adversarial system.

==Modern usage==

===France===
The main feature of the inquisitorial system in [[criminal justice]] in France and other countries functioning along the same lines is the function of the examining or investigating judge (''juge d'instruction''). The examining judge conducts investigations into serious crimes or complex inquiries. As a member of the [[judiciary]], he or she is independent and outside the province of the executive branch, and therefore separate from the Office of Public Prosecutions which is supervised by the [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]].

Despite high media attention and frequent TV portrayals, examining judges are actually active in only a small minority of cases. In 2005, there were 1.1 million criminal rulings in France, while only 33,000 new cases were investigated by judges.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.justice.gouv.fr/art_pix/1_chiffrescles06.pdf Les chiffres-clés de la Justice]'', French Ministry of Justice, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of cases are therefore investigated directly by law enforcement agencies ([[French National Police|police]], [[French Gendarmerie|gendarmerie]]) under the supervision of the Office of Public Prosecutions (''procureurs'').

Examining judges are used for serious crimes, e.g., [[murder]] and [[rape]], and for crimes involving complexity, such as [[embezzlement]], misuse of public funds, and [[political corruption|corruption]]. The case may be brought before the examining judge either by the public prosecutor (''procureur'') or, more rarely, by the victim (who may compel an ''instruction'' even if the public prosecutor rules the charges to be insufficient).

The judge questions witnesses, interrogates suspects, and orders [[search warrant|search]]es for other investigations. Their role is not to prosecute the accused, but to gather facts, and as such their duty is to look for any and all [[evidence (law)|evidence]] (''à charge et à décharge''), incriminating or exculpatory. Both the [[prosecution]] and the [[defense (legal)|defense]] may request the judge to act and may appeal the judge's decisions before an appellate court. The scope of the inquiry is limited by the mandate given by the prosecutor's office:  the examining judge cannot open a criminal investigation [[sua sponte]].

In the past the examining judge could order committal of the accused, this power being subject to appeal. However, this is no longer the case, and other judges have to approve a committal order.

If the examining judge decides there is a valid case against a suspect, the accused is sent for adversarial trial by jury. The examining judge does not sit on the trial court which tries the case and is in fact prohibited from sitting for future cases involving the same defendant. The case is tried before the court in a manner similar to that of adversarial courts: the prosecution (and on occasion a plaintiff) seeks the conviction of accused criminals, the defense attempts to rebut the prosecution claims, and the [[judge]] and [[jury]] draw their conclusions from the evidence presented at trial.

As a result of judicial investigation and defendants being able to have judicial proceedings dismissed on procedural grounds during the examining phase, cases where the evidence is weak tend not to reach the trial stage. Conversely, the guilty [[plea]] and [[plea bargain]]ing were until recently unknown to French law, and now it only applies to crimes for which the prosecution seeks a sentence not exceeding one year imprisonment. Therefore, most cases go to trial, including cases where the prosecution is almost sure to gain a conviction, whereas, in countries such as the United States, these would be settled by plea bargain.

==Other types==

===Administrative justice===
In [[administrative law|administrative court]]s such as the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], litigation proceedings are markedly more inquisitorial. Most of the procedure is conducted in writing; the plaintiff writes to the court, which asks explanations from the administration or public service concerned; when answered, the court may then ask further detail from the plaintiff, etc. When the case is sufficiently complete, the lawsuit opens in court; however, the parties are not even required to attend the court appearance. This method reflects the fact that administrative lawsuits are for the most part about matters of formal procedure and technicalities.

===Inquisitorial tribunals within the United States===
Certain administrative proceedings within some common law jurisdictions in the United States may be similar to their civil law counterparts but are conducted on a more inquisitorial model. For instance tribunals dealing with minor traffic violations at the [[New York City Traffic Violations Bureau]] are held before an adjudicator who also functions as a prosecutor. They question witnesses before rendering judgements and setting fines.

These types of tribunals or boards function as an expedited form of justice where the state agents conduct an initial investigation and the adjudicator's job is to confirm these preliminary findings through a simplified form of procedure that grants some basic amount of [[due process]] or [[fundamental justice]] in which the accused party has an opportunity to place his or her objections on the record.

'''Integrated modification methodology''' ('''IMM''') is a procedure encompassing an open set of scientific techniques for morphologically analyzing the [[built environment]] in a multiscale manner and evaluating its performance in actual states or under specific design scenarios.

The methodology is structured around a nonlinear phasing process aiming for delivering a systemic understanding of any given urban settlement, formulating the modification set-ups for improving its performance, and examining the modification strategies to transform that system. The basic assumption in IMM is the recognition of the built environment as a [[Complex adaptive system|Complex Adaptive System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=J|date=2007|title=Complex Adaptive Systems|url=|journal=CIS Technical Report|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMM has been developed by IMMdesignlab, a research lab based at [[Polytechnic University of Milan|Politecnico di Milano]] at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC).

==History==

IMM began in 2010 as an academic research at Politecnico di Milano. That research criticized the analytical approach frequently used to study and evaluate the built environment by most of the sustainable development methods. By Recognizing the built environment as a [[Complex Adaptive System]] (CAS), IMM is urged towards a holistic simulation rather than simplifying the complex mechanisms within the cities with [[reductionism]].

In 2013, Massimo Tadi established the ''IMMdesignlab'' at the Department of Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (DABC) of the Politecnico di Milano. The purpose of the mentioned laboratory is to develop IMM through research and education.

IN 2015, ''Integrated Modification Methodology for the Sustainable Built Environment'' has been approved as an academic course in the curriculum of the ''Architectural Engineering'', an International Master Program in Politecnico di Milano.

==Background==

At its theoretical background, Integrated Modification Methodology refers to the contemporary urban development as a highly paradoxical context arisen from the social and economic significance of the cities on the one hand and their arguably negative environmental impacts on the other. Asserting the inevitably of [[urbanization]], IMM declares that the only way to overcome that paradox for the cities is to develop in a profound integration with the [[ecology]]. According to IMM, the fundamental prerequisite of ecologically [[sustainable development]] is to have a comprehensive systemic understanding of the built environment.

IMM suggests that the advancement in construction techniques, building materials quality and transportation technologies alone have not solved the complex problems of the urban life simply because such improvements are not necessarily dealing with the systemic integration. The core argument of IMM is that the performance of the city is being chiefly driven by the complex relationships subsystems rather than the independent qualities of the urban elements. Thus, it aims at portraying the systemic structure of the built environment by introducing a logical framework for modeling the linkage between the city’s static and dynamic elements.

== Methodology ==

Integrated Modification Methodology is based on an iterative process involving the following four major phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first2=S|date=2014|title=Transformation of an urban complex system into a more sustainable form via integrated modification methodology (I.M.M)|url=|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Investigation
# Formulation
# Modification
# Retrofitting and Optimization 
The first phase, Investigation, is a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. It begins with ''Horizontal Investigation'' in which the area under study is being dismantled into its morphology-generator elements, namely Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. It follows with ''Vertical Investigation'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahabzadeh Manesh|first=S|last2=Tadi|first2=Massimo|date=2011|title=, Sustainable urban morphology emergence via Complex Adaptive System analysis|url=|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=|pages=89–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is a study of integral relationships between the mentioned elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes named ''[[Key Categories]]''. In a nutshell they are types of [[emergence]] that show how elements come to self-organize or to synchronize their states into forming a new level of organization. Hence in IMM, Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between elementary parts (Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links) to form a synergy able to add value to the combined organization. Key categories are the products of the synergy between elementary parts, a new organization that emerge not (simply as) an additive result of the proprieties of the elementary parts. 
IMM declares that the city’s functioning manner is chiefly driven from the Key Categories, hence, they have the most fundamental role in understanding the architecture of the city as a Complex Adaptive System. The Investigation phase concludes with the ''Evaluation'' step which is basically an examination of the system’s performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability. The same indicators are later used in the CAS retrofitting process necessary for the final evaluation of the system performance, after the transformation design process occurred.

The Formulation phase is a technical assumption of the most critical Key Category and the urban element within the  area deduced from the Investigation phase. These critical attributes are being interpreted as the Catalysts of transformation and are to come to the designer’s use to set a contextual priority list of ''[[Design Ordering Principals]]''.

The third phase is the introduction of the modification/design scenarios to the project and advances with examining them by the exact procedure of the Investigation phase in a repetitive manner until the transformed context is predicted to be acceptable in arrangement and evaluation.

The fourth phase, Retrofitting and Optimization, is a testing process of the outcomes of the modification phase, then a local optimization by technical strategies (e.g. installing photovoltaic panels, designing green roofs, studying building orientations etc.) is initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadi|first=Massimo|last2=Mohammad Zadeh|first2=Hadi|date=2014|others=Naraghi, Vahabzadeh Manesh|title=Environmental and energy performance optimization of a neighborhood in Tehran, via IMM methodology|url=|journal=International Journal of Engineering Science and Innovative Technology (IJESIT)|volume=|pages=409–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The first recorded use of the term "libertarianism" was in 1789 by [[William Belsham]] in a discussion of free will and in opposition to "[[Necessitarianism|necessitarian]]" (or determinist) views.&lt;ref&gt;William Belsham, "Essays", printed for C. Dilly, 1789; original from the University of Michigan, digitized May 21, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6Y0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=William+Belsham+libertarian&amp;ei=-nUySsirNKqMygSy6-2OBg p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary definition of libertarianism].&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysical libertarianism is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires the [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] to be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, and consequently the world is not closed under physics. Such [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|interactionist dualists]] believe that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]].

Explanations of libertarianism that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– a theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Physical determinism, under the assumption of physicalism, implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. Some libertarian explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities. Other approaches do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe; ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" believed to be necessary by libertarians.

Free [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is regarded as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of indeterminism.

Most events can be explained as the effects of prior events.  When a tree falls, it does so because of the force of the wind, its own structural weakness, and so on.  However, when a person performs a free act, agent causation theorists say that the action was not caused by any other events or states of affairs, but rather was caused by the agent.  Agent causation is [[ontology|ontologically]] separate from event causation.  The action was not uncaused, because the agent caused it.  But the agent's causing it was not determined by the agent's character, desires, or past, since that would just be event causation.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm 1964, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Chisholm explains it, humans have "a prerogative which some would attribute only to God: each of us, when we act, is a [[unmoved mover|prime mover]] unmoved.  In doing what we do, we cause certain events to happen, and nothing – or no one – causes us to cause those events to happen."&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm 1964, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;   

This theory involves a difficulty which has long been associated with the idea of an unmoved mover.  If a free action was not caused by any event, such as a change in the agent or an act of the will, then what is the difference between saying that an agent caused the event and simply saying that the event happened on its own?  As [[William James]] put it, "If a 'free' act be a sheer novelty, that comes not from me, the previous me, but ex nihilo, and simply tacks itself on to me, how can I, the previous I, be responsible?  How can I have any permanent character that will stand still long enough for praise or blame to be awarded?"&lt;ref&gt;''[Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5116/5116-h/5116-h.htm#link2H_4_0005]'' (1907), Hackett Publishing 1981: {{ISBN|0-915145-05-7}}, Dover 1995: {{ISBN|0-486-28270-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  

Agent causation advocates respond that agent causation is actually more intuitive than event causation. They point to [[David Hume]]'s argument that when we see two events happen in succession, our belief that one event caused the other cannot be justified rationally (known as the [[problem of induction]]).  If that is so, where does our belief in causality come from?  According to Thomas Reid, "the conception of an efficient cause may very probably be derived from the experience we have had...of our own power to produce certain effects."&lt;ref name="ReidStewart1843"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Reid|author2=Dugald Stewart|title=Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind: An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense; and An Essay on Quantity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWQAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA102|year=1843|publisher=T. Tegg|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Our everyday experiences of agent causation provide the basis for the idea of event causation.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event-causal theories==
Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events – and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes – a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

===Epicurus===
{{seealso|Free will in antiquity}}
[[Epicurus]], an ancient Greek philosopher, argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would "swerve" (''[[clinamen]]'') from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions, something impossible if every action was deterministically caused.

Epicurus did not say the swerve was directly involved in decisions. But following [[Aristotle]], Epicurus thought human agents have the autonomous ability to transcend necessity and chance (both of which destroy responsibility), so that praise and blame are appropriate. Epicurus finds a ''[[tertium quid]]'', beyond necessity ([[Democritus]]' physics) and beyond chance. His ''tertium quid'' is agent autonomy, what is "up to us."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...some things happen of necessity (ἀνάγκη), others by chance (τύχη), others through our own agency (παρ’ ἡμᾶς).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    ...necessity destroys responsibility and chance is inconstant; whereas our own actions are autonomous, and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach.&lt;ref&gt;Epicurus, ''Letter to Menoeceus'', §133&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Lucretius]] (1st century BC), a strong supporter of Epicurus, saw the randomness as enabling free will, even if he could not explain exactly how, beyond the fact that random swerves would break the causal chain of determinism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Again, if all motion is always one long chain, and new motion arises out of the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this freedom (''libera'') in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will (''voluntas'') wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just where our mind has taken us? For undoubtedly it is his own will in each that begins these things, and from the will movements go rippling through the limbs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the interpretation of Greek philosophers is controversial. Tim O'Keefe has argued that Epicurus and Lucretius were not libertarians at all, but compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-1-139-44624-2| last = O'Keefe| first = Tim| title = Epicurus on Freedom| date = 2005-07-28|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5pXXFXNrIAC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Nozick===
[[Robert Nozick]] put forward an indeterministic theory of free will in ''[[Philosophical Explanations]]'' (1981).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nozick, Robert. Philosophical Explanations. 1981: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

When human beings become agents through reflexive self-awareness, they express their agency by having reasons for acting, to which they assign weights. Choosing the dimensions of one's identity is a special case, in which the assigning of weight to a dimension is partly self-constitutive. But all acting for reasons is constitutive of the self in a broader sense, namely, by its shaping one's character and personality in a manner analogous to the shaping that law undergoes through the precedent set by earlier court decisions. Just as a judge does not merely apply the law but to some degree makes it through judicial discretion, so too a person does not merely discover weights but assigns them; one not only weighs reasons but also weights them. Set in train is a process of building a framework for future decisions that we are tentatively committed to.

The lifelong process of self-definition in this broader sense is construed [[Indeterminism|indeterministically]] by Nozick. The weighting is "up to us" in the sense that it is undetermined by antecedent causal factors, even though subsequent action is fully caused by the reasons one has accepted. He compares assigning weights in this deterministic sense to "the currently orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics", following [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] in understanding a quantum mechanical system as in a superposition or probability mixture of states, which changes continuously in accordance with quantum mechanical equations of motion and discontinuously via measurement or observation that "collapses the wave packet" from a superposition to a particular state.  Analogously, a person before decision has reasons without fixed weights: he is in a superposition of weights. The process of decision reduces the superposition to a particular state that causes action.

===Robert Kane===
One particularly influential contemporary theory of libertarian free will is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]].&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Penguin| isbn = 978-1-101-57266-5| last = Dennett| first = Daniel C.| title = Freedom Evolves| date = 2004-01-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsuNFGmIxkIC|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1538-1617| last1 = Palmer| first1 = David| last2 = Swenson| first2 = Philip| title = Review of &lt;i&gt;Libertarian Free Will: Contemporary Debates&lt;/i&gt;| date = 2015-06-24|
url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/libertarian-free-will-contemporary-debates/}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Kane argues that "(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent's power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and that (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)".&lt;ref&gt;Kane (ed.): ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that the crux of Kane's position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR).  Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-514970-8| last = Kane| first = Robert| title = A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will| date = 2005|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is necessary that there be ([[Metaphysics|metaphysically]]) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control.  The control is found in "ultimate responsibility".

Ultimate responsibility entails that agents must be the ultimate creators (or originators) and sustainers of their own ends and purposes.  There must be more than one way for a person's life to turn out (AP).  More importantly, whichever way it turns out must be based in the person's willing actions.  As Kane defines it,

{{Quotation|'''UR:''' ''An agent is ultimately responsible for some (event or state) E's occurring only if (R) the agent is personally responsible for E's occurring in a sense which entails that something the agent voluntarily (or willingly) did or omitted either was, or causally contributed to, E's occurrence and made a difference to whether or not E occurred; and (U) for every X and Y (where X and Y represent occurrences of events and/or states) if the agent is personally responsible for X and if Y is an ''arche'' (sufficient condition, cause or motive) for X, then the agent must also be personally responsible for Y.''|}}

In short, "an agent must be responsible for anything that is a sufficient reason (condition, cause or motive) for the action's occurring."&lt;ref&gt;Kane: "Free Will" in ''Free Will'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

What allows for ultimacy of creation in Kane's picture are what he refers to as "self-forming actions" or SFAs—those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills.  These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refraining in the life histories of agents that are required for UR.  UR does not require that ''every'' act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs.  These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action.  If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), they are responsible for the actions that are a result of their character.

====Critique====
[[Randolph Clarke (philosopher)|Randolph Clarke]] objects that Kane's depiction of free will is not truly libertarian but rather a form of [[compatibilism]].  The objection asserts that although the outcome of an SFA is not determined, one's history up to the event ''is''; so the fact that an SFA will occur is also determined.  The outcome of the SFA is based on chance, and from that point on one's life is determined.  This kind of freedom, says Clarke, is no different than the kind of freedom argued for by compatibilists, who assert that even though our actions are determined, they are free because they are in accordance with our own wills, much like the outcome of an SFA.&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Randolph Clarke|title=Libertarian Accounts of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7V6n6-vobcIC|date=8 December 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530642-2|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kane responds that the difference between causal indeterminism and compatibilism is "ultimate control—the originative control exercised by agents when it is 'up to them' which of a set of possible choices or actions will now occur, and up to no one and nothing else over which the agents themselves do not also have control".&lt;ref&gt;Kane: "Free Will" in ''Free Will'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;  UR assures that the sufficient conditions for one's actions do not lie before one's own birth.

[[Galen Strawson]] holds that there is a fundamental sense in which [[free will]] is impossible, whether [[determinism]] is true or not.  He argues for this position with what he calls his "basic argument", which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us.

In his book defending [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilism]], ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', Daniel Dennett spends a chapter criticising Kane's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, 97–137&lt;/ref&gt; Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially ''indetectable'' notion of free will to be incredible.

A '''MET''' ('''M'''aterials, '''E'''nergy, and '''T'''oxicity) '''Matrix''' is an [[analysis]] tool used to evaluate various [[environmental impact]]s of a product over its [[Life cycle analysis|life cycle]].  The tool takes the form of a 3x3 matrix with descriptive text in each of its cells.  One dimension of the matrix is composed of a qualitative input-output model that examines environmental concerns related to the product's materials use, energy use, and [[toxicity]].  The other dimension looks at the [[Life cycle analysis|life cycle]] of the product through its production, use, and [[Waste management|disposal]] phase.  The text in each cell corresponds to the intersection of two particular aspects.  For example, this means that by looking at certain cells, one can examine aspects such as energy use during the production phase, or levels of [[toxicity]] that may be a concern during the [[Waste management|disposal]] phase.&lt;ref&gt;René van Berkel, Esther Willems, and Marije Lafleur (1997) "Development of an industrial ecology toolbox for the introduction of industrial ecology in enterprises - I" ''Journal of Cleaner Production'' 1997, 5:1-2, pp 11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">The '''Manhattan address algorithm''' refers to the formulas used to estimate the closest east–west cross street for [[building number]]s on north–south avenues in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ny.com/locator/ Manhattan Address Locator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frommers.com/destinations/newyorkcity/0021020048.html Frommer's New York City 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm==
To find the approximate number of the closest cross street, divide the building number by a divisor (generally 20) and add (or subtract) the "magic number" from the table below:

In [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] theory, the '''Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution''' ('''MRTS''')—or '''Technical Rate of Substitution''' ('''TRS''')—is the amount by which the quantity of one input has to be reduced (&lt;math&gt;-\Delta x_2&lt;/math&gt;) when one extra unit of another input is used (&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;), so that output remains constant (&lt;math&gt;y = \bar{y}&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;MRTS(x_1,x_2) =-\frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1} = \frac{MP_1}{MP_2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;MP_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;MP_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[marginal product]]s of input 1 and input 2, respectively.

Along an [[isoquant]], the MRTS shows the rate at which one input (e.g. capital or labor) may be substituted for another, while maintaining the same level of output. Thus the MRTS is the absolute value of the slope of an isoquant at the point in question.

When relative input usages are optimal, the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal to the relative unit costs of the inputs, and the slope of the isoquant at the chosen point equals the slope of the [[isocost|isocost curve]] (see [[Conditional factor demands]]). It is the rate at which one input is substituted for another to maintain the same level of output.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6935">In [[mathematics]], there are many senses in which a sequence or a series is said to be convergent.  This article describes various modes (senses or species) of convergence in the settings where they are defined.  For a list of '''modes of convergence''', see [[Modes of convergence (annotated index)]]

Note that each of the following objects is a special case of the types preceding it: [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[topological spaces]], [[uniform spaces]], [[topological abelian group|TAGs]] (topological abelian groups), [[Normed vector space|normed spaces]], [[Euclidean spaces]], and the real/complex numbers. Also, note that any [[metric space]] is a uniform space.

==Elements of a topological space==
Convergence can be defined in terms of [[Limit of a sequence|sequences]] in [[first-countable space]]s. [[Net (mathematics)|Net]]s are a generalization of sequences that is useful in spaces which are not first countable. [[Filter (mathematics)|Filter]]s further generalize the concept of convergence.

In metric spaces, one can define [[Cauchy sequence]]s. Cauchy nets and filters are generalizations to [[uniform space]]s. Even more generally, [[Cauchy space]]s are spaces in which Cauchy filters may be defined. Convergence implies "Cauchy-convergence", and Cauchy-convergence, together with the existence of a convergent subsequence implies convergence. The concept of [[complete metric space|completeness]] of metric spaces, and its generalizations is defined in terms of Cauchy sequences.

==Series of elements in a topological abelian group==
In a [[topological abelian group]], convergence of a [[series (mathematics)|series]] is defined as convergence of the sequence of partial sums. An important concept when considering series is [[unconditional convergence]], which guarantees that the limit of the series is invariant under permutations of the summands.

In a normed vector space, one can define [[absolute convergence]] as convergence of the series of norms (&lt;math&gt;\Sigma|b_k|&lt;/math&gt;). Absolute convergence implies Cauchy convergence of the sequence of partial sums (by the triangle inequality), which in turn implies absolute-convergence of some grouping (not reordering). The sequence of partial sums obtained by grouping is a subsequence of the partial sums of the original series. The norm convergence of absolutely convergent series is an equivalent condition for a normed linear space to be [[Banach space|Banach]] (i.e.: complete).

Absolute convergence and convergence together imply unconditional convergence, but unconditional convergence does not imply absolute convergence in general, even if the space is Banach, although the implication holds in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

==Convergence of sequence of functions on a topological space==
The most basic type of convergence for a sequence of functions (in particular, it does not assume any topological structure on the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the functions) is [[pointwise convergence]]. It is defined as convergence of the sequence of values of the functions at every point. If the functions take their values in a uniform space, then one can define pointwise Cauchy convergence, [[uniform convergence]], and [[uniformly Cauchy sequence|uniform Cauchy convergence]] of the sequence.

Pointwise convergence implies pointwise Cauchy-convergence, and the converse holds if the space in which the functions take their values is complete. Uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence and uniform Cauchy convergence. Uniform Cauchy convergence and pointwise convergence of a subsequence imply uniform convergence of the sequence, and if the codomain is complete, then uniform Cauchy convergence implies uniform convergence.

If the domain of the functions is a topological space, [[local uniform convergence]] (i.e. uniform convergence on a neighborhood of each point) and [[compact convergence|compact (uniform) convergence]] (i.e. uniform convergence on all [[compact subset]]s) may be defined. Note that "compact convergence" is always short for "compact uniform convergence," since "compact pointwise convergence" would mean the same thing as "pointwise convergence" (points are always compact).

Uniform convergence implies both local uniform convergence and compact convergence, since both are local notions while uniform convergence is global. If ''X'' is [[locally compact]] (even in the weakest sense: every point has compact neighborhood), then local uniform convergence is equivalent to compact (uniform) convergence.  Roughly speaking, this is because "local" and "compact" connote the same thing.

==Series of functions on a topological abelian group==
Pointwise and uniform convergence of series of functions are defined in terms of convergence of the sequence of partial sums.

For functions taking values in a [[normed linear space]], absolute convergence refers to convergence of the series of positive, real-valued functions &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt; . "Pointwise absolute convergence" is then simply pointwise convergence of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt;.
 
[[Normal convergence]]&lt;sup&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/N/n067430.htm]&lt;/sup&gt; is convergence of the series of non-negative real numbers obtained by taking the [[uniform norm|uniform (i.e. "sup") norm]] of each function in the series (uniform convergence of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma|g_k|&lt;/math&gt;). In [[Banach space]]s, pointwise absolute convergence implies pointwise convergence, and normal convergence implies uniform convergence.

For functions defined on a topological space, one can define (as above) [[local uniform convergence]] and [[compact convergence|compact (uniform) convergence]] in terms of the partial sums of the series. If, in addition, the functions take values in a normed linear space, then [[Normal convergence#Local normal convergence|local normal convergence]] (local, uniform, absolute convergence) and [[Normal convergence#Compact normal convergence|compact normal convergence]] (absolute convergence on [[compact set]]s) can be defined.

Normal convergence implies both local normal convergence and compact normal convergence. And if the domain is [[locally compact]] (even in the weakest sense), then local normal convergence implies compact normal convergence.

==Functions defined on a measure space==
{{Main|Convergence of random variables}}
If one considers sequences of [[measurable function]]s, then several modes of convergence that depend on measure-theoretic, rather than solely topological properties, arise. This includes pointwise convergence almost-everywhere, convergence in ''p''-mean and convergence in measure. These are of particular interest in [[probability theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">'''Moral blindness''' is a state of unawareness or insensibility to moral issues pertaining both to oneself and to one's relations to others. [[George Eliot]] considered that "We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder to feed our supreme selves".&lt;ref&gt;George Eliot, ''Middlemarch'' (1974) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy development leads away from early [[egotism]] to produce greater levels of awareness,&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; leading to degrees of what [[Abraham Maslow]] called "lesser blindness".&lt;ref&gt;J. Loevinger, ''Ego Development'' (1976) p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics question whether "moral blindness" is ever more than a useful weapon of debate with which to charge one's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;A. Edel, ''Ethical Judgement'' (1955) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
Philosophically, moral blindness has been explored from [[Plato]]'s tyrant onwards, through [[Epitectus]] and [[Kant]], but came into full prominence with [[Ethical intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Edel, ''Moral Judgement'' (1955) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Figures like [[G. E. Moore]] argued for a "direct moral awareness"&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; and saw moral blindness as the equivalent of colour blindness.&lt;ref&gt;A. Edel, ''Moral Judgement'' (1955) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental views==
[[Melanie Klein]] saw early development in terms of the child slowly emerging from a state of [[narcissism|narcissistic]] blindness to recognise the motherer as a moral end in herself, not simply as the child's means or tool—a step she called the [[depressive position]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. W. Winnicott]] similarly saw the infant as moving from {{Clarification needed|text=pre-ruth to ruth|date=May 2016}}—from an unconcerned use of the mother to concerned usage.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1997) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern amplifications==
[[Zygmunt Bauman]] considers certain features of 21st century society to actively promote moral blindness. A valorisation of commodities as ephemeral and exchangeable combines with the effect of [[internet]] anonymity to create a culture that tends to ignore of the particularity of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Bauman/L. Doaskis, ''Moral Blindness'' (2014)   p. 11-5&lt;/ref&gt; Equally pernicious is the extension of a calculus of gain over ever-wider areas of life, to the exclusion of moral evaluation&lt;ref&gt;Z. Bauman/L. Doaskis, ''Moral Blindness'' (2014) p. 16 and p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;—the unchallenged moral blindness of the market.&lt;ref&gt;S. Best, ''A Beginner's Guide to Social Theory'' (2003) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary analogies==
* [[Dante]] has been interpreted as showing vices leading to moral blindness, virtues to moral imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Pucka, ''Moral Development'' (1994) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iain M. Banks]] wrote of "the moral equivalent of black holes, where the normal laws—the rules of right and wrong that people imagine apply everywhere else in the universe—break down".&lt;ref&gt;Iain M. Banks, ''Use of Weapons'' (1990) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhūrt''' ({{lang-sa|मुहूर्त}}) is a  [[Hindu units of measurement|Hindu unit of measurement]] for time along with nimesh, kāṣṭhā and kalā&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hinduism for Children Activity Workbook|last=Verma|first=Dinesh|publisher=Chanda Books|year=2008|isbn=9781440499913|location=|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Hindu calendar]].

In the [[Brāhmaṇas]], ''muhūrta'' denotes a division of time: one-thirtieth of a day, or a period of forty-eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, I, I (for the names); 9, 7; 12, 9, 6; Śatapata Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 2, 18. 25. 27; 3, 20; xii. 3, 2, 5; x. 4, 4, 4, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense "moment" is also common in the Brāhmanạs.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 9, 139 et seq.; Indische Streifen, I, 92, et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rigveda]]&lt;ref&gt;Rigveda iii. 33, 5: 53, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; we only find the sense "moment."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Anthony Macdonnell and [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]], ''Vedic Index of Names and Subjects,'' vol. 2, p. 169. Motilal Banarsidas, London 1912, reprint 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further each muhūrta is further divided into 30 (Indian) minutes or kalā (making 30 Kalā ≈ 48 western min). Each kalā is further divided into 30 (Indian) seconds or Kāṣṭhā, making 30 Kāṣṭhā ≈ 1.6 western minute.

==Etymology==
The "Sandhi Vidchhed" for the term is thus: It breaks muhūrt into two parts, "muhu" (moment/immediate) and "ṛta" (order). The author of Ṛg Ved III.33.5 has accordingly created this descriptive term. [[Rta|Ṛta]] refers to the natural, yearly order of the seasons, so that the term muhūrt refers to the daily reflection of these. Also, cf., ''Śatpath Brāhmaṇa'' X.4.2.18, as below.

==Usage in the Vedic Period==
The term appears as early as the Ṛg Veda, where, according to Monier Williams, it means "a moment",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0825-mugdha.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; but does not evidence any specification of an exact periodicity there as received in later works, such as the  ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana|Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa]]'', "The One Hundred Path Riddle" or the ''[[Taittiriya Brahmana|Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa]]'', "The Partridge's Riddle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Index of Names and Subjects, Volume 2; Volume 5|page=169|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |author2=Arthur Berriedale Keith|date=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5GaKHfNzScC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pt. Vijay Shrikrishna Jakatdar points to two specific Ṛg Veda passages that employ the term, III.33.5, and III.53.8:&lt;ref name="ebookbrowsee.net"&gt;http://ebookbrowsee.net/filedownload-php-v-8-a-y-b-y-f-71-muhurtaaconcepttobeamendedaspermoderntimesbw-pdf-d169899279&lt;/ref&gt;

पर सिन्धुमछा बर्हती मनीषावस्युरह्वे कुशिकस्य सूनुः ||

"Linger a little at my friendly bidding rest, Holy Ones, a ''moment'' in your journey.
With hymn sublime soliciting your favour Kuśika's son hath called unto the River." (trans. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv03033.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
and

रूपं-रूपं मघवा बोभवीति मायाः कर्ण्वानस्तन्वं परि सवाम | 
तरिर्यद दिवः परि मुहूर्तमागात सवैर्मन्त्रैरन्र्तुपा रतावा ||

"Maghavan weareth every shape at pleasure, effecting magic changes in his body,
Holy One, drinker out of season, coming thrice, in a ''moment'', through fit prayers, from heaven." (ibid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv03053.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Authur Anthony Macdonell and Authur Berriedale, the Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa mentions the names of 15 muhūrtas:

''(1) saṁjñānaṁ (2) vijñānaṁ (3) prajñānaṁ (4) jānad (5) abhijānat'' |&lt;br&gt;
''(6) saṁkalpamānaṁ (7) prakalpamānam (8) upakalpamānam (9) upakḷptaṁ (10) kḷptam'' |&lt;br&gt;
''(11) śreyo (12)  vasīya (13) āyat (14) saṁbhūtaṁ (15) bhūtam'' |&lt;br&gt;
''citraḥ ketuḥ prabhānābhānt saṁbhān'' |&lt;br&gt;
''jyotiṣmaṁs-tejasvānātapaṁs-tapann-abhitapan'' |&lt;br&gt;
''rocano rocamānaḥ śobhanaḥ śobhamānaḥ kalyāṇaḥ'' |&lt;br&gt;
''darśā dṛṣṭā darśatā viṣvarūpā surdarśanā'' |&lt;br&gt;
''āpy-āyamāṇāpyāyamānāpyāyā su-nṛterā'' |&lt;br&gt;
''āpūryamāṇā pūryamāṇā pūryantī pūrṇā paurṇamāsī'' |&lt;br&gt;
''dātā pradātā'nando modaḥ pramodaḥ ''|| III.10.1.1 ||

Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa describes a muhūrta as 1/15th portion of a day:

átʰa yaccáturviṃśatimātmáno'kuruta |
tásmāc-cátur-viṃśaty-ardʰa-māsaḥ saṃ-vatsaraḥ sá etaiś-cátur-viṃśatyā triṃ-śád-iṣṭakair-ātmábʰir-na vyábʰavat-sa páñca-daśā́hno rūpā́ṇy-apaśyad-ātmánas-tanvò muhūrtā́lokam-pr̥ṇāḥ páñca-daśaiva rā́tres-tadyán-muhu trā́yante tásmān-muhurtā átʰa yát-kṣudrāḥ sánta imā́ṃ-lokā́n-āpūráyanti tásmāl-lokam-pr̥ṇā́ḥ || (X.4.2.18)

It is stated in ''[[Manusmṛti]]'' that 18 nimeṣas (twinklings of the eye) are 1 Kāṣṭhā, 30 Kāṣṭhās are 1 Kāla, 30 Kālas are one Muhūrta, and 30 Muhūrtas are one day and night.

==Ritual Significance==
It is a common practice in Hinduism to perform or avoid activities like important religious ceremonies on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Demystifying Brahminism and Re-Inventing Hinduism: Volume 1 - Demystifying Brahminism|last=Shri|first=Satya|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=9781946515544|location=Chennai|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dheivegam.com/tamil-muhurtham-dates/ | title=Tamil Muhurtham dates | publisher=Dheivegam}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or more Muhūrtas are recommended by the Vedic scriptures when performing rituals and other ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is demonstrated in the way "Muhūrt" is used in present-day South Asia for calculating the most auspicious moment for a Vedic-Hindu Wedding ceremony. Astrologers are often hired to calculate a moment for the wedding so that any possible divinely-sourced problems can be averted. Jakatdar suggests a shift in the contemporary temperament regarding the traditional approach to calculating such events, to accommodate the ever increasing complexity of modern life.&lt;ref name="ebookbrowsee.net"/&gt; The muhūrt has the same utility in the marriage rites in Brahmanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Volume 20|last=Sholapur|first=|publisher=Government Central Press|year=1884|isbn=|location=Bombay|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example is the so-called Brahma Muhūrta, which is about one and a half hours before sunrise. This particular time, which is associated with the constellations during the Vernal Equinox, is said to be auspicious for practicing yoga.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also the case of ''samayik'', which is part of the initiation rite for the ''Svetambar'' mendicants or those who pursue a perpetual state of heightened meditative awareness. They take the ''samayik,'' a vow for life taken for short periods, preferably one or two muhūrts, where one muhūrt constitutes forty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jains in the World: Religious Values and Ideology in India|last=Cort|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0195132343|location=Oxford|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yearly Calibration==
The Muhūrtas are traditionally calculated{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} by assuming sunrise at 06:00 AM on the Vernal Equinox, which is the Vedic New Year.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Not all of the constellations cross the zenith, so that it is not in every case clear which constellation presides over the Muhūrta. Yet it is clear that one or more prominent features of the correlate constellations, from which the later Muhūrtas draw their respective names, falls within the Celestial Longitude of the same, drawn from the Polar Axis.

==Significance==
Traditionally, it is common practice amongst [[Hindu]]s to start or avoid starting significant tasks like religious ceremonies, etc. on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta. The [[Vedas|Vedic scriptures]] also generally recommend one or more Muhūrtas to perform rituals and practices. The most widely known example of this practice:

* [[Brahma muhurta|Brahma Muhūrta]], approximately one and a half hours before sunrise or more precisely is 1Hr 36 Mins. i.e. 96 Minutes = 2 Muhūrta or 4 Ghaṭīkā, is recommended in all practices of [[yoga]] is traditionally considered most apt for [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="brahma-muhurta" /&gt; However, it is clear from the associations of the names with specific constellations that the present Brahma-Muhūrta starts just before 6:00AM during the Vernal Equinox. At present, Jīva-Amṛta and Viṣṇu comprise the two twilight muhūrtas prior to sunrise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6561">'''Nets within Nets''' is a modelling method belonging to the family of [[Petri net]]s.
This method is distinguished from other sorts of Petri nets by the possibility to provide their tokens with a proper structure, which is based on Petri net modelling again. Hence, a net can contain further net items, being able to move around and fire themselves.

== Motivation ==

Nets within nets are well suited for the modelling of distributed systems under the particular aspects of
* hierarchy,
* mobility
* encapsulation.

In a lot of publications in relation to [[object-oriented design]]  is  given,  in order to combine the ability of Petri nets in modelling distributed computing with the modelling of objects, being able to be created and to interact.

== History ==

Starting from the need of practical applications, by the mid of nineties, different formalisms have been created, which fit the description of „nets within nets“. Lomazova and Schnoebelen are listing&lt;ref&gt;Irina A. Lomazova, Philippe Schnoebelen: ''Some decidability results for nested Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 1755, 2000, pp. 208-220&lt;/ref&gt;
some of these approaches, namely by Sibertin-Blanc,&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Sibertin-Blanc: ''Cooperative Nets'', Springer LNCS 815, 1994, pp. 471-490&lt;/ref&gt; Lakos,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lakos: ''From coloured Petri nets to object Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 935, 1995, pp. 278-297&lt;/ref&gt; Moldt und Wienberg&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moldt und Frank Wienberg: ''Multi-agent-systems based on coloured Petri nets'', Springer LNCS 1248, 1997, pp. 82-101&lt;/ref&gt;  as extending [[Coloured Petri net]]s,  aside the Object Nets of Valk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Petri nets as token objects'', Springer LNCS 1420, 1998, pp. 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest use of such hierarchic net models appeared by [[Rüdiger Valk]] in Valk and Jessen,&lt;ref&gt;Eike Jessen, [[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Rechensysteme: Grundlagen der Modellbildung'', Springer, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  where the so-called task-flow nets&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Modelling Concurrency by Task/Flow EN Systems''. Proceedings 3rd Workshop on Concurrency and Compositionality, GMD-Studien Nr. 191, Bonn, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  are introduced in order to model task systems in operating systems. In these models tasks are modelled by a Petri net, which represents the precedences of tasks and their state of execution.

== Semantics ==

The most important differences in semantics is given by the execution of net tokens. On the one side net tokens can be [[Reference (programming)|references]]  to net items,&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Kummer: ''Referenznetze'', Dissertation, Universität Hamburg, Logos Verlag Berlin 2002&lt;/ref&gt; which case is called „reference semantics“. This kind of semantic is distinguished from [[value semantics]], where net objects may exist in different places and different internal states. In value semantics different copies can be created to model concurrent execution. The corresponding join of such a split can be defined in different ways, as for instance by „distributed token semantics“&lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler, Heiko Rölke: ''Properties of Object Petri Nets''. Springer LNCS 3099, 2004, pp. 278-297&lt;/ref&gt;   or „history process semantics“.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rüdiger Valk]]: ''Object Petri Nets'', Springer LNCS 3098, 2004, pp. 819-848&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with mobile computing hybrid versions of reference and value semantics are of importance.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt Farwer, Michael Köhler: ''Modelling global and local name spaces for mobile agents using object nets'', Fundamenta Informaticae, Vol. 72, No 1, pp. 109-122, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In distributed token semantics the important calculus of place invariants for Petri nets remains  valid.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler-Bußmeier, Daniel Moldt: ''Analysis of mobile agents using invariants of object nets''. Electronic Communications of the EASST: Special Issue on Formal Modeling of Adaptive and Mobile Processes, 12, 2009. http://www.easst.org/eceasst/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication ==

The formalism of nets within nets would be of few importance without communication between net tokens. Like in [[object-oriented programming]]  communication of net tokens is    introduced via predefined interfaces which are dynamically bound.

[[File:forthandback.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Nested Petri net containing channels via inscriptions]]

In Figure 1 a Petri net is shown containing a token Petri net in place „a“. The token net can move around from place „a“ to place „b“ and back by firing of the transitions of the outer net. The channel inscriptions at the transitions behave like a call of a [[Method (computer programming)|method]], resulting in the synchronised firing of the calling transition in the outer net [e.g. labelled by x:forth()] and the called transition [e.g. labelled by :forth()] in the token net. The variable „x“ at an arrow is bound to the token net in the place connected with this arrow. The brackets may contain parameters to be passed. This example is so simple that reference and value semantics coincide.

== Algorithms and restricted formalisms ==

Standard Petri net properties like [[Petri net|reachability]], [[Petri net|boundedness]] and [[Petri net|liveness]] show a mixed picture. A paper &lt;ref&gt;Michael Köhler-Bußmeier: ''A Survey of Decidability Results for Elementary Object Systems'': Fundamenta Informaticae, Vol.  130, No 1, pp. 99-123, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; of  Köhler-Bußmeier gives a survey on decidability results for elementary object systems.
To reduce the complexity of the formalism subclasses have been defined by restricting the structure of the Petri nets, as for instance to state machines. Such restrictions still allow complex modelling of distributed and mobile systems, but have polynomial complexity in [[model checking]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Heitmann, Michael Köhler-Bußmeier: ''P- and t-systems in the nets-within-nets formalism'': Springer LNCS 7347, 2012, pp. 368-387&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Numeral systems}}
A '''numeral system''' (or '''system of numeration''') is a [[writing system]] for expressing numbers; that is, a [[mathematical notation]] for representing [[number]]s of a given set, using [[Numerical digit|digits]] or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems. For example, "11" represents the number ''three'' in the [[binary numeral system]] (used in [[computer]]s) and the number ''eleven'' in the [[decimal numeral system]] (used in common life).

The number the numeral represents is called its value.

Ideally, a numeral system will:
*Represent a useful set of numbers (e.g. all [[integer]]s, or [[rational number]]s)
*Give every number represented a unique representation (or at least a standard representation)
*Reflect the algebraic and arithmetic structure of the numbers.

For example, the usual [[decimal]] representation of whole numbers gives every nonzero whole number a unique representation as a [[finite set|finite]] [[sequence]] of [[numerical digit|digits]], beginning with a non-zero digit. However, when decimal representation is used for the [[rational number|rational]] or real numbers, such numbers in general have an infinite number of representations, for example 2.31 can also be written as 2.310, 2.3100000, 2.309999999..., etc., all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown.

Numeral systems are sometimes called ''[[number system]]s'', but that name is ambiguous, as it could refer to different systems of numbers, such as the system of [[real number]]s, the system of [[complex number]]s, the system of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], etc. Such systems are, however, not the topic of this article.

==Main numeral systems==
{{main|List of numeral systems}}
The most commonly used system of numerals is the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Eugene Smith |author2=Louis Charles Karpinski |title=The Hindu-Arabic numerals |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wEw6AAAAMAAJ |year=1911 |publisher=Ginn and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Indian mathematicians]] are credited with developing it. [[Aryabhata]] of [[Patna|Kusumapura]] developed the [[place-value notation]] in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century and a century later [[Brahmagupta]] introduced the symbol for [[zero]]. The numeral system and the zero concept, developed by the Hindus in India, slowly spread to other surrounding countries due to their commercial and military activities with India. The Arabs adopted and modified it. Even today, the Arabs call the numerals which they use "Rakam Al-Hind" or the Hindu numeral system. The Arabs translated Hindu texts on numerology and spread them to the western world due to their trade links with them. The Western world modified them and called them the Arabic numerals, as they learned them from the Arabs. Hence the current western numeral system is the modified version of the Hindu numeral system developed in India. It also exhibits a great similarity to the Sanskrit–Devanagari notation, which is still used in India and neighbouring Nepal.

The simplest numeral system is the [[unary numeral system]], in which every [[natural number]] is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by &lt;tt&gt;///////&lt;/tt&gt;. [[Tally marks]] represent one such system still in common use. The unary system is only useful for small numbers, although it plays an important role in [[theoretical computer science]]. [[Elias gamma coding]], which is commonly used in [[data compression]], expresses arbitrary-sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a binary numeral.

The unary notation can be abbreviated by introducing different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, these values are powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, − for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as &lt;tt&gt;+++ ////&lt;/tt&gt; and the number 123 as &lt;tt&gt;+ − − ///&lt;/tt&gt; without any need for zero. This is called [[sign-value notation]]. The ancient [[Egyptian numeral system]] was of this type, and the [[Roman numeral system]] was a modification of this idea.

More useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols; for example, using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations, with A standing for "one occurrence", B "two occurrences", and so on, one could then write C+ D/ for the number 304. This system is used when writing [[Chinese numerals]] and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese. The number system of the [[English language]] is of this type ("three hundred [and] four"), as are those of other spoken [[language]]s, regardless of what written systems they have adopted. However, many languages use mixtures of bases, and other features, for instance 79 in French is ''soixante dix-neuf'' ({{nowrap|60 + 10 + 9}}) and in Welsh is ''pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain'' ({{nowrap|4 + (5 + 10) + (3 × 20)}}) or (somewhat archaic) ''pedwar ugain namyn un'' ({{nowrap|4 × 20 − 1}}). In English, one could say "four score less one", as in the famous [[Gettysburg Address]] representing "87 years ago" as "four score and seven years ago".

More elegant is a ''[[positional notation|positional system]]'', also known as place-value notation. Again working in base&amp;nbsp;10, ten different digits 0,&amp;nbsp;..., 9 are used and the position of a digit is used to signify the power of ten that the digit is to be multiplied with, as in {{nowrap|304 {{=}} 3×100 + 0×10 + 4×1}} or more precisely {{nowrap|3×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 4×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Note that zero, which is not needed in the other systems, is of crucial importance here, in order to be able to "skip" a power. The Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which originated in India and is now used throughout the world, is a positional base&amp;nbsp;10 system.

Arithmetic is much easier in positional systems than in the earlier additive ones; furthermore, additive systems need a large number of different symbols for the different powers of 10; a positional system needs only ten different symbols (assuming that it uses base&amp;nbsp;10).

The positional decimal system is presently universally used in human writing. The base&amp;nbsp;1000 is also used (albeit not universally), by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit. This is the meaning of the common notation 1,000,234,567 used for very large numbers.

In [[computers]], the main numeral systems are based on the positional system in base&amp;nbsp;2 ([[binary numeral system]]), with two [[binary digit]]s, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three ([[octal numeral system]]) or four ([[hexadecimal numeral system]]) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the [[machine word]]) are used, as, for example, in [[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library|GMP]].

The numerals used when writing numbers with digits or symbols can be divided into two types that might be called the [[Arithmetic sequence|arithmetic]] numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the [[Geometric sequence|geometric]] numerals (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ...), respectively. The sign-value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals. A sign-value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition (except for the [[Greek numerals|Ionic system]]), and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses ''both'' arithmetic and geometric numerals.

In certain areas of computer science, a modified base ''k'' positional system is used, called [[bijective numeration]], with digits 1, 2,&amp;nbsp;..., ''k'' ({{nowrap|''k'' ≥ 1}}), and zero being represented by an empty string. This establishes a [[bijection]] between the set of all such digit-strings and the set of non-negative integers, avoiding the non-uniqueness caused by leading zeros. Bijective base-''k'' numeration is also called ''k''-adic notation, not to be confused with [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. Bijective base&amp;nbsp;1 is the same as unary.

==Positional systems in detail==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Cantor set]]--&gt;
{{See also|Positional notation}}
In a positional base ''b'' numeral system (with ''b'' a [[natural number]] greater than 1 known as the [[radix]]), ''b'' basic symbols (or digits) corresponding to the first ''b'' natural numbers including zero are used. To generate the rest of the numerals, the position of the symbol in the figure is used. The symbol in the last position has its own value, and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by ''b''.

For example, in the [[decimal]] system (base 10), the numeral 4327 means {{math|('''4'''×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + ('''3'''×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + ('''2'''×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + ('''7'''×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, noting that {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}.

In general, if ''b'' is the base, one writes a number in the numeral system of base ''b'' by expressing it in the form {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} and writing the enumerated digits {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in descending order. The digits are natural numbers between 0 and {{math|''b'' − 1}}, inclusive.

If a text (such as this one) discusses multiple bases, and if ambiguity exists, the base (itself represented in base&amp;nbsp;10) is added in subscript to the right of the number, like this: number&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt;. Unless specified by context, numbers without subscript are considered to be decimal.

By using a dot to divide the digits into two groups, one can also write fractions in the positional system. For example, the base&amp;nbsp;2 numeral 10.11 denotes {{math|1×2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 0×2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 1×2&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1×2&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 2.75}}.

In general, numbers in the base ''b'' system are of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;
(a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_1a_0.c_1 c_2 c_3\cdots)_b =
\sum_{k=0}^n a_kb^k + \sum_{k=1}^\infty c_kb^{-k}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The numbers ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are the [[weight function|weights]] of the corresponding digits. The position ''k'' is the [[logarithm]] of the corresponding weight ''w'', that is &lt;math&gt;k = \log_{b} w = \log_{b} b^k&lt;/math&gt;. The highest used position is close to the [[order of magnitude]] of the number.

The number of [[tally marks]] required in the [[unary numeral system]] for ''describing the weight'' would have been '''w'''. In the positional system, the number of digits required to describe it is only &lt;math&gt;k + 1 = \log_{b} w + 1&lt;/math&gt;, for ''k'' ≥ 0. For example, to describe the weight 1000 then four digits are needed because &lt;math&gt;\log_{10} 1000 + 1 = 3 + 1&lt;/math&gt;. The number of digits required to ''describe the position'' is &lt;math&gt;\log_b k + 1 = \log_b \log_b w + 1&lt;/math&gt; (in positions 1, 10, 100,... only for simplicity in the decimal example).

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l|rrrrrrr}
\text{Position}
&amp; 3
&amp; 2
&amp; 1
&amp; 0
&amp; -1
&amp; -2
&amp; \cdots

\\
\text{Decimal example digit}
&amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that a number has a terminating or repeating expansion [[if and only if]] it is [[rational number|rational]]; this does not depend on the base. A number that terminates in one base may repeat in another (thus {{math|0.3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.0100110011001...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}). An irrational number stays aperiodic (with an infinite number of non-repeating digits) in all integral bases. Thus, for example in base&amp;nbsp;2, {{math|[[pi|π]] {{=}} 3.1415926...&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be written as the aperiodic 11.001001000011111...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Putting [[overline|overscores]], {{overline|''n''}}, or dots, ''ṅ'', above the common digits is a convention used to represent repeating rational expansions. Thus:
:14/11 = 1.272727272727... = 1.{{overline|27}} &amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; 321.3217878787878... = 321.321{{Overline|78}}.

If ''b'' = ''p'' is a [[prime number]], one can define base-''p'' numerals whose expansion to the left never stops; these are called the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]].

==Generalized variable-length integers==
More general is using a [[mixed radix]] notation (here written [[Endianness|little-endian]]) like &lt;math&gt;a_0 a_1 a_2&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_1 b_2&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

This is used in [[punycode]], one aspect of which is the representation of a sequence of non-negative integers of arbitrary size in the form of a sequence without delimiters, of "digits" from a collection of 36: a–z and 0–9, representing 0–25 and 26–35 respectively. A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b (i.e. 1) then a (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b–9 (1–35), therefore the weight ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 35 instead of 36. Suppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are c (2), then the third digit has a weight 34 × 35 = 1190 and we have the following sequence:

a (0), ba (1), ca (2), .., 9a (35), bb (36), cb (37), .., 9b (70), bca (71), .., 99a (1260), bcb (1261), etc.

Unlike a regular based numeral system, there are numbers like 9b where 9 and b each represents 35; yet the representation is unique because ac and aca are not allowed – the a would terminate the number.

The flexibility in choosing threshold values allows optimization depending on the frequency of occurrence of numbers of various sizes.

The case with all threshold values equal to 1 corresponds to [[bijective numeration]], where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non-zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8686">'''Obsessive relational intrusion''' (ORI) occurs when someone knowingly and repeatedly invades another person's privacy boundaries by using intrusive tactics to try to get closer to that person. It includes behaviors such as repeated calls and texts, malicious contact, spreading rumors, stalking, and violence (kidnapping and assault).

Drs. Brian Spitzberg and William Cupach, the creators of the term, define ORI as "repeated and unwanted pursuit and invasion of one's sense of physical or symbolic privacy by another person, either stranger or acquaintance, who desires and/or presumes an intimate relationship".&lt;ref name=Spitzberg&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dark Side of Close Relationships|year=1998|publisher=Lawrence Erlbraum Assoc|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-4450-3|pages=233–264|author=Spitzberg, Brian|edition=3rd|author2=Cupach, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims of ORI have no preexisting relationship with or interest in their pursuers; others know their pursuers, but are less interested in making an existing relationship more intimate.&lt;ref name=Close&gt;{{cite book|title=Close Encounters-Communication in Relationships|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-4522-1710-9|pages=288–291|author=Guerrero, Laura |author2=Andersen, Peter |author3=Walid, Afifi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

There are several key components of ORI that distinguish it from other similar relational patterns.

First, ORI involves a lack of mutual agreement regarding the nature or even the existence of a relationship. While the person obsessed with the relationship is attempting to make a closer connection, the object of ORI desires freedom from continued forced contact. Spitzberg writes that "this dialectical tension is endemic to the formation and ongoing construction of all interpersonal relationships".&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt;

Second, ORI is not associated with a singular event, but is repeated. Spitzberg and Cupach write, "Obsessiveness is reflected in the fact that the intruder is fixated on the target of attention; the intruder's thoughts and behaviors are persistent, preoccupying, and often morbid.  Pursuit is persistent despite the absence of reciprocity by the obsessional object and despite resistance by the object."&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt; The episodes of unwanted behavior tend to escalate over time, with the seriousness rising and the time between incidents shortening.&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt;

Third, the intrusion can be symbolic and psychological, not just physical.  The invasion of privacy as well as the imposition on the victim's feelings of freedom of choice are important aspects of ORI.&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt;

==Behaviors==

Studies have been done to explore certain factors that predispose individuals to ORI.  Some have found [[narcissism]] and low empathy as predictors for ORI, and hypothesized that people with high empathy would be more inclined to judge ORI behaviors as unacceptable.  But this pattern has been found inconclusive; one study found that empathy may not inhibit ORI, although there is a substantial positive relationship between narcissism and the acceptability of ORI.&lt;ref name=Narcissism&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asada|first=Kelly |author2=Eunsoon Lee |author3=Levine Timothy |author4=Ferrara, Merissa |title=Narcissism and Empathy as Predictors of Obsessive Relational Intrusion|journal=Communication Research Reports|year=204|volume=21|issue=4|pages=379–390|doi=10.1080/08824090409360002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many victims of ORI have also experienced sexual coercion, and the coping responses used for both tend to be similar.  Additionally, the more serious the intrusion (for example, violence), the more formal the coping response (for example, calling the police).&lt;ref name=Last&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spitzberg|first=Brian|title=Obsessive Relational Intrusion, Coping, and Sexual Coercion Victimization|journal=Communication Reports|year=2001|volume=14|issue=1|pages=19–31|doi=10.1080/08934210109367733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ORI behavior, as well as non-ORI sexually coercive behavior, can involve types of coercion identified as deception coercion, mild force coercion, psychological coercion and severe force coercion.&lt;ref name=Last /&gt;

==Stalking==

[[Stalking]], a severe form of ORI, is typically defined as "the willful, malicious, and repeated following and harassing of another persons that threatens his or her safety".&lt;ref name=Spitzberg /&gt;

===Connection between ORI and stalking===

Spitzberg and Cupach state more research is needed to correctly capture the connection, but ORI and stalking are pervasive and impactful occurrences.  A clearer picture is needed to better understand the incidence, prevalence and consequences of ORI and stalking.  Better understanding will provide improvements in prevention, intervention and treatment of offenders and victims.&lt;ref name=Stalking3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sptizberg|first=Brian|author2=Nicastro, Alana|title=Exploring the Interactional Phenomenon of Stalking and Obsessive Relational Intrustion|journal=Communication Reports|year=1998|volume=11|series=|issue=1|pages=33–47|doi=10.1080/08934219809367683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==

The authors Brian Spitzberg and William Cupach developed ORI in 1998, and published their research in their book ''The Dark Side of Close Relationships.''

==Social theory use of ORI==

===Relational Goal Pursuit Theory===

According to the Relational Goal Pursuit Theory (RGPT),&lt;ref name="Relationship Pursuit"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dark Side of Relationship Pursuit: From Attraction to Obsession to Stalking|year=2008|publisher=Lawrence Eflbaum|location=New Jersey|pages=5–102|author=Spitzberg, Brian|author2=Cupach, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; people expend energy to develop or reinitiate relationships to the extent that they perceive a relationship desirable and attainable.  It becomes all about achieving the goal of a relationship.  ORI occurs when people continue to believe that a relationship is attainable even though it is not.   The pursuer begins to escalate when they meet challenges to their goal.  
RGPT identifies processes that conspire to transform otherwise normal relationships into ORI and stalking.   All relationships begin with a goal to pursuit.  The following are some rules:

# Obsessive pursuers link the relationship to higher order goals, such as happiness and self-worth
# This linking results in exaggerated positive attitudes regarding the success of the relational goal
# There is an exaggerated positive attitude regarding the success of the relational goal
# Linking also produces exaggerated negative attitudes towards failure of the relational goal
# This failure produces heightened negative emotions
# The linking renders goal abandonment as unlikely
# These exaggerated attitudes reinforce the importance of the relational goal
# The strength of the attitudes can predict persistence

==Other reasons for ORI use==

Cultural scripts – if people play hard to get enough, eventually win the affection of person trying to love – usually work against the realization that the relationship is unattainable.&lt;ref name=Close /&gt;

Ambiguous [[communication]] – initiation, reinitiating and rejection of relationships may keep hope alive. Using indirect signals to reject people because they are worried about hurting their feelings, pursuers usually interpret this incorrectly.&lt;ref name=Close /&gt;

[[rumination (psychology)|Rumination]] – when people can’t obtain a goal, they tend to fixate on the problem and pursuers redouble their efforts.&lt;ref name=Close /&gt;

Shift in motivation – when pursuer moves from desire to revenge from a feeling of being humiliated.  This shift usually marks the beginning of more aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name=Close /&gt;

==ORI and Facebook==

With the increase of [[Facebook]] and other social media tools designed to make us more accessible to others while taking away pieces of our privacy, ORI has become easier in an online world.  There is relational intrusion from both offenders and targets in five different categories:&lt;ref name=facebook&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaulk|first=Kasey|author2=Jones, Tim|title=Online Obsessive Relational Intrusion: Further Concerns About Facebook|journal=Springer Science and Business Media|year=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=245–254|doi=10.1007/s10896-011-9360-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Primary contact attempts
# Secondary contact attempts
# Monitoring or surveillance
# Expressions
# Invitations

Online social media helps to facilitate behaviors indicative of ORI and these behaviors have consequences for users on their privacy and security.

The native inhabitants of the Central Highlands are the [[Degar]] (Montagnard) peoples. The Vietnamese conquered the Central Highlands during their "march to the south" ([[Nam tiến]]). Ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese (Kinh) people]] now outnumber the indigenous Degars (considered derogatory term) after state-sponsored colonization directed by both the government of [[South Vietnam]] and the current Communist government of unified [[Vietnam]]. The Montagnards have engaged in conflicts with the Vietnamese, from the anti-Communist South Vietnamese government, the [[Viet Cong]], to the Communist government of unified Vietnam{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. There are contrasting views on this issue, as the constitution of the government of [[Vietnam]] states "Article 36 of the Constitution, the state invests heavily in education and supports various preferential programmes for ethnic minorities, like ethnic minority boarding schools, lower entry requirements and quota for minorities."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137455536_12|title=Language, Education and Nation-building|last=Le Ha|first=Phan|last2=Ha|first2=Vu Hai|last3=Dat|first3=Bao|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349546336|location=London|pages=232–244|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137455536_12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="refworld.org"&gt;http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3c6a48474.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Both the initial 1945 constitute and the revised 1992 constitution of [[North Vietnam]] and the successor state [[Vietnam|the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] stated that all minority groups in Vietnam have the right to maintain their mother tongues in their schooling as well as to use their languages to preserve their ethnic cultures and values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Background==

The Champa state and Chams in the lowlands til 1471 were traditional suzerains whom the Montagnards in the highlands acknowledged as their lords, while autonomy was held by the Montagnards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=35–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II concept of "Nam tiến" and the southward conquest was celebrated by Vietnamese scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Zottoli|first= Brian A.|date=2011  |title=Conceptualizing Southern Vietnamese History from the 15th to 18th Centuries:  Competition along the Coasts from Guangdong to Cambodia  |type=A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (History) in The University of Michigan |chapter= |publisher= |docket= |oclc= |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/89821/bria?sequence=1 |page=5 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois was the name of the Central Highlands from 1946 under French Indochina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=155–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until French rule, the Central Highlands was alleged by one American source as almost never entered by the Vietnamese since they viewed it as a savage (Moi-Montaganrd) populated area with fierce animals like tigers, "poisoned water" and "evil malevolent spirits", but the Vietnamese expressed interest in the land after the French transformed it into a profitable plantation area to grow crops on,&lt;ref name="M.D.2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

In 1955, Northern Vietnamese migrants were settled in the Central Highlands after the autonomous Montagnard area was abolished by [[Ngô Đình Diệm]]. [[Y Bham Enuol]] founded [[Bajaraka]] on January 5, 1958 to resist the discrimination, Vietnamese settlement on Highlands and forced assimilation by the South Vietnamese government. The United Nations Secretary-General and foreign embassies were contacted by Y Bham Enuol. "Front for the Liberation of the Highlands of Champa" (Mặt Trận Giải Phóng Cao Nguyên Champa) and Bajaraka were both headed by Y Bham Enuol. He was killed by the [[Khmer Rouge]] on April 20, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.champaka.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=768:kyniem&amp;catid=80:2012&amp;Itemid=92|title=Kỷ niệm 38 năm từ trần của Y Bham Enuol, lãnh tụ phong trào Fulro|author=Written by Ja Karo, độc giả trong nước|date=18 April 2013|website=Champaka.info|publisher=Champaka.info|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support of Central Highlands tribe was seen as essential to Hanoi's war strategy, and various tribes had supported the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]], with a Christian [[Rade people]] Y Bih Aleo serving as the vice-President of the NLF.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1EjDgAAQBAJ&amp;|title=Viet Nam: A History from Earliest Times to the Present|last=Kiernan|first=Ben|date=2017-02-17|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780190627294|location=|pages=411–419|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Montagnard agents had assisted PAVN attacks against U.S Special Forces camps and personnel within the region, and their antagonism with the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] caused them to not warn them of attacks during the 1975 campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Les Kosem]], Y Bham Enuol and Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] worked together to found [[FULRO]] and launch an uprising against the South Vietnamese government to regain their land from the Vietnamese colonizers. Since 1964 the Montagnards of FULRO struggled for their own country and continued to fight against the Vietnamese Communist regime which persecuted them for their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thayer  |first=Nate|date=25 September 1992|title=Lighting the darkness: FULRO's jungle Christians|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/lighting-darkness-fulros-jungle-christians|newspaper=The Phnom Penh Post|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After mass jailings and killings during the 2001 and 2004 protests by ethnic hill tribe minorities against the Vietnamese regime, foreigners were banned from the Central Highlands for a period of time by Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bray|first=Adam|date=June 16, 2014|title=The Cham: Descendants of Ancient Rulers of South China Sea Watch Maritime Dispute From Sidelines|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-south-china-sea-vietnam-china-cambodia-champa/|journal=National Geographic News|publisher=National Geographic|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi= |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/169-the-cham-descendants-of-ancient-rulers-of-south-china-sea-watch-maritime-dispute-from-sidelines|title=The Cham: Descendants of Ancient Rulers of South China Sea Watch Maritime Dispute From Sidelines|last1=Bray|first1=Adam|date= |website= IOC-Champa|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101606/http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/169-the-cham-descendants-of-ancient-rulers-of-south-china-sea-watch-maritime-dispute-from-sidelines|archivedate=26 June 2015|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forced Colonization of the Central Highlands during the Indochina War(s)==
{{Cleanup|reason=Need to verify claims, needs to additionally better describe section. Montagnards are not one group, neither is this word used as anything but a derogatory term.|date=June 2018}}

The Montagnard inhabited Central Highlands became open to the Vietnamese only under French rule{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The word savage (moi) was used by the Vietnamese against the Montagnard Degars. Both the South Vietnamese and the united Communist Vietnam government were fought against by the FULRO Degar fighters for the sake of the Central Highlands and Montagnard people under the direction of Y-Bham Enuol{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The Montagnards in FULRO fought the Vietnamese for twenty years after the end of the Vietnam War and the scale of Vietnamese attacks on the Montagnards are alleged by one US author as having killed over 200,000 Montagnards after 1975 during the war between FULRO and Vietnam in the Central Highlands, as the Vietnamese lease land for Japanese companies to harvest lumber in the area. Munitions, weapons, and 5,000 rifles were given by the Chinese to some Montagnard groups after some Montagnards requested help from China via Thai General Savit-Yun K-Yut since the United States refused to help the FULRO Montagnards against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="Dooley2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Dooley|title=Battle for the Central Highlands: A Special Forces Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAKbllE5bioC&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=18 December 2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-41463-2|pages=255–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures have not been validated by independent sources or third parties, however. Degar courts were abolished by South Vietnam and the Central Highlands became flooded with Vietnamese colonizers under the direction of South Vietnam{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Torture and mass arrests by the Vietnamese military were used in the Central Highlands against the Degar during the February 2001 protests against Vietnamese oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/members/7898 |title=Degar-Montagnards |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=March 25, 2008 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese, the Central Highlands Montagnards, Cham, and Delta Cambodians (Khmer Krom) were all alienated by the South Vietnamese government under Diem. The Montagnard Highlands were subjected to colonization by ethnic Vietnamese under Diem.

The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia)  and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien, while the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own native culture without adopting external culture and were the true indigenous natives of the region, and to hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term ''Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois'' PMSI emerged for the Central Highlands along with the natives being addressed by the name Montagnard.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003 1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=moi+savages+vietnamese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MxRYU8TjBsmcyATZpIDQBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=moi%20savages%20vietnamese&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent demonstrations with fatalities have broken out due to Montagnard anger at Vietnamese discrimination and seizure of their land since many Vietnamese Kinh were settled by the government in the Central Highlands.&lt;ref name="SullivanSullivan2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Sullivan|author2=James Sullivan|title=Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WLfsdeJgHsC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=moi+savages+vietnamese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MxRYU8TjBsmcyATZpIDQBg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6wEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=moi%20savages%20vietnamese&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=National Geographic Society|isbn=978-0-7922-6203-9|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Sullivan|title=National Geographic Traveler Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8cRgWpCXUoC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=moi+savages+vietnamese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MxRYU8TjBsmcyATZpIDQBg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=moi%20savages%20vietnamese&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=National Geographic|isbn=978-1-4262-0522-4|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Vietnamese and Communist Vietnamese colonization of the Central Highlands has been compared to the historic Nam tiến of previous Vietnamese rulers. During the Nam tiến (March to the South) Khmer and Cham territory was seized and militarily colonized ([[Tuntian|đồn điền]]) by the Vietnamese which was repeated by the state-sponsored colonization of Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees on Montagnard land by the South Vietnamese leader Diem and the introduction to the Central Highlands of "New Economic Zones" by the now Communist Vietnamese government.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003" /&gt; The thousand year violent war the Vietnamese in the lowlands had with the Montagnards in the mountains was a long-established custom and the Vietnamese used the derogatory word "Moi" (savages) to address the Montagnards, the South Vietnamese government was strongly against the autonomous Montagnard CIDG (Civilian Irregular Defense Groups) who were fighting against the Vietcong because they feared that the Montagnards would gain independence so the South Vietnamese and Montagnards violently clashed against each other{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

A colonization program of Kinh Vietnamese by the South Vietnamese government and united Vietnamese Communist government was implemented{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Leaving out any plans for autonomy for ethnic minorities, an assimilation plan was launched by the South Vietnamese government with the creation of the "Social and Economic Council for the Southern Highlander Country", the South Vietnamese based their approach to the highlanders by claiming that they would be "developed" since they were "poor" and "ignorant", making swidden agriculturalists sedentarize and settling ethnic Vietnamese colonists from the coastal regions into the highlands such as Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees who fled to South Vietnam, 50,000 Vietnamese settlers were in the highlands in 1960 and in 1963 the total number of settlers was 200,000 and up to 1974 the South Vietnamese were still implemented the colonization plan even though the highland natives experienced massive turbulence and disorder because of the colonization, and by 1971 less than half of a scheme back by the Americans to leave Montagnards with just 20% of the Central Highlands was completed, and even in the parts of the highlands which did not experience colonization, the South Vietnamese threw the native tribes into "strategic hamelets" to keep them away from places where communists potentially operated and the South Vietnamese consistently spurned any attempts too make overtures to the native Highlanders.&lt;ref name="Duncan2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher R.

===2001 mass protests===

After the Vietnamese government arrested Montagnards a demonstration was started in Chu Prong county by the Montagnards in the Central Highlands consisting of around 500 people in February 2001. Vietnam accused them of plotting for autonomy and accused them of trying to stir up ethnic animosity, and launched an anti-Highlander military operation. The traditional lands of the Central Highland had been taken by the Vietnamese and the Central Highland demonstrators had asked for it back. The Vietnamese government refused to return the lands and instead attacked the demonstrators, arresting hundreds and assaulting and pummeling the demonstrators{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The Vietnamese military took charge of the Central Highlands, severing telephone lines and keeping heavy watch over travel within the area. The Bahnar, Rhade, and Raglai participated in the mass demonstrations against the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. They carried no weapons while they started their mass protests. The natives regard the puppet leaders placed in their communities by the Vietnamese Communist government as collaborators who help persecute the natives for the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The tribal customs of the highlanders are ignored by the Vietnamese government which shows no regard for the traditional leaders of the Highlanders. The natives of the Central Highlands are mired in poverty and the Vietnamese are richer than them and are subjected to starvation. The Vietnamese government seized the land of the natives in the Central Highlands for Vietnamese settlers and coffee companies. They severely limited the amount of land farmed by the Highlanders and drove them away. Vietnamese colonizers also directly seize land from the natives in addition to the coffee companies{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.  The policies of the Vietnamese government impede the natives while helping the Vietnamese colonizers. The lumber and coffee companies are assisted by the Vietnamese government. Vietnamese government workers embezzle and steal aid meant for the Central Highlanders. After these provocations, when Buon xer village was seized by Vietnamese colonizers, they were attacked by the Rhade when the straw finally broke the camel's back on August 8, 2000. The massive amount of Vietnamese colonizers and land theft was the impetus for the mass 2001 demonstrations against the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

The jailed Montagnards had been subjected to torture by the Vietnamese government which caused the mass protests. There were 30 police officers wounded in Buon Ma Thuot in Daklak and Pleiku.

Because of his desire to promote trade with Vietnam, John Kerry rejected showing any concern for Montagnard rights and voted against the 2001 Vietnam Human Rights Act in the Senate. Kerry said that "communism" was what the people wanted in Vietnam. The current 750,000 Montagnard have been halved from their original 1975 number of 1,500,000 while there was a three times growth in the Vietnamese population while killings, torture, and seizure of land from the Montagnards has taken place. Mass graves were created to be filled with the corpses of the Montagnards as kids, women and men were assaulted by Vietnamese security forces. Laotian Communists are effectively a satellite of the Vietnamese with Laos containing Vietnamese soldier garrisons and the Laotians are seen as primitive by the Vietnamese. The Cambodian government is seen as a satellite government under Vietnam's control with a garrison of Vietnamese soldiers stationed there as Vietnamese use their historic military settlement method of Don Dien on Cambodia and Laos.

As a means of intimidation, the Vietnamese gather hundreds of spectators to watch trials of arrested Montaganrds and force public repudiation of religious belief upon the Montagnards. the Vietnamese accuse Montagnards of being "reactionary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/03/30/vietnam-montagnards-harshly-persecuted|title=Vietnam: Montagnards Harshly Persecuted  Forced Renunciation of Faith, Harassment, Violence, and Arrests|date=March 30, 2011|website=Human Rights Watch|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/03/30/vietnam-montagnards-harshly-persecuted Vietnam: Montagnards Harshly Persecuted | Human Rights Watch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Degar religious rights and autonomy are not allowed by the Vietnamese Communists. A Montagnard family was attacked with machetes by ordinary Vietnamese citizens.

Religious freedom is officially allowed in article 70 of the constitution of Vietnam, but the Vietnamese government ignores this and kill, jails, and abuses Degars because of their religion after 1975 when the Central Highlands was occupied by North Vietnamese.

The Degars experienced hardship, tribulation and adversity during the Indochina Wars and have continued to suffer from Vietnamese oppression while the beneficiaries have been the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese has sterilized Degar women, and murdered and jailed Degar men to wipe out the Degars for the purpose of seizing their land and the Vietnamese despise the Degar way of life due to ethnic hatred by the Vietnamese against the Degar which led to ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degarfoundation.org/kok-ksors-statement-to-cerd-80th-session/HRUE-DƯM...21-02-2012/MRO=718|archiveurl=http://www.degarfoundation.org/kok-ksors-statement-to-cerd-80th-session/HRUE-D%C6%AFM...21-02-2012/MRO=718|title=Kok Ksor's Statement to CERD 80th Session|author=Mr. Kok Ksor|date=21 February 2012|website=DEGAR FOUNDATION, INC.|publisher=|access-date=|archivedate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese police assaulted and brutalized the Montagnard Foundation President Kok Ksor's mother, Ksor H'Ble, especially following the Degar February 2001 demonstrations over land and religion and the April 2004 demonstrations. The Vietnamese police bullied and assaulted her for years. She died on 18 August 2011.

Degars were violently assaulted and brutalized by racist ordinary Vietnamese citizens on 27 September 2007. Degars were targeted for murder by Vietnamese citizens on 5 October 2007. In the Central Highlands there is severe ethnic bigotry towards the native Degars by the Vietnamese.

Ethnic minority lands are subjected to settlement and colonization by ethnic Vietnamese Kinh supported by the Vietnamese government, as the native populations are driven out and their lands stolen in addition to their bad economic situation. Violence and jail sentences are used against ethnic minorities like Khmer Krom and the most racism is perpetrated against the Hmong and Montagnards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=|date=20 February 2012 |title=Vietnam religious minorities face persecution says activist|url=http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/vietnam-religious-minorities-face-persecution-says-activist_209627.html|newspaper=Expatica|location=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/Vietnam-religious-minorities-face-persecution-says-activist_320583.html Vietnam religious minorities face persecution says activist | News | Expatica Switzerland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Demanding that the Vietnamese regime stop repressing ethnic minorities and religion, the "Coalition for Indigenous Peoples in Vietnam" was formed out of the Thai, Khmer Krom, and Montagnards after they combined forces against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degar-Montagnards: Vietnamese Minority Groups Unite|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/14284|author=Voice of America |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=May 15, 2012 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Voice of America |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese brutally suppressed, imprisoned and tortured Montagnards after the Montagnards asked for their lands back during protests in Gia Lai province in 2012 so 85 of the Montagnards were forced to escape from the Vietnamese by going to Rattanakiri province in Cambodia. The religion and ethnicity of the Montagnards is distinct from the Vietnamese. Prospect of a new insurgency by Montagnards for independence were shot down by the Hun Sen regime in Cambodia which refused to aid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/15157 |title=Degar-Montagnards: Refugees In Cambodia’s Jungles |author=Voice of America|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 20, 2012 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Voice of America |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trouble and chaos in the Central Highlands after the Vietnamese abused and jailed Montagnard leader Y'Soai Eban he managed to run away from Vietnamese custody. The Montagnards were subjected to genocide after the Vietnam War in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/15451 |title=Degar-Montagnards: Father Reunited With His Family After 6 Years |author=Wral.com|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=February 4, 2013 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Wral.com |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence from the Communist authorities was desired by the Montagnards after the Vietnam War since they were killed, abused, discriminated against and jailed by the Vietnamese authorities so many of them were forced to run away from the Central Highlands as refugees. Cambodia and eventually the United States were their destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/16663 |title=Degar-Montagnards: 11 Christian Vietnamese And Cambodian Refugees Ordained |author=Biblical Recorder|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=December 4, 2013 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Biblical Recorder |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death, torture, and incarceration were the punishments inflicted on Montagnards gathering in groups of three or more by the Vietnamese with their religion severely persecuted and repressed at the hands of the Vietnamese Communist regime since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/9642|title=Montagnard: Government Destroys First Christian Degar Church|author=Montagnard Foundation|date=May 28, 2009|website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Montagnard Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States State Department showed little concern at the plight of the Montagnards at the hands of the Vietnamese. A thirteen-year-old Montagnard girl Y Kang was severely assaulted, beaten and kicked along with 16 Montagnard women and men by Vietnamese police in Gai Lai province, Plei Ku city, district Mang Yang, commune H'ra in Buon Kret Krot village on July 7, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degar Montagnard: Beaten for Worshiping in Church.|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/13058|author=Charisma Magazine|date=August 19, 2011|website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO|publisher=Charisma Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam has jailed hundreds of Montagnards in addition to murdering, abusing, and discriminating against their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/11735|title=Degar Montagnard: Foundation Announces Establishment Of "Sang Ae Die Degar" Christian Church In Vietnam|author=Montagnard Foundation|date=October 1, 2010|website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO|publisher=Montagnard Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death was a possible consequence of getting caught with a Bible. The Vietnamese regime claims that Montagnard separatism is conducted by religious matters and uses this as a reason to attack their religion. Montagnard land was seized by the Vietnamese government after the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1492-i-dont-know-my-age-5-things-i-learned-in-my-isolated-tribe.html|title=I Don't Know My Age: 5 Things I Learned in My Isolated Tribe|last1=Evans|first1=Robert|last2=Enuol|first2=Rich|date= November 16, 2014|website=Cracked.com|publisher=Cracked.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gia Lai province, Chu Prong district in 2010 Montagnards were assaulted and detained by the Vietnamese.

In many cases a button may appear to do nothing but in fact causes behavior that is not immediately apparent; this can give the appearance of it being a placebo button.

In the United Kingdom and [[Hong Kong]], pedestrian push-buttons on crossings using the [[Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique]] may or may not have any real effect on crossing timings, depending on their location and the time of day, and some junctions may be completely automated, with push-buttons which do not have any effect at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23869955|title=Does pressing the pedestrian crossing button actually do anything?|author=Tom de Castella|publisher=BBC News|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other areas the buttons have an effect only during the night.&lt;ref name="bbcfuture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150415-the-buttons-that-do-nothing|title=Press me!

These buttons were subsequently removed when the stock was refurbished.

== Office thermostats ==

It has been reported that the temperature set point adjustment on [[thermostat]]s in many office buildings in the United States is non-functional, installed to give tenants' employees a similar illusion of control.  In some cases they act as input devices to a central control computer but in others they serve no purpose other than to keep employees contented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A common implementation in buildings with an [[Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning|HVAC]] central control computer is to allow the thermostats to provide a graded level of control. Temperatures in such a system are governed by the central controller's settings, which are typically set by the building maintenance staff or HVAC engineers. The individual thermostats in various offices provide the controller with a temperature reading of the zone (provided the thermocouples are not installed as inline duct sensors), but also serve as modifiers for the central controller's set point. While the thermostat may include settings from, for example, {{convert|60|to|90|F|C|disp=flip}}, the actual effect of the thermostat is to apply "pressure" to the central controller's set point. Thus, if the controller's setting is {{convert|72|F|C|disp=flip}}, setting the thermostat to its maximum warm or cool settings will deflect the output temperature, generally by only a few degrees Fahrenheit (about two degrees Celsius) at most. So, although the thermostat can be set to its lowest marking of {{convert|60|F|C|disp=flip}}, in reality, it may change the HVAC system's output temperature only to {{convert|70|F|C|disp=flip}}. In this case, the thermostat has a "swing" of 2&amp;nbsp;°C (4&amp;nbsp;°F) — it can alter the produced temperature from the main controller's set point by a maximum of 1&amp;nbsp;°C (2&amp;nbsp;°F) in either direction. Consequently, while not purely a placebo, the thermostat in this setup does not provide the level of control that is expected, but the combination of the lower setting number and the feeling of a slight change in temperature can induce the office occupants to believe that the temperature was significantly decreased.

Placebo thermostats work on two psychological principles, which are classical conditioning and the placebo effect. First, placebo thermostats work in accordance with classical conditioning. Classical conditioning was first discovered by [[Ivan Pavlov]] and is a type of learning which pairs a stimulus with a physiological response. Applied to placebo thermostats, this is when the employee adjusts the thermostat and hears the noise of hissing or a fan running and consequently physically feels more content. This is due to the countless trials involving the thermostat in their own home, which actually works. The employee has paired the sound of hissing or a fan running to being more physically content due to the actual temperature change and therefore when they experience the noise at work they feel the same way even though there is no change in temperature. As long as individuals get the result they are looking for (noise associated with temperature change) they will continue with the practice (changing the placebo thermostat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McRaney|first=David|title=Placebo Buttons|url=http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/02/10/placebo-buttons/|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, placebo thermostats work due to the placebo effect. The placebo effect works on the basis that individuals will experience what they believe they will experience. This is attributed to [[Expectancy theory]], which states that the placebo effect is mediated by overt expectancies.&lt;ref name="Stewart-Williams 2004 324–340"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart-Williams|first=Steve|author2=John Podd |title=The Placebo Effect: Dissolving the Expectancy Versus Conditioning Debate|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2004|volume=130|issue=2|pages=324–340|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.2.324|pmid=14979775}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common example is in medical testing: inactive sugar pills are given to patients who are told they are actually medicine. Some patients will experience relief from symptoms regardless. According to expectancy theory, if people believe they are going to experience a temperature change after changing a placebo thermostat they may psychologically experience one without an actual change happening.&lt;ref name="Stewart-Williams 2004 324–340"/&gt; Both psychological concepts of classical conditioning and the placebo effect may play a role in the effectiveness of placebo thermostats.

[[Mutilation]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] was a common method of [[punishment]] for [[criminals]] of the era but it also had a role in the empire's political life.&lt;ref name= "Rautman p. 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Rautman|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some disfigurements practised bore a secondary practical rationale as well. By [[Blinding (punishment)|blinding]] a rival, one would not only restrict their mobility but make it almost impossible for them to lead an army into battle, then an important part of taking control of the empire. [[Castration]] was also used to eliminate potential opponents. In the Byzantine Empire, for a man to be castrated meant that he was no longer a man—half-dead, "life that was half death".&lt;ref name= "Ringrose p. 62"&gt;{{harvnb|Ringrose|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castration also eliminated any chance of heirs being born to threaten either the emperor or the emperor's children's place at the throne.  Other mutilations were the severing of the nose ([[rhinotomy]]) or the amputating of limbs.

==Rationale==
The mutilation of political rivals by the [[emperor]] was deemed an effective way of side-lining from the line of succession a person who was seen as a threat. Castrated men were not seen as a threat, as no matter how much power they gained they could never take the throne, and numerous eunuchs were entrusted with high and confidential offices in the Byzantine court and administration. In Byzantine culture, the emperor was a [[Divine right of kings|reflection of heavenly authority]]. Since [[God]] was perfect, the emperor also had to be unblemished; any mutilation, especially facial wounds, would disqualify an individual from taking the throne.&lt;ref name= "Longworth p. 321"&gt;{{harvnb|Longworth|1997|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception was [[Justinian II]]  (ὁ Ῥινότμητος, "the slit-nosed"), who [[Rhinotomy|had his nose cut off]] (Greek - ''rhinokopia'') when he was overthrown in 695 but was able to become emperor again, in 705.&lt;ref name= "Ostrogorski p. 124"&gt;{{harvnb|Ostrogorski|1957|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Blinding as a punishment for political rivals and a recognized penalty for treachery was established in 705, although Emperor [[Phocas]] used it earlier during his rule as well, becoming common practice from [[Heraclius]] onwards.&lt;ref name= "Kazhdan p. 297"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castration as a punishment for political rivals did not come into use until much later, becoming popular in the 10th and 11th centuries. An example is that of [[Basil Lekapenos]], the illegitimate son of Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]], who was castrated when young. He gained enough power to become ''[[parakoimomenos]]'' and effective prime minister for three successive emperors, but could not assume the throne himself.&lt;ref name= "Norwich p. 167"&gt;{{harvnb|Norwich|1993|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Talbot-Sullivan p. 143"&gt;{{harvnb|Talbot|Sullivan|2005|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last to use this method voluntarily was [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], although some of his successors were forced to use it again by the Ottoman Sultans.

states that more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Jon E. Roeckelein (1998), ''Dictionary of Theories, Laws, and Concepts in Psychology,'' Greenwood, {{ISBN|0-313-30460-2}} p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Sexual deviance: issues and controversies |author1=Tony Ward |author2=D.

==Origin and description of the principle==

The Premack principle was derived from a study of [[Cebus monkey]]s by Professor [[David Premack]], but it has explanatory and [[predictive power]] when applied to humans, and it has been used by therapists practicing [[applied behavior analysis]]. Premack's principle suggests that if a person wants to perform a given activity, the person will perform a less desirable activity to get at the more desirable activity; that is, activities may themselves be reinforcers. An individual will be more motivated to perform a particular activity if he knows that he will partake in a more desirable activity as a consequence. Stated objectively, if high-probability behaviors (more desirable behaviors) are made contingent upon lower-probability behaviors (less desirable behaviors), then the lower-probability behaviors are more likely to occur. More desirable behaviors are those that individuals spend more time doing if permitted; less desirable behaviors are those that individuals spend less time doing when free to act.

Just as "reward" was commonly used to alter behavior long before "reinforcement" was studied experimentally, the Premack principle has long been informally understood and used in a wide variety of circumstances. An example is a mother who says "You have to finish your vegetables (low frequency) before you can eat any ice cream (high frequency)"

==Experimental evidence==

David Premack and his colleagues, and others, have conducted a number of experiments to test the effectiveness of the Premack principle in humans. One of the earliest studies was conducted with young children. Premack gave the children two response alternatives, eating candy or playing a [[pinball]] machine, and determined which of these behaviors was more probable for each child. Some of the children preferred one activity, some the other. In the second phase of the experiment, the children were tested with one of two procedures. In one procedure, eating was the reinforcing response, and playing pinball served as the instrumental response; that is, the children had to play pinball in order to eat candy. The results were consistent with the Premack principle: only the children who preferred eating candy over playing pinball showed a reinforcement effect. The roles of responses were reversed in the second test, with corresponding results. That is, only children who preferred playing pinball over eating candy showed a reinforcement effect. This study, among others, helps to confirm the Premack principle in showing that a high-probability activity can be an effective reinforcer for an activity that the subject is less likely to perform.(Domjan, 2010).

==An alternative: Response deprivation theory==

Premack's principle may be violated if a situation or schedule of reinforcement provides much more of the high-probability behavior than of the low-probability behavior. Such observations led the team of Timberlake and Allison (1974) to propose the Response Deprivation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Timberlake and Allison, Response deprivation: an empirical approach to instrumental performance, Psychological Review, 1974, 81, 146-164&lt;/ref&gt; Like Premack's principle, this hypothesis bases reinforcement of one behavior on access to another.  Experimenters observe the extent to which an individual is deprived of, or prevented from performing, the behavior that is later made contingent on the second behavior. Reinforcement occurs only when the situation is set up so that access to the contingent response has been reduced relative to its baseline level. In effect, the subject must subsequently increase responding to make up for the "deprivation" of the contingent response. Several subsequent experiments have supported this alternative to the Premack principle.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In a 2013 [[UNICEF]] report covering 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East, [[Ethiopia]] had the region's highest total number of women that have undergone FGM (27.2 million), while [[Somalia]] had the highest percentage ([[prevalence]]) of FGM (98%).&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt;

The world's first known campaign against FGM took place in Egypt in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; FGM prevalence in Egypt in 1995 was still at least as high as Somalia's 2013 world record (98%), despite dropping significantly since then among young women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/brussels/en/home/ourwork/sustainable-development/successstories/the-taboo-has-been-broken--fighting-female-genital-mutilation-in.html The taboo has been broken: Fighting Female Genital Mutilation in Egypt]. According to this UNDP report, FGM prevalence among 15 to 30-year-olds dropped to 72% already in 2008 after having been 96% in 1995, which means that the prevalence among all women in 1995 was even higher than 76%.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the prevalence of FGM vary according to source.

==Classifications of FGM==
{{main|Female genital mutilation}}
The WHO identifies four types of FGM:
*'''Type I''': removal of the [[clitoral hood]], the skin around the [[clitoris]] (''Ia''), with partial or complete removal of the clitoris (''Ib'');
*'''Type II''': removal of the [[labia minora]] (''IIa''), with partial or complete removal of the clitoris (''IIb'') and the [[labia majora]] (''IIc'');
*'''Type III''': removal of all or part of the labia minora (''IIIa'') and labia majora (''IIIb''), and the stitching of a seal across the vagina, leaving a small opening for the passage of urine and menstrual blood ([[infibulation]]);
*'''Type IV''': other miscellaneous acts, might or might not include cauterization of the clitoris, cutting of the vagina ([[gishiri cutting]]), and introducing corrosive substances into the vagina to tighten it (extreme and rare cases) &lt;ref name=Momoh6&gt;Momoh, Comfort (ed). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dVjIP0RfVAMC&amp;pg=PA5 "Female Genital Mutilation"], Radcliffe Publishing, 2005, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==

The term "[[prevalence]]" is used to describe the proportion of women and girls now living in a country who have undergone FGM at some stage in their lives. This is distinct from the "[[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]" of FGM which describes the proportion of women and girls who have undergone the procedure within a particular time period, which could be contemporary or historical. FGM is practiced in Africa, the Middle East,&lt;ref name="FGM - Where is it practiced"/&gt; Indonesia and Malaysia,&lt;ref name="World Health Organization 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="William G.

In a 2013 UNICEF report based on surveys completed by select countries, FGM is known to be prevalent in 27 African countries, Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan, where 125 million women and girls have undergone FGM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp. 3–26. *For Iraqi Kurdistan, also see Yasin, Berivan A. et al.

As a result of immigration, FGM has also spread to Europe, Australia, and the United States, with some families having their daughters undergo the procedure while on vacation overseas. As Western governments become more aware of FGM, legislation has come into effect in many countries to make the practice a criminal offense. In 2006, [[Khalid Adem]] became the first man in the United States to be prosecuted for mutilating his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/02brfs-001.html?_r=1 "Georgia: Man Convicted in Daughter’s Mutilation"], Associated Press, 2 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has called for elimination of the practice by 2030. A 2017 [[UCLA Fielding School of Public Health]] study, measuring trends in the prevalence of FGM over the course of three decades, found that they dropped significantly in 17 of the 22 countries surveyed. The researchers found a 2–8 percentage points increase in Chad, Mali and Sierra Leone during the 30-years period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Koski |first1=Alissa |last2=Heymann |first2=Jody |date=25 November 2017 |title=Thirty-year trends in the prevalence and severity of female genital mutilation: a comparison of 22 countries |url=http://gh.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000467 |journal=BMJ Global Health |publisher=BMJ Journals |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e000467 |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data reliability==
Much of the FGM prevalence data currently available is based on verbal surveys and self-reporting.&lt;ref name=b2013&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1155/2013/680926 | volume=2013 | title=Female Genital Mutilation in Sierra Leone: Forms, Reliability of Reported Status, and Accuracy of Related Demographic and Health Survey Questions | year=2013 | journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology International | pages=1–14 | author=Bjälkander Owolabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical examinations are uncommon. The assumption is that women respond truthfully when asked about their FGM status and that they know the type and extent of FGM that was performed on their genitalia. Many FGM procedures are performed at a very young age, many cultures feel a taboo about such discussions, and a number of such factors raise the possibility that the validity of survey responses might be incorrect, potentially underreported.&lt;ref name=b2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rahman and N. Toubia, Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Worldwide Laws and Policies, Zed Press, London, UK, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Oman]], for example, some do not wish to discuss FGM from the fear that such discussion is showing their culture's dirty laundry to the world, causing criticism of a practice that they believe is purely religious.&lt;ref name="muscatdaily.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307034607/http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Stories-Files/The-issue-of-female-genital-mutilation-in-Oman-1xye The issue of female genital mutilation in Oman] Susan Mubarak, Muscat Daily (January 01, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries where FGM has been outlawed, fear of prosecution of family members or self, and social disapproval from elders may cause women to deny that they underwent or were subjected to FGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1475-9276-10-20 | volume=10 | title=Factors associated with female genital mutilation in Burkina Faso and its policy implications | year=2011 | journal=International Journal for Equity in Health | page=20 | author=Karmaker Bue, Kandala Ngianga-Bakwin, Chung Donna, Clarke Aileen}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the self-reported circumcision status of women aged 15–49 was verbally surveyed in 1995 in northern Ghana. The same women were interviewed again in 2000 after the enactment of a law that criminalized FGM and Ghana-wide public campaigns against the practice. This study discovered that 13% of women who reported in 1995 that they had undergone FGM denied it in the 2000 interview, with youngest age group girls denying at rates as high as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;E.

===General===
Although estimates of the prevalence of FGM vary, sources have consistently found the practice to be undergone by the majority of women in the [[Horn of Africa]], in the [[West Africa]]n countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso, as well as in Sudan and Egypt.
Of these countries, all have laws or decrees against the practice, with the exception of Sierra Leone, Mali and some states of Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change - UNICEF DATA|date=22 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34921135|title=Gambia's Yahya Jammeh bans female genital mutilation|date=25 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study found that over 95% of Egyptian women have undergone some form of FGM.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL30168862 "Egypt death sparks debate on female circumcision"], Reuters, 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 UNICEF report, the prevalence had dropped to 91%.&lt;ref name=childinfo/&gt; The 2016 UNICEF report stated that the share of girls aged 15 to 19 who had undergone FGM dropped from 97% in 1985 to 70% in 2015.&lt;ref name=UNICEF2016/&gt; The percentage of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years who had

===Eritrea===

The government of [[Eritrea]] surveyed and published an official FGM prevalence rate of 89% in 2003.&lt;ref name=dkerit&gt;Diana Kuring(2008) Female Genital Mutilation in Eritrea: Regional Variations" (Chapter 4, pp. 57 – 120) in: Weibliche Genitalverstümmelung in Eritrea.

===Ethiopia===
The WHO gives a prevalence of 65% for FGM in [[Ethiopia]] (2016) in women age 15-49 and falling to 47.1 in those 15–19 years. In a 2016 UNICEF report, [[Ethiopia]]'s regional prevalence of FGM is : [[Afar Region]] – 91.2%; [[Somali Region]] – 98.5%; [[Harari Region]] – 81.7%; [[Dire Dawa]] 75.3%; [[Amhara Region]] – 1.4% to 21.9%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2147/IJWH.S28805 | title=Female genital mutilation: prevalence, perceptions and effect on women's health in Kersa district of Ethiopia | year=2012 | journal=International Journal of Women's Health | page=45 | author=Shanko Yirga Wondimu, Kassa Nega, Gebremichael Mengistu, Aro Arja R}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oromia Region]] – 75.6%; [[Addis Ababa]] City – 54%; [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region]] – 62.9%; [[Tigray Region]] – 24.2%; [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region|Southern Region]] – 62%; [[Gambela Region]] 33%.

===Gambia===
[[File:FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005.jpg|thumb|250 px|Anti-FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005]]
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Gambia]].&lt;ref name="fgmnetwork1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; In a 2013 report, an estimated 76.3% of girls and women have been subjected to FGM/C.&lt;ref name=kapgh&gt;Kaplan et al., [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/13/851 Knowledge, attitudes and practices of female genital mutilation/cutting among health care professionals in The Gambia: a multiethnic study], BMC Public Health 2013, 13:851&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 UNICEF survey found a 78.3% prevalence rate in Gambia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/gambia/MICS_III_Main_Report_final_version.pdf The Gambia MICS 2005-2006 Report] UNICEF and Gambia Bureau of Statistics (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The age when FGM is done on Gambian girls ranges from 7 days after birth up to pre-adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Hernlund Y: Cutting without ritual and ritual without cutting: female circumcision and the Re-ritualization of initiation in The Gambia. In Female “circumcision” in Africa: culture, controversy and change. Edited by Shell-Duncan B, Hernlund Y. London: Rienner publishers; 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gambia's predominant religion is Islam (90%), and it has many ethnic groups. Prevalence rates of FGM/C vary significantly between the ethnic groups: Sarahule (FGM rate of 98%), Mandinka (97%), Djola (87%), Serer (43%), and Wolof (12%). Urban areas report FGM/C rates of about 56%, whereas in rural areas, rates exceed 90%. A majority of Gambian women who underwent FGM/C claimed they did it primarily because religion mandates it.&lt;ref name=kapgh/&gt; 

A 2011 clinical study reports 66% FGMs in Gambia were Type I, 26% were Type II and 8% Type III.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2011), [http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1742-4755-8-26.pdf Health consequences of female genital mutilation/cutting in the Gambia, evidence into action] Reproductive Health, 8:26&lt;/ref&gt; About a third of all women in Gambia with FGM/C, including Type I, suffered health complications because of the procedure. In 2015, Gambia's president [[Yahya Jammeh]] has banned FGM.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; As FGM is less prevalent among younger women according to [[City University London]] in 2015, this suggested a decline in the practice.&lt;ref name="CUL_Prevalence_FGM_Jul2015" /&gt;

===Ghana===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="ecoi" /&gt; According to the WHO, its prevalence is 3.8%. In 1989, the head of the government of Ghana, President Rawlings, issued a formal declaration against FGM. Article 39 of Ghana's Constitution also provides in part that traditional practices that are injurious to a person's health and well being are abolished. The Criminal Code was amended in 1994 to outlaw FGM, and the law was strengthened in 2007.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; Ghana ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2007.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

===Guinea===
[[Guinea]] has the second highest FGM prevalence rate in the world.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; In a 2005 survey, 96% of all Guinea women aged between 15 and 49 had been cut.&lt;ref name=fgmgui2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-guinea-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Guinea] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003050527/http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-guinea-2011.pdf |date=2013-10-03 }} Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; That is a slight decline in the practice from the 1999 recorded FGM rate of 98.6%. Among the 15- to 19-year-olds the prevalence was 89%, among 20- to 24-year-olds 95%. About 50% of the women in Guinea believe FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; Guinea is predominantly a Muslim country, with 90% of the population practicing Islam. The high FGM rates are observed across all religions in Guinea; FGM is prevalent in 99% of Muslim women, 94% of Catholics and Protestants, and 93% of Animist women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt; 

FGM is illegal in Guinea under Article 265 of the Penal Code. The law sentences death to the perpetrator if the girl dies within 40 days after the FGM.&lt;ref name=unlaw09&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Berhane%20Ras-Work%20revised_.pdf LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION (FGM)] Berhane Ras-Work, United Nations (May 21, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6 of the Guinean Constitution, which outlaws cruel and inhumane treatment, could be interpreted to include these practices, should a case be brought to the Supreme Court. Guinea signed the Maputo Protocol in 2003 but has not ratified it.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt; 

Article 305 of Guinea’s penal code also bans FGM, but nobody has yet been sentenced under any of Guinea's FGM-related laws.&lt;ref name=fgmgui2011/&gt; In Guinea, instead of stopping FGM, the trend is towards medicalisation of FGM, where the mutilation is advertised under hygienic conditions by medically trained staff, who see FGM practice an additional source of income. Per the above 2005 survey, 27% of girls were cut by medically trained staff.

===Guinea-Bissau===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Guinea-Bissau]], and have been estimated at a 50% prevalence rate in 2000.&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; A law banning the practice nationwide was adopted by Parliament in June 2011 with 64 votes to 1. At the time, 45% of women aged 15 to 49 years were affected by FGM. According to a survey, 33% of women favoured a continuation of genital cutting, but 50% of the overall population wanted to abandon the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/guineabissau_59787.html |title=New law prohibits practice of female genital mutilation in Guinea-Bissau &amp;#124; At a glance: Guinea-Bissau |publisher=UNICEF |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; The 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) estimated the national prevalence of FGM to be 21% among women age 15-49, down from 27% in the 2008/09 survey and 32 percent in the 2003 survey.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR308/FR308.pdf|title=Kenya DHS 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of FGM in 2014 varied widely by age, location, ethnic group, and religion. Prevalence of FGM increases with age. It is lowest among women ages 15–19 at 11.4%, and highest among women aged 45–49 at 40.9%. This trend underscores the declining trend in FGM over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

By region, prevalence is highest in the former provinces of North Eastern (97.5%), Nyanza (32.4%), Rift Valley (26.9%), and Eastern (26.4%), and lower in Central (16.5%), Coast (10.2%), Nairobi (8.0%), and Western (0.8%). It is more common in rural areas (25.9%) than urban (13.8%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By ethnic group, FGM is most prevalent among women in the Somali (93.6%), Samburu (86.0%), Kisii (84.4%), and Maasai (77.9%) ethnic groups. By religion, it is more prevalent in Muslim women (51.1%) and women listing no religion (32.9%) and less prevalent in Roman Catholic (21.5%) and Protestant or other Christian women (17.9%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2001 Kenya enacted the Children’s Act, under the provisions of which FGM was criminalized when practiced on girls younger than 18.&lt;ref name="fgmken2011"&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-kenia-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Kenya] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was made illegal nationwide in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2011/sep/08/women-africa "FGM: Kenya acts against unkindest cut"], The Guardian, 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberia===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; Genital mutilation is a taboo subject in Liberia. It is difficult to get accurate data on FGM prevalence rate. The FGM procedure is mandatory for initiation of women into the secret Liberia and Sierra Leone society called the [[Sande society]], sometimes called Bondo. A 2007 demographic survey asked women if they belonged to Sande society. It was assumed that those who were part of Sande society had undergone FGM. Based on this estimation method, the prevalence of FGM in Liberia has been estimated as 58%.&lt;ref name=fgmlib2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-liberia-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Liberia] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Liberia has consented to international charters such as CEDAW as well as Africa's Maputo Protocol. National legislation explicitly making FGM punishable by law has yet to be passed.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmlib2011/&gt; As FGM was less prevalent among younger women in a 2015 study, this suggested a decline in the practice.&lt;ref name="CUL_Prevalence_FGM_Jul2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alison MacFarlane et al|title=Prevalence of Female Genital Mutilation in England and Wales: National and local estimates|date=July 2015|publisher=[[City University London]]|location=London|isbn=9781900804936|page=10|url=https://www.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/282388/FGM-statistics-final-report-21-07-15-released-text.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121004826/https://www.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/282388/FGM-statistics-final-report-21-07-15-released-text.pdf|archivedate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libya===
Female genital mutilation is rarely practiced in Libya. Likely to be found in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ecoi"/&gt;

===Malawi===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in Malawi mostly in the following districts of Malawi. Southern Malawi: Mulanje, Thyolo, Mangochi and parts of Machinga and Chiradzuro District. In the Northern part of Malawi: Nkhatabay. This custom is common among the Tonga tribe, Yao tribe and Lomwe tribe. It is a custom which has been there for generation. In some villages it is deeply routed compared to others . Every FGM camp has its own degree of how deep they want to conduct the custom but the motive is the same. It is shrouded in silence. Not even the government authorities can trace the roots because the high powers are given to the local authorities of the village and clan.&lt;ref name="ecoi" /&gt;

===Mali===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Mali]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; The WHO gives a prevalence of 85.2% for women aged 15–49 in 2006 in Mali.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; In a 2007 report,&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007/&gt; 92% of all Mali women between the ages of 15 and 49 had been subjected to FGM. The rates of FGM are lower only among the Sonrai (28%), the Tamachek (32%) and the Bozo people (76%). Nearly half are Type I, another half Type II.&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/en/dokumente/en-fgm-countries-mali.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Mali] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence varies with religion in Mali; FGM is prevalent in 92% of Muslim women, 76% of Christians.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt; 

About 64% of the women of Mali believe FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; In 2002, Mali created a government program aimed at discouraging FGM (''Ordinance No. 02-053 portant creation du programme national de lutte contre la pratique de l’excision'' [Ordinance creating a National Program to Fight the Practice of Female Genital Mutilation]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.k4health.org/sites/default/files/pub_bo_GG_appendA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There is no specific legislation criminalizing FGM.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007/&gt;

===Niger===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; In a 2006 survey, about 2% of Niger women had undergone FGM/C.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; In 1998, Niger reported a 4.5% prevalence rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glow-boell.de/media/de/txt_rubrik_2/FGM_Statistic_UNICEF_2005.pdf FGM/C - 2005 Statistics] UNICEF, see page 32&lt;/ref&gt; This survey data is potentially incorrect because, adjusted for age group, the women who claimed to have experienced FGM at the previous survey still are, albeit in a different age group. The 2006 survey implies more women had never experienced FGM than previously reported. The DHS surveyors claim the adoption of criminal legislation and fear of prosecution may explain why Niger women did not want to report having ever been circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR193/FR193-NI06.pdf Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples 2006] RÉPUBLIQUE DU NIGER; page 281 (in French, use an internet translator if you are not fluent in French)&lt;/ref&gt;  A WHO report estimates the prevalence rate of FGM in Niger to be 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.who.int/dsa/cat98/fgmbook.htm Female Genital Mutilation: An overview] WHO, Geneva&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, including a UNICEF 2009 report, claim FGM rates are high in Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/niger_49292.html Ten villages unite to say 'no’ to female genital mutilation/cutting in Niger] UNICEF (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engenderhealth.org/files/pubs/maternal-health/report/section/niger.pdf NIGER] Nathalie Maulet, UNFPA (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/printreport.aspx?reportid=48483 NIGER: Legal ban on female circumcision widely ignored] IRIN, UN News Service (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A law banning FGM was passed in 2003 by the Niger government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/wcaro/WCARO_Niger_Factsheet-11.pdf PRIORITIES IN CHILD SURVIVAL, EDUCATION AND PROTECTION - Niger] UNICEF (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
{{Main|Female genital mutilation in Nigeria}}
A 2008 demographic survey found 30% of all [[Nigeria]]n women have been subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="fgmnigeria2011"&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-nigeria-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Nigeria] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with 25% reported by a 1999 survey, and 19% by 2003 survey. This suggests no trend, unreliable past or most recent survey data in some regions, as well as the possibility that a number of women are increasingly willing to acknowledge having undergone FGM. Another possible explanation for higher 2008 prevalence rate is the definition of FGM used, which included Type IV FGMs. In some parts of Nigeria, the vagina walls are cut in new born girls or other traditional practices performed - such as the ''angurya'' and ''gishiri'' cuts - which fall under Type IV FGM classification of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="fgmnigeria2011" /&gt; Over 80% of all FGMs are performed on girls under one year of age. The prevalence varies with religion in Nigeria; FGM is prevalent in 31% of Catholics, 27% of Protestant and 7% of Muslim women.&lt;ref name="unicefstat2010" /&gt; FGM was banned throughout the country in 2015.&lt;ref name="theguardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt;

===Republic of the Congo===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in the [[Republic of the Congo]],&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; and has been estimated at a 5% prevalence rate.&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt;

===Senegal===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; According to 2005 survey, FGM prevalence rate is 28% of all women aged between 15 and 49.&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-senegal-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Senegal] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant differences in regional prevalence. FGM is most widespread in the Southern Senegal (94% in Kolda Region) and in Northeastern Senegal (93% in Matam Region). FGM rates are lower in other regions: Tambacounda (86%), Ziguinchor (69%), and less than 5% in Diourbel and Louga Regions. Senegal is 94% Muslim. The FGM prevalence rate varies by religion: 29% of Muslim women have undergone FGM, 16% of Animists, and 11% of Christian women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011/&gt; 

A law that was passed in January 1999 makes FGM illegal in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/wi/rls/rep/crfgm/10107.htm "Senegal: Report on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC)"], Released by the Office of the Senior Coordinator for International Women's Issues, US Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; President Diouf had appealed for an end to this practice and for legislation outlawing it. The law modifies the Penal Code to make this practice a criminal act, punishable by a sentence of one to five years in prison. A spokesperson for the human rights group RADDHO (The African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights) noted in the local press that "Adopting the law is not the end, as it will still need to be effectively enforced for women to benefit from it. Senegal ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

===Sierra Leone===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; According to a 2008 survey, 91% of women in Sierra Leone between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM. The highest rate of prevalence is in the Northern Sierra Leone (97%).&lt;ref name=fgmsile2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-sierraleone-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Sierra Leone] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Type II is most common, but Type I is known as well as Type III. In a 2013 report, researchers first conducted verbal surveys followed by clinical examination. They found that the verbal disclosure were not completely reliable, and clinical examination showed greater extent of FGM. These researchers report 68% Type II and 32% Type I in Sierra Leone women.&lt;ref name="b2013"/&gt; 

Like Liberia, Sierra Leone has the traditional secret society of women, called Bondo or [[Sande society]], which uses FGM as part of the initiation rite. 70% of the population is Muslim, 20% Christian, and 10% as traditional religions.&lt;ref name=fgmsile2011/&gt; Only Creole Christians of Sierra Leone are known to not practice FGM. There is no federal law against FGM in Sierra Leone; and the ''Soweis'' - those who do FGM excision - wield considerable political power during elections.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;

===Somalia===
According to a 2005 WHO estimate, about 97.9% of [[Somalia]]'s women and girls underwent FGM. This was at the time the world's highest prevalence rate of the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/index.html |title=Prevalence of FGM |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 UNICEF report also noted that Somalia had the world's highest rate of Type III FGM, with 79% of all Somali women having undergone the procedure; another 15% underwent Type II FGM.&lt;ref name="prb.org"/&gt; The prevalence rate varies considerably by region and is on the decline in the northern part of the country. In 2013, UNICEF in conjunction with the Somali authorities reported that the FGM prevalence rate among 1- to 14-year-old girls in the autonomous northern [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]] regions had dropped to 25% following a social and religious awareness campaign.&lt;ref name="Jpsfgmd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Female genital mutilation down|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/04/16/somalia-female-genital-mutilation-down.html|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=Associated Press via The Jakarta Post|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 15 of the [[Constitution of Somalia|Federal Constitution]] adopted in August 2012 also prohibits female circumcision.&lt;ref name="Frspc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Republic of Somalia - Provisional Constitution |url=http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228121925/http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="ecoi" /&gt;

===South Sudan===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[South Sudan]], but its exact prevalence is unknown. A 2015 UNICEF report claimed 1% of women aged 15–49 had been subjected to FGM, but as of May 2018 there were no recent data confirming this figure. FGM has been reported to be practiced in some Christian and Muslims communities, and has been noted in some refugee camps in [[Upper Nile State]]. South Sudanese law has banned female genital mutilation, but the government has not enacted a clear plan to eradicate the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.28toomany.org/static/media/uploads/Law%20Reports/south_sudan_law_report_v1_(may_2018).pdf |title=South Sudan: the law and FGM |author= |work=28 Too Many 2018 |publisher=Thomas Reuters Foundation |date=May 2018 |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
The prevalence of FGM in Sudan is 90%.&lt;ref name="applications.emro.who.int"&gt;http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/High_Level_Exp_Meet_Rep_2013_EN_14808.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Only some [[states of Sudan]] have laws against FGM;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prb.org/pdf14/progress-ending-fgm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; currently there is no national law forbidding FGM, although Sudan was the first country to outlaw it in 1946, under the British. Type III was prohibited under the 1925 Penal Code, with less severe forms allowed. Outreach groups have been trying to eradicate the practice for 50 years, working with NGOs, religious groups, the government, the media and medical practitioners. Arrests have been made but no further action seems to have taken place.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt; Sudan signed the Maputo Protocol in June, 2008 but no ratification has yet been deposited with the African Union.

===Tanzania===
According to 2015-16 survey in [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; FGM prevalence rate is 10% of all women aged between 15 and 49 and 4.7% for those aged 15–19. In contrast, the 1996 survey reported 17.6, suggesting a drop of 7.6% over 20 years or unwillingness to disclose. Type II FGM was found to be most common. There are significant differences in regional prevalence; FGM is most widespread in Manyara (81%), Dodoma (68%), Arusha (55%), Singida (43%) and Mara (38%) regions.&lt;ref name=fgmtanz2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-tansania-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Tanzania] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The practice varies with religion, with reported prevalence rates of 20% for Christian and 15% of Muslim women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt; 

Section 169A of the Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act of 1998 prohibits FGM in Tanzania. Punishment is imprisonment of from five to fifteen years or a fine not exceeding 300,000 shillings (approximately US$250) or both. Tanzania ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2007. As with Kenya, Tanzania 1998 Act protects only girls up to the age of 18 years. The FGM law is being occasionally implemented, with 52 violations have been reported, filed and prosecuted. At least 10 cases were convicted in Tanzania.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;

===Togo===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in [[Togo]]. In a 2014 UNICEF report, the prevalence is 1.8% in girls 15-19.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; The WHO puts its prevalence at 5.8% in 2006.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Other sources cite 12%&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and 50%&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; as prevalence. Type II is usually practiced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On October 30, 1998, the National Assembly unanimously voted to outlaw the practice of FGM. Penalties under the law can include a prison term of two months to ten years and a fine of 100,000 francs to one million francs (approximately US$160 to 1,600). A person who had knowledge that the procedure was going to take place and failed to inform public authorities can be punished with one month to one year imprisonment or a fine of from 20,000 to 500,000 francs (approximately US$32 to 800). Togo ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

==Europe==
In recent years the increase in immigration for individuals from countries which practice [[FGM]], has led to the introduction of FGM in European and North American societies. FGM prevalence rate has been difficult to quantify among immigrants to European countries.&lt;ref name=Leye2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1= Leye | first1= Els | last2= Powell | first2= Richard A. | last3= Nienhuis | first3= Gerda | last4= Claeys | first4= Patricia | last5= Temmerman | first5= Marleen | title = Health care in Europe for women with genital mutilation | journal = [[Health Care for Women International]] | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 362–378 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/07399330500511717 | date = March 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07399330500511717 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; A case study which investigated FGM in groups of migrant women from [[Northern Africa]] to European regions like Scandinavia, noted that a majority of these women had FGM before their migration to Europe.&lt;ref name=Elgaali2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elgaali|first1=Mahoud | last2= Strevens | first2= Helena  | last3= Mårdh | first3= Per-Anders |title= Female genital mutilation – an exported medical hazard |journal= [[The European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care]] |year=2005|volume=10 | issue =2|pages=93–97 | publisher = [[Informa]] | doi = 10.1080/13625180400020945 |pmid = 16147813}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been established that African communities in European countries continue the practice of FGM on their daughters after migrating to Europe. For instance in [[Sweden]], a study by [[Karolinska Institutet]] concluded that about a third of families migrated from countries with a FGM culture wanted to continue mutilating in their new countries.&lt;ref name=dn_2014-06-24&gt;{{cite news|title=En av tre familjer vill fortsätta omskära|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/en-av-tre-familjer-vill-fortsatta-omskara/|accessdate=25 June 2014|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], which came into force on 1 August 2014, defines and criminalize the practice in Article 38:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 13 Countries sign new Convention in Istanbul | url = http://www.unric.org/en/violence-against-women/27000-13-countries-sign-new-convention-in-istanbul | website = unric.org | publisher = [[UNRIC|United Nations Regional Information Centre (UNRIC)]] | accessdate = 28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm | website = conventions.coe.int | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | date = 2011 | accessdate = 28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (treaty signatures) | url = http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG | website = conventions.coe.int | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | date = May 2011 | accessdate = 28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
After a few cases of infibulation practiced by complaisant medical practitioners within the African immigrant community came to public knowledge through media coverage, the Law n°7/2006 was passed on 1/9/2006, becoming effective on 1/28/2006, concerning "Measures of prevention and prohibition of any female genital mutilation practice"; the Act is also known as the ''Legge Consolo'' ("Consolo Act") named after its primary promoter, Senator Giuseppe Consolo. Article 6 of the law integrates the Italian Penal Code with Articles 583-''Bis'' and 583-''Ter'', punishing any practice of female genital mutilation "not justifiable under therapeutical or medical needs" with imprisonment ranging from 4 to 12 years (3 to 7 years for any mutilation other than, or less severe than, clitoridectomy, excision or infibulation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/06007l.htm Italian Law n°7 1/9/2006, ''Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile''], accessed 23 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty can be reduced up to {{frac|2|3}} if the harm caused is of modest entity (i.e. if partially or completely unsuccessful), but may also be elevated up to {{frac|3}} if the victim is a minor or if the offense has been committed for profit. An Italian citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in Italy can be punished under this law even if the offense is committed abroad; the law will as well afflict any individual of any citizenship in Italy, even illegally or provisionally. The law also mandates any medical practitioner found guilty under those provisions to have his/her medical license revoked for a minimum of six up to a maximum of ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/06007l.htm Italian Law n°7 1/9/2006, ''Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile''], accessed 23 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
FGM is considered mutilation and is punishable as a criminal offense under Dutch law. There is no specific law against FGM: the act is subsumed under the general offense of inflicting harm (''"mishandeling"'' in Dutch, art. 300–304 Dutch Criminal Code). The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of 12 years. The sentence can be higher if the offender is a family member of the victim. It is also illegal to assist or encourage another person to perform FGM. A Dutch citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in the Netherlands can be punished even if the offense is committed abroad. Doctors have the obligation to report suspected cases of FGM and may break patient confidentiality rules if necessary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Iran ===
National data on FGM in Iran are unknown. Various studies have been conducted on prevalence in provinces and counties, suggesting significant regional differences.&lt;ref name="OrchidIran"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://orchidproject.org/country/iran/ |title=Iran  |publisher=[[Orchid Project]] |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kameelahmady.com/wp-content/uploads/Kameel%20-%20EN%20Final.pdf |title=A comprehensive research study on female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) in Iran |author=Kameel Ahmady |publisher=Kameel Ahmady |date=2015 |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is known to be prevalent in four provinces: [[West Azerbaijan Province]] (mostly the Kurdish populated southern part), [[Kurdistan Province]] and [[Kermanshah Province]] in the Kurdish-dominated northwest, and [[Hormozgan Province]] and islands near it in the south.&lt;ref name="Ahmady20"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

FGM in Iran is primarily associated with Sunni Muslims following the [[Shafi‘i]] [[madhhab]], especially those living in certain Kurdish-populated rural areas in northwestern Iran, adjacent to the Kurdish-speaking regions in northeastern Iraq where FGM also has a relatively high presence compared to the non-Kurdish areas around it. There is strong disparity even within the Kurdish communities, and the prevalence may differ considerably from one village to the next.&lt;ref name="Ahmady14"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] government, which has implemented a relatively successful anti-FGM campaign, official representatives as well as nationalist individuals or groups tend to deny FGM even exists in Iran.&lt;ref name="Ahmady14"/&gt; In the southern province of Hormozgan, FGM is mostly practiced by (Persian) Sunnis, but also a small minority of Shias living near them.&lt;ref name="Ahmady20"/&gt;

The issue is rarely discussed in public; the national Shia religious establishment claims it as an exclusively Sunni practice in which it should not get involved, and generally sees no reason to try and end it. It is also rarely the subject of research in academia, with the government neither permitting nor funding any public engagement projects for the affected regions.&lt;ref name="Ahmady15"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Susie Latham reported that FGC had been abandoned around the capital of the south-western province Khuzestan in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/17496535.2016.1167227 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=The campaign against Female Genital Cutting: empowering women or reinforcing global inequity? | year=2016 | journal=Ethics and Social Welfare | pages=108–121 | author=Latham Susie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Kameel Ahmady (2005–2015) also revealed the practice had been abandoned in several other parts of Iran, such as among Shia Kurdish women in parts of Kermanshah and [[Ilam Province]].&lt;ref name="Ahmady20"/&gt;

Some studies estimate the Type I and II FGM among Iraqi migrants and other Kurdish minority groups to be variable, ranging from 40% to 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopfgmmideast.org/countries/iran/ |title=» Iran |publisher=Stopfgmmideast.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golnaz Esfandiari (2009-03-10).

===Jordan===
Residents of [[Arabah|Wadi Araba]] village in southern [[Jordan]] are known to practice FGM. The practice is foreign to the rest of the country, experts speculate that this practise was introduced through descendants of tribes that came from neighbouring [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Beer Sheba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Arts/Nov/13/The-Jordanian-town-that-still-circumcises-women.ashx#axzz2g5h5CT28 The Jordanian town that still circumcises women] Rana Sabbagh-Gargour, The Star (Lebanon)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml Female circumcision/genital cutting] BBC Guide, United Kingdom (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oman===
The practice is very prevalent in [[Oman]].&lt;ref name="meforum1"&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/1629/is-female-genital-mutilation-an-islamic-problem "Is Female Genital Mutilation an Islamic Problem?"], ''Middle East Quarterly'', accessed 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article by journalist Susan Mubarak describes FGM practice in Oman, and claims the practice is very common in [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]] in the southwest. The author went on to say that a previous article on the topic received both positive feedback for spreading awareness of what some considered a 'horrific tradition', as well as negative feedback from others for 'hanging Dhofar’s dirty washing for the world to see and criticising a practice that they believe is purely Islamic,' commenting that she 'paid little attention to these criticisms because I know the practice is harmful and primitive', and 'our religion neither encourages the practice nor condemns it.'&lt;ref name="muscatdaily.com"/&gt; 

According to a small survey by human rights activist and statistician Habiba Al Hinai conducted in October 2013 and published in January 2014, 78% of 100 women interviewed living in the capital city of [[Muscat]] had undergone FGM. These women came from all parts of the country, each region showing a very high prevalence, and even though fewer women from Muscat itself had undergone FGM, they were still in the majority. Her findings contradicted the common belief that FGM was only widespread in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/news/new-study-oman-shows-high-prevalence-fgm-all-over-country |title=New study in Oman shows high prevalence of FGM all over the country &amp;#124; Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures |publisher=Wluml.org |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Type I is mostly performed in southern Oman and typically performed within a few weeks of a girl's birth, while Type IV is observed in other parts of northern Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweek.co.om/printCon.aspx?Cval=6181 FOCUS ON FGM] Victoria Cuthbert, The Week (Oman), (April 25, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The only indigenous tribe in Latin America known to practise FGM is Colombia's [[Emberá people]]. The tradition was extremely secretive and taboo until a 2007 incident, in which a girl died as a result of FGM. The incident caused much controversy, raised awareness and stimulated debate about ending the practice altogether. In 2015, it was reported that of the approximately 250,000 members of the tribe, 25,000 (10%) had decided to discontinue female genital mutilation, with a community leader saying they hoped to eradicate it by 2030.&lt;ref name=Moloney&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moloney|first1=Anastasia|title=Colombia's Embera tribe hopes to eradicate FGM by 2030|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-colombia-girls-fgm-idUSKBN0LA2FX20150206|website=Reuters|accessdate=6 August 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714145347/https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-colombia-girls-fgm-idUSKBN0LA2FX20150206|archivedate=14 July 2015|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the procedures had been done overseas, but two children born in Australia had the procedure done in [[New South Wales]] and a third child born in Australia had been taken to Indonesia to have the procedure done.

Across the sites, among all the children aged 15–18, 86-100% of the girls were reported already circumcised. More than 90% of families visited in the studies claimed they wanted the practice to continue.&lt;ref name=ahin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACU138.pdf Female Circumcision in Indonesia] Population Council and USAID, September 2003; see pages 24-27 and full report&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records suggest female circumcision in Indonesia started and became prevalent with the arrival of Islam in the 13th century as part of its drive to convert people to Islam. In islands of Indonesia, where partial populations converted to Islam in the 17th century, FGM has been prevalent in Muslim females only.&lt;ref&gt;William Clarence-Smith, Self-determination and Women's Rights in Muslim Societies (edited by Raghavan and Levine); pp 127-134, Brandeis University Press (2012), {{ISBN|978-1-61168-280-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2899">'''Pride of workmanship''' is the gratifying sense of having done good work. It is an element of [[job satisfaction]]. 

One of the key principles in the philosophy of management consultant [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|W. Edwards Deming]] is that workers have a right to [[pride]] of [[workmanship]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
12a. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality.

b. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, ''[[inter alia]]'', abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of [[management by objective]].{{sfn|Deming|2000|p=24}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Out of the Crisis'' (1982), Deming argues that pride of workmanship is more important to workers than "gymnasiums, tennis courts, and recreation areas,"{{sfn|Deming|2000|p=125}} and that barriers to pride of workmanship are a major obstacle to cost reduction and quality improvement.{{sfn|Deming|2000|p=83}}

Economist [[Thorstein Veblen]] advocated transferring control of industry from financial and business people to engineers, who were most likely to be driven by pride of workmanship and curiosity.{{sfn|Tool|1988|p=61}}

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the factory system destroyed the workers' traditional way of life, depriving them of pride of workmanship, among other things. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, workers responded by destroying machines and factories in what were called the [[Luddite]] revolts.{{sfn|Hunt|2016|p=65}}

The '''Psychogenetic System''' is a collection of theories about how our romantic relationship styles are influenced by our observations in early childhood of our own parents' relationship processes, as well as procedures for discovering, rewriting and adding to more mature perceptions and reactions in our present romantic relationships.  Teachworth's '''Psychogenetic System''' theories, which comprise a unique system of relationship counseling, were first developed in 1991 by Anne Teachworth, a Certified Gestalt Therapist, the Founder and Director of the Gestalt Institute of New Orleans since 1976. These theories and associated counseling techniques facilitate [[psychotherapeutic]] resolutions to a romantic couple's [[Intimate relationship|relationship]] problems by mining their early childhood reactions to their own parents' relationship shortcomings.

Teachworth first wrote about her "Psychogenetics" theory about relationship counseling in "Three Couples Transformed" which was published as a chapter in the book ''A Living Legacy of Fritz and Laura Perls: Contemporary Case Studies'' by Bud Feder and Ruth Ronall (1997).  Anne’s counseling method for this is described in depth in her own book on the subject, ''Why We Pick The Mates We Do'', first published in 1997; now its Seventh edition, revised in 2007.

A Psychogenetics System therapeutic session utilizes elements of [[Transactional Analysis]], [[Gestalt Therapy]], [[Redecision Therapy]], and [[Neurolinguistic Programming]] all of which Anne has a strong training background in.  Additionally, she has trained therapists for many years, co-instructing with Richard Bandler, Laura Perls, [[Joseph Zinker]], Dan Blum, Violet Oaklander, Anne Ancelin Schutzenberger, Stella Resnick, Phyllis Jenkins, Leonard Ravich and others well known in the world psychotherapy community. Since Anne Teachworth's death in February 2012, her legacy utilizing the Psychogenetics System in relationship counseling continues through The Gestalt Institute of New Orleans by her son Jeff Teachworth, also a Certified Psychogenetics Coach and a Certified Gestalt Therapist (see Gestalt-Institute.com.)

Teachworth's theories suggest that at an unconscious level, each of us assimilates our parents' pattern of relating to each other. In the child memory part of our mind, that "script" is the most familiar "road-map" of how to keep a relationship from breaking apart.  Under stress, when the logical functions get frustrated, these old patterns of relationship interaction seem to be the only option for survival. Sometimes beneficial, sometimes faulty, these behaviors occur spontaneously. With this phenomenon occurring on behalf of each partner, the results can be quite chaotic.

Psychogenetics suggests that our later adult mate choosing is highly colored by an unconscious compulsion to find a suitable partner to [[roleplay]] one of the two spousal roles assimilated in our early childhood, our "Inner Mate Model"; while we ourselves play the other identified role, referred to as our "Inner Adult Model". As young adults we can become powerfully attracted unconsciously to someone who matches our "Inner Mate Model" regardless of whether they are a productive mate for us. We are drawn into powerful attraction with a partner who we cast into one of the two roles, while we play the other. Note that many couples manage to have satisfactory relationships much of the time, especially if there were several positive personality factors in their parents' relationships. It is when there were substantial negative factors that a relationship can have considerable turbulence.

Original to Psychogenetics is the observation, reported by multiple clients of Teachworth's in her book, how from one marriage to another, the same adult can find their partner playing the role they played in their previous marriage and realize they are stuck in the other. For example, a person who was generally the "Topdog" in one relationship sometimes finds themselves more of the "Underdog" in their next relationship. 

Psychogenetics offers much insight into the commonly observed pattern of the same man or woman, in multiple marriages, choosing “the same type of partner.” Psychogenetics modifies this to say:  our unconscious is compelled to play either one of two spousal roles we naively learned in early childhood years, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THESE ROLES FUNCTION WELL OR POORLY.  As adults our unconscious is strongly influenced to utilize these TWO reference points to pick marriage partners.

==Genetic aspect==

Also original to Psychogenetics is the idea not only are "mommy's and daddy's" relationship style and habits imprinted in our unconscious; it's also possible and observable to find elements of the spousal habits of ancestral family generations imprinted on an individual's unconscious as well, due to a kind of transitive property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36500">'''Psychological behaviorism''' is a form of [[behaviorism]] — a major theory within psychology which holds that generally human behaviors are learned — proposed by [[Arthur W. Staats]]. The theory is constructed to advance from basic animal learning principles to deal with all types of human behavior, including personality, culture, and human evolution. Behaviorism was first developed by [[John B. Watson]] (1912), who coined the term "behaviorism," and then [[B. F. Skinner]] who developed what is known as "radical behaviorism." Watson and Skinner rejected the idea that psychological data could be obtained through introspection or by an attempt to describe consciousness; all psychological data, in their view, was to be derived from the observation of outward behavior. The strategy of these behaviorists was that the animal learning principles should then be used to explain human behavior. Thus, their behaviorisms were based upon research with animals.

Staats' program takes the animal learning principles, in the form in which he presents them, to be basic. But, also on the basis of his study of human behaviors, adds human learning principles. These principles are unique, not evident in any other species.&lt;ref name="rfs"&gt;{{citation |author=Staats, Arthur W |year=1996 |title=Behavior and  personality: psychological behaviorism  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIyd4NBHGxAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=psychological+behaviorism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OFOhUdKCEuWXiQLqq4DAAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ |publisher= Springer |place=New York  |isbn= 0826193110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holth also critically reviews psychological behaviorism as a "path to the grand reunification of psychology and behavior analysis".&lt;ref name="holth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holth | first1 = P | year = 2003 | title = Psychological Behaviorism: A Path to the Grand Reunification of Psychology and Behavior Analysis? | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_4/ai_n28173258/?tag=content;col1 | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 306–309 | doi=10.1037/h0100019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
The preceding behaviorisms of [[Ivan P. Pavlov]], [[Edward L. Thorndike]], [[John B. Watson]], [[B. F. Skinner]], and [[Clark L. Hull]] studied the basic principles of conditioning with animals. These behaviorists were animal researchers. Their basic approach was that those basic animal principles were to be applied to the explanation of human behavior. They did not have programs for the study of human behavior broadly, and deeply. 

Staats was the first to do his research with human subjects. His study ranged from research on basic principles to research and theory analysis of a wide variety of human behaviors, real life human behaviors. That is why [[Warren Tryon]] (2004) suggested that Staats change the name of his approach to psychological behaviorism, because Staats behaviorism is based upon human research and unifies aspects of traditional study with his behaviorism.
 
That includes his study of the basic principles. For example, the original behaviorists treated the two types of conditioning in different ways. The most generally used way by [[B. F. Skinner]] constructively considered [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]] to be separate and independent principles. In classical conditioning, if a piece of food is provided to a dog shortly after a buzzer is sounded, for a number of times, the buzzer will come to elicit salivation, part of an emotional response. In operant conditioning, if a piece of food is presented to a dog after the dog makes a particular motor response, the dog will come to make that motor response more frequently. 

For Staats, these two types of conditioning are not separate, they interact. A piece of food elicits an emotional response. A piece of food presented after the dog has made a motor response will have the effect of strengthening that motor response so that it occurs more frequently in the future.

Staats sees the piece of food to have two functions: one function is that of eliciting an emotional response, the other function is that of strengthening the motor behavior the precedes the presenting of food. So classical conditioning and operant conditioning are very much related.

Positive emotion stimuli will serve as positive reinforcers. Negative emotion stimuli will serve as punishers. As a consequence of humans’ inevitable learning positive emotion stimuli will serve as positive discriminative stimuli, incentives. Negative emotion stimuli will serve as negative discriminative stimuli, disincentives. So, emotion stimuli also have reinforcing value and discriminative stimulus value. Unlike Skinner’s basic principles, emotion and classical conditioning are central causes of behavior.

==Principles of human learning ==
Unlike the other behaviorisms, Staats’ considers human [[learning]] principles. He states that humans learn complex repertoires of behavior like language, values, and athletic skills –– that is cognitive, emotional, and sensory motor repertoires. When such a repertoire has been learned, they change the individual’s learning ability. A child who has learned language, a basic repertoire, can learn to read. A person who has learned a value system, such as a system of beliefs in human freedom, can learn to value different forms of government. An individual who has learned to be a track athlete, can learn to move more quickly as a football player. This introduces a basic principle of psychological behaviorism, that human behavior is learned cumulatively. Learning one repertoire enables the individual to learn other repertoires that enable the individual to learn additional repertoires, and on and on. Cumulative learning is a unique human characteristic. It has taken humans from chipping hand axes to flying to the moon, learned repertoires that enable the learning of new repertoires that enable the learning of new repertoires in an endless fashion of achievement.

That theory development enables psychological behaviorism to deal with types of human behavior. Out of the reach of radical behaviorism, for example, personality.

===Description&lt;!--'Behavioral repertoire' redirects here--&gt;===

Staats proposes that radical behaviorism is insufficient, because in his view psychology needs to unify traditional knowledge of human behavior with behaviorism. He has called that behaviorizing psychology in a way that enables psychological behaviorism to deal with topics not usually dealt with in behaviorism, such as personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/ |title=Behaviorism (Stanford Encyclopedia  of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, personality consists of three huge and complex '''behavioral repertoires'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;:&lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;
* sensory-motor repertoire, including basic sensory-motor abilities, as well as attentional and social skills;
* language-cognitive repertoire, including receptive [[language]], expressive language, and receptive-expressive language;
* emotional-motivational repertoire, including positive and negative patterns of emotional reaction directing the whole behavior of the person.

The infant begins life without the basic behavioral repertoires. They are acquired through complex learning, and as this occurs, the child becomes able to respond appropriately to various situations.&lt;ref name="holth" /&gt;

Whereas at the beginning learning involves only basic conditioning, as repertories are acquired the child's learning improves, being aided by the repertoires that are already functional. The way a person experiences the world depends on his/her repertoires. The individual's environment to the present results in learning a basic behavioral repertoire (BBR). The individual's [[behavior]] is function of the life situation and the individual's BBR. The BBRs are both a dependent and an independent variable, as they result from learning and cause behavior,  constituting the individual's personality. According to this theory, biological conditions of  learning are essential. Biology provides the mechanisms for learning and performance of behavior.  For example, a severely brain-damaged child will not learn BBRs in a normal manner.

According to Staats, the biological organism is the mechanism by which the environment produces  learning that results in basic behavioral repertoires which constitute personality. In turn,  these repertoires, once acquired, are modifying the brain's biology, through the creation of new  neural connections. Organic conditions affect behavior through affecting learning, basic  repertoires, and sensory processes. The effect of environment on behavior can be proximal,  here-and-now, or distal, through memory and personality.&lt;ref name="holth"/&gt; Thus, biology  provides the mechanism, learning and environment provide the content of behavior and personality.  Creative behavior is explained by novel combinations of behaviors elicited by new, complex  environmental situations. The [[self (psychology)|self]] is the individual's perception of  his/her behavior, situation, and organism. Personality, situation, and the interaction between  them are the three main forces explaining behavior. The world acts upon the person, but the  person also acts both on the world, and on him/herself.

===Methods===
The methodology of psychological behavioral theory contains techniques of assessment and therapy  specially designed for the three behavioral repertoires:
* classical [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] techniques;
* [[language]]-[[cognitive]] techniques (verbal association, verbal imitation, and  verbal-writing);
* [[emotion]]al-[[motivational]] techniques (the [[Child time-out|time-out]] technique).&lt;ref  name="rfs"/&gt;

==The paradigm==

===Psychology and behaviorism===

Watson named the approach ''behaviorism'' as a form of revolution against the then prevalent use of introspection to study the mind. Introspection was subjective and variable, not a source of objective evidence, and the mind consisted of an inferred entity that could never be observed. He insisted psychology had to be based on objective observation of behavior and the objective observation of the environmental events that cause behavior. [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]]’s radical behaviorism also has not established a systematic relationship to traditional psychology knowledge.

Psychological behaviorism—while bolstering Watson’s rejection of inferring the existence of internal entities such as mind, personality, maturation stages, and free will—considers important knowledge produced by non-behavioral psychology that can be objectified by analysis in learning-behavioral terms. As one example, the concept of intelligence is inferred, not observed, and thus intelligence and intelligence tests are not considered systematically in behaviorism. However, PB considers IQ tests measure important behaviors that predict later school performance and intelligence is composed of learned repertoires of such behaviors. Joining the knowledge of behaviorism and intelligence testing yields concepts and research concerning what intelligence is behaviorally, what causes intelligence, as well as how intelligence can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Staats | first1 = Arthur W. | last2 = Burns | first2 = G. Leonard | year = 1982 | title = Emotional personality repertoire as cause of behavior: Specification of personality and interaction principles | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 873–881 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.43.4.873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus a behaviorism that systematically incorporates and explains, behaviorally, empirical parts of psychology.

===Basic principles===

The different behaviourisms also differ with respect to basic principles. Skinner contributed greatly in separating Pavlov’s classical conditioning of emotion responses and operant conditioning of motor behaviors. Staats, however, notes that food was used by Pavlov to elicit a positive emotional response in his classical conditioning and Thorndike [[Edward Thorndike]] used food as the reward (reinforcer) that strengthened a motor response in what came to be called operant conditioning, thus emotion-eliciting stimuli are also reinforcing stimuli.&lt;ref name="SocialBehaviorism" /&gt; Watson, although the father of behaviorism, did not develop and research a basic theory of the principles of conditioning. The behaviorists whose work centered on that development treated differently the relationship of the two types of conditioning. Skinner’s basic theory was advanced in recognizing two different types of conditioning, but he didn’t recognize their interrelatedness, or the importance of classical conditioning, both very central for explaining human behavior and human nature.

Staats’ basic theory specifies the two types of conditioning and the principles of their relationship. Since Pavlov used a food stimulus to elicit an emotional response and Thorndike used food as a reward (reinforcer) to strengthen a particular motor response, whenever food is used both types of conditioning thus take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Arthur W.|title=Positive and Negative Reinforcer: How About the Second and Third Functions?|journal=Behavior Analyst|year=2006|volume=29|pages=271–272|pmc=2223154|pmid=22478469|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that food both elicits a positive emotion and food will serve as a positive reinforcer (reward). It also means that any stimulus that is paired with food will come to have those two functions. Psychological behaviorism and Skinner’s behaviorism both consider operant conditioning a central explanation of human behavior, but PB additionally concerns emotion and classical conditioning.

===Language===

This difference between the two behaviorisms can be seen clearly in their theories of language. Staats, extending prior theory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mowrer|first=Orval|title=American Psychologist|quote=The Psychologist Looks at Language|year=1954|volume=9|pages=660–694|doi=10.1037/h0062737|journal=American Psychologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osgood|first=Charles E.|title=Method and theory in experimental psychology|year=1953|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=0195010086}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that a large number of words elicit either a positive or negative emotional response because of prior classical conditioning. As such they should transfer their emotional response to anything with which they are paired. PB provides evidence this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Arthur|author2=Saats, Carolyn |title=Attitudes established by classical conditioning.|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |year=1959|volume=57 | issue = 1 |pages=37–40|doi=10.1037/h0042782}}&lt;/ref&gt; PB’s basic learning theory also states that emotional words have two additional functions. They will serve as rewards and punishments in learning other behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finley|first=Judson R.|author2=Staats, Arthur W. |title=Evaluative meaning words as reinforcing stimuli|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1967|volume=6|issue=2|pages=193–197|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(67)80094-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they also serve to elicit either approach or avoidance behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Arthur W.|author2=Warren, Don R. |title=Motivation and the three-function learning: Food deprivation and approach-avoidance to food words.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1974|volume=103|issue=6|pages=1191–1199|doi=10.1037/h0037417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, (1) hearing that people of an ethnic group are dishonest will condition a negative emotion to the name of that group as well as to members of that group, (2) complimenting (saying positive emotional words to) a person for a performance will increase the likelihood the person will perform that action later on, and (3) seeing the sign RESTAURANT will elicit a positive emotion in a hungry driver and thus instigate turning into the restaurant’s parking lot. Each case depends upon words eliciting an emotional response.

PB treats various aspects of language, from its original development in children to its role in intelligence and in abnormal behavior,&lt;ref name="Staats 1968a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1968b"&gt;Staats, Arthur W.

===Child development===

Much of the research on which PB is based has concerned children’s learning. For example, there is a series of studies of the first learning of reading with preschoolers &lt;ref&gt;Staats, Arthur W.; Brewer, Barbara A.; Gross, Michael C. (1970).

Staats began studies to analyze cases of important human behaviors in basic and applied ways in 1954. In 1958 he analyzed dyslexia and introduced his token reinforcer system (later called the token economy) along with his teaching method and materials for treating the disorder. When his daughter Jenny was born in 1960 he began to study and to produce her language, emotional, and sensory-motor development. When she was a year and a half old he began teaching her number concepts, and then reading six months later, using his token reinforcer system, as he recorded on audiotape. Films were made in 1966 of Staats being interviewed about his conception of how variations in children’s home learning variously prepared them for school on the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVouEJ1B9io first of three Arthur Staats YouTube videos]. Following that the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YLOGiMe9U8 second Staats YouTube video] records him beginning teaching his three-year-old son with the reading learning (and counting) method he developed in 1962 with his daughter. This film also shows a graduate assistant working with a culturally deprived four-year-old learning reading and writing numbers and counting, participating voluntarily. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0gqlbwwtw Staats YouTube video number 3] has additional cases of these usually delayed children voluntarily learning much ahead of time these cognitive repertoires that prepare them for school. This group of 11 children gained an average of 11 points in IQ and advanced significantly on a child development measure as they also learned to like the learning situation. Staats published the first study in this series in 1962 and describes his later studies and his more general conception in his 1963 book. This research, that included work with his own children from birth on, was the basis for Staats’ books &lt;ref name="rfs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1971" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SocialBehaviorism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 2012" /&gt; specifying the importance of the parents' early training of the child in language and other cognitive repertoires. He shows they are the foundations for being intelligent and doing well on entering school. There are new studies showing that parents who talk to their children more have children with advanced language development, school success, and intelligence measures. These statistical studies should be joined with Staats’ work with individual children that shows the specifics of the learning involved and how to best produce it. The two together show powerfully the importance of early child learning.

Staats also applied his approach in fathering his own children and employed his findings in constructing conception of human behavior and human nature.&lt;ref name="Staats 1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1968b"/&gt; He deals with many aspects of child development, from babbling to walking to discipline and time-out, and he considers parents one of his audiences.&lt;ref name="Staats 1971"/&gt; In the last of his books he summarizes his theory of child development. His position is that children are the young of the human species that has a body that can make an infinity of different behaviors. The human species also has a nervous system and brain of 100 billion neurons that can learn in marvelous complexity. The child’s development consists of the learning of repertoires, extraordinarily complex, like a language-cognitive repertoire, an emotional-motivational repertoire, and a sensory-motor repertoire, each including sub-repertoires of various kinds. The child’s behavior, in the various life situations encountered, depend upon the repertoires that have been learned. The child’s ability to learn in the variety of situations encountered also depends on the repertoires that have been learned. This conception makes parenting central in the child's development, supported by many studies in behavior analysis, and offers knowledge to parents in raising their children.

===Personality===

Staats &lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt; describes humans great variability in behavior, across different people. Those individual differences are consistent in different life situations and typify people. Those differences also tend to run in families. Such phenomena have led to the concept of personality as some internal trait that is inherited that strongly determines individuals’ characteristic ways of behaving. Personality conceived in that way remains an inference, based on how people behave, but with no evidence of what personality is.

More successful has been the measurement of personality. There are tests of intelligence for example. No internal organ of intelligence has been found, and no genes either. But intelligence tests have been constructed that predict (helpfully but not perfectly) the performance of children in school. Children who have the behaviors measured on the tests display better learning behaviors in the classroom. Although such tests have been widely applied radical behaviorism has not invested in the study of personality or personality testing.

Psychological behaviorism (e.g.&lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt;) however considers it important to study what personality is, how personality determines behavior, what causes personality, as well as what personality tests measure. Tests (including intelligence tests) are considered to measure different repertoires of behavior that individuals have learned. The individual in life situations also displays behaviors that have been learned. That is why personality tests can predict how people will behave. That means also that tests can be used to identify important human behaviors, and the learning that produces those behaviors can be studied. Gaining that knowledge will make it possible to develop environmental experiences that produce or prevent  types of personality from developing. A study has shown,&lt;ref name="IntelligenceIS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staats|first=Arthur W.|author2=Burns, G. Leonard |title=Intelligence and child development: What intelligence is and how it is learned and functions|journal=Genetic Psychology Monographs|year=1981|volume=104|pages=237–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, that in learning to write letters of the alphabet children learn repertoires that make them more intelligent.

===Abnormal personality===

Psychological behaviorism’s theory of abnormal personality rejects the concept of mental illness. Rather behavior disorders are composed of learned repertoires of abnormal behavior. Behavior disorders also involve not having learned basic repertoires that are needed in adjusting to life's demands. Severe autism can involve not having learned a language repertoire as well as having learned tantrums and other abnormal repertoires.&lt;ref name="Staats 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur W. Staats|title=Behavior and Personality: Psychological Behaviorism|year=1996|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PB’s theories of various behavior disorders &lt;ref Name="Staats 2012"/&gt; employ the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=DSM-IV-TR : diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.|year=2000|publisher=AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC)|location=United States|isbn=0890420254|edition=4TH ED.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (DSM) descriptions of both abnormal repertoires and the absence of normal repertoires. Psychological behaviorism provides the framework for an approach to clinical treatment of behavior disorders, as shown in the field of behavior analysis.&lt;ref name="Staats 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IntelligenceIS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staats, Arthur W. (2003). "A psychological behaviorism theory of personality." In Millon, Theodore; Learner, Melvin J. (Eds.), Handbook of psychology [italics here]. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-38404-6}} pp 135-158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Staats | first1 = A.

Homewood, IL: Dorsey Press. {{ISBN|0256015376}}&lt;/ref&gt; PB theory also indicates how behavior disorders can be prevented by preventing the abnormal learning conditions that produce them.

===Education===

The PB theory is that child development, besides its physical growth, consists of the learning of repertoires some of which are basic in the sense they provide the behaviors for many life situations and also they determine what and how well the individual can learn. That theory states that humans are unique in having a building type of learning, [[cumulative learning]], in which basic repertoires enable the child to learn other repertoires that enable the learning of other repertoires. Learning language, for example, enables the child to learn various other repertoires, like reading, number concepts, and grammar. Those repertoires provide the bases for learning other repertoires. For example, reading ability, opens the possibilities for an individual to do things and learn things that a non-reader cannot.

With that theory, and with its empirical methodology, PB applies to education.

New York: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Darwin gathered imposing evidence showing the evolution of physical characteristics of species his view that behavioral characteristics (such as human intelligence) also evolved was pure assumption with no evidentiary support PB presents a different theory, that the cumulative learning of pre-human hominins drove human evolution. That explains the consistent increase in brain size over the course of human evolution. That occurred because the members of the evolving hominin species were continually learning new language, emotion-motivation, and sensory-motor repertoires. That meant the new generations had to learn those ever more complex repertoires. It was cumulative learning that consistently created the selection device for the members of those generations that had the larger brains and were the better learners.

That theory makes learning ability central in human origin, selecting who would survive and reproduce, until the advent of Homo sapiens where all individuals (except if damaged) have full brains and full learning ability.&lt;ref Name="Staats 2012"/&gt;

===Theory levels===

Psychological behaviorism is set forth as an overarching theory, constructed of multiple theories in various areas. Staats considers it a unified theory. The areas are related, their principles consistent, and they are advanced consistently, composing levels from basic to increasingly advanced. Its most basic level calls for a systematic study of the biology of the learning “organs” and their evolutionary development, from species like amoeba that have no learning ability to humans that have the most. The basic learning principles constitute another level of theory, as do the human learning principles that specify cumulative learning. How the principles work—in areas like child development, personality, abnormal personality, clinical treatment, education, and human evolution—compose additional levels of study.&lt;ref Name="Staats 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staats 1975" /&gt; Staats sees the overarching theory of PB as basic for additional levels that compose the social sciences of sociology, linguistics, political science, anthrology, and paleoanthropology. He criticizes the disunification of the sciences that study human behavior and human nature. Because they are disconnected, they do not build a related, simpler and more understandable conception and scientific endeavor as, for example, the biological sciences do.&lt;ref name="Disunity" /&gt; This philosophy of science of unification is at one with Staats’ attempt to construct his unified psychological behaviorism.

===Projections===

Psychological behaviorism’s works project new basic and applied science at its various theory levels. The basic principles level, as one example, needs to study systematically the relationship of the classical conditioning of emotional responses and the operant conditioning of motor responses. As another projection, the field of child development should focus on the study of the learning of the basic repertoires. One essential is the systematic detailed study of the learning experiences of children in the home from birth on. He says such research could be accomplished by installing cameras in the homes of volunteering, remunerated families. This research should also be done to discover how such learning produces both normal and abnormal personality development. As another example, PB also calls for educational research into how school learning could be advanced using its methods and theories. Also, Staats' theory of human evolution is seen to call for research and theory developments.&lt;ref Name="Staats 2012"/&gt;

'''Quantity''' is a property that can exist as a [[Counting|multitude]] or [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]. Quantities can be compared in terms of "more", "less", or "equal", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic [[Class (philosophy)|classes]] of things along with [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]], [[Substance theory|substance]], [[change (mathematics)|change]], and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. 

Two basic divisions of quantity, magnitude and multitude, imply the principal distinction between continuity ([[continuum (theory)|continuum]]) and [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]].

Under the name of multitude comes what is discontinuous and discrete and divisible ultimately into indivisibles, such as: ''army, fleet, flock, government, company, party, people, mess (military), chorus, crowd'', and ''number''; all which are cases of [[collective nouns]]. Under the name of magnitude comes what is continuous and unified and divisible only into smaller divisibles, such as: ''matter, mass, energy, liquid, material''—all cases of non-collective nouns.

Along with analyzing its nature and classification, the issues of quantity involve such closely related topics as the relation of magnitudes and multitudes, dimensionality, equality, proportion, the measurements of quantities, the units of measurements, number and numbering systems, the types of numbers and their relations to each other as numerical ratios.

Thus quantity is a property that exists in a range of magnitudes or multitudes. [[Mass]], [[time]], [[distance]], [[heat]], and angular separation are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties.

==Background==
In mathematics, the concept of quantity is an ancient one extending back to the time of [[Aristotle]] and earlier. Aristotle regarded quantity as a fundamental ontological and scientific category. In Aristotle's [[ontology]], quantity or quantum was classified into two different types, which he characterized as follows:

:'Quantum' means that which is divisible into two or more constituent parts, of which each is by nature a 'one' and a 'this'. A quantum is a plurality if it is numerable, a magnitude if it is measurable. 'Plurality' means that which is divisible potentially into non-continuous parts, magnitude that which is divisible into continuous parts; of magnitude, that which is continuous in one dimension is length; in two breadth, in three depth. Of these, limited plurality is number, limited length is a line, breadth a surface, depth a solid. (Aristotle, book v, chapters 11-14, Metaphysics).

In his [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']], [[Euclid]] developed the theory of ratios of magnitudes without studying the nature of magnitudes, as Archimedes, but giving the following significant definitions:

:A magnitude is a ''part'' of a magnitude, the less of the greater, when it measures the greater; A ''ratio'' is a sort of relation in respect of size between two magnitudes of the same kind.

For Aristotle and Euclid, relations were conceived as [[Integer|whole numbers]] (Michell, 1993). [[John Wallis]] later conceived of ratios of magnitudes as [[real numbers]] as reflected in the following:

:When a comparison in terms of ratio is made, the resultant ratio often [namely with the exception of the 'numerical genus' itself] leaves the genus of quantities compared, and passes into the numerical genus, whatever the genus of quantities compared may have been. (John Wallis, ''Mathesis Universalis'')

That is, the ratio of magnitudes of any quantity, whether volume, mass, heat and so on, is a number. Following this, [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton]] then defined number, and the relationship between quantity and number, in the following terms: "By ''number'' we understand not so much a multitude of unities, as the abstracted ratio of any quantity to another quantity of the same kind, which we take for unity" (Newton, 1728).

==Quantitative structure==
Continuous quantities possess a particular structure that was first explicitly characterized by [[Otto Hölder|Hölder]] (1901) as a set of axioms that define such features as ''identities'' and ''relations'' between magnitudes. In science, quantitative structure is the subject of [[Empirical research|empirical investigation]] and cannot be assumed to exist ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' for any given property. The linear [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] represents the prototype of continuous quantitative structure as characterized by Hölder (1901) (translated in Michell &amp; Ernst, 1996). A fundamental feature of any type of quantity is that the relationships of equality or inequality can in principle be stated in comparisons between particular magnitudes, unlike quality, which is marked by likeness, similarity and difference, diversity. Another fundamental feature is additivity. Additivity may involve concatenation, such as adding two lengths A and B to obtain a third A + B. Additivity is not, however, restricted to extensive quantities but may also entail relations between magnitudes that can be established through experiments that permit tests of hypothesized [[observable]] manifestations of the additive relations of magnitudes. Another feature is continuity, on which Michell (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;51) says of length, as a type of quantitative attribute, "what continuity means is that if any arbitrary length, a, is selected as a unit, then for every positive real number, ''r'', there is a length b such that b = ''r''a". A further generalization is given by the [[theory of conjoint measurement]], independently developed by French economist [[Gérard Debreu]] (1960) and by the American mathematical psychologist [[R. Duncan Luce]] and statistician [[John Tukey]] (1964).

==Quantity in mathematics==
{{Confusing|section|date=March 2012}}
Magnitude (how much) and multitude (how many), the two principal types of quantities, are further divided as mathematical and physical. In formal terms, quantities—their ratios, proportions, order and formal relationships of equality and inequality—are studied by mathematics. The essential part of mathematical quantities consists of having a collection of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], each assuming a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of values. These can be a set of a single quantity, referred to as a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] when represented by real numbers, or have multiple quantities as do [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] and [[tensor]]s, two kinds of geometric objects.

The mathematical usage of a quantity can then be varied and so is situationally dependent. Quantities can be used as being [[infinitesimal]], [[Argument of a function|arguments of a function]], variables in an [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]] (independent or dependent), or probabilistic as in random and [[stochastic]] quantities. In mathematics, magnitudes and multitudes are also not only two distinct kinds of quantity but furthermore relatable to each other.

[[Number theory]] covers the topics of the [[continuous and discrete variables|discrete quantities]] as numbers: number systems with their kinds and relations. [[Geometry]] studies the issues of spatial magnitudes: straight lines, curved lines, surfaces and solids, all with their respective measurements and relationships.

A traditional [[philosophy of mathematics]], stemming from [[Aristotle]] and remaining popular until the eighteenth century, held that mathematics is the "science of quantity". Quantity was considered to be divided into the discrete (studied by arithmetic) and the continuous (studied by geometry and later [[calculus]]). The theory fits reasonably well elementary or school mathematics but less well the abstract topological and algebraic structures of modern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''An Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics'', Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, 2014, pp. 31-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantity in physical science==
{{main|Physical quantity}}

Establishing quantitative structure and relationships ''between'' different quantities is the cornerstone of modern physical sciences. Physics is fundamentally a quantitative science. Its progress is chiefly achieved due to rendering the abstract qualities of material entities into physical quantities, by postulating that all material bodies marked by quantitative properties or physical dimensions are subject to some measurements and observations. Setting the units of measurement, physics covers such fundamental quantities as space (length, breadth, and depth) and time, mass and force, temperature, energy, and [[quantum|quanta]].

A distinction has also been made between [[intensive quantity]] and [[extensive quantity]] as two types of quantitative property, state or relation. The magnitude of an ''intensive quantity'' does not depend on the size, or extent, of the object or system of which the quantity is a property, whereas magnitudes of an ''extensive quantity'' are additive for parts of an entity or subsystems. Thus, magnitude does depend on the extent of the entity or system in the case of extensive quantity. Examples of intensive quantities are [[density]] and [[pressure]], while examples of extensive quantities are [[energy]], [[volume]], and [[mass]].

==Quantity in natural language==
In human languages, including [[English language|English]], [[grammatical number|number]] is a [[syntactic category]], along with [[person]] and [[gender]]. The quantity is expressed by identifiers, definite and indefinite, and [[Quantifier_(linguistics)|quantifiers]], definite and indefinite, as well as by three types of [[noun]]s: 1. count unit nouns or countables; 2. [[mass nouns]], uncountables, referring to the indefinite, unidentified amounts; 3. nouns of multitude ([[collective noun]]s). The word ‘number’ belongs to a noun of multitude standing either for a single entity or for the individuals making the whole. An amount in general is expressed by a special class of words called identifiers, indefinite and definite and quantifiers, definite and indefinite.{{clarify|date=October 2017}} The amount may be expressed by: singular form and plural from, ordinal numbers before a count noun singular (first, second, third...), the demonstratives; definite and indefinite numbers and measurements (hundred/hundreds, million/millions), or cardinal numbers before count nouns. The set of language quantifiers covers "a few, a great number, many, several (for count names); a bit of, a little, less, a great deal (amount) of, much (for mass names); all, plenty of, a lot of, enough, more, most, some, any, both, each, either, neither, every, no". For the complex case of unidentified amounts, the parts and examples of a mass are indicated with respect to the following: a measure of a mass (two kilos of rice and twenty bottles of milk or ten pieces of paper); a piece or part of a mass (part, element, atom, item, article, drop); or a shape of a container (a basket, box, case, cup, bottle, vessel, jar).

==Further examples==
Some further examples of quantities are:

* 1.76 litres ([[liter]]s) of milk, a continuous quantity
* 2''πr'' metres, where ''r'' is the length of a [[radius]] of a [[circle]] expressed in metres (or meters), also a continuous quantity
* one apple, two apples, three apples, where the number is an integer representing the count of a denumerable collection of objects (apples)
* 500 people (also a count)
* a ''couple'' conventionally refers to two objects
* ''a few'' usually refers to an indefinite, but usually small number, greater than one.
* ''quite a few'' also refers to an indefinite, but surprisingly (in relation to the context) large number.
* ''several'' refers to an indefinite, but usually small, number - usually indefinitely greater than "a few".
* OPEC has a few members

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">The '''rain-out model''' is a [[Scientific modelling|model]] of [[planetary science]] that describes the first stage of [[planetary differentiation]] and [[core (geology)|core]] formation. According to this model, a [[Planet|planetary body]] is assumed to be composed primarily of [[silicate mineral]]s and [[NiFe]] (i.e. a mixture of [[nickel]] and [[iron]]). If temperatures within this body reach about 1500&amp;nbsp;K, the minerals and the metals will melt. This will produce an [[emulsion]] in which globules of liquid NiFe are dispersed in a [[magma]] of liquid silicates, the two being [[immiscible]]. Because the NiFe globules are denser than the silicates, they will sink under the influence of gravity to the centre of the planetary body—in effect, the globules of metal will "rain out" from the emulsion to the centre, forming a core.

According to the rain-out model, core formation was a relatively rapid process, taking a few dozen millennia to reach completion. This occurred at the end of a lengthy process in which the planets were assembled from colliding [[planetary embryo]]s. Only the collisions of such large embryos could generate enough heat to melt entire bodies. Furthermore, it was only after all of the iron and nickel delivered by impacting bodies had arrived that core formation could proceed to completion.

However, this process of core formation was preceded by a long period of partial differentiation, in which some of the nickel and iron within the planetary embryos had begun to separate.

The rain-out model can be invoked to explain core formation in all the [[terrestrial planet]]s, given that these consist primarily of silicates, nickel and iron. It can also be adapted to account for core formation in smaller bodies composed of [[volatiles|ices]] and silicates. In such a case, it would be the denser silicates which would rain out to form a rocky core, while the volatile components would form an icy mantle.

The '''reasonable person model''' ('''RPM''') is a psychological framework which argues that people are at their best when their informational needs are met. Positing that unreasonableness is not a human trait, but rather the result of environment (context and circumstances), the RPM attempts to define the environments/actions that foster reasonableness,  defining three key areas that assist with this: model building, being effective, and meaningful action.

The RPM was developed by environmental psychologists [[Rachel and Stephen Kaplan|Stephen and Rachel Kaplan]] and integrates principles from [[environmental psychology|environmental]], [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Reasonable Person Model Diagram 2.png|alt=RPM Diagram|thumb|RPM diagram (&amp;copy; 2011, Rachel Kaplan)]]
The RPM is a psychological framework that posits human functioning is improved when the following three domains of informational needs are met:&lt;ref name="Kaplan2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01010.x | volume = 22 | pages = 826–829 | last = Kaplan | first = Rachel | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Stephen | title = Bringing out the best in people: A psychological perspective | journal = Conservation Biology | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Model building''' –  RPM posits that a central informational need is to build [[mental model]]s (also known as [[cognitive map]]s) in order to function effectively in the world. It suggests that mental models help people recognize objects and circumstances, predict and evaluate possible future outcomes and decide on actions.
* '''Being effective''' – This focuses on helping people utilize knowledge effectively by developing the necessary skills, also maintaining a clear head in order to function effectively.
* '''Meaningful action''' – RPM suggests that people wish to use their skills to make a difference, meaning they wish to be listened to and be given opportunities to participate.

RPM states that an environment or context supportive of informational needs can foster reasonable behavior that will "bring out the best in people".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2008"/&gt;

==Conceptualizing reasonableness==
The use of the term ''reasonable'' in RPM has commonalities and differences with the colloquial use of the word. In RPM, reasonableness refers to the ways in which "one would hope people behave".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 56 | pages = 491–508 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | title = Human nature and environmentally responsible behavior | journal = Journal of Social Issues | date = 2000 | doi = 10.1111/0022-4537.00180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is partially conveyed by what it is not, unreasonable states such as incivility, aggression, irritability and impatience. Examples may also include "...demanding fairness for oneself while denying it to others, displaying intolerance and disrespect for others, willingness to harm or kill because of differences in beliefs, and attempting to extract the earth’s resources for personal gain without regard for the needs of future generations".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2009"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jenvp.2008.10.005 | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 329–339 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Rachel | title = Creating a larger role for environmental psychology: The Reasonable Person Model as an integrative framework | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison to theories on rationality ===
The RPM may be viewed as a contrary theory to [[Homo economicus|rational man theory]] (also known as [[Homo economicus|Homo Economicus]]) or related [[rational choice theory]], in that it describes a landscape of mutual dependencies, such as the manner in which people treat one another. RPM assumes that information is often misunderstood, overwhelming, and unavailable. It also assumes that people are not interested in maximizing personal gain, but rather [[satisficing]]. RPM further asserts that people often have multiple concerns which cannot be reduced to a single monetary value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cornell University Press | last = Midgley | first = Mary | title = Beast and Man: Roots of Human Nature | date = 1978 |isbn = 0203626508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison to subjective well-being ===
Reasonableness shares some themes with [[subjective well-being]], including emphasis on positive/negative affect and quality of life. However, whereas SWB addresses self-directed feelings, RPM also considers the contexts that foster civil behavior and improve relationships between people.&lt;ref name="Basu2014"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Edward Elgar | editors = Timo J.

==Model building==
The world, as [[William James]] described it, is a "blooming buzzing confusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Principles of Psychology|last = James|first = William|publisher = Dover|year = 1890|isbn = 0-486-20381-6|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mental models are neural structures, made of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s, that organize our experiences into a usable form and allow us to
#[[Object Recognition in Cognitive Neuroscience|recognize objects]], situations, and other patterns,
#predict possible future outcomes,
#evaluate those outcomes offline, and
#take appropriate action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Aldine | pages = 63–78 | editors = R. M. Downs, D.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the organism carries a “small-scale model” of external reality and of its own possible actions within its head, it is able to try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situations before they arise, utilize the knowledge of past events in dealing with the present and future, and in every way to react in a much fuller, easier, and more competent manner to the emergencies which face it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of Explanation|last = Craik|first = Kenneth J. W.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1943|isbn = 9780521094450|location = London|pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mechanisms of model building ===
Mental models are built through repetition, variation, and association. Experiencing something multiple times is said to lead to an [[Mental representation|internal representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Ulrich's Press | isbn = 0030623448 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Rachel | title = Cognition and environment: functioning in an uncertain world | location = Ann Arbor, MI | date = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing sequences of things [[Association (psychology)|associates]] our internal representations in a mental map according to how those things occur in reality. [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb's]] [[Hebbian theory|rule]] put it as: Things that fire together, wire together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Organization of Behavior|last = Hebb|first = Donald O.|publisher =Wiley &amp; Sons |year =1949 |isbn = |location =New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Being effective==
This refers to the skills needed over and above basic knowledge to accomplish goals and refers to a state of mind that is capable of attending to and managing information. Lack of clearheadedness is described within [[attention restoration theory]], which states there are two attentional systems: one for attending to naturally fascinating stimuli and another that allows us to intentionally direct our attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = |title = The restorative benefits of nature: toward an integrative frame-work |last = Kaplan|first = Stephen|date = 1995|journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/0272-4944(95)90001-2|pmid = |volume = 15|pages = 169–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Louv]]'s notion of [[nature deficit disorder]] describes some of the symptoms associated with a younger generation who do not spend time outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Last Child in the Woods|last = Louv|first = Richard|publisher =Algonquin Books |year =2005 |isbn =9781565126053 |location =Chapel Hill |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaningful action==
RPM's third domain argues that people have a desire to use their knowledge and skills to make a difference. Fewer people have work that is directly connected to their survival yet the evolutionary desire to make a difference remains. The inability to do so can lead to [[learned helplessness]] and feeling hopeless and alone in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.  Such a state is not amenable to effective human functioning, yet there continues to be, as Kaplan describes, a "pervasive malaise of helplessness".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2000" /&gt; Goldschmidt described what he termed The Human Career as: one in which humans are primarily seeking the respect of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Human Career: The self in the symbolic world|last = Goldschmidt|first = Walter|authorlink1=Walter Goldschmidt|publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1990|isbn = |location = Cambridge, MA, USA|pages = |publication-place = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that, in participatory contexts, the most effective strategies are ones that help people feel like they can make a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Environmental Locus of Control, Sympathy, and Proenvironmental Behavior A Test of Geller’s Actively Caring Hypothesis|last = Allen|first = James B.|date = 1999|journal = Environment and Behavior|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/00139169921972137|pmid = |last2 = Ferrand|first2 = Jennifer L.|volume = 31|issue = 3|pages = 338–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sante Monachesi''' (1910-1991), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] belonging to the modern movement of the ''[[Scuola romana]] (Roman School)'' and founder in 1932 of the ''Movimento Futurista nelle Marche ([[Futurism|Futurist]] Movement of [[Marche]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[:it:Emilio Villa|E. Villa]] ed., ''Sante Monachesi'', [[Rome]], 1970, Intro.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Monachesi studied at the ''[[Centro sperimentale di cinematografia|Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia]]'' (Experimental film centre or Italian National film school) in [[Rome]]. In the 1930s he embraced Futurism with spiralist and diagonal shapes both in painting and in sculpture, experimenting with [[aluminium]] in a mobile light.

An important representative of ''[[Aeropittura]]'' (Aeropainting), in 1936 he exhibited at [[Biennale di Venezia]] and in 1937 at the [[World Expo]] of [[Paris]].

Immediately after [[World War II]], Monachesi did [[expressionism|expressionist]] and [[fauve art|fauve]] painting, also as a member of the ''[[Scuola Romana]]'', becoming part of the group of "Balduina" with David Grazioso and Ferdinando Bellorini, but it was especially in [[plastic arts|plastic]] [[sculpture]] that his research became innovative. He explored new materials and compositions, and on the occasion of the [[Moon landing]], he founded the ''Agrà Movement'', a [[futurism|futurist]] current looking at these exalting successes of technology and thus expresses in artwork the absence of gravity, the [[Zero-G]] that by subtracting from bodies their terrestrial weight, proposes to free man and art from all conditioning.

Monachesi's pieces in coloured [[methacrylate]] are truly dynamic action-sculptures: "... the artist moulds the transparent and fluorescent perpex sheet, and succeeds in capturing and freeing the void of the full figure it circumscribes," (Floriano de Santis, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. S. Papetti, ed., ''Monachesi. Gli anni Quaranta e Cinquanta'' (Monachesi. The 1940s and 1950s), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Perspex and ''evelpiume'' introduce two new materials into Art: [[rubber foam]] and [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|polymethacrylate]], neglected by the contemporary [[Figurative art|figurative]] language until 1959.

Monachesi introduced "nomadic sculptures", where the artist ties and melts the foam sheet, continuously creating new forms and shapes. They were defined "primary forms of matter and cosmos" by art critic Franco Passoni,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Passoni, [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL4565352W/Art_and_plastics ''Art and plastics''], 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; well qualifies the [[Jesolo]] Exhibition of 1978, which Monachesi entitled ''To Tie &amp; To Dissolve''.

A '''self-defeating prophecy''' (''self-destroying'' or ''self-denying'' in some sources) is the complementary opposite of a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]; a prediction that prevents what it predicts from happening. This is also known as the '''prophet's dilemma'''.

A self-defeating prophecy can be the result of [[rebellion]] to the prediction. If the audience of a prediction has an interest in seeing it falsified, and its fulfillment depends on their actions or inaction, their actions upon hearing it will make the prediction less plausible. If a prediction is made with this outcome specifically in mind, it is commonly referred to as [[reverse psychology]] or warning. Also, when working to make a premonition come true, one can inadvertently change the circumstances so much that the prophecy cannot come true.

It is important to distinguish a self-defeating prophecy from a self-fulfilling prophecy that predicts a negative outcome. If a prophecy of a negative outcome is made, and that negative outcome is achieved as a result of [[positive feedback]], then it is a self-''fulfilling'' prophecy. For example, if a group of people decide they will not be able to achieve a goal and stop working towards the goal as a result, their prophecy was self-fulfilling. Likewise, if a prediction of a negative outcome is made, but the outcome is positive because of [[negative feedback]] resulting from the rebellion, then that is a self-''defeating'' prophecy.

==Examples==
* If an economic crisis is predicted then consumers, manufacturers and authorities will respond to avoid economic loss, breaking the chain of events that would lead to crisis.&lt;ref name="afters"&gt;{{cite book |title=Aftershocks: Economic Crisis and Institutional Choice |last=Hemerijck |first=Anton |author2=Ben Knapen |author3=Ellen van Doorne |year=2009 |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |isbn=9089641920 |page=259 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QPtfVA33ISgC |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The biblical prophet [[Jonah]] famously ran away and refused to deliver God's prophecy of [[Nineveh]]'s destruction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:2-3|HE}} from [[Book of Jonah]]&lt;/ref&gt; lest the inhabitants repent and cause God to forgive them and not destroy the city.  Indeed, when Jonah eventually does deliver the prophecy, the people do mend their ways and cause the prophecy not to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:4-10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Year 2000 problem]] was claimed to be an example of a self-defeating prophecy, in that fear of massive technology failures caused by computers' internal clocks "rolling over" encouraged the very changes needed to avoid those failures. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* Pre-announcing products in a way that discourages current sales (the [[Osborne effect]]) is also an example of a self-defeating prophecy.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''semigroupoid''' (also called '''semicategory''', '''naked category''' or '''precategory''') is a [[partial algebra]] that satisfies the axioms for a small&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tilson|first=Bret|title=Categories as algebra: an essential ingredient in the theory of monoids|journal=J. Pure Appl. Algebra|volume=48|year=1987|issue=1-2|pages=83–198|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(87)90108-3}}, Appendix B&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The q-Theory of Finite Semigroups|first1=John|last1=Rhodes|first2=Ben|last2=Steinberg|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9780387097817|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{citation|title=Semigroups, Algorithms, Automata and Languages|first=Gracinda M. S.|last=Gomes|publisher=World Scientific|year=2002|isbn=9789812776884|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IL58mAsfXOgC&amp;pg=PA41}}, which requires the objects of a semigroupoid to form a set.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Category (mathematics)|category]], except possibly for the requirement that there be an identity at each object. Semigroupoids generalise [[semigroup]]s in the same way that small categories generalise [[monoid]]s and [[groupoid]]s generalise [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. Semigroupoids have applications in the structural theory of semigroups.

Formally, a ''semigroupoid'' consists of:
* a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of things called ''objects''.
* for every two objects ''A'' and ''B'' a set Mor(''A'',''B'') of things called ''[[morphism]]s from A to B''. If ''f'' is in Mor(''A'',''B''), we write ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B''.
* for every three objects ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' a binary operation Mor(''A'',''B'') &amp;times; Mor(''B'',''C'') → Mor(''A'',''C'') called ''composition of morphisms''. The composition of ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' and ''g'' : ''B'' → ''C'' is written as ''g'' ∘ ''f'' or ''gf''. (Some authors write it as ''fg''.)

such that the following axiom holds:

* (associativity) if ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'', ''g'' : ''B'' → ''C'' and ''h'' : ''C'' → ''D'' then ''h'' ∘ (''g'' ∘ ''f'') = (''h'' ∘ ''g'') ∘ ''f''.

'''Shogi notation''' is the set of various abbreviatory notational systems used to describe the piece movements of a [[shogi]] game record or the positions of pieces on a shogi board.

A game record is called a 棋譜 ''[[kifu]]'' in Japanese.

==Recording moves==

=== Western notation ===

The system used in English language texts to express shogi moves was established by [[George Hodges (shogi)|George Hodges]] and Glyndon Townhill in 1976 by the second issue of ''Shogi'' magazine.{{sfn | Hodges | 1976}}{{efn | The notation system used by Hodges in the first issue of ''Shogi'' differs in a few aspects. Rather than indicate the destination square coordinates in captures, the piece being captured was indicated. For example, '''PxP''' indicated 'pawn captures pawn.' In ambiguity resolution, the origin square was enclosed in parentheses. For example, '''S(3c)-2b''' instead of '''S3c-2b'''. Moreover, since captures were notated with the captured piece, ambiguity resolution is required when multiple pieces of the same type are possible. Therefore, '''RxP(2f)''' or '''RxP(1e)''' would be required as the '''RxP''' notation would be ambiguous. Finally, promoted pieces were indicated with '''+''' suffixed to the piece initial enclosed in parentheses. For example, '''R(+)-7h''' instead of '''+R-7h'''. Changes were made to the first system in order to make it simpler and to avoid notation strings which were felt to be 'clumsy'. The first system also overlooked the need for an unpromotion indication.}} 
A slightly modified version was used in Hosking (1996). It is derived from the [[Algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation used for chess]], but differs in several respects.{{sfn | Fairbairn | 1986 | p=13–18}}{{sfn | Hosking | 1997 | p=20–21}} A typical move might be notated '''P86''' or '''P-8f'''. The notation format has the following 5 part structure:

:{| style='margin: 30px;'
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 1 
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 2
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 3 
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 4
! 5
|-
| style='padding-right: 55px; text-align: center;' | piece
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | (origin)
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | movement
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | destination
| (promotion)
|}

An example using all 5 parts is '''S72x83+''' or '''S7bx8c+'''. All parts are obligatory except for the ''origin'' and ''promotion'' parts. (Thus, most notation strings only contain 3 parts.) The ''origin'' part is only indicated when needed to resolve ambiguity. The ''promotion'' part is only needed when there is the possibility of promotion.

Western notation is not used in Japanese language texts, as it is no more concise than traditional notation with kanji and two ciphers which originated in the [[Edo period]].

====Piece====

The first letter represents the piece moved. For instance, '''P''' is for '''P'''awn. Below are the abbreviations used.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Abbreviation !! English Term !! Japanese
|-
| P || pawn || 歩
|-
| L || lance || 香
|-
| N || knight || 桂
|-
| S || silver || 銀
|-
| G || gold || 金
|-
| B || bishop || 角
|-
| R || rook || 飛
|-
| K || king || 玉/王
|}

Promoted pieces are indicated by a '''+''' preceding the letter. For example, '''+P''' is a promoted pawn (と ''tokin''), '''+R''' is a promoted rook (that is, a dragon 龍).

Some Japanese websites (such as [[81Dojo]]) and Japanese authors use two different abbreviations for the promoted rook and promoted bishop in a way more similar to Japanese notation. Thus, '''D''' (for ''dragon'') instead of '''+R''' and '''H''' (for ''horse'') instead of '''+B'''.

====Ambiguity resolution: Origin coordinates====

In cases where the moving piece is ambiguous, the starting square is added after the letter for the piece but before the movement indication.

For example, in diagrams below, Black has three golds which can move to square '''78'''. Thus, simply notating '''G-78''' is not enough to indicate the move. The three possible moves are distinguished via the origin specification as '''G77-78''', '''G68-78''', or '''G79-78'''.

====Movement type====

Following the abbreviation for the piece is a symbol for the type of move. There are 3 different indications:

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Notation Symbol !! Movement Type
|-
| '''-''' || simple movement
|-
| '''x''' || capture (opponent's piece)
|-
| '''*''' or '''’'''|| drop (your own piece)
|}

As examples, '''P-24''' indicates moving one's pawn to the 2d square (without capture), '''Px24''' indicates moving one's pawn to the 24 square and capturing the opponent's piece that was on 24, and '''P*24''' indicates dropping one's pawn in hand to the previously empty 24 square. (Note the '''x''' indication is a significant departure from Japanese notation, which has no way of signaling whether a piece was captured.)

There is some variation for the drop symbol. A '''*''' (asterisk) is often used, but some books (e.g. Hosking 1997) use a '''’''' (apostrophe) instead. Thus, Hosking '''B’56''' is equivalent to Hodges '''B*5f'''.{{efn | For comparison, the chess variant [[crazyhouse]] uses yet another symbol for dropped piece notation: the [[@]] symbol.}}

The simple movement indication (the hyphen '''-''') is not used by Hosking (1997) who does not use a movement symbol. Thus, Hosking '''P26''' is equivalent to Hodges '''P-2f'''.

====Destination coordinates====

After the movement piece indication is the square on which the piece lands. This is indicated by a numeral for the file (1–9) and the rank (1–9), with '''11''' being the top right corner from Black's perspective and '''99''' being the bottom left corner. This is based on Japanese notation conventions.

Hosking differs from Hodges in that Hosking uses numerals for the rank notation whereas Hodges uses letters (a–i) for the rank.

====Promotion status====

If a move entitles the player to promote, then a '''+''' is added to the end if the promotion was taken or an '''=''' if it was declined. For example, '''Nx73=''' indicates an unpromoted knight capturing on 73 without promoting while '''Nx73+''' indicates an unpromoted knight capturing on 73 and promoting. The promotion status is always omitted in situations where promotion is not possible. When promotion is possible, then the promotion status is obligatorily notated.

====Other conventions====

Game moves in western notation are always numbered (unlike Japanese game records). Additionally, what is numbered are pairs of two moves – the first move by Black, the second by White – instead of numbering each move by each player. This also differs from the Japanese system. For instance, three pairs of moves (or six individual moves) are numbered as '''1. P-76 P-34 2. P-26 P-44 3. S-48 S-32'''. However, in the British ''Shogi'' magazine of the 1970s and 1980s, the pair number convention was not used for [[tsumeshogi]] problems, in which case the each player's move is number just as in the Japanese notation conventions.

Following western chess conventions, omitted moves are indicated with an '''...''' ellipsis. As a consequence of the way moves are numbered in the western system, all moves by White are notated with an ellipsis prefix in texts. For example, '''...P-55''' indicates a move by White while '''P-55''' indicates a move by Black. In handicap games, White plays first, so Black's first move is replaced by an ellipsis. For example, '''1. ...G-32 2. P-76 G-72'''.

Unlike western chess, game states like check or checkmate are not typically notated. However, the use of question marks and exclamation points to indicate questionable and good moves, respectively, are occasionally used.

=== Japanese notation ===

[[File:ShogiJapaneseNotationInTsume.png|thumb|right|Japanese notation (shown on the left, listed vertically) accompanying a 15-move checkmate (''[[Tsumeshogi|tsume]]'') problem. Note the lack of numbered moves and the lack of both explicit dropped piece notation and capture notation. From the book 詰むや詰まざるや (''Tsumu ya tsumazaru ya'') (1975) by 伊藤宗看 (''Sōkan Itō'') [1706–1761], a shogi Meijin of the Edo period, and 門脇芳雄 (''Yoshio Kadowaki'').]]

The earliest way to indicate game records in Japan during the [[Edo period]] was to use descriptive sentences such as ''Open the bishop's diagonal, push the rook's pawn, close the bishop's diagonal'' and the like. Soon afterward, a notational system was developed which is mostly the same as what is used in the presentday in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current standard====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kifu325.jpg| thumb | Official game record log for the third game of the 2013 professional [[Ryu-oh]] tournament final between [[Akira Watanabe (shogi player)|Akira Watanabe]] and [[Toshiyuki Moriuchi]].]] --&gt;

In Japanese notation, the notation string has the following five-part format:{{sfn | Hosking | 1997 | p=263–265}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://81dojo.com/documents/Notation_System|title=Notation System - 81Dojo Docs|author=|date=|work=81Dojo.com|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shogi.or.jp/faq/kihuhyouki.html|title=棋譜の表記方法｜よくある質問｜日本将棋連盟|author=|date=|work=Shogi.or.jp|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical move is indicated like '''８六歩''' (equivalent to western P-86). An example that uses all five parts is '''☗８三銀引成''' (which could be either S72-83+ or S72x83+ in western notation). The player's side information is optional and the movement and promotion indications are only used in order to resolve ambiguity.

=====Player's side=====

It is common for the White (''gote'') and Black (''sente'') player to be indicated at the beginning of the notation string with either black and white triangles (▲/△) or shogi-piece-shaped pentagons (☗/☖) , such as '''▲７六歩△３四歩▲２六歩△３二金''' or '''☗７六歩☖３四歩☗２六歩☖３二金'''. However, this is not obligatory: several books notate shogi moves without explicit indication of which player is making the moves. (See the adjacent image for an example.) In such cases, knowing which player the move refers to can be determined by the context in the book. This white/black convention is more common when the moves are not numbered (which is also optional to notate).

=====Destination coordinates=====

For the board's coordinates, the file is indicated with an Arabic numeral followed by the rank indicated with a [[Japanese numeral]] (instead of an Arabic number or letter like in the western system). For example, square '''23''' in Japanese notation is '''２三'''.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Japanese numeral !! Japanese pronunciation !! Arabic equivalent 
|-
| 一 || ''ichi'' || １ 
|-
| 二 || ''ni'' || ２ 
|-
| 三 || ''san'' || ３ 
|-
| 四 || ''yon'' || ４ 
|-
| 五 || ''go'' || ５
|-
| 六 || ''roku'' || ６ 
|-
| 七 || ''nana'' || ７
|-
| 八 || ''hachi'' || ８
|-
| 九 || ''kyū'' || ９
|-
| 同 || ''dō'' or ''onajiku'' || (same) 
|}

Earlier (for instance, in the Edo period), only Japanese numerals were used.

There is also an abbreviatory convention: when a piece moves to the same coordinates as the previous move's piece (as in a capture), the position is simply indicated with '''同''' (which is pronounced ''dō'') instead of the file-rank coordinate numbers. For example, if Black's pawn moved to a square in which White's pawn captured Black's pawn and then both players' bishops recaptured followed by a rook recapture, this could be notated as '''☗２四歩 ☖同歩 ☗同角 ☖同角 ☗同飛''' which would be equivalent to the western notation sequence '''1. P-24 Px24, 2. Bx24 Bx24, 3. Rx24'''. An alternate symbol '''仝''' is used instead of '''同''' in older books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/861188?itemId=info:ndljp/pid/861188&amp;__lang=en NDL Digital Collections - 指将棋定跡集]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Note that the 仝 character is also sometimes used as an abbreviatory symbol for a promoted lance. See [[Shogi#Equipment|Shogi§Equipment]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to encounter Roman numerals for both the file and rank coordinates, such as ''' ☗２４歩''' instead of ''' ☗２四歩'''.

Also, since Japanese is often written vertically from top to bottom, the notation may be written vertically as well with the top number indicating the file and rank number below the file number. Finally, in older books of the Edo period, the notation may be written from right to left (as is the case with traditional vertical writing) even when the notation is written horizontally. However, this older practice is not used in the modern period, where horizontally writing is read from left to right following European language traditions. (See the 1839 game record image below for such an example.)

=====Piece=====

Pieces are indicated with kanji (instead of letters as in the western system). The piece's kanji follows the piece's board coordinates. The following symbols are used.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Japanese !! Western !! Japanese || Western
|-
| 歩 || P || と || +P
|-
| 香 || L || 成香 || +L
|-
| 桂 || N || 成桂 || +N
|-
| 銀 || S || 成銀 || +S
|-
| 角 || B || 馬 || +B
|-
| 飛 || R || 龍 || +R
|-
| 金 || G || 玉 || K
|-
| 合 || (n/a) || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|}

Promoted pieces are indicated with a '''成''' prefix except for the promoted pawn, promoted bishop, and promoted rook, which are '''と''', '''馬''', '''龍''', respectively. '''兵''' is used instead of '''歩''' in some older texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/861188?itemId=info:ndljp/pid/861188&amp;__lang=en|title=NDL Digital Collections - 指将棋定跡集|author=|date=|work=NDL.go.jp|access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[tsumeshogi]], the character '''合''' is used essentially as a [[Variable (computer science)|variable]] that represents a piece of any value.

=====Ambiguity resolution: Movement description=====

When there is ambiguity in piece movement, there is a complex system of movement description using the symbols below. The movement descriptors consist of (a) a dropped piece indicator, (b) movement toward destination indicators, and (c) movement origin indicators.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Movement notation !! Meaning
|-
| '''打''' || dropped
|-
| '''引''' || downward
|-
| '''寄''' || horizontally
|-
| '''上''' || upward
|-
| '''右''' || moving from right (going leftwards)
|-
| '''左''' || moving from left (going rightwards)
|-
| '''直''' || perpendicularly vertical (gold/silver only)
|-
| '''行''' || upward (dragon/horse)
|-
| '''入''' || upward (dragon/horse)
|}

The symbol for a dropped piece is '''打''' following the piece's character. In the usual course of a game, most dropped pieces will probably be unambiguous. In these unambiguous cases, explicit notation for the dropped piece is not required and usually omitted (unlike in western notation where the drop notation is obligatory). For example, a western notation such as '''P*23''' will be notated simply as '''２三歩''' instead of '''２三歩打'''. In other situations, there is a possibility that either a piece that is already in play on the board can move to a certain square or a piece of the same kind that is held in hand can be dropped to that square. In this case, when the piece on the board moves to that square, the notation simply notates the move as usual with no drop indication. However, when the piece in hand is dropped to that location, then the drop indication must be present in the notation in order to resolve the ambiguity. In other words, '''打''' is only used when the following two conditions are met: (i) a piece is dropped and (ii) there is ambiguity with another piece on the board.

For ambiguity resolution with pieces on the board, the main notation symbols are '''引''' for downward movement, '''寄''' for horizontal movement, and '''上''' for upward movement. Note that these three indicators describe movement toward their destination square.

In the example below, three golds can move to the ７八 (= 78) square. The gold that originates on ７七 (= 77) and moves down is notated as '''７八金引''' (= G77-78). The other two possibilities are notated as '''７八金寄''' (= G68-78) and '''７八金上''' (= G79-78).

There are two less common alternate symbols used instead of '''上''': '''行''' and '''入'''. However, these alternate symbols are reserved for indicating only the two most powerful promoted dragon 龍 and horse 馬 pieces. Thus, '''５五龍行''' or '''５五龍入''' instead of '''５五龍上''', but not '''５五金行''' or '''５五金入'''.

In certain situations, an indication of movement toward the destination square (that is, with '''引''', '''寄''', '''上''') is not sufficient to resolve ambiguity. In these cases, the origin square of the piece is notated with a relative positional indicator. These are '''右''' for a piece moving from a right square (and thus moving leftward) and '''左''' for a piece moving from a left square (rightward).

This positional information is relative to each player's directions. Thus, '''△５二金右''' (literally: "white 5-2 gold right") refers to the silver on the right from White's perspective (which would be on the left from Black's perspective).

In the special case of golds and silvers as well as promoted pieces with gold-like movements (成銀, 成桂, 成香, と), it is possible for there to be a three-way ambiguity in upward movement. In this case, a third positional origin indicator is used: '''直''' for vertical (straight up) movement.

Additionally, this '''直''' indicator tends to always be used for vertical movement even when simply using  '''右''' ("right") and '''左''' ("left") would suffice. Relatedly, '''直''' tends to be used only for golds and silvers and not for other pieces.

=====Promotion=====

A piece that promotes is indicated with '''成''' following the piece's character, such as '''７三桂成''' (N-73+). If a piece does not promote, this is indicated with '''不成''' following the piece's character, such as '''７三桂不成''' (N-73=). There is an alternate symbol for unpromotion: '''生''' is sometimes used instead of '''不成'''.

=====Numbering=====

Unlike western notation, numbering Japanese game records is not obligatory. Although players' moves often aren't numbered, shogi moves are always counted per player's move. This is commonly seen in checkmate problems where a ''3-move'' ３手 checkmate problem would mean a move sequence of black-white-black. This is unlike western chess which counts each pair of moves as one move. (In western notation for shogi, the move numbering tends to follow western chess notation conventions.)

=====Game end=====

Shogi games are officially over when a player formally resigns. The resignation is notated as '''投了''' ''tōryō.'' Other possible endings include rare '''千日手''' [[Shogi#Repetition (Draw)|Repetition Draw]], '''反則手''' [[Shogi#Illegal move|Illegal Move]], and the very rare '''持将棋''' [[Shogi#Impasse|Impasse Draw]].

=====Other conventions=====

[[File:OldShogiGameRecord.png| thumb | 275px | A game record from a 1839 Right [[Lance handicap|Lance]] [[handicap (shogi)|handicap]] game between Kenko Ishimoto (石本検校) who is Black (''shitate'') and Ryusetsu Ohashi (大橋柳雪) who is White. The game record uses shorthand notation. For example, the first move indicated is 七六丶 with the numerals read from right-to-left. This would be written in the standard notation as ７六歩. However, typically, White is notated as the top player these days, so this would be notated more typically as △３四歩 with the western equivalent as 1. ...P-34.]]

Unlike western notation, a capture of a piece is never explicitly notated in the Japanese system since the capture can be understood in the context of the game.

=====Shorthand=====

In addition to the usual kanji symbols, there are also [[shorthand]] versions of piece symbols that can be written very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ameblo.jp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ameblo.jp/kakuzan101/entry-10981017040.html | title=棋譜の取り方 | work=Ameblo.jp | access-date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several of the symbols, there is variation in what shorthand symbol is used – the ones listed here may not be exhaustive of all the alternatives used in Japan.

====Iroha notation====

A notation used in older times was the ''iroha'' notation.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; It used the [[Kana|syllables]] of the Japanese poem ''[[Iroha]]'' (いろは歌) (as well as other Japanese characters) to label each square on the shogi board.

For example, the 23 square was indicated by the symbol '''を'''. [[Tokugawa Ieharu]] (the tenth shogun 1760–1786) favored this notational system. Therefore, it was used for all castle game records during his reign.

=== Kitao–Kawasaki notation ===

The Kitao–Kawasaki notation is a hybrid notation introduced by the Nekomado publishing company in English translations of shogi books by Madoka Kitao and Takashi Kaneko.&lt;ref&gt;Kaneko, Takashi. 2013. ''Storming the Mino castle.'' R Sams (transl.). Tokyo: Nekomado.&lt;/ref&gt; The system incorporates elements of both the western and the Japanese notation systems.

The order of elements is the same as the western system except that a player's side argument is added.

:{| style='margin: 30px;'
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 1 
! style='padding-right: 55px;' | 2

| style='padding-right: 55px;' | (origin)
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | movement
| style='padding-right: 55px;' | (destination)
| (promotion)
|}

A typical move is indicated like '''☗歩-86''' (western equivalent: P-86). An example that uses all 6 parts is '''☗銀(72)x83+''' (S72x83+ in western notation).

'''1. Player's Side.''' Like the Japanese system, the black and white shogi pieces ☗ and ☖ are used.

'''2. Piece.''' Like the Japanese system, the characters for the shogi pieces are used. For promoted pieces, pieces that are notated with 成 in Japanese notation are notated with the western symbol '''+''' instead. However, unlike the western system, this convention is not used for the pawn, bishop, or rook.

:{| style='margin: 20px;'
! Kitao–Kawasaki !! English Term !! Western !! Japanese
|-
| と || promoted pawn || +P || と
|-
| +香 || promoted lance || +L || 成香
|-
| +桂 || promoted knight || +N || 成桂
|-
| +銀 || promoted silver || +S || 成銀
|-
| 馬 || promoted bishop || +B || 馬
|-
| 龍 || promoted rook || +R || 龍
|}

The convention of using kanji overlooks the issue of non-Japanese handwritten records.

'''3. Ambiguity Resolution: Origin Coordinates.''' In cases where the moving piece is ambiguous, the starting square coordinates enclosed in parentheses are added to the string. This is only indicated when needed to resolve ambiguity. Thus, following the example used above, '''金(77)-78''' is equivalent to western G77-78 and Japanese 7八金引, '''金(68)-78''' equivalent to G68-78 and 7八金寄, and '''金(79)-78''' equivalent to G79-78 and 7八金上.

'''4. Movement Type.''' The three movement types ('''-''', '''x''', '''*''') are the same as in the western system. Thus: '''歩-24''', '''歩x24''', '''歩*24'''. Like the western system (but unlike the Japanese system), this movement indication is obligatory in all contexts.

'''5. Destination Coordinates.''' Indicates which square a piece is moved to.

Like the Japanese system, rank (row) coordinates are indicated with a numeral (and not a letter). However, Arabic numerals are used instead of Japanese numerals. For example, '''76''' is equivalent to Japanese 7六.

When a piece is moved to the same location as the preceding piece (in a capture), the designation coordinates are omitted. This is similar to the use of 同 in the Japanese system. For example, the sequence '''☗歩-24 ☖歩x ☗角x ☖角x ☗飛x''' would be equivalent to western 1. P-24 Px24, 2. Bx24 Bx24, 3. Rx24 and Japanese ☗2四歩☖同歩☗同角☖同角☗同飛.

'''6. Promotion Status.''' The symbols '''+''' and '''=''' are used as in the western system.

'''Other conventions.''' Like the Japanese system, the numbering of moves is not obligatory. The ellipsis (...) notation for White's moves in the western system is not needed (as '''☖''' is used instead).

==Recording games and positions==

{{Expand section | date=March 2017}}

===SFEN===

SFEN is an extension of [[Forsyth–Edwards Notation]] (FEN) used for describing board positions of shogi games. 

Formally, an SFEN is a [[text string]] of [[ASCII]] characters. It has three fields that are separated by a space. The fields:

# Piece placement on the board from Black's perspective
# Who has the next move
# Pieces in hand

}}

The following is an example (from a [[Tempo Loss Bishop Exchange]] opening)

&lt;pre&gt;lnsgk2nl/1r4gs1/p1pppp1pp/1p4p2/7P1/2P6/PP1PPPP1P/1SG4R1/LN2KGSNL b Bb&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, the first field is '''lnsgk2nl/1r4gs1/p1pppp1pp/1p4p2/7P1/2P6/PP1PPPP1P/1SG4R1/LN2KGSNL''', the second is '''b''', and the last is '''Bb'''.

For the first field, each piece is represented with a single letter. White's pieces are lowercase letters while Black's pieces are uppercase letters. The set of letters used are the same as the ones used in [[Shogi notation#Western notation|western notation]] (i.e., p, +p, l, +l, n, +n, s, +s, g, b, +b, r, +r, k). Each rank is separated by a forward slash (/). The listing of ranks is from top (rank A) to bottom (rank i), and the order to pieces is from file 9 to file 1 (in other words, from left to right as viewed on typical shogi diagram with White as the top player and Black as the bottom player). Empty squares are indicated with numeral corresponding to the number of adjacent empty squares on the same rank. In the example, the first rank A is '''lnsgk2nl''' which indicates sequence of lance, knight, silver, gold, king followed by two empty squares to the right of the king and a sequence of knight and lance.

The second field can be either '''b''' for Black's turn to play or '''w''' for White's turn to play. In the example, '''b''' indicates that Black has the next move.

The third field contains all of the pieces in hand held by each player. In the example, the '''Bb''' indicates that Black has one bishop in hand ('''B'''), and White also has one bishop in hand ('''b''').

Below is another example showing the board position for [[Yoshiharu Habu]]'s famous 52 silver drop in an NHK game ([[Bishop Exchange Climbing Silver]] opening) with [[Hifumi Katoh]].

===KIF===

{{Expand section | date=November 2018}}

The '''KIF''' file format is used for saving full games of shogi. Internally, it uses Japanese notation in the UTF-8 text encoding, and each move is disambiguated with an origin square.

===KI2===

{{Expand section | date= November 2018}}

The '''KI2''' file format is similar to the '''KIF''' format but more compact.  Moves are only disambiguated with the standard Japanese relative direction kanji.

===CSA===

{{Expand section | date=March 2017}}

Another format for saving positions and games of shogi, which only uses ASCII internally. Mostly used in the computer shogi arena.

===PSN===

{{Expand section | date= November 2018}}

'''Portable Shogi Notation''' is a derivative of the [[Portable Game Notation]] used in chess, is expanded to specify shogi pieces and drops. It uses the Hodges coordinate system. It has little support outside of GNU Shogi.

'''Synchronization''' is the coordination of events to operate a [[system]] in unison. The [[Conductor (music)|conductor]] of an orchestra keeps the orchestra synchronized or ''in time''. Systems that operate with all parts in synchrony are said to be '''synchronous''' or ''in sync''—and those that are not are ''[[Asynchronous system|asynchronous]]''.

Today, '''time synchronization''' can occur between systems around the world through [[satellite navigation]] signals.

== Transport ==
Time-keeping and synchronization of clocks has been a critical problem in long-distance ocean navigation.  Before [[radio navigation]] and [[Radionavigation-satellite service|satellite-based navigation]], navigators required accurate time in conjunction with astronomical observations to determine how far east or west their vessel traveled. The invention of an accurate [[marine chronometer]] revolutionized marine navigation. By the end of the 19th century, important ports provided  [[time signal]]s in the form of a signal gun, flag, or dropping [[time ball]] so that mariners could check their chronometers for error.

Synchronization was important in the operation of 19th century railways, these being the first major means of transport fast enough for differences in local time between adjacent towns to be noticeable. Each line handled the problem by synchronizing all its stations to headquarters as a standard [[Time zone#Railroad time|railroad time]]. In some territories, sharing of single railroad tracks was controlled by the timetable.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The need for strict timekeeping led the companies to settle on one standard, and civil authorities eventually abandoned local [[mean solar time]] in favor of that standard.

== Communication ==
{{further information|Synchronization in telecommunications}}
In [[electrical engineering]] terms, for digital logic and data transfer, a [[synchronous circuit]] requires a [[clock signal]].  However, the use of the word "clock" in this sense is different from the typical sense of a clock as a device that keeps track of time-of-day; the clock signal simply signals the start and/or end of some time period, often very minute (measured in microseconds or nanoseconds), that has an arbitrary relationship to sidereal, solar, or lunar time, or to any other system of measurement of the passage of minutes, hours, and days.

In a different sense, electronic systems are sometimes synchronized to make events at points far apart appear simultaneous or near-simultaneous from a certain perspective.  (Albert Einstein proved in 1905 in his first relativity paper that there actually are no such things as absolutely simultaneous events.) Timekeeping technologies such as the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) provide real-time access to a close approximation to the [[UTC]] timescale and are used for many terrestrial synchronization applications of this kind.

Synchronization is an important concept in the following fields:
* [[Synchronization (computer science)|Computer science]] (In computer science, especially [[parallel computing]], synchronization refers to the coordination of simultaneous [[thread (computing)|threads]] or [[Process (computing)|processes]] to complete a task with correct runtime order and no unexpected [[race condition]]s.)
* [[Cryptography]]
* [[Multimedia]]
* Music (rhythm)
* [[Neural synchronization|Neuroscience]]
* Photography
* [[Physics]] (The idea of [[simultaneity]] has many difficulties, both in practice and theory.)
* [[Oscillator sync|Synthesizers]]
* Telecommunication

== Dynamical systems ==
Synchronization of multiple interacting [[dynamical system]]s can occur when the systems are [[Self-oscillation|autonomous oscillators]].  For instance, integrate-and-fire oscillators with either two-way (symmetric) or one-way coupling can synchronize when the strength of the coupling (in frequency units) is greater than the differences among the free-running natural oscillator frequencies.  Poincare phase oscillators are model systems that can interact and partially synchronize within random or regular networks.&lt;ref name="Nolte"&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Nolte | title = Introduction to Modern Dynamics: Chaos, Networks, Space and Time  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |  year = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of global synchronization of phase oscillators, an abrupt transition from unsynchronized to full synchronization takes place when the coupling strength exceeds a critical threshold.  This is known as the [[Kuramoto model]] phase transition.  Synchronization is an emergent property that occurs in a broad range of dynamical systems, including neural signaling, the beating of the heart and the synchronization of fire-fly light waves.

There has been dispute regarding the true effect of synchrony in these studies. Research in this area detailing the positive effects of synchrony, have attributed this to synchrony alone; however, many of the experiments incorporate a shared intention to achieve synchrony. Indeed, the Reinforcement of Cooperation Model suggests that perception of synchrony leads to reinforcement that cooperation is occurring, which leads to the pro-social effects of synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddish|first=Paul|last2=Fischer|first2=Ronald|last3=Bulbulia|first3=Joseph|date=1 January 2013|title=Let's dance together: synchrony, shared intentionality and cooperation|journal=PLoS One|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e71182|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0071182|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3737148|pmid=23951106}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is required to separate the effect of intentionality from the beneficial effect of synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellamil|first=Melissa|last2=Berson|first2=Josh|last3=Margulies|first3=Daniel S.|date=1 January 2016|title=Influences on and Measures of Unintentional Group Synchrony|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=7|pages=1744|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01744|pmc=5101201|pmid=27881968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
* Film synchronization of image and sound in [[sound film]].
* Synchronization is important in fields such as [[digital telephony]], video and [[digital audio]] where streams of sampled data are manipulated.
* In [[electric power]] systems, [[alternator synchronization]] is required when multiple generators are connected to an electrical grid.
* [[Arbiter (electronics)|Arbiters]] are needed in digital electronic systems such as [[microprocessor]]s to deal with asynchronous inputs.  There are also electronic digital circuits called ''synchronizers'' that attempt to perform arbitration in one clock cycle.  Synchronizers, unlike arbiters, are prone to failure.  (See [[metastability in electronics]]).
* [[Encryption]] systems usually require some synchronization mechanism to ensure that the receiving cipher is decoding the right bits at the right time.
* Automotive [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] contain [[synchromesh|synchronizers]] that bring the toothed rotating parts (gears and splined shaft) to the same rotational velocity before engaging the teeth.
* Film, video, and [[sound|audio]] applications use [[time code]] to synchronize audio and video.
* [[Flash (photo)|Flash]] photography, see [[Flash synchronization]]

Some systems may be only approximately synchronized, or [[plesiochronous]]. Some applications require that relative offsets between events be determined. For others, only the [[Partially ordered set|order]] of the event is important.

'''Synergistic gardening''' is a system of [[organic gardening]], developed by [[Emilia Hazelip]]. The system is strongly influenced by [[permaculture]], as well as the work of [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] and [[Marc Bonfils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Synergistic Garden |url=http://www.seedballs.com/hazelip.html |work=Excerpt from Permaculture Magazine |series=Issue 19 |date=Spring 1999 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316085845/http://www.seedballs.com/hazelip.html |archivedate=March 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing the [[garden]], there is no further digging, ploughing or tilling, and no use of external inputs such as [[manure]]s and other [[fertilizer]]s, or [[pesticide]]s. [[Soil health]] is maintained by the selection of [[plant]]s, [[mulch]]ing, and recycling of plant residues.&lt;ref name="Emilia emails"/&gt;

'''Taylor's law''' (also known as '''Taylor's power law''') is an empirical law in [[ecology]] that relates the [[variance]] of the [[population density|number of individuals of a species per unit area]] of habitat to the corresponding [[mean]] by a [[power law]] relationship.&lt;ref name=Taylor1961&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=L. R. |year=1961 |title=Aggregation, variance and the mean |journal=Nature |volume=189 |issue=4766 |pages=732–735 |doi=10.1038/189732a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the ecologist who first proposed it in 1961, [[Roy Taylor (ecologist)|Lionel Roy Taylor]] (1924–2007).&lt;ref name=Southwood1966&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas R. E. Southwood |title=Ecological methods, with particular reference to the study of insect populations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StwPAQAAMAAJ |year=1966 |publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's original name for this relationship was the law of the mean.&lt;ref name=Taylor1961/&gt;

==Definition==
This law was originally defined for ecological systems, specifically to assess the spatial clustering of organisms. For a population count ''Y'' with mean ''µ'' and variance var(''Y''), Taylor's law is written,

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var} (Y) = a\mu^b,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are both positive constants. Taylor proposed this relationship in 1961, suggesting that the exponent ''b'' be considered a species specific index of aggregation.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt; This power law has subsequently been confirmed for many hundreds of species.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=L. R.|last2=Woiwod|first2=I. P. |year=1980 |title=Temporal stability as a density-dependent species characteristic |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=209–224 |doi=10.2307/4285 |jstor=4285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor1982&gt;Taylor LR &amp; Woiwod (1982) Comparative Synoptic Dynamics.

==History==

The first use of a double log-log plot was by [[Osborne Reynolds|Reynolds]] in 1879 on thermal aerodynamics.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1879&gt;Reynolds O (1879) On certain dimensional properties of matter in the gaseous state. Part I. Experimental researches on thermal transpiration of gases through porous plates and on the laws of  transpiration and impulsion, including an experimental proof that gas is not a continuous plenum. Part II. On an extension of the dynamical theory of gas, which includes the stresses, tangential and normal, caused by a varying condition of gas, and affords an explanation of the phenomena of transpiration and impulsion. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 170:727-845&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] used a similar plot to study the proportion of a population and their income.&lt;ref name=Pareto1897&gt;Pareto V (1897) Cours D'économie Politique. Volume 2. Lausanne: F. Rouge&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term ''[[variance]]'' was coined by [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]] in 1918.&lt;ref name=Fisher1918&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fisher | first=RA | title=The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance | journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh | year=1918 | volume=52 | pages=399–433 | doi=10.1017/S0080456800012163 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a m + b m^2 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] studied the relationship between the sample mean and variance in 1926.&lt;ref name=Neyman1926&gt;Neyman J (1926) On the correlation of the mean and the variance in samples drawn from an "infinite" population. Biometrika 18:401–413&lt;/ref&gt; [[M. S.

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a m + b m^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Smith in 1938 while studying crop yields proposed a relationship similar to Taylor's.&lt;ref name=Smith1938&gt;Smith HF (1938) An empirical law describing heterogeneity in the yield of agricultural crops. J Agric Sci 28: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship was

: &lt;math&gt; \log V_x = \log V_1 + b\log x \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance of yield for plots of ''x'' units, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance of yield per unit area and ''x'' is the size of plots. The slope (''b'') is the index of heterogeneity. The value of ''b'' in this relationship lies between 0 and 1. Where the yield are highly correlated ''b'' tends to 0; when they are uncorrelated ''b'' tends to 1.

Bliss&lt;ref name=Bliss1941&gt;Bliss CI (1941) Statistical problems in estimating populations of Japanese beetle larve. ''J Econ Entomol'' 34, 221-232&lt;/ref&gt; in 1941, Fracker and Brischle&lt;ref name=Fracker1944&gt;Fracker SB &amp; Brischle HA (1944) Measuring the local distribution of ''Ribes''. Ecology 25: 283–303&lt;/ref&gt; in 1941 and Hayman &amp; Lowe &lt;ref name=Hayman1961&gt;Hayman BI &amp; Lowe AD (1961) The transformation of counts of the cabbage aphid (''Brevicovyne brassicae'' (L.)) NZ J Sci 4:271–278&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 also described what is now known as Taylor's law, but in the context of data from single species.

L. R. Taylor (1924–2007) was an English entomologist who worked on the Rothamsted Insect Survey for pest control. His 1961 paper used data from 24 papers published between 1936 and 1960. These papers considered a variety of biological settings: [[virus]] lesions, [[zooplankton|macro-zooplankton]], [[worm]]s and [[symphylid]]s in [[soil]], [[insect]]s in soil, on [[plant]]s and in the air, [[mite]]s on [[leaf|leaves]], [[tick]]s on [[sheep]] and [[fish]] in the [[sea]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt; In these papers the ''b'' value lay between 1 and 3. Taylor proposed the power law as a general feature of the spatial distribution of these species. He also proposed a mechanistic hypothesis to explain this law. Among the papers cited were those of Bliss and Yates and Finney.

Initial attempts to explain the spatial distribution of animals had been based on approaches like [[M. S. Bartlet|Bartlett's]] stochastic population models and the [[negative binomial distribution]] that could result from [[birth-death process]]es.&lt;ref name=Taylor1984&gt;Taylor LR (1984) Anscombe’s hypothesis and the changing distributions of insect populations. ''Antenna'' 8, 62–67&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor's novel explanation was based the assumption of a balanced migratory and congregatory behavior of animals.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt;  His hypothesis was initially qualitative, but as it evolved it became semi-quantitative and was supported by simulations.&lt;ref name=Taylor1977&gt;Taylor LR &amp; Taylor RAJ (1977) Aggregation, migration and population mechanics. ''Nature'' 265, 415–421&lt;/ref&gt;  In proposing that animal behavior was the principal mechanism behind the clustering of organisms, Taylor though appeared to have ignored his own report of clustering seen with tobacco necrosis virus plaques.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt;

Following Taylor's initial publications several alternative hypotheses for the power law were advanced. Hanski proposed a random walk model, modulated by the presumed multiplicative effect of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Hanski1980&gt;Hanski I (1980) Spatial patterns and movements in coprophagous beetles. ''Oikos'' 34, 293–310&lt;/ref&gt; Hanski's model predicted that the power law exponent would be constrained to range closely about the value of 2, which seemed inconsistent with many reported values.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1982"/&gt;

Anderson ''et al'' formulated a simple stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model that yielded a quadratic variance function.&lt;ref name=Anderson1961&gt;Anderson RD, Crawley GM &amp; Hassell M (1982) Variability in the abundance of animal and plant species. ''Nature'' 296, 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to this model Taylor argued that such a [[Markov process]] would predict that the power law exponent would vary considerably between replicate observations, and that such variability had not been observed.&lt;ref name=Taylor1983&gt;Taylor LR, Taylor RAJ, Woiwod IP &amp; Perry JN (1983) Behavioural dynamics. ''Nature'' 303, 801–804&lt;/ref&gt;

About this time concerns were, however, raised regarding the statistical variability with measurements of the power law exponent, and the possibility that observations of a power law might reflect more mathematical artifact than a mechanistic process.&lt;ref name=Downing1986&gt;Downing JA (1986) Spatial heterogeneity: evolved behaviour or mathematical artefact? ''Nature'' 323, 255–257&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor ''et al'' responded with an additional publication of extensive observations which he claimed refuted Downing's concerns.&lt;ref name=Taylor1988&gt;Taylor LR (1988) Specificity of the spatial power-law exponent in ecology and agriculture. ''Nature'' 332, 721–722&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Thórarinsson published a detailed critique of the animal behavioral model, noting that Taylor had modified his model several times in response to concerns raised, and that some of these modifications were inconsistent with earlier versions.&lt;ref name="Thórarinsson1986"&gt; Thórarinsson K (1986) Population density and movement: a critique of Δ-models. ''Oikos'' 189, 70–81&lt;/ref&gt; Thórarinsson also claimed that Taylor confounded animal numbers with density and that Taylor had incorrectly interpreted simulations that had been constructed to demonstrate his models as validation.

Kemp reviewed a number of discrete stochastic models based on the negative binomial, Neyman type A, and Polya–Aeppli distributions that with suitable adjustment of parameters could produce a variance to mean power law.&lt;ref name=Kemp1987&gt;Kemp AW (1987) Families of discrete distributions satisfying Taylor’s power law. ''Biometrics'' 43, 693–699&lt;/ref&gt;  Kemp, however, did not explain the parameterizations of his models in mechanistic terms.  Other relatively abstract models for Taylor's law followed.&lt;ref name="Kendal1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamamura1990&gt;Yamamura K (1990) Sampling scale dependence of Taylor’s power law. ''Oikos'' 59, 121–125&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of additional statistical concerns were raised regarding Taylor's law, based on the difficulty with real data in distinguishing between Taylor's law and other variance to mean functions, as well the inaccuracy of standard regression methods.&lt;ref name=Routledge1991&gt;Routledge RD &amp; Swartz TB (1991) Taylor’s power law re-examined. ''Oikos'' 60, 107–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tokeshi1995&gt;Tokeshi M (1995) On the mathematical basis of the variance–mean power relationship. ''Res Pop Ecol'' 37, 43–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports also began to accumulate where Taylor's law had been applied to time series data. Perry showed how simulations based on [[chaos theory]] could yield Taylor's law, and Kilpatrick &amp; Ives provided simulations which showed how interactions between different species might lead to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Perry1994&gt;Perry JN (1994) Chaotic dynamics can generate Taylor’s power law. ''Proc Roy Soc Lond Ser B Biol Sci'' 257, 221–226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kilpatrick2003&gt;Kilpatrick AM &amp; Ives AR (2003) Species interactions can explain Taylor’s power law for ecological time series. ''Nature'' 422, 65–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reports appeared where Taylor's law had been applied to the spatial distribution of plants&lt;ref name=Clark1996&gt;Clark S, Perry JJN &amp; Marshall JP (1996) Estimating Taylor’s power law parameters for weeds and the effect of spatial scale. ''Weed Res'' 36, 405–417&lt;/ref&gt; and bacterial populations&lt;ref name=Ramsayer2011&gt;Ramsayer J, Fellous S, Cohen JE &amp; Hochberg ME (2011) Taylor's Law holds in experimental bacterial populations but competition does not influence the slope. ''Biology Letters''&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the observations of Tobacco necrosis virus mentioned earlier, these observations were not consistent with Taylor's animal behavioral model.

Earlier it was mentioned that variance to mean power function had been applied to non-ecological systems, under the rubric of Taylor's law.  To provide a more general explanation for the range of manifestations of the power law a hypothesis was proposed based on the [[Tweedie distributions]],&lt;ref name="Jørgensen-1997"&gt;{{cite book       | author = Jørgensen, Bent | year = 1997| title = The theory of dispersion models | publisher = [Chapman &amp; Hall] | isbn = 978-0412997112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a family of probabilistic models that express an inherent power function relationship between the variance and the mean.&lt;ref name=Kendal2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2002&gt;Kendal WS (2002) Spatial aggregation of the Colorado potato beetle described by an exponential dispersion model. ''Ecol Model'' 151, 261–269&lt;/ref&gt;  Details regarding this hypothesis will be provided in the next section.

A further alternative explanation for Taylor's law was proposed by [[Joel E. Cohen|Cohen]] ''et al'', derived from the [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]] Cohen [[Population dynamics|growth model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J E |author2=Xu, m |author3=Schuster, W S|title=Stochastic multiplicative population growth predicts and interprets Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling|journal=Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|year=2013|volume=280|page=20122955}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was successfully used to describe the spatial and temporal variability of forest populations.

Another paper by Cohen and Xu that random sampling in blocks where the underling distribution is skewed with the first four moments finite gives rise to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Cohen2015&gt;Cohen JE, Xu M (2015) Random sampling of skewed distributions implies Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112(25):7749–7754. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1503824112&lt;/ref&gt; Approximate formulae for the parameters and their variances were also derived. These estimates were tested again data from the Black Rock Forest and found to be in reasonable agreement.

Following Taylor's initial publications several alternative hypotheses for the power law were advanced. Hanski proposed a random walk model, modulated by the presumed multiplicative effect of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Hanski1980&gt;Hanski I (1980) Spatial patterns and movements in coprophagous beetles. ''Oikos'' 34, 293–310&lt;/ref&gt; Hanski's model predicted that the power law exponent would be constrained to range closely about the value of 2, which seemed inconsistent with many reported values.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1982"/&gt; Anderson ''et al'' formulated a simple stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model that yielded a quadratic variance function.&lt;ref name=Anderson1961&gt;Anderson RD, Crawley GM &amp; Hassell M (1982) Variability in the abundance of animal and plant species. ''Nature'' 296, 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]] Cohen [[Population dynamics|growth model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J E |author2=Xu, m |author3=Schuster, W S|title=Stochastic multiplicative population growth predicts and interprets Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling|journal=Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|year=2013|volume=280|page=20122955}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another proposed explanation. The possibility that observations of a power law might reflect more mathematical artifact than a mechanistic process was raised.&lt;ref name=Downing1986&gt;Downing JA (1986) Spatial heterogeneity: evolved behaviour or mathematical artefact? ''Nature'' 323, 255–257&lt;/ref&gt;



===Physics===

In the physics literature Taylor's law has been referred to as ''fluctuation scaling''. Eisler ''et al'', in a further attempt to find a general explanation for fluctuation scaling, proposed a process they called ''impact inhomogeneity'' in which frequent events are associated with larger impacts.&lt;ref name=Eisler2008&gt;Eisler Z, Bartos I &amp; Kertesz (2008) Fluctuation scaling in complex systems: Taylor’s law and beyond. ''Adv Phys'' 57, 89–142&lt;/ref&gt; In appendix B of the Eisler article, however, the authors noted that the equations for impact inhomogeneity yielded the same mathematical relationships as found with the Tweedie distributions.

Another group of physicists, Fronczak and Fronczak, derived Taylor's power law for fluctuation scaling from principles of equilibrium and non-equilibrium [[statistical physics]].&lt;ref name=Fronczak2010&gt;Fronczak A &amp; Fronczak P (2010) Origins of Taylor’s power law for fluctuation scaling in complex systems. ''Phys Rev E'' 81, 066112&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation was based on assumptions of physical quantities like [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] and an external [[field (physics)|field]] that caused the clustering of biological organisms. Direct experimental demonstration of these postulated physical quantities in relationship to animal or plant aggregation has yet to be achieved, though. Shortly thereafter, an analysis of Fronczak and Fronczak's model was presented that showed their equations directly lead to the Tweedie distributions, a finding that suggested that Fronczak and Fronczak had possibly provided a [[maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum entropy]] derivation of these distributions.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;

===Mathematics===

Taylor's law has been shown to hold for [[prime number]]s not exceeding a given real number.&lt;ref name=Cohen2016&gt;Cohen JE (2016) Statistics of primes (and probably twin primes) satisfy Taylor's Law from ecology. The American Statistician 70 (4) 399–404&lt;/ref&gt; This result has been shown to hold for the first 11 million primes. If the [[Twin prime|Hardy–Littlewood twin primes conjecture]] is true then this law also holds for twin primes.

===Naming of law===

The law itself is named after the ecologist [[Roy Taylor (ecologist)|Lionel Roy Taylor]] (1924–2007). The name 'Taylor's law' was coined by Southwood in 1966.&lt;ref name=Southwood1966/&gt; Taylor's original name for this relationship was the law of the mean

==The Tweedie Hypothesis==

About the time that Taylor was substantiating his ecological observations, [[Maurice Tweedie|MCK Tweedie]], a British statistician and medical physicist, was investigating a family of probabilistic models that are now known as the [[Tweedie distributions]].&lt;ref name=Tweedie1984&gt;Tweedie MCK (1984) An index which distinguishes between some important exponential families. In: ''Statistics: Applications and New Directions Proceedings of the Indian Statistical Institute Golden Jubilee International Conference'' pp 579-604 Eds: JK Ghosh &amp; J Roy, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1987"&gt;Jørgensen B (1987)Exponential dispersion models. ''J Roy Stat Soc Ser B'' 49, 127–162}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, these distributions are all characterized by a variance to mean power law mathematically identical to Taylor's law.

The Tweedie distribution most applicable to ecological observations is the [[compound Poisson distribution|compound Poisson-gamma distribution]], which represents the sum of ''N'' independent and identically distributed random variables with a gamma distribution where ''N'' is a random variable distributed in accordance with a Poisson distribution. In the additive form its [[cumulant|cumulant generating function]] (CGF) is:

: &lt;math&gt;K^*_b(s;\theta,\lambda)=\lambda\kappa_b(\theta)\left [\left(1+{s \over \theta}\right)^\alpha-1\right]&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''κ''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'') is the cumulant function,

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_b(\theta)={(\alpha-1)\over \alpha}\left({\theta \over (\alpha-1)}\right)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

the Tweedie exponent

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha=(b-2)/(b-1)&lt;/math&gt;,

''s'' is the generating function variable, and ''θ'' and ''λ'' are the canonical and index parameters, respectively.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen-1997"/&gt;

These last two parameters are analogous to the [[scale parameter|scale]] and [[shape parameter]]s used in probability theory. The [[cumulant]]s of this distribution can be determined by successive differentiations of the CGF and then substituting ''s=0'' into the resultant equations. The first and second cumulants are the mean and variance, respectively, and thus the compound Poisson-gamma CGF yields Taylor's law with the proportionality constant

: &lt;math&gt;a=\lambda^{1/(\alpha-1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The compound Poisson-gamma cumulative distribution function has been verified for limited ecological data through the comparison of the theoretical distribution function with the empirical distribution function.&lt;ref name=Kendal2002 /&gt; A number of other systems, demonstrating variance to mean power laws related to Taylor's law, have been similarly tested for the compound Poisson-gamma distribution.&lt;ref name=Kendal2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b"/&gt;

The main justification for the Tweedie hypothesis rests with the mathematical [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] properties of the Tweedie distributions.&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt; The [[Tweedie distributions|'''Tweedie convergence theorem''']] requires the Tweedie distributions to act as foci of convergence for a wide range of statistical processes.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1994"&gt;Jørgensen B, Marinez JR &amp; Tsao M (1994) Asymptotic behaviour of the variance function. ''Scandinavian Journal of Statistics'' 21, 223–243&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this convergence theorem, processes based on the sum of multiple independent small jumps will tend to express Taylor's law and obey a Tweedie distribution. A limit theorem for independent and identically distributed variables, as with the Tweedie convergence theorem, might then be considered as being fundamental relative to the ''ad hoc'' population models, or models proposed on the basis of simulation or approximation.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b"/&gt;

This hypothesis remains controversial; more conventional [[Population dynamics|population dynamic]] approaches seem preferred amongst ecologists, despite the fact that the Tweedie compound Poisson distribution can be directly applied to population dynamic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Kendal1995/&gt;

One difficulty with the Tweedie hypothesis is that the value of ''b'' does not range between 0 and 1. Values of ''b'' &lt; 1 are rare but have been reported.&lt;ref name=Wilson1982&gt;Wilson LT &amp; Room PM (1982) The relative efficiency and reliability of three methods for sampling arthropods in Australian cotton fields. J Aust Entomol Soc 21: 175-181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==

In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; s_i^2 = am_i^b &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[variance]] of the density of the ''i''th sample, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[mean]] density of the ''i''th sample and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants.

In logarithmic form

: &lt;math&gt; \log s_i^2 = \log a + b\log m_i &lt;/math&gt;

===Scale invariance===

Taylor's law is scale invariant. If the unit of measurement is changed by a constant factor ''c'', the exponent (''b'') remains unchanged.

To see this let ''y'' = ''cx''. Then

&lt;math&gt; \mu_1 = \mathbb{E}( x ) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mu_2 = \mathbb{E}( y ) =\mathbb{E}( c\,x ) = c \, \mathbb{E}( x ) = c\, \mu_1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_1 = \mathbb{E} ( x - \mu_1 )^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_2 = \mathbb{E}( y - \mu_2 )^2 = \mathbb{E}( c\,x - c\, \mu_1 )^2 = c^2 \mathbb{E} ( x - \mu_1 )^2 = c^2\, \sigma^2_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Taylor's law expressed in the original variable (''x'') is

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_1^2 = a \mu_1^b &lt;/math&gt;

and in the rescaled variable (''y'') it is

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_2^2 = a \mu_2^b = c^2 \sigma_1^2 = c^2 a \mu_1^b &lt;/math&gt;

It has been shown that Taylor's law is the only relationship between the mean and variance that is scale invariant.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1997"&gt;Jørgensen B (1997) The theory of exponential dispersion models. Chapman &amp; Hall. London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensions and refinements===

A refinement in the estimation of the slope ''b'' has been proposed by Rayner.&lt;ref name=Rayner1985&gt;Rayner JMV (1985) Linear relations in biomechanics: the statistics of scaling functions. J Zoo 206 (3) 415–439&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; b = \frac { f - \varphi + \sqrt{ ( f - \varphi )^2 - 4 r^2 f \varphi } }{ 2 r \sqrt{ f } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson moment correlation coefficient]] between log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'', ''f'' is the ratio of sample variances in log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'' and ''φ'' is the ratio of the errors in log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''m''.

Ordinary least squares regression assumes that&amp;nbsp;''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞. This tends to underestimate the value of ''b'' because the estimates of both log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'' are subject to error.

An extension of Taylor's law has been proposed by Ferris ''et al'' when multiple samples are taken&lt;ref name=Ferris1990&gt;Ferris H, Mullens TA, Foord KE (1990) Stability and characteristics of spatial description parameters for nematode populations. J Nematol 22(4):427-439&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = ( c n^d ) ( m^b ) &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''m'' are the variance and mean respectively, ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' are constants and ''n'' is the number of samples taken. To date, this proposed extension has not been verified to be as applicable as the original version of Taylor's law.

===Small samples===

An extension to this law for small samples has been proposed by Hanski.&lt;ref name=Hanski1982&gt;Hanski I(1982) On patterns of temporal and spatial variation in animal populations. Ann. zool. Fermici 19: 21—37&lt;/ref&gt; For small samples the Poisson variation (''P'') - the variation that can be ascribed to sampling variation - may be significant. Let ''S'' be the total variance and let ''V'' be the biological (real) variance. Then

: &lt;math&gt; S = V + P &lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the validity of Taylor's law, we have

: &lt;math&gt; V = a m^b &lt;/math&gt;

Because in the Poisson distribution the mean equals the variance, we have

: &lt;math&gt; P = m &lt;/math&gt;

This gives us

: &lt;math&gt; S = V + P = a m^b + m &lt;/math&gt;

This closely resembles Barlett's original suggestion.

===Interpretation===

Slope values (''b'') significantly &gt;&amp;nbsp;1 indicate clumping of the organisms.

In [[Poisson distribution|Poisson-distributed]] data, ''b'' = 1.&lt;ref name=Taylor1983/&gt; If the population follows a [[lognormal distribution|lognormal]] or [[gamma distribution]], then&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

For populations that are experiencing constant per capita environmental variability, the regression of log( variance ) versus log( mean abundance ) should have a line with ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

Most populations that have been studied have ''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 (usually 1.5–1.6) but values of 2 have been reported.&lt;ref name=Boag1992&gt;Boag B, Hackett CA, Topham PB (1992) The use of Taylor's power law to describe the aggregated distribution of gastro-intestinal nematodes of sheep. Int J Parasitol 22(3):267–270&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally cases with ''b'' &gt; 2 have been reported.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt; ''b'' values below 1 are uncommon but have also been reported ( ''b'' = 0.93 ).&lt;ref name="Wilson1982"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the exponent of the law (''b'') is proportional to the skewness of the underlying distribution.&lt;ref name=v2015&gt;Cohen J E, Xua M (2015) Random sampling of skewed distributions implies Taylor’s power law of fluctuation scaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2015 112 (25) 7749–7754&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal has criticised: additional work seems to be indicated.&lt;ref name=Anon2015a&gt;Reply to Chen: Under specified assumptions, adequate random samples of skewed distributions obey Taylor's law (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112 (25) E3157-E3158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anon2015b&gt;Random sampling of skewed distributions does not necessarily imply Taylor's law (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112 (25) E3156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes===

The origin of the slope (''b'') in this regression remains unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain it. One suggests that ''b'' arises from the species behavior and is a constant for that species. The alternative suggests that it is dependent on the sampled population. Despite the considerable number of studies carried out on this law (over 1000), this question remains open.

It is known that both ''a'' and ''b'' are subject to change due to age-specific dispersal, mortality and sample unit size.&lt;ref name=Banerjee1976&gt;Banerjee B (1976) Variance to mean ratio and the spatial distribution of animals. Experientia 32: 993-994&lt;/ref&gt;

This law may be a poor fit if the values are small. For this reason an extension to Taylor's law has been proposed by [[Ilkka Hanski|Hanski]] which improves the fit of Taylor's law at low densities.&lt;ref name=Hanski1982 /&gt;

===Extension to cluster sampling of binary data===

A form of Taylor's law applicable to binary data in clusters (e.q., quadrats) has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Hughes&amp;Madden1992&gt;Hughes G, and Madden LV (1992) Aggregation and incidence of disease. Plant Pathology 41(6):657–660&lt;/ref&gt; In a binomial distribution, the theoretical variance is

: &lt;math&gt; var_{ bin } = n p ( 1 - p ) &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''(var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is the binomial variance, ''n'' is the sample size per cluster, and ''p'' is the proportion of individuals with a trait (such as disease), an estimate of the probability of an individual having that trait.

One difficulty with binary data is that the mean and variance, in general, have a particular relationship: as the mean proportion of individuals infected increases above 0.5, the variance deceases.

It is now known that the observed variance ''(var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;)'' changes as a power function of ''(var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;)''.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt;

Hughes and Madden noted that if the distribution is Poisson, the mean and variance are equal.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt; As this is clearly not the case in many observed proportion samples, they instead assumed a binomial distribution. They replaced the mean in Taylor's law with the binomial variance and then compared this theoretical variance with the observed variance. For binomial data, they showed that ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; = var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;'' with overdispersion, ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;''.

In symbols, Hughes and Madden's modification to Tyalor's law was

: &lt;math&gt; var_{ obs } = a( var_{ bin } )^b &lt;/math&gt;.

In logarithmic form this relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; \log( var_{ obs } ) = \log( a ) + b \log( var_{ bin } ) &lt;/math&gt;.

This latter version is known as the binary power law.

A key step in the derivation of the binary power law by Hughes and Madden was the observation made by Patil and Stiteler&lt;ref name=Patil&amp;Stiteler1974&gt;Patil GP, and Stiteler WM (1974) Concepts of aggregation and their quantification: a critical review with some new results and applications. Researches on Population Ecology 15:238-254&lt;/ref&gt; that the variance-to-mean ratio used for assessing over-dispersion of unbounded counts in a single sample is actually the ratio of two variances: the observed variance and the theoretical variance for a random distribution. For unbounded counts, the random distribution is the Poisson. Thus, the Taylor power law for a collection of samples can be considered as a relationship between the observed variance and the Poisson variance.

More broadly, Madden and Hughes&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt; considered the power law as the relationship between two variances, the observed variance and the theoretical variance for a random distribution. With binary data, the random distribution is the binomial (not the Poisson). Thus the Taylor power law and the binary power law are two special cases of a general power-law relationships for heterogeneity.

When both ''a'' and ''b'' are equal to 1, then a small-scale random spatial pattern is suggested and is best described by the binomial distribution. When ''b'' = 1 and ''a'' &gt; 1, there is over-dispersion (small scale aggregation). When ''b'' is &gt; 1, the degree of aggregation varies with ''p''. Turechek ''et al''&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"&gt;Turechek WW, Madden LV, Gent DH, Xu XM (2011) Comments regarding the binary power law for heterogeneity of disease incidence. Phytopathology 101(12):1396-1407&lt;/ref&gt; have showed that the binary power law describes numerous data sets in plant pathology. In general, ''b'' is greater than 1 and less than 2.

The fit of this law has been tested by simulations.&lt;ref name=Gosme2009&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Marie|last1=Gosme|first2=Philippe|last2=Lucas|title=Disease Spread Across Multiple Scales in a Spatial Hierarchy: Effect of Host Spatial Structure and of Inoculum Quantity and Distribution|url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHYTO-99-7-0833|journal=Phytopathology|date=2009-06-12|issn=0031-949X|pages=833–839|volume=99|issue=7|doi=10.1094/phyto-99-7-0833|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest that rather than a single regression line for the data set, a segmental regression may be a better model for genuinely random distributions. However, this segmentation only occurs for very short-range dispersal distances and large quadrat sizes.&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"/&gt; The break in the line occurs only at ''p'' very close to 0.

An extension to this law has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Xu2014&gt;Xu X-M, Madden LV (2013) The limits of the binary power law describing spatial variability for incidence data. Plant Pathology 63 (5) 973–982&lt;/ref&gt; The original form of this law is symmetrical but it can be extended to an asymmetrical form.&lt;ref name="Xu2014"/&gt; Using simulations the symmetrical form fits the data when there is positive correlation of disease status of neighbors. Where there is a negative correlation between the likelihood of neighbours being infected, the asymmetrical version is a better fit to the data.

==Applications==

Because of the ubiquitous occurrence of Taylor's law in biology it has found a variety of uses some of which are listed here.

===Recommendations as to use===

It has been recommended based on simulation studies&lt;ref name=Clark1994&gt;Clark SJ &amp; Perry JN (1994) Small sample estimation for Taylor's power law. Environment Ecol Stats 1 (4) 287–302, {{doi|10.1007/BF00469426}}&lt;/ref&gt; in applications testing the validity of Taylor's law to a data sample that:

(1) the total number of organisms studied be &gt; 15&lt;br/&gt;
(2) the minimum number of groups of organisms studied be &gt; 5&lt;br/&gt; 
(3) the density of the organisms should vary by at least 2 orders of magnitude within the sample

===Randomly distributed populations===

It is common assumed (at least initially) that a population is randomly distributed in the environment. If a population is randomly distributed then the mean ( ''m'' ) and variance ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ) of the population are equal and the proportion of samples that contain at least one individual ( ''p'' ) is

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ -m } &lt;/math&gt;

When a species with a clumped pattern is compared with one that is randomly distributed with equal overall densities, p will be less for the species having the clumped distribution pattern. Conversely when comparing a uniformly and a randomly distributed species but at equal overall densities, ''p'' will be greater for the randomly distributed population. This can be graphically tested by plotting ''p'' against ''m''.

Wilson and Room developed a binomial model that incorporates Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Wison1983&gt;Wilson LT &amp; Room PM (1983) Clumping patterns of fruit and arthropods in cotton with implications for binomial sampling. Environ Entomol 12:50-54&lt;/ref&gt; The basic relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( s^2 / m )( s^2 / m - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

where the log is taken to the base ''e''.

Incorporating Taylor's law this relationship becomes

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( a m^{ b - 1 } )( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

===Dispersion parameter estimator===

The common dispersion parameter (''k'') of the negative binomial distribution is

: &lt;math&gt; k = m^2 / ( s^2 - m ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance.&lt;ref name=Bliss1953&gt;Bliss CI and Fisher RA (1953) Fitting the negative binomial distribution to biological data (also includes note on the efficient fitting of the negative binomial). Biometrics 9: 177-200&lt;/ref&gt; If 1 / ''k'' is &gt; 0 the population is considered to be aggregated; 1 / ''k'' = 0 ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''m'' ) the population is considered to be randomly (Poisson) distributed and if 1 / ''k'' is &lt; 0 the population is considered to be uniformly distributed. No comment on the distribution can be made if ''k'' = 0.

Wilson and Room assuming that Taylor's law applied to the population gave an alternative estimator for ''k'':&lt;ref name="Wison1983"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; k = \frac { m } { a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the constants from Taylor's law.

Jones&lt;ref name=Jones1991&gt;Jones VP (1991) Binomial sampling plans for tentiform leafminer (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) on apple in Utah. J Econ Entomol 84: 484-488&lt;/ref&gt; using the estimate for ''k'' above along with the relationship Wilson and Room developed for the probability of finding a sample having at least one individual&lt;ref name="Wison1983"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( a m^{ b - 1 } )( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

derived an estimator for the probability of a sample containing ''x'' individuals per sampling unit. Jones's formula is

: &lt;math&gt; P( x ) = P( x - 1 ) \frac { k + x - 1 } { x } \frac { m k^{ -1 } } { m k^{ -1 } - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''( ''x'' ) is the probability of finding ''x'' individuals per sampling unit, ''k'' is estimated from the Wilon and Room equation and ''m'' is the sample mean. The probability of finding zero individuals ''P''( 0 ) is estimated with the [[negative binomial distribution]]

: &lt;math&gt; P( 0 ) = ( 1 + m / k )^{ -k } &lt;/math&gt;

Jones also gives confidence intervals for these probabilities.

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ CI } = t \left( \frac { P( x ) ( 1 - P( x ) ) } { N } \right)^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''CI'' is the confidence interval, ''t'' is the critical value taken from the t distribution and ''N'' is the total sample size.

===Katz family of distributions===

Katz proposed a family of distributions (the [[Katz family]]) with 2 parameters ( ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ).&lt;ref name=Katz1965&gt;Katz L (1965) United treatment of a broad class of discrete probability distributions. ''in'' Proceedings of the International Symposium on Discrete Distributions. Montreal&lt;/ref&gt; This family of distributions includes the [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]], [[Geometric distribution|Geometric]], [[Pascal distribution|Pascal]] and Poisson distributions as special cases. The mean and variance of a Katz distribution are

: &lt;math&gt; m = \frac { w_1 } { 1 - w_2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = \frac{ w_1 } { ( 1 - w_2 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the sample. The parameters can be estimated by the method of moments from which we have

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { w_1 } { ( 1 - w_2 ) } = m &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { w_2 } { ( 1 - w_2 ) } = \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

For a Poisson distribution ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''λ'' the parameter of the Possion distribution. This family of distributions is also sometimes known as the Panjer family of distributions.

The Katz family is related to the Sundt-Jewel family of distributions:&lt;ref name=Jewel1981&gt;Jewel W, Sundt B (1981) Improved approximations for the distribution of a heterogeneous risk portfolio. Bull Assoc Swiss Act 81: 221-240&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; p_n = \left( a + \frac{ b }{ n } \right) p_{ n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

The only members of the Sundt-Jewel family are the Poisson, binomial, negative binomial (Pascal), [[extended truncated negative binomial]] and [[logarithmic series distribution]]s.

If the population obeys a Katz distribution then the coefficients of Taylor's law are

: &lt;math&gt; a = -\log ( 1 - w_2 ) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; b = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Katz also introduced a statistical test&lt;ref name="Katz1965"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; J_n = \sqrt { \frac { n } { 2 } } \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the test statistic, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the sample, ''m'' is the mean of the sample and ''n'' is the sample size. ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is asymptotically normally distributed with a zero mean and unit variance. If the sample is Poisson distributed ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0; values of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 and &gt; 0 indicate under and over dispersion respectively. Overdispersion is often caused by latent heterogeneity - the presence of multiple sub populations within the population the sample is drawn from.

This statistic is related to the Neyman-Scott statistic

: &lt;math&gt; NS = \sqrt { \frac { n - 1 } { 2 } } \left( \frac { s^2} { m } - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

which is known to be asymptotically normal and the conditional chi-squared statistic (Poisson dispersion test)

: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac { ( n - 1 ) s^2 } { m } &lt;/math&gt;
 
which is known to have an asymptotic chi squared distribution with ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom when the population is Poisson distributed.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; J_n = \sqrt { \frac { n } { 2 } } ( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 ) &lt;/math&gt;

===Time to extinction===

If Taylor's law is assumed to apply it is possible to determine the mean time to local extinction. This model assumes a simple random walk in time and the absence of density dependent population regulation.&lt;ref name=Foley1994&gt;Foley P (1994) Predicting extinction times from environmental stochasticity and carrying capacity. Conserv Biol 8: 124-137&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; N_{ t + 1 } = r N_{ t } &lt;/math&gt; where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are the population sizes at time ''t'' + 1 and ''t'' respectively and ''r'' is parameter equal to the annual increase (decrease in population). Then

: &lt;math&gt; var(r) = s^2 ( \log( r ) ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''var''( ''r'' ) is the variance of ''r''.

Let ''K'' be a measure of the species abundance (organisms per unit area). Then

: &lt;math&gt; T_E = \frac{ 2\log( N ) } { Var( r ) } ( \log( K ) - \frac{ \log( N ) } { 2 }) &lt;/math&gt;

where T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean time to local extinction.

The probability of extinction by time ''t'' is

: &lt;math&gt; P( t ) = 1 - e^{ \frac{ t } { T_E } } &lt;/math&gt;

===Minimum population size required to avoid extinction===

If a population is [[lognormal distribution|lognormally distributed]] then the [[harmonic mean]] of the population size (''H'') is related to the [[arithmetic mean]] (''m'')&lt;ref name=Pertoldi2008&gt;Pertoldi C, Bach LA, Loeschcke V (2008) On the brink between extinction and persistence. Biol Direct 3: 47 doi: 10.1186/1745-6150-3-47&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; H = m - am^{ ( b - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

Given that ''H'' must be &gt; 0 for the population to persist then rearranging we have

: &lt;math&gt; m &gt; a^{ \frac{ 1 }{ 2 - b } } &lt;/math&gt;

is the minimum size of population for the species to persist.

The assumption of a lognormal distribution appears to apply to about half of a sample of 544 species.&lt;ref name=Halley2002&gt;Halley J, Inchausti P (2002) Lognormality in ecological time series. Oikos 99:518–530. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.11962.x&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it is at least a plausible assumption.

===Sampling size estimators===

The degree of precision (''D'') is defined to be ''s'' / ''m'' where ''s'' is the [[standard deviation]] and ''m'' is the mean. The degree of precision is known as the [[coefficient of variation]] in other contexts. In ecology research it is recommended that ''D'' be in the range 10-25%.&lt;ref name=Southwood2000&gt;Southwood TRE &amp; Henderson PA (2000) Ecological methods. 3rd ed. Blackwood, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; The desired degree of precision is important in estimating the required sample size where an investigator wishes to test if Taylor's law applies to the data. The required sample size has been estimated for a number of simple distributions but where the population distribution is not known or cannot be assumed more complex formulae may needed to determine the required sample size.

Where the population is Poisson distributed the sample size (''n'') needed is

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 / m &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is critical level of the [[Student's t-distribution|t distribution]] for the type 1 error with the [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] that the mean (''m'') was calculated with.

If the population is distributed as a [[negative binomial distribution]] then the required sample size is

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 ( m + k ) / ( mk ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the parameter of the negative binomial distribution.

A more general sample size estimator has also been proposed&lt;ref name=Service1971&gt;Service MW (1971) Studies on sampling larval populations of the ''Anopheles gambiae'' complex. Bull World Health Organ 45: 169-180&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 a m^{( b - 2 )} &lt;/math&gt;

where a and b are derived from Taylor's law.

An alternative has been proposed by Southwood&lt;ref name=Southwood1978&gt;Southwood TRE (1978) Ecological methods. Chapman &amp; Hall, London, England&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = a m^b / D^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the required sample size, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients and ''D'' is the desired degree of precision.

Karandinos proposed two similar estimators for ''n''.&lt;ref name=Karandinos1976&gt;Karandinos MG (1976) Optimum sample size and comments on some published formulae. Bull Entomol Soc Am 22:417-421&lt;/ref&gt; The first was modified by Ruesink to incorporate Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Ruesink1980&gt;Ruesink WG (1980) Introduction to sampling theory, in Kogan M &amp; Herzog DC (eds.) Sampling Methods in Soybean Entomology. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc, New York. pp 61-78&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / d_m )^2 a m^{( b - 2 )} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the ratio of half the desired confidence interval (''CI'') to the mean. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; d_m = \frac { CI } { 2m } &lt;/math&gt;

The second estimator is used in binomial (presence-absence) sampling. The desired sample size (''n'') is

&lt;math&gt; n = ( t / d_p )^2 p^{ -1 } q &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is ratio of half the desired confidence interval to the proportion of sample units with individuals, ''p'' is proportion of samples containing individuals and ''q'' = 1 - ''p''. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; d_p = \frac { CI } { 2p } &lt;/math&gt;

For binary (presence/absence) sampling, Schulthess ''et al'' modified Karandinos' equation

&lt;math&gt; N = \left( \frac{ t } { D_{ pi } } \right)^2 \frac{ 1 - p }{ p } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the required sample size, ''p'' is the proportion of units containing the organisms of interest, ''t'' is the chosen level of significance and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;ip&lt;/sub&gt; is a parameter derived from Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Schulthess1991&gt;Schulthess F, Bosque-Péreza NA, Gounoua S (1991) Sampling lepidopterous pests on maize in West Africa. Bull Entomol Res 81 (3) 297-301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequential sampling===

[[Sequential analysis]] is a method of [[statistical analysis]] where the sample size is not fixed in advance. Instead samples are taken in accordance with a predefined [[stopping rule]]. Taylor's law has been used to derive a number of stopping rules.

A formula for fixed precision in serial sampling to test Taylor's law was derived by Green in 1970.&lt;ref name=Bisseleua2011&gt;Bisseleua DHB, Yede, &amp; Vida S (2011) Dispersion models and sampling of cacao mirid bug ''Sahlbergella singularis'' (Hemiptera: Miridae) on theobroma cacao in southern Cameroon. Environ Entomol 40(1): 111-119&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \log T = \frac{\log ( D^2 ) - a }{ b - 2 } + (\log n) \frac{ b - 1 }{ b - 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the cumulative sample total, ''D'' is the level of precision, ''n'' is the sample size and ''a'' and ''b'' are obtained from Taylor's law.

As an aid to pest control Wilson ''et al'' developed a test that incorporated a threshold level where action should be taken.&lt;ref name=Wilson1985&gt;Wilson LT, Gonzalez D &amp; Plant RE(1985) Predicting sampling frequency and economic status of spider mites on cotton. Proc. Beltwide Cotton Prod Res Conf, National Cotton Council of America, Memphis, TN pp 168-170&lt;/ref&gt; The required sample size is

: &lt;math&gt; n = t | m - T |^{ - 2} a m^b &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor coefficients, || is the [[absolute value]], ''m'' is the sample mean, ''T'' is the threshold level and ''t'' is the critical level of the t distribution. The authors also provided a similar test for binomial (presence-absence) sampling

: &lt;math&gt; n = t | m - T |^{ -2 } p q &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the probability of finding a sample with pests present and ''q'' = 1 - ''p''.

Green derived another sampling formula for sequential sampling based on Taylor's law&lt;ref name=Green1970&gt;Green RH (1970) On fixed precision level sequential sampling. Res Pop Ecol 12 (2) 249-251 {{doi|10.1007/BF02511568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; D = ( a n^{ 1 - b } T^{ b - 2 } )^ { 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the degree of precision, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients, ''n'' is the sample size and ''T'' is the total number of individuals sampled.

Serra ''et al'' have proposed a stopping rule based on Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Serraa2012&gt;Serraa GV, La Porta NC, Avalos S, Mazzuferi V (2012) Fixed-precision sequential sampling plans for estimating alfalfa caterpillar, ''Colias lesbia'', egg density in alfalfa, ''Medicago sativa'', fields in Córdoba, Argentina. J Insect Sci 13: 41&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; T_n \ge \left( \frac{ a n^{ 1 - b } }{ D^2 } \right)^{ \frac{ 1 } { 2 - b } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the parameters from Taylor's law, ''D'' is the desired level of precision and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size.

Serra ''et al'' also proposed a second stopping rule based on Iwoa's regression

&lt;math&gt; T_n \ge \frac{ \alpha - 1 }{ D^2 - \frac{ \beta - 1 }{ n } }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' and ''β'' are the parameters of the regression line, ''D'' is the desired level of precision and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size.

The authors recommended that ''D'' be set at 0.1 for studies of population dynamics and ''D'' = 0.25 for pest control.

==Related analyses==

It is considered to be good practice to estimate at least one additional analysis of aggregation (other than Taylor's law) because the use of only a single index may be misleading.&lt;ref name=Myers1978&gt;Myers JH (1978). Selecting a measure of dispersion. Environ Entomol 7: 619–621&lt;/ref&gt; Although a number of other methods for detecting relationships between the variance and mean in biological samples have been proposed, to date none have achieved the popularity of Taylor's law. The most popular analysis used in conjunction with Taylor's law is probably Iowa's Patchiness regression test but all the methods listed here have been used in the literature.

===Barlett–Iawo model===

Barlett in 1936&lt;ref name=Bartlett1936 /&gt; and later Iawo independently in 1968&lt;ref name=Iwao1968a&gt;Iwao S (1968) A new regression method for analyzing the aggregation pattern of animal populations. Res Popul Ecol 10: 1–20&lt;/ref&gt; both proposed an alternative relationship between the variance and the mean. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; s_i^2 = am_i + bm_i^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the variance in the ''i''th sample and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean of the ''i''th sample

When the population follows a [[negative binomial distribution]], ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' (the exponent of the negative binomial distribution).

This alternative formulation has not been found to be as good a fit as Taylor's law in most studies.

===Nachman model===

Nachman proposed a relationship between the mean density and the proportion of samples with zero counts:&lt;ref name=Nachman1981&gt;Nachman G (1981) A mathematical model of the functional relationship between density and spatial distribution of a population. J Anim Ecol 50: 453–460&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; p_0 = \exp( -a m^b ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of the sample with zero counts, ''m'' is the mean density, ''a'' is a scale parameter and ''b'' is a dispersion parameter. If ''a'' = ''b'' = 0 the distribution is random. This relationship is usually tested in its logarithmic form

: &lt;math&gt; \log m = c + d \log p_0 &lt;/math&gt;

Allsop used this relationship along with Taylor's law to derive an expression for the proportion of infested units in a sample&lt;ref name=Allsopp1991&gt;Allsopp PG (1991) Binomial sequential sampling of adult ''Saccharicoccus sacchari'' on sugarcane. Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 60 (3) 213–218&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P_1 = 1 - \exp\left( -\exp\left( \frac{ \frac{ \log_e \left( \frac{ A^2 } a \right) }{ b - 2 } + \log_e( n )\left( \frac{ b - 1 }{ b - 2 } - 1 \right) - c } d \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; N = n P_1 &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; A^2 = \frac{D^2}{z^2_{\alpha/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the degree of precision desired, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;α/2&lt;/sub&gt; is the upper α/2 of the normal distribution, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients, ''c'' and ''d'' are the Nachman coefficients, ''n'' is the sample size and ''N'' is the number of infested units.

===Kono–Sugino equation===

Binary sampling is not uncommonly used in ecology. In 1958 Kono and Sugino derived an equation that relates the proportion of samples without individuals to the mean density of the samples.&lt;ref name=Kono1958&gt;Kono T &amp; Sugino T (1958) On the estimation of density of rice stem infested by the rice stem borer. Japanese J Appl Entomol and Zool 2: 184&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \log( m ) = \log( a ) + b \log( - \log( p_0 ) ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of the sample with no individuals, ''m'' is the mean sample density, ''a'' and ''b'' are constants. Like Taylor's law this equation has been found to fit a variety of populations including ones that obey Taylor's law. Unlike the negative binomial distribution this model is independent of the mean density.

The derivation of this equation is straightforward. Let the proportion of empty units be ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and assume that these are distributed exponentially. Then

&lt;math&gt; p_0 = \exp( -A m^B ) &lt;/math&gt;

Taking logs twice and re arranging, we obtain the equation above. This model is the same as that proposed by Nachman.

The advantage of this model is that it does not require counting the individuals but rather their presence or absence. Counting individuals may not be possible in many cases particularly where insects are the matter of study.

;Note

The equation was derived while examining the relationship between the proportion ''P'' of a series of rice hills infested and the mean severity of infestation&amp;nbsp;''m''. The model studied was

: &lt;math&gt; P = 1 - a e^{ b m } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are empirical constants. Based on this model the constants ''a'' and ''b'' were derived and a table prepared relating the values of ''P'' and&amp;nbsp;''m''

;Uses

The predicted estimates of ''m'' from this equation are subject to bias&lt;ref name=Binns1990&gt;Binns MR &amp; Bostonian NJ (1990) Robustness in empirically based binomial decision rules for integrated pest management. J Econ Entomol 83: 420–442&lt;/ref&gt; and it is recommended that the adjusted mean ( ''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ) be used instead&lt;ref name=Nachman1984&gt;Nachman G (1984) Estimates of mean population density and spatial distribution of ''Tetranychus urticae'' (Acarina: Tetranychidae) and ''Phytoseiulus persimilis'' (Acarina: Phytoseiidae) based upon the proportion of empty sampling units. ''J Appl Ecolog'' 21: 903-991&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; m_a = m \left( 1 - \frac { \operatorname{var}( \log( m_i ) ) } 2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where var is the variance of the sample unit means ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m'' is the overall mean.

An alternative adjustment to the mean estimates is&lt;ref name=Nachman1984/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; m_a = m e^{ ( \text{MSE} / 2 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where MSE is the mean square error of the regression.

This model may also be used to estimate stop lines for enumerative (sequential) sampling. The variance of the estimated means is&lt;ref name=Schaalje1991&gt;Schaalje GB, Butts RA, Lysyk TL (1991) Simulation studies of binomial sampling: a new variance estimator and density pre&amp;ctor, with special reference to the Russian wheat aphid (Homoptera: Aphididae). J Econ Entomol 84: 140–147&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}( m ) = m^2 ( c_1 + c_2 - c_3 + MSE ) &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; c_1 = \frac{ \beta^2 ( 1 - p_0 ) }{ n p_0 \log_e( p_0 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; c_2 = \frac{ \text{MSE} } { N } + s_{\beta}^2 ( \log_e( \log_e( p_0 ) ) - p^2 ) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; c_3 = \frac{ \exp( a + ( b - 2 )[\alpha - \beta \log_e( p_0 ) ] ) } n &lt;/math&gt;

where MSE is the [[mean square error]] of the regression, ''α'' and ''β'' are the constant and slope of the regression respectively, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the slope of the regression, ''N'' is the number of points in the regression, ''n'' is the number of sample units and ''p'' is the mean value of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the regression. The parameters ''a'' and ''b'' are estimated from Taylor's law:

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a + b \log_e( m ) &lt;/math&gt;

===Hughes–Madden equation===

Hughes and Madden have proposed testing a similar relationship applicable to binary observations in cluster, where each cluster contains from 0 to n individuals.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; var_\text{obs} = a p^b ( 1 - p )^c &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are constants, ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the observed variance, and p is the proportion of individuals with a trait (such as disease), an estimate of the probability of an individual with a trait. In logarithmic form, this relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; \log( \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} ) = \log( a ) + b \log( p ) + c \log( 1 - p ) .&lt;/math&gt;

In most cases, it is assumed that ''b = c'', leading to a simple model

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} = a ( p( 1 - p ) )^b &lt;/math&gt;

This relationship has been subjected to less extensive testing than Taylor's law. However, it has accurately described over 100 data sets, and there are no published examples reporting that it does not works.&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"/&gt;

A variant of this equation was proposed by Shiyomi et al. (&lt;ref name=Shiyomi1998&gt;Shiyomi M, Egawa T, Yamamoto Y (1998) Negative hypergeometric series and Taylor's power law in occurrence of plant populations in semi-natural grassland in Japan. Proceedings of the 18th International Grassland Congress on grassland management. The Inner Mongolia Univ Press pp 35–43 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;) who suggested testing the regression

: &lt;math&gt; \log( \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} / n^2 ) = a + b \log( p ( 1 - p ) / n ) &lt;/math&gt;

where var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance, ''a'' and ''b'' are the constants of the regression, ''n'' here is the sample size (not sample per cluster) and ''p'' is the probability of a sample containing at least one individual.

===Negative binomial distribution model===

A negative binomial model has also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Wilson1983&gt;Wilson L T &amp; Room PM (1983) Clumping patterns of fruit and arthropods in cotton, with implications for binomial sampling. Environ Entomol 12: 50–54&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersion parameter (''k'') using the method of moments is ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – ''m'' ) and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of samples with counts &gt; 0. The ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; used in the calculation of ''k'' are the values predicted by Taylor's law. ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is plotted against 1 - ( ''k'' ( ''k'' + ''m'' ) &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and the fit of the data is visually inspected.

Perry and Taylor have proposed an alternative estimator of ''k'' based on Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Perry1986&gt;Perry JN &amp; Taylor LR(1986). Stability of real interacting populations in space and time: implications, alternatives and negative binomial. J Animal Ecol 55: 1053–1068&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 1/k = am^{ b - 2 } - 1 / m&lt;/math&gt;

A better estimate of the dispersion parameter can be made with the method of [[maximum likelihood]]. For the negative binomial it can be estimated from the equation&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sum \frac { A_x } { k + x } = N \log( 1 + m / k ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of samples with more than ''x'' individuals, ''N'' is the total number of individuals, ''x'' is the number of individuals in a sample, ''m'' is the mean number of individuals per sample and ''k'' is the exponent. The value of ''k'' has to be estimated numerically.

Goodness of fit of this model can be tested in a number of ways including using the chi square test. As these may be biased by small samples an alternative is the ''U'' statistic – the difference between the variance expected under the negative binomial distribution and that of the sample. The expected variance of this distribution is ''m'' + ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''k'' and

: &lt;math&gt; U = s^2 - m + m^2 / k &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the sample variance, ''m'' is the sample mean and ''k'' is the negative binomial parameter.

The variance of U is&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}( U ) = 2m p^2 q \left( \frac { 1 - R^2 } {-\log( 1 - R ) - R } \right) + p^4 \frac { (1 - R)^{-k} - 1 - kR } { N ( -\log( 1 - R ) - R)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' = ''m'' / ''k'', ''q'' = 1 + ''p'', ''R'' = ''p'' / ''q'' and ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the sample. The expected value of ''U'' is 0. For large sample sizes ''U'' is distributed normally.

Note: The negative binomial is actually a family of distributions defined by the relation of the mean to the variance

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 = \mu + a \mu^p &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''p'' are constants. When ''a'' = 0 this defines the Poisson distribution. With ''p'' = 1 and ''p'' = 2, the distribution is known as the NB1 and NB2 distribution respectively.

This model is a version of that proposed earlier by Barlett.

===Tests for a common dispersion parameter===

The dispersion parameter (''k'')&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; k = m^2 / ( s^2 - m ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance. If ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is &gt; 0 the population is considered to be aggregated; ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 the population is considered to be random; and if ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is &lt; 0 the population is considered to be uniformly distributed.
 
Southwood has recommended regressing ''k'' against the mean and a constant&lt;ref name=Southwood1978 /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; k_i = a + b m_i &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the dispersion parameter and the mean of the ith sample respectively to test for the existence of a common dispersion parameter (''k''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;). A slope (''b'') value significantly &gt; 0 indicates the dependence of ''k'' on the mean density.

An alternative method was proposed by Elliot who suggested plotting ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''m'' ) against ( ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''n'' ).&lt;ref name=Elliot1977a&gt;Elliot JM (1977) Some methods for the statistical analysis of samples of benthic invertebrates. 2nd ed. Freshwater Biological Association, Cambridge, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to 1/slope of this regression.

===Charlier coefficient===

This coefficient (''C'') is defined as

&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{ 100 ( s^2 - m )^{0.5} } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

If the population can be assumed to be distributed in a negative binomial fashion, then ''C'' = 100 (1/''k'')&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; where ''k'' is the dispersion parameter of the distribution.

===Cole's index of dispersion===

This index (''I''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined as&lt;ref name=Cole1946&gt;Cole LC (1946) A theory for analyzing contagiously distributed populations. Ecol 27: 329–341&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ \Sigma x^2 }{ ( \Sigma x )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The usual interpretation of this index is as follows: values of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1, 1, &gt; 1 are taken to mean a uniform distribution, a random distribution or an aggregated distribution.

Because ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Σ x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (Σx)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the index can also be written

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ s^2 + ( nm )^2 }{ ( nm )^2 } = \frac{ 1 }{ n^2} \frac{ s^2 }{ m^2 } + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

If Taylor's law can be assumed to hold, then

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ a m^{ b - 2 } }{ n^2 } + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Lloyd's indexes===

Lloyd's index of mean crowding (''IMC'') is the average number of other points contained in the sample unit that contains a randomly chosen point.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1967&gt;Lloyd M (1967) Mean crowding. J Anim Ecol 36: 1–30&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IMC } = m + s^2 / m - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance.

Lloyd's index of patchiness (''IP'')&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IP } = \text{IMC} / m &lt;/math&gt;

It is a measure of pattern intensity that is unaffected by thinning (random removal of points). This index was also proposed by Pielou in 1988 and is sometimes known by this name also.

Because an estimate of the variance of ''IP'' is extremely difficult to estimate from the formula itself, LLyod suggested fitting a negative binomial distribution to the data. This method gives a parameter ''k''

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = m + \frac{ m^2 }{ k } &lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt; SE( IP ) = \frac{ 1 }{ k^2 } [ \operatorname{var}( k ) + \frac{ k ( k + 1 ) ( k + m ) }{ mq } ] &lt;/math&gt;

where ''SE''(''IP'') is the standard error of the index of patchiness,''var''(''k'') is the variance of the parameter ''k'' and ''q'' is the number of [[quadrat]]s sampled..

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IMC } = m + a^{ -1 } m^{ 1 - b } - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IP } = 1 + a^{ -1 } m^{ - b } - \frac { 1 } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

===Patchiness regression test===

Iwao proposed a patchiness regression to test for clumping&lt;ref name=Iwao1968b&gt;Iwao S &amp; Kuno E (1968) Use of the regression of mean crowding on mean density for estimating sample size and the transformation of data for the analysis of variance. Res Pop Ecology, 10, 210–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ifoulis2006&gt;Ifoulis AA, Savopoulou-Soultani M (2006) Developing optimum sample size and multistage sampling plans for ''Lobesia botrana'' (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) larval infestation and injury in northern Greece. J Econ Entomol 99(5):1890–1898&lt;/ref&gt;

Let

: &lt;math&gt; y_i = m_i + s^2 / m_i - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; here is Lloyd's index of mean crowding.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt; Perform an ordinary least squares regression of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; against&amp;nbsp;''y''.

In this regression the value of the slope (''b'') is an indicator of clumping: the slope&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 if the data is Poisson-distributed. The constant (''a'') is the number of individuals that share a unit of habitat at infinitesimal density and may be &lt; 0, 0 or &gt; 0. These values represent regularity, randomness and aggregation of populations in spatial patterns respectively. A value of ''a'' &lt; 1 is taken to mean that the basic unit of the distribution is a single individual.

Where the statistic ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''m'' is not constant it has been recommended to use instead to regress Lloyd's index against ''am'' + ''bm''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are constants.&lt;ref name=Ho1993&gt;Ho CC (1993) Dispersion statistics and sample size estimates for ''Tetranychus kanzawai'' (Acari: Tetranychidae) on mulberry. Environ Entomol 22: 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The sample size (''n'') for a given degree of precision (''D'') for this regression is given by&lt;ref name="Ho1993"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = \left( \frac{ t }{ D } \right)^2 ( \frac{ a + 1 } { m } + b - 1 )&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is the constant in this regression, ''b'' is the slope, ''m'' is the mean and ''t'' is the critical value of the t distribution.

Iawo has proposed a sequential sampling test based on this regression.&lt;ref name=Iwao1975&gt;Iwao S (1975) A new method of sequential sampling to classify populations relative to a critical density. Res Popul Ecol 16: 281–28&lt;/ref&gt; The upper and lower limits of this test are based on critical densities m&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; where control of a pest requires action to be taken.

: &lt;math&gt; N_u = im_c + t( i ( a + 1 ) m_c + ( b - 1 ) m_c^2 )^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; N_l = im_c - t( i ( a + 1 ) m_c + ( b - 1 ) m_c^2 )^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; are the upper and lower bounds respectively, ''a'' is the constant from the regression, ''b'' is the slope and ''i'' is the number of samples.

Kuno has proposed an alternative sequential stopping test also based on this regression.&lt;ref name=Kuno1969&gt;Kuno E (1969) A new method of sequential sampling to obtain the population estimates with a fixed level of precision. Res. Pooul. Ecol 11: 127–136&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = \frac { a + 1 } { D^2 - \frac { b - 1 } n } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size, ''D'' is the degree of precision, ''n'' is the number of samples units, a is the constant and b is the slope from the regression respectively.

Kuno's test is subject to the condition that ''n'' ≥ (''b'' − 1) / ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Parrella and Jones have proposed an alternative but related stop line&lt;ref&gt;Parrella MP, Jones VP (1985) Yellow traps as monitoring tools for ''Liriomyza trifolii'' (Diptera: Agromyzidae) in chrysanthemum greenhouses. J Econ Entomol 78, 53-56&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = \left( 1 - \frac { n } { N } \right) \frac { a + 1 } { D^2 - \left( 1 - \frac { n } { N } \right) \frac { b - 1 } { n } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the parameters from the regression, ''N'' is the maximum number of sampled units and ''n'' is the individual sample size.

===Morisita’s index of dispersion===

Morisita's index of dispersion ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ) is the scaled probability that two points chosen at random from the whole population are in the same sample.&lt;ref name=Morisita1959&gt;Morisita M (1959) Measuring the dispersion and the analysis of distribution patterns. Memoires of the Faculty of Science, Kyushu University Series E. Biol 2:215–235&lt;/ref&gt; Higher values indicate a more clumped distribution.

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = \frac { \sum x ( x - 1 ) } { n m ( m - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative formulation is

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = n \frac{ \sum x^2 - \sum x } { ( \sum x )^2 - \sum x } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the total sample size, ''m'' is the sample mean and ''x'' are the individual values with the sum taken over the whole sample.
It is also equal to

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = \frac { n IMC } { ( nm - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''IMC'' is Lloyd's index of crowding.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt;

This index is relatively independent of the population density but is affected by the sample size. Values &gt; 1 indicate clumping; values &lt; 1 indicate a uniformity of distribution and a value of 1 indicates a random sample.

Morisita showed that the statistic&lt;ref name="Morisita1959"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_m ( \sum x - 1 ) + n - \sum x &lt;/math&gt;

is distributed as a chi squared variable with ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom.

An alternative significance test for this index has been developed for large samples.&lt;ref name=Pedigo1994&gt;Pedigo LP &amp; Buntin GD (1994) Handbook of sampling methods for arthropods in agriculture. CRC Boca Raton FL&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; z = \frac { I_m - 1 } { ( 2 / n m^2 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the overall sample mean, ''n'' is the number of sample units and ''z'' is the normal distribution [[abscissa]]. Significance is tested by comparing the value of ''z'' against the values of the [[normal distribution]].

A function for its calculation is available in the statistical [[R language]]. [http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/dispindmorisita.html R function]

===Standardised Morisita’s index===

Smith-Gill developed a statistic based on Morisita's index which is independent of both sample size and population density and bounded by −1 and +1. This statistic is calculated as follows&lt;ref name=Smith-Gill1975&gt;Smith-Gill SJ (1975) Cytophysiological basis of disruptive pigmentary patterns in the leopard frog ''Rana pipiens''. II. Wild type and mutant cell specific patterns. J Morphol 146, 35–54&lt;/ref&gt;

First determine Morisita's index ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ) in the usual fashion. Then let ''k'' be the number of units the population was sampled from. Calculate the two critical values

: &lt;math&gt; M_u = \frac { \chi^2_{ 0.975 } - k + \sum x } { \sum x - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; M_c = \frac { \chi^2_{ 0.025 } - k + \sum x } { \sum x - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the chi square value for ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom at the 97.5% and 2.5% levels of confidence.

The standardised index ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ) is then calculated from one of the formulae below

When ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = 0.5 + 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - M_c } { k - M_c } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 1

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - 1 } { M_u - 1 } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When 1 &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = -0.5 ( \frac { I_d - 1 } { M_u - 1 } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When 1 &gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = -0.5 + 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - M_u } { M_u } ) &lt;/math&gt;

''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ranges between +1 and −1 with 95% confidence intervals of ±0.5. ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; has the value of 0 if the pattern is random; if the pattern is uniform, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 and if the pattern shows aggregation, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.

===Southwood's index of spatial aggregation===

Southwood's index of spatial aggregation (''k'') is defined as

: &lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{k} = \frac{m^*}{m} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mean of the sample and ''m''* is Lloyd's index of crowding.&lt;ref name=Southwood1978 /&gt;

===Fisher's index of dispersion===

Fisher's [[index of dispersion]]&lt;ref name=Elliot1977b&gt;Elliot JM (1977) Statistical analysis of samples of benthic invertebrates. Freshwater Biological Association. Ambleside&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher1925&gt;Fisher RA (1925) Statistical methods for research workers. Hafner, New York&lt;/ref&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ID} = \frac{( n - 1 ) s^2 }{ m } &lt;/math&gt;

This index may be used to test for over dispersion of the population. It is recommended that in applications n &gt; 5&lt;ref name=Hoel1943&gt;Hoel P (1943) On the indices of dispersion. Ann Math Statist 14: 155&lt;/ref&gt; and that the sample total divided by the number of samples is &gt; 3. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { \sum x } { n } &gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is an individual sample value. The expectation of the index is equal to ''n'' and it is distributed as the [[chi-square distribution]] with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 degrees of freedom when the population is Poisson distributed.&lt;ref name=Hoel1943 /&gt; It is equal to the scale parameter when the population obeys the [[gamma distribution]].

It can be applied both to the overall population and to the individual areas sampled individually. The use of this test on the individual sample areas should also include the use of a Bonferroni correction factor.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ID } = ( n - 1 ) a m^{ b - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

===Index of cluster size===

The index of cluster size (''ICS'') was created by David and Moore.&lt;ref name=David1954&gt;David FN &amp; Moore PG (1954) Notes on contagious distributions in plant populations. Ann Bot of London 18:47-53&lt;/ref&gt; Under a random (Poisson) distribution ''ICS'' is expected to equal 0. Positive values indicate a clumped distribution; negative values indicate a uniform distribution.

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ICS } = s^2 / m - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance and ''m'' is the mean.

If the population obeys Taylor's law

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ICS } = a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The ''ICS'' is also equal to Katz's test statistic divided by ( ''n'' / 2 )&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''n'' is the sample size. It is also related to Clapham's test statistic. It is also sometimes referred to as the clumping index.

===Green’s index===

Green's index (''GI'') is a modification of the index of cluster size that is independent of ''n'' the number of sample units.&lt;ref name=Green1966&gt;Green RH (1966) Measurement of non-randomness in spatial distributions. Res Pop Ecol 8:1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; C_x = \frac { s^2 / m - 1 } { nm - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

This index equals 0 if the distribution is random, 1 if it is maximally aggregated and −1 / ( ''nm'' − 1 ) if it is uniform.

The distribution of Green's index is not currently known so statistical tests have been difficult to devise for it.

If the population obeys Taylor's law

: &lt;math&gt; C_x = \frac { a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 } { ( nm - 1 ) }&lt;/math&gt;

===Binary dispersal index===

Binary sampling (presence/absence) is frequently used where it is difficult to obtain accurate counts. The dispersal index (''D'') is used when the study population is divided into a series of equal samples ( number of units = ''N'': number of units per sample = ''n'': total population size = ''n'' x ''N'' ).&lt;ref name=Gottwald2007&gt;Gottwald TR, Bassanezi RB, Amorim L, Bergamin-Filho A (2007) Spatial pattern analysis of citrus canker-infected plantings in São Paulo, Brazil, and augmentation of infection elicited by the Asian leafminer. Phytopathology 97(6):674–683&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical variance of a sample from a population with a binomial distribution is

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = n p ( 1 - p ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance, ''n'' is the number of units sampled and ''p'' is the mean proportion of sampling units with at least one individual present. The dispersal index (''D'') is defined as the ratio of observed variance to the expected variance. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; D = \frac {var_{ obs } } { var_{ bin } } = \frac{ s^2 } { n p ( 1 - p ) }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''var''&lt;sub&gt;''obs''&lt;/sub&gt; is the observed variance and ''var''&lt;sub&gt;''bin''&lt;/sub&gt; is the expected variance. The expected variance is calculated with the overall mean of the population. Values of ''D'' &gt; 1 are considered to suggest aggregation. ''D''( ''n'' − 1 ) is distributed as the chi squared variable with ''n'' - 1 degrees of freedom where ''n'' is the number of units sampled.

An alternative test is the ''C'' test.&lt;ref name=Hughes1993&gt;Hughes G &amp; Madden LV (1993) Using the beta-binomial distribution to describe aggregated patterns of disease incidence. Phytopathology 83:759−763&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; C = \frac { D( n N - 1 ) - n N } { ( 2 N ( n^2 - n ) ) ^{ 1 / 2 } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the dispersal index, ''n'' is the number of units per sample and ''N'' is the number of samples. C is distributed normally. A statistically significant value of C indicates [[overdispersion]] of the population.

''D'' is also related to [[intraclass correlation]] ( ρ ) which is defined as&lt;ref name=Fleiss1981&gt;Fleiss JL (1981) Statistical methods for rates and proportions. 2nd ed. Wiley, Newy York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = 1 - \frac{ \sum x_i ( T - x_i ) } { p ( 1 - p ) N T ( T - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the number of organisms per sample, ''p'' is the likelihood of the organism having the sought after property (diseased, pest free, ''etc''), and x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of organism in the ''i''th unit with this property. ''T'' must be the same for all sampled units. In this case with ''n'' constant

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{ D - 1 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

If the data can be fitted with a [[beta-binomial distribution]] then&lt;ref name="Fleiss1981"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; D = 1 + \frac{ ( n - 1 ) \theta }{ 1 + \theta } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the parameter of the distribution.&lt;ref name=Hughes1993 /&gt;

===Ma's population aggregation critical density===

Ma has proposed a parameter (''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) − the population aggregation critical density - to relate population density to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Ma1991&gt;Ma ZS (1991) Further interpreted Taylor’s Power Law and population aggregation critical density. Trans Ecol Soc China (1991) 284–288&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; m_0 = \exp( \frac{ \log ( a ) }{ 1 - b } ) &lt;/math&gt;

==Related statistics==

A number of statistical tests are known that may be of use in applications.

===de Oliveria's statistic===

A related statistic suggested by de Oliveria&lt;ref name=deOliveria1965&gt;de Oliveria T (1965) Some elementary tests for mixtures of discrete distributions, ''in'' Patil, GP ''ed.'', Classical and contagious discrete distributions. Calcutá, Calcutta Publishing Society pp379-384&lt;/ref&gt; is the difference of the variance and the mean.&lt;ref name=Bohning1994&gt;Bohning D (1994) A note on a test for Poisson overdispersion. Biometrica 81(2) 418-419&lt;/ref&gt; If the population is Poisson distributed then

: &lt;math&gt; var( s^2 - m ) = \frac{ 2t^2 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the Poisson parameter, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance, ''m'' is the mean and ''n'' is the sample size. The expected value of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''m'' is zero. This statistic is distributed normally.&lt;ref name=Ping1995&gt;Ping S (1995) Further study on the statistical test to detect spatial pattern. Biometrical J 37(2) 199–203&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Poisson parameter in this equation is estimated by putting ''t'' = ''m'', after a little manipulation this statistic can be written

: &lt;math&gt; O_T = \sqrt { \frac { n - 1 } { 2 } } \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

This is almost identical to Katz's statistic with ( ''n'' - 1 ) replacing ''n''. Again ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is normally distributed with mean 0 and unit variance for large ''n''. This statistic is the same as the Neyman-Scott statistic.

;Note

de Oliveria actually suggested that the variance of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''m'' was ( 1 - 2''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''t'' ) / ''n'' where ''t'' is the Poisson parameter. He suggested that ''t'' could be estimated by putting it equal to the mean (''m'') of the sample. Further investigation by Bohning&lt;ref name="Bohning1994"/&gt; showed that this estimate of the variance was incorrect. Bohning's correction is given in the equations above.

===Clapham's test===

In 1936 Clapham proposed using the ratio of the variance to the mean as a test statistic (the relative variance).&lt;ref name=Clapham1936&gt;Clapham AR (1936) Overdispersion in grassland communities and the use of statistical methods in plant ecology. J Ecol 14: 232&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{ s^2 }{ m } &lt;/math&gt;

For a Possion distribution this ratio equals 1. To test for deviations from this value he proposed testing its value against the chi square distribution with ''n'' degrees of freedom where ''n'' is the number of sample units. The distribution of this statistic was studied further by Blackman&lt;ref name=Blackman1942&gt;Blackman GE (1942) Statistical and ecological studies on the distribution of species in plant communities. I. Dispersion as a factor in the study of changes in plant populations. Ann Bot N.s. vi: 351&lt;/ref&gt; who noted that it was approximately normally distributed with a mean of 1 and a variance ( ''V''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; ) of

: &lt;math&gt; V_{ \theta } = \frac{ 2n } { ( n - 1 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The derivation of the variance was re analysed by Bartlett&lt;ref name=Greig-Smith1952&gt;Greig-Smith P (1952) The use of random and contiguous quadrats in the study of the structure of plant communities. Ann. Bot. 16:293-316&lt;/ref&gt; who considered it to be

: &lt;math&gt; V_{ \theta } = \frac{ 2 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

For large samples these two formulae are in approximate agreement. This test is related to the later Katz's ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; statistic.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = am^{ b - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

;Note

A refinement on this test has also been published&lt;ref name=Gosset1986&gt;Gosset E, Louis B (1986) The binning analysis - Towards a better significance test. Astrophysics Space Sci 120 (2) 263-306&lt;/ref&gt; These authors noted that this test tends to detect overdispersion at higher scales even when this was not present in the data. They noted that the use of the multinomial distribution may be more appropriate than the use of a Poisson distribution for such data. The statistic ''θ'' is distributed

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{ s^2 }{ m } = \frac{ 1 } { n } \sum{ ( x_i - \frac{ n }{ N } )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of sample units, ''n'' is the total number of samples examined and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the individual data values.

The expectation and variance of ''θ'' are

: &lt;math&gt; E( \theta ) = \frac{ N } { N - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; Var( \theta ) = \frac{ ( N - 1 )^2 } { N^3 } - \frac { 2N - 3 } { nN^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

For large ''N'' ''E''(θ) is approximately 1 and

: &lt;math&gt; Var( \theta ) \sim\ \frac{ 2 } { N } ( 1 - \frac{ 1 } { n } ) &lt;/math&gt;

If the number of individuals sampled ( ''n'' ) is large this estimate of the variance is in agreement with those derived earlier. However, for smaller samples these latter estimates are more precise and should be used.

The '''visual workplace''' is a continuous improvement paradigm that is closely related to [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]], the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), and [[operational excellence]] yet offers its own comprehensive methodology for significant financial and cultural improvement gains. Introduced by [[Gwendolyn Galsworth]] in her 1997 book ''Visual Systems,''.,&lt;ref name="Galsworth, Gwendolyn 1997"&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (1997) ''Visual Systems: Harnessing the Power of a Visual Workplace'' AMACOM {{ISBN|978-0814403204}}&lt;/ref&gt; this system integrates and codifies the many iterations of visuality in the world of continuous improvement.

==Brief History of Visual Information Sharing==

Visual communication rests on the natural inclination of humans to use pictures, graphics, and other images to quickly and simply convey meaning and understand information. For instance, look at the practices and applications that civil engineers have developed to handle complex human interaction on our roads and highways,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices''] Retrieved on 22 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the entire field of [[wayfinding]] in public spaces &lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp_rpt_052.pdf ''Wayfinding &amp; Signing Guidelines for Airport Terminals''] Retrieved 23 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same logic eventually migrated into the workplace, notably in post-war Japan, and most saliently at Toyoda Motors where visual applications (visual devices) became a commonplace element in the Toyota Production System (TPS).&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, H. (1995) ''5 Pillars of the Visual Workplace,'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-1563270475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading companies in Japan, such as Canon and Okidata, adopted many of the same practices. However, while visibility was clearly a part of Japan's success solution, it was only noticed—or cited in the literature—as a generalized principle and not a codified system or a framework of thinking. For example, Dr. Robert W. Hall, in his 1983 book, ''Zero Inventories,'' states: "Establishing visibility of all forms of production problems is very important. ...The entire idea is instant communication."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Robert W. (1983). ''Zero Inventories,'' Homewood, Ill., Dow Jones-Irwin {{ISBN|978-0870944611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Japan's JIT (just-in-time) manufacturing approach had an easy-to-understand visual interface: andon (stacked lights) kanban (pick-up tickets for control material quantity), color-coding (to make the match between items), scheduling boards for daily production, easy-to-read labels on shelving, and lines on the floor to trace out locations.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, H.(1988) ''JIT Factory,'' {{ISBN|978-0870944611}} Productivity Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese master practitioners also noted that visual devices made it easy to see the difference between normal and abnormal: "…abnormal conditions and problems need to be obvious enough to catch people's attention. Because of the emphasis on visual methods for quick information transfer, the practice is called ’management by sight’ or ‘visual control’." &lt;ref name=Suzaki&gt;Suzaki, Kiyoshi (1987) ''The New Manufacturing Challenge'' The Free Press {{ISBN|978-1451697551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzaki also compared the responsiveness of a well-tuned production system with the way the human body responds to stimuli and problems: "…Corrective action is taken right away, just as our muscles pull our hand away when we touch a hot plate."&lt;ref name=Suzaki/&gt;

Michel Greif's book, ''The Visual Factory'' &lt;ref&gt;Greif, Michel (1997) ''The Visual Factory'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-0915299676}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferred the name for the first time, though Dr. Greif's theme focused primarily on the ability of visual applications to increase the interest of hourly workers in their own performance and their participation in company improvement activities.

==A Codified System of Visual Functions==
Throughout this period (1983–1991), [[Gwendolyn Galsworth]] was head of training and development at Productivity Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a publishing, training, and consulting firm known for bringing the work of Japan's manufacturing leaders to the United StatesGalsworth headed study missions to Japan and observed visuality in Japan first-hand. She also had the opportunity of working one-on-one with many of Japan's seminal thinkers, including [[Taiichi Ohno]], Ryuji Fukuda, and [[Shigeo Shingo]]. Dr. Shingo personally tasked Galsworth with developing his mistake proofing/poka-yoke methodology for western companies.&lt;ref&gt;Shingo, Shigeo (1986) ''Zero Quality Control'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-0915299072}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the synthesis of all these factors and influences that lead Dr. Galsworth to develop and codify the many threads of visuality into a coherent methodology of the visual workplace.

The visual workplace, then, is an overall operational strategy and philosophy, geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals through visual devices and systems. Galsworth continues to be the main driving force behind the practice and articulation of workplace visuality, along with a network of individuals and companies loosely coupled as visual workplace practitioners around the world. The visual workplace is a large body of knowledge and know-how, with a strong guiding philosophy of continuous improvement with an emphasis on the centrality of the individual in the prosperity of the enterprise.

==Basic Principles==

While virtually all major improvement paradigms in use in the West incorporate some element of visuality, the entire codified set of visual principles and practices, from the foundation of 5S through to visual guarantees (poka-yoke), rests on this definition: "The visual workplace is a self-ordering, self-explaining, self-regulating, and self-improving work environment—where what is supposed to happen does happen, on time, every time, day or night—because of visual devices."&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (2005) ''Visual Workplace, Visual Thinking,'' Visual-Lean Enterprise Press {{ISBN|978-1932516012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visual workplace is defined by devices designed to visually share information about organizational operations in order to make human and machine performance safer, more exact, more repeatable, and more reliable. The more the process becomes visual, the more production velocity increases.&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (2011) ''Work that Makes Sense: Operator-Led Visuality'' Visual-Lean Press {{ISBN|978-1932516302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is accomplished in parallel with generating new levels of employee engagement and contribution, which in turn lead to improved alignment within the enterprise and significant bottom line benefits. In an effective visual workplace, this level of information can be seen and understood without coaching, supervision or the need for an explanation—at best, without speaking a word.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/jobs/the-visual-workplace-and-how-to-build-it.html?_r=0 ''Don't Just Talk About Change, Show It.''] Retrieved 23 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key principle is to install vital information visually as close to the point of use as possible. When a step-by-step methodology is applied, the visual workplace targets the elimination of the seventh waste, ''motion'', defined as ''moving without working.''&lt;ref name="Galsworth, Gwendolyn 1997"/&gt;

Originally implemented and refined in manufacturing settings, the concept of the visual workplace is now taking hold in such wide-ranging venues as libraries&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Christian [http://creativelibrarypractice.org/2013/02/11/library-as-visual-workplace/ ''The Library as Visual Workplace''] Retrieved Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Graban, Mark (2012) ''Lean Hospitals'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|9781439870433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13216">The traditional '''[[potlatch]] among Athabaskan peoples''' was a gathering that combined aspects of competition, peacekeeping and a show of wealth.&lt;ref name="Laurence A. Goldin 1996"&gt;Laurence A. Goldin, ''The Land is Ours'', 1996, Auroroa Films&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The traditional [[Athabaskan]] potlatch had "social, religious and economic significance."&lt;ref name="history"&gt;William Simeone, ''A History of Alaskan Athapaskans'', 1982, Alaska Historical Commission&lt;/ref&gt; It was a gathering that combined aspects of competition, peacekeeping and a show of wealth.&lt;ref name="Laurence A. Goldin 1996"/&gt; During a potlatch, members of the society with a surplus of food and supplies provide these for all members of a [[clan]], and in situations with other clans this sharing of resources is either a competitive showing or one of creating loyalties, and sometimes both simultaneously.

Traditionally the village was centered on the chiefs' house, and this is where potlatches were held. This was because the chief had the biggest cache where the food was stored.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;A.E. Stephan, ''The First Athabascans of Alaska:Strawberries'', 1996, Dorrance Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8059-3883-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many different reasons to hold a potlatch in Athabaskan culture, including the birth of a child, a surplus of food, or a death in the clan. The most elaborate of Athabaskan potlatches was the mortuary or funeral potlatch.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; This marked "the separation of the deceased from society and is the last public expression of grief." &lt;ref name="rifles"&gt;William Simeone, ''Rifles, Blankets, and Beads'', 1995, University of Oklahoma Press, {{ISBN|0-8061-2713-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were slight variations in the funeral and mortuary potlatches depending on the status or role of the member of the clan who had died. Different songs and dances were performed for a warrior than for an elder. Because of the tight-knit manner of a group or clan, usually due to extended family ties,&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; the death of an elder, in particular, had a very large effect on the tribe. The [[cadaver|corpse]] would first be dressed by the women of the clan and be  prepared, while the mobilizing and putting together of the funeral would be taken care of by the closest male relative of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone, Identity 183&lt;/ref&gt; The preparations would differ but the proceedings of the funerals themselves were generally similar.

The potlatch generally consisted of "the feast, dancing &amp; singing, oratory, and the distribution of gifts".&lt;ref&gt;Simeone, Identity 210&lt;/ref&gt; The feast was provided by a wealthier member of the group to communicate "sentiment, affection, familiarity and goodwill."&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; Dancing and singing were a reciprocation of the guests to the hosts for their generosity. Stories were told in the same manner, and for entertainment. The act of giving out gifts was possibly the most dynamic aspect of the traditional Athabaskan potlatch. This was a generous act of sharing one's wealth with the rest of the tribe, and simultaneously a show of the abundance and superiority of the host.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

Modern potlatches still contain many of the traditional aspects of sharing food, giving gifts, singing, dancing and telling stories, but now the purpose has changed. Most modern potlatches can be held for similar reasons, such as a birth or a death, but now they are no longer so much a show of wealth, but a celebration to keep the tradition alive.

==Food==
As with other aspects of the potlatch, food plays a significant role in the social structure; providing large amounts of food for the guests is symbolic of the host's love and care for his guests, and also for the nourishment he symbolically provides to future generations.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; Due to the overabundance of food, leftovers are distributed first to elders, then the remainder of the guests. According to Simeone, doing so is "a reminder of the host's generosity long after the event."&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

=== Preparation ===
As the potlatch is attended by dozens to hundreds of people from neighboring villages, and is often hosted by one or two people, food and money are given as a gift to the host by family members, to help offset the cost of feeding so many.&lt;ref name="crow" &gt;Thomas Mishler, ''Crow is my Boss: the oral history of a Tanacross Athabaskan elder'', University of Oklahoma Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Several men of the village are tasked with hunting moose specifically for a potlatch; it is not uncommon for three or more moose to be killed to feed the guests over the two or three days feasting. One account of a potlatch in the village of [[Tetlin, Alaska|Tetlin]] claimed 22 moose were killed and butchered in preparation of a particularly large feast.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; In addition to moose meat, many other types of wild food are harvested or donated, such as beaver, duck, salmon, and berries. Traditional [[subsistence]] foods provide a reminder of the relationship between the Athabaskan and the land which has historically sustained them.

=== Meals ===
Breakfast and lunch are served each day for potlatch attendees and are less formal than the evening meal. Breakfast is offered each morning; eggs, bacon, coffee, and potatoes are common fare. Lunch consists of soup, sandwiches, and tea.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; The evening meal is scheduled for a specific time and all potlatch attendees are expected to attend. It is the most significant spiritual and social event of the potlatch and is treated as such by the attendees. Large rolls of white butcher paper are rolled out on the floor to serve as place settings and many participants sit next to each other on the floor. Benches and chairs are provided for elders.

=== Types ===
Moose is normally cooked by the men of the potlatch. It is served roasted, fried, and as moose head stew, which consists of the meaty portions of the moose's head mixed with vegetables and rice in large stew pots. Grilled and smoked salmon is served, as is soup made from [[round whitefish]]. Wild cranberries and blueberries are incorporated into desserts.

The traditional wild food is supplemented by store-bought items, most notably black loose leaf tea, which was introduced to the Athabaskan by traders in the 1800s&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; and remains a staple among present day potlatches. [[Bannock (food)|Bannock]], also known as [[fry bread]], rolls, and salads are also served.

==Dance==
The celebration of dance for the Athabaskan people plays a vital role in the success of a potlatch.  Unlike many cultures that have changed their [[mourning]] over the course of many generations, the Athabaskan people have stayed strong and true to the old ways of song and dance.

Dancing is a very important part of Athabaskan culture, and it is often the focal point of the potlatch, particularly after the evening meal. During potlatches a variety of songs are sung; the first songs sung of the weeklong event are called the mourning songs.  Traditionally new songs are song first to give thanks to the hosts that are sponsoring the potlatch, followed by the singing of old songs.

[[Poldine Carlo]], an Athabaskan from Interior Alaska, noted that "The potlatch usually lasted for a week. The first night we would have a big potlatch at the community hall and then the mourning songs were sung, the new songs first for the ones the potlatch was being given for and then the old, old songs that we have been singing for a long time. The women would stand in line all across the hall and dance."&lt;ref name=nulato&gt;Poldine Carlo, ''Nulato: An Indian Life on the Yukon,'' Fairbanks, Alaska, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

An excerpt from the book ''Rifles, Blankets, &amp; Beads'' tells of "sorry songs" that were sung at a potlatch that took place in [[Tanacross, Alaska|Tanacross]]:  "At one potlatch in Tonacross, for example, a sequence of sorry songs began with one made especially for the person that had just died.  It followed by songs for a young man who died in a house fire 10 years before; a boy who drowned in the river while attempting to draw water and for Elisha's father, who died in the 1960s."&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;file:///home/chronos/u-15985fe980d04ec3ec881e482cd33c8a6e32a755/Downloads/fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The grieving process within the Alaskan Native community is rather unusual, it is shared not just by the family but by both local and neighboring communities.  If one member of the family of the deceased does not show up or is late, this is considered to be such a great insult that tribal chiefs have been known to interrupt potlatches in order to publicly shame those who have arrived late or have not communicated with the rest of the community concerning their loss.  Grieving is expected to be shared, and thus the burden of grief is lifted from the individual to the group.

Dance is the outlet that allows potlatch attendees to vent their grief; "sorry songs" give way to "happy songs" and dances, such as the calico dance, where colorful bolts of cloth are passed among female participants, who dance in a large circle.  Such dances serve to restore harmony among the relationships within the tribe.

==Gifts==
A traditional Athabaskan potlatch is concluded with the giving of gifts.  Valuable trade items, traditionally [[Dentalium (anthropology)|dentalium]] shells, now largely replaced by rifles, [[Hudson's Bay point blanket|blankets]], cash, and beaded items, are collected by the host from members of their mother's [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moiety]] and are redistributed by the host to members of his father's moiety in exchange for their contributions of celebration and participation in the potlatch.  For instance, an exceptional dancer might be rewarded for her abilities, and likewise a grave digger or pallbearer would be compensated at a funeral potlatch.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

At the conclusion of a potlatch, gifts are piled high in the center of the meeting hall and distributed to guests.  By distributing guns and blankets to the assembled guests, the host demonstrates his relationship to and his feelings for his paternal relatives and potential marriage partners. Through these distributions the host gains prestige as he symbolically ensures his guests' existence by giving them guns to hunt with and blankets to keep them warm.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

Beaded items are also commonly given as gifts at potlatches, including necklaces, [[moccasins]], gloves, vests, and gun cases.  Beads, like the dentalium they have come to replace, are symbolic of social relations that, when expressed in the form of necklaces or sashes, literally surround or embrace the individual. Today Tanacross people see dentalium shells not only as symbols of prestige but also as expressions of affection.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

While rifles, blankets and beaded items are traditional potlatch gifts, they are not the only ones.  Other gifts might include furs, afghans, quilts, moose hide jackets, calico, snowshoes, gloves, hats, coffeepots, enameled plates, snow shovels, suitcases, frying pans and many others both practical and symbolic.&lt;ref name="villagers"&gt;Claire Fejes, ''Villagers: Athabaskan Indian Life Along the Yukon River,'' Random House, 1981, {{ISBN|0-394-51673-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dentalium shells and moose hide jackets are often worn by the host while distributing gifts.&lt;ref name="villagers"/&gt; In some communities, gifts are given out while wearing gloves.  If the gloves are kept, it is believed that the wealth will be stored in them, and eventually return to the giver.&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt;

Often a potlatch host will fully deplete their savings and give away their entire material wealth.&lt;ref name="villagers"/&gt; The potlatch is an honorable ceremony, and in giving everything away, the host gains prestige.  A rich man who does not share his possessions is, to an Athabaskan, a stingy man who is to be pitied.&lt;ref name="villagers"/&gt;

'''Thomas Henry Huxley''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PC|PRS|HFRSE|FLS|DCL|LLD|FRS}} (4 May 1825&amp;nbsp;– 29 June 1895) was an English [[biologist]] specialising in [[comparative anatomy]]. He is known as "Darwin's Bulldog" for his advocacy of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica Online|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stories regarding Huxley's [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|famous debate in 1860]] with [[Samuel Wilberforce]] were a key moment in the wider acceptance of [[evolution]] and in his own career, although historians think that the surviving story of the debate is a later fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, David. "Myth 17. That Huxley Defeated Wilberforce in Their Debate over Evolution and Religion," in Numbers, Ronald L., ed. Galileo goes to jail and other myths about science and religion. No. 74. Harvard University Press, 2009, 152-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley had been planning to leave [[Oxford]] on the previous day, but, after an encounter with [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], the author of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'', he changed his mind and decided to join the debate. Wilberforce was coached by [[Richard Owen]], against whom Huxley also debated about whether humans were closely related to apes.

Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, such as [[gradualism]], and was undecided about [[natural selection]], but despite this he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin. Instrumental in developing scientific [[education]] in Britain, he fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition.

Originally coining the term in 1869, Huxley elaborated on "[[agnosticism]]" in 1889 to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not. Huxley states&lt;blockquote&gt;Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle... the fundamental axiom of modern science... In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration... In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. (Feb, 1889). II. Agnosticism. In Christianity and Agnosticism: A controversy. New York, NY: The Humboldt Publishing Co. Retrieved from https://archive.org/stream/agnosticism00variuoft/agnosticism00variuoft_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Use of that term has continued to the present day (see [[Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Huxley T. H. 1889. Agnosticism: a rejoinder. In ''Collected Essays vol 5 Science and Christian tradition''. Macmillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Huxley's agnosticism is influenced by Kantian views on human perception and the ability to rely on rational evidence rather than belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Lightman, B. (1987) ''The Origins of Agnosticism: Victorian Unbelief and the Limits of Knowledge.''. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1086/ahr/94.2.444&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley had little formal schooling and was virtually self-taught. He became perhaps the finest [[comparative anatomy|comparative anatomist]] of the later 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Poulton E. B. 1909. Charles Darwin and the origin of species. London.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked on [[invertebrates]], clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood. Later, he worked on [[vertebrates]], especially on the relationship between apes and humans. After comparing ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' with ''[[Compsognathus]]'', he concluded that [[Evolution of birds|birds]] evolved from small carnivorous [[Theropoda|dinosaurs]], a theory widely accepted today.

The tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favour of evolution, and by his extensive public work on scientific education, both of which had significant effects on society in Britain and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Lankester|Lankester E. Ray]] 1895. The Right Hon. T. H. Huxley. ''Athenaeum'', 6 July. Lankester commented that Huxley was "only accidentally a zoologist".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} 'Huxley in perspective', 235–261, an outstanding summary of Huxley in his social &amp; historical context, scarcely mentions his zoological work.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
Thomas Henry Huxley was born in [[Ealing]], which was then a village in [[Middlesex]]. He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers. Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], Huxley was brought up in a literate middle-class family which had fallen on hard times. His father was a mathematics teacher at Ealing School until it closed,&lt;ref&gt;Bibby, amongst others, queried this account, which owes its origin to Leonard Huxley's biography (1900). Bibby, Cyril. 1959. ''T. H. Huxley: scientist, humanist and educator''. Watts, London. p. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; putting the family into financial difficulties. As a result, Thomas left school at age 10, after only two years of formal schooling. Huxley’s parents were Anglicans, although it was against organized religion Huxley sympathized with the town’s [[Nonconformist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Henry-Huxley Biography] in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=R_8pAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=Bernard+Lightman+Huxley+nonconformist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9BlaUUWIXO&amp;sig=srRakfHTurYMPxQnjG2cYZKk0sQ&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5hdLVlqLaAhVFuVkKHZbmCxYQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bernard%20Lightman%20Huxley%20nonconformist&amp;f=false Victorian Scientific Naturalism: Community, Identity, Continuity.] (2014).
Edited by [[Bernard Lightman]], Gowan Dawson. [[University of Chicago Press]], p.210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this unenviable start, Huxley was determined to educate himself. He became one of the great [[autodidacticism|autodidact]]s of the nineteenth century. At first he read [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[James Hutton]]'s ''Geology'', and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]]'s ''Logic''. In his teens he taught himself [[German language|German]], eventually becoming fluent and used by [[Charles Darwin]] as a translator of scientific material in German. He learned [[Latin language|Latin]],  and enough [[Greek language|Greek]] to read Aristotle in the original.

[[Image:Young Huxley RN.jpg|thumb|Huxley, aged 21]]

Later on, as a young adult, he made himself an expert, first on [[invertebrates]], and later on [[vertebrates]], all self-taught. He was skilled in drawing and did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates. In his later debates and writing on science and religion his grasp of theology was better than most of his clerical opponents. Huxley, a boy who left school at ten, became one of the most knowledgeable men in Britain.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners: at 13 to his brother-in-law John Cooke in Coventry, who passed him on to Thomas Chandler, notable for his experiments using [[animal magnetism|mesmerism]] for medical purposes. Chandler's practice was in London's [[Rotherhithe]] amidst the squalor endured by the [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]ian poor. Here Thomas would have seen poverty, crime and rampant disease at its worst.&lt;ref&gt;Chesney, Kellow 1970. ''The Victorian underworld''. Temple Smith, London; Pelican 1972, pp. 105, 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Next, another brother-in-law took him on: John Salt, his eldest sister's husband. Now 16, Huxley entered Sydenham College (behind [[University College Hospital]]), a cut-price anatomy school whose founder, [[Marshall Hall (physiologist)|Marshall Hall]], discovered the [[reflex arc]]. All this time Huxley continued his programme of reading, which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling.

A year later, buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the [[Society of Apothecaries|Apothecaries']] yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by [[Thomas Wharton Jones]], Professor of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery at [[University College London]]. Jones had been [[Robert Knox]]'s assistant when Knox bought cadavers from [[Burke and Hare]].&lt;ref&gt;The cut-price anatomy schools and Robert Knox are well treated in Desmond's account of materialist medical dissidents of the 1820s and 30s: Desmond A. 1989. ''The politics of evolution: morphology, medicine and reform in radical London''. Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland. He was a fine teacher, up-to-date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon. In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as [[Huxley's layer]]. No doubt remembering this, and of course knowing his merit, later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor.

At twenty he passed his First M.B. examination at the [[University of London]], winning the gold medal for [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. However, he did not present himself for the final (Second M.B.) exams and consequently did not qualify with a university degree. His apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

===Voyage of the ''Rattlesnake''===
Aged 20, Huxley was too young to apply to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] for a licence to practise, yet he was 'deep in debt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; So, at a friend's suggestion, he applied for an appointment in the [[Royal Navy]]. He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy. Sir William Burnett, the Physician General of the Navy, interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence (by means of a ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'')&lt;!-- viva voce links to a disambiguation page, but the best Wikipedia choice might be [[Thesis#Thesis examinations]] which would confuse reader even more ("often an oral examination" - it's always oral); the wiktionary link alternative is worse in it makes the reader think of a dental procedure. Leave this ambiguous for now, until a UK-specific explanation arises. --&gt;.

[[File:Rattlesnake2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|HMS ''Rattlesnake'' by the ship's artist [[Oswald Brierly]]]]

Finally Huxley was made [[surgery|Assistant Surgeon]] ('surgeon's mate', but in practice marine naturalist) to [[HMS Rattlesnake (1822)|HMS ''Rattlesnake'']], about to set sail on a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia. The ''Rattlesnake'' left England on 3 December 1846 and, once they had arrived in the southern hemisphere, Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to send details of his discoveries back to England, where publication was arranged by [[Edward Forbes]] FRS (who had also been a pupil of Knox). Both before and after the voyage Forbes was something of a mentor to Huxley.

Huxley's paper "On the anatomy and the affinities of the family of Medusae" was published in 1849 by the [[Royal Society]] in its ''Philosophical Transactions''. Huxley united the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps with the Medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of ''[[Hydrozoa]]''. The connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers, enclosing a central cavity or stomach. This is characteristic of the [[phylum]] now called the ''[[Cnidaria]]''. He compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals. When at last he got a grant from the Royal Society for the printing of plates, Huxley was able to summarise this work in ''The Oceanic Hydrozoa'', published by the [[Ray Society]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Di Gregorio|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australian woman by Thomas Henry Huxley.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Australian woman: Pencil drawing by Huxley]]

The value of Huxley's work was recognised and, on returning to England in 1850, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, at the age of twenty-six, he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council. He met [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[John Tyndall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1896|Ref=CITEREFTyndall1896|}} pp. 7, 9, 66, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; who remained his lifelong friends. The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant-surgeon, so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the ''Rattlesnake''. He solved the problem of ''[[Appendicularia]]'', whose place in the animal kingdom [[Johannes Peter Müller]] had found himself wholly unable to assign. It and the [[Ascidiacea|Ascidians]] are both, as Huxley showed, [[tunicates]], today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum ''[[Chordata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holland|2007|}} pp. 153–5&lt;/ref&gt; Other papers on the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the [[cephalopod]]s and on [[brachiopod]]s and [[rotifer]]s are also noteworthy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name="foster1903"&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898–1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rattlesnake'''s official naturalist, [[John MacGillivray]], did some work on botany, and proved surprisingly good at notating Australian aboriginal languages. He wrote up the voyage in the standard Victorian two volume format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGillivray|1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Huxley effectively resigned from the navy (by refusing to return to active service) and, in July 1854, he became Professor of Natural History at the [[Royal School of Mines]] and naturalist to the [[British Geological Survey]] in the following year. In addition, he was Fullerian Professor at the [[Royal Institution]] 1855–58 and 1865–67; Hunterian Professor at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] 1863–69; President of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] 1869–1870; President of the [[Quekett Microscopical Club]] 1878; President of the [[Royal Society]] 1883–85; Inspector of Fisheries 1881–85; and President of the [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|Marine Biological Association]] 1884–1890.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The thirty-one years during which Huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life. Huxley retired in 1885, after a bout of depressive illness which started in 1884. He resigned the presidency of the Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair (as soon as he decently could) and took six months' leave. His pension was a fairly handsome £1200 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Henry-Huxley|title=Thomas Henry Huxley {{!}} British biologist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, he moved from London to [[Eastbourne]] where he edited the nine volumes of his ''Collected Essays''. In 1894 he heard of [[Eugene Dubois]]' discovery in Java of the remains of ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (now known as ''[[Homo erectus]]''). Finally, in 1895, he died of a heart attack (after contracting influenza and pneumonia), and was buried in North London at [[East Finchley Cemetery|St Marylebone]]. This small family plot had been purchased upon the death of his beloved youngest son Noel, who died of [[scarlet fever]] in 1860; Huxley's wife Henrietta Anne née Heathorn and son Noel are also buried there. No invitations were sent out, but two hundred people turned up for the ceremony; they included [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[William Henry Flower]], [[Mulford B. Foster]], [[Edwin Lankester]], [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] and, apparently, [[Henry James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley and his wife had five daughters and three sons:

Noel Huxley (1856–1860), died aged 4.
Jessie Oriana Huxley (1856–1927), married architect Fred Waller in 1877.
Marian Huxley (1859–1887), married artist [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]] in 1879.
Leonard Huxley (1860–1933), married Julia Arnold.
Rachel Huxley (1862–1934), married civil engineer Alfred Eckersley in 1884.
Henrietta (Nettie) Huxley (1863–1940), married Harold Roller, travelled Europe as a singer.
Henry Huxley (1865–1946), became a fashionable general practitioner in London.
Ethel Huxley (1866–1941) married artist John Collier (widower of sister) in 1889.

====Public duties and awards====
From 1870 onwards, Huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty. He served on eight [[Royal Commission]]s, from 1862 to 1884. From 1871 to 1880 he was a Secretary of the [[Royal Society]] and from 1883 to 1885 he was president. He was president of the [[Geological Society]] from 1868 to 1870. In 1870, he was president of the [[British Association]] at Liverpool and, in the same year was elected a member of the newly constituted [[London School Board]]. He was president of the [[Quekett Microscopical Club]] from 1877 to 1879. He was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society, persuaded government about science, and established scientific education in British schools and universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before him, science was mostly a gentleman's occupation; after him, science was a profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|Huxley in perspective}} p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the highest honours then open to British men of science. The [[Royal Society]], who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the [[Royal Medal]] the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award. He was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition. Then later in life came the [[Copley Medal]] in 1888 and the [[Darwin Medal]] in 1894; the [[Geological Society]] awarded him the [[Wollaston Medal]] in 1876; the [[Linnean Society]] awarded him the [[Linnean Medal]] in 1890. There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards are listed in the ''Life and Letters''. He turned down many other appointments, notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of [[University College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:T.H.Huxley-1880s.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Huxley &lt;br /&gt;by [[Alexander Bassano|Bassano]] c1883]]

In 1873 the King of Sweden made Huxley, Hooker and Tyndall Knights of the [[Order of the Polar Star]]: they could wear the insignia but not use the title in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1998|}} p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley collected many honorary memberships of foreign societies, academic awards and honorary doctorates from Britain and Germany. He also became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001052 |title=T.H. Huxley (1825 - 1895) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As recognition of his many public services he was given a pension by the state, and was appointed [[Privy Councillor]] in 1892.

Despite his many achievements he was given no award by the British state until late in life. In this he did better than Darwin, who got no award of any kind from the state. (Darwin's proposed knighthood was vetoed by ecclesiastical advisers, including Wilberforce)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps Huxley had commented too often on his dislike of honours, or perhaps his many assaults on the traditional beliefs of organised religion made enemies in the establishment—he had vigorous debates in print with [[Benjamin Disraeli]], [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], and his relationship with [[Lord Salisbury]] was less than tranquil.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was for about thirty years evolution's most effective advocate, and for some Huxley was "''the'' premier advocate of science in the nineteenth century [for] the whole English-speaking world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|1999|}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he had many admirers and disciples, his retirement and later death left British zoology somewhat bereft of leadership. He had, directly or indirectly, guided the careers and appointments of the next generation, but none were of his stature. The loss of [[Francis Maitland Balfour|Francis Balfour]] in 1882, climbing the Alps just after he was appointed to a chair at Cambridge, was a tragedy. Huxley thought he was "the only man who can carry out my work": the deaths of Balfour and [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]] were "the greatest losses to science in our time".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

====Vertebrate palaeontology====

The first half of Huxley's career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for 'persistent types', in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the [[Phanerozoic]]. In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the [[Palaeozoic]] era, and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Much paper has been consumed by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond A. 1982. ''Archetypes and ancestors: palaeontology in Victorian London 1850–1875''. Muller, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of [[order (biology)|orders]] in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Huxley's detailed anatomical work was, as always, first-rate and productive. His work on [[fossil fish]] shows his distinctive approach: whereas pre-Darwinian naturalists collected, identified and classified, Huxley worked mainly to reveal the evolutionary relationships between groups.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Image:Thomas Henry Huxley by Theodore Blake Wirgman.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Huxley by Wirgman&lt;br /&gt;a drawing in pencil, 1882]]

The [[lobed-finned fish]] (such as [[coelacanths]] and [[lung fish]]) have paired appendages whose internal skeleton is attached to the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone, the humerus or femur. His interest in these fish brought him close to the origin of [[tetrapods]], one of the most important areas of vertebrate palaeontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clack|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1861|}} pp. 67–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898–1903|}} pp. 163–187&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of fossil reptiles led to his demonstrating the fundamental affinity of birds and reptiles, which he united under the title of ''[[Sauropsida]]''. His papers on ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and the [[origin of birds]] were of great interest then and still are.&lt;ref name="foster1903"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2002|}} p. 171–224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prum|2003|}} p. 550–561.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his interest in persuading the world that man was a primate, and had descended from the same stock as the apes, Huxley did little work on mammals, with one exception. On his tour of America Huxley was shown the remarkable series of fossil horses, discovered by [[O. C. Marsh]], in [[Yale]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|Peabody Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marsh was part palaeontologist, part robber baron, a man who had hunted buffalo and met [[Red Cloud]] (in 1874). Funded by his uncle [[George Peabody]], Marsh had made some remarkable discoveries:
the huge [[Cretaceous]] aquatic bird ''[[Hesperornis]]'', and the dinosaur footprints along the [[Connecticut River]] were worth the trip by themselves, but the horse fossils were really special.{{According to whom|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Eohippus + Eohomo.gif|thumb|Huxley's sketch of then hypothetical five-toed ''[[Eohippus]]'' being ridden by "Eohomo"]]
The collection at that time went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling ''[[Orohippus]]'' from the [[Eocene]] through three-toed species such as ''[[Miohippus]]'' to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the [[Pleistocene]]: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]]). The modern account of the [[evolution of the horse]] has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.

The horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual, and that the origin of the modern horse lay in North America, not in Eurasia. If so, then something must have happened to horses in North America, since none were there when Europeans arrived. The experience was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin's gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

{{See also|Reaction to Darwin's theory}}

Huxley was originally not persuaded of "development theory", as evolution was once called. This can be seen in his savage review&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1854|}} p.425–439.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', a book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution. Huxley had also rejected [[Jean-Baptiste de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck|Lamarck's]] theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1855|}} p. 82–85.&lt;/ref&gt; which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley's mind. It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley, who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was therefore one of the small group who knew about Darwin's ideas before they were published (the group included [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[Charles Lyell]]). The first publication by Darwin of his ideas came when Wallace sent Darwin his famous paper on natural selection, which was presented by Lyell and Hooker to the [[Linnean Society]] in 1858 alongside excerpts from Darwin's notebook and a Darwin letter to [[Asa Gray]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|Wallace|1858|[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F350&amp;pageseq=1 45–62]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's famous response to the idea of natural selection was "How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}} vol. 1, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he never conclusively made up his mind about whether natural selection was the main method for evolution, though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis.

Logically speaking, the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was devoted. Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of Darwin's way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book's publication.

Huxley's support started with his anonymous favourable review of the ''Origin'' in the ''Times'' for 26 December 1859,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1893-94a|}} pp. 1–20&lt;/ref&gt; and continued with articles in several periodicals, and in a lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] in February 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898–1903|}} p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Richard Owen]], whilst writing an extremely hostile anonymous review of the ''Origin'' in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; also primed [[Samuel Wilberforce]] who wrote one in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'', running to 17,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilberforce|1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of this latter review was not known for sure until Wilberforce's son wrote his biography. So it can be said that, just as Darwin groomed Huxley, so Owen groomed Wilberforce; and both the proxies fought public battles on behalf of their principals as much as themselves. Though we do not know the exact words of the Oxford debate, we do know what Huxley thought of the review in the ''Quarterly'':

[[Image:TH Huxley 41.5 KB.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Caricature of Huxley by&lt;br /&gt;[[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]] in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868–1914)|Vanity Fair]]'' 1871]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since [[Lord Brougham]] assailed Dr [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]], the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most candid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as a "flighty" person, who endeavours "to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation," and whose "mode of dealing with nature" is reprobated as "utterly dishonourable to Natural Science."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the ''Origin of Species'' to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the ''Quarterly Review'' article...&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Francis (ed) 1887. ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin, including an autobiographical chapter''. Murray, London, volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A more complete version is available in [[q:Thomas Henry Huxley|Wikiquote]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley said "I am Darwin's bulldog". While the second half of Darwin's life was lived mainly within his family, the younger combative Huxley operated mainly out in the world at large. A letter from Huxley to Ernst Haeckel (2 November 1871) states: "The dogs have been snapping at [Darwin's] heels too much of late." At Oxford and Cambridge Universities, "Bulldog" was and still is student slang for a university policeman, whose job was to corral errant students and maintain their moral rectitude.

===Debate with Wilberforce===
{{Main|1860 Oxford evolution debate}}

Famously, Huxley responded to Wilberforce in the debate at the [[British Association]] meeting, on Saturday 30 June 1860 at the Oxford University Museum. Huxley's presence there had been encouraged on the previous evening when he met Robert Chambers, the Scottish publisher and author of "Vestiges", who was walking the streets of Oxford in a dispirited state, and begged for assistance.  The debate followed the presentation of a paper by [[John William Draper]], and was chaired by Darwins's former botany tutor [[John Stevens Henslow]]. Darwin's theory was opposed by the Lord Bishop of Oxford, [[Samuel Wilberforce]], and those supporting Darwin included Huxley and their mutual friends [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] and [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Lubbock]]. The platform featured [[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet|Brodie]] and Professor Beale, and [[Robert FitzRoy]], who had been captain of HMS ''Beagle'' during Darwin's voyage, spoke against Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. p. 209, note 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilberforce had a track record against evolution as far back as the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers' ''Vestiges''. For the more challenging task of opposing the ''Origin'', and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by [[Richard Owen]]&amp;nbsp;– Owen stayed with him the night before the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991}} p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; On the day Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his ''Quarterly Review'' article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother's side or his father's side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley's reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate—the exact wording is not certain—was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play.

The letters of [[Alfred Newton]] include one to his brother giving an eye-witness account of the debate, and written less than a month afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Wollaston AFR 1921. ''[https://archive.org/stream/lifeofalfrednewt01woll#page/118/mode/2up Life of Alfred Newton]: late Professor of Comparative Anatomy, Cambridge University 1866–1907, with a Preface by Sir [[Archibald Geikie]] OM''. Dutton, NY. pp. 118–120.&lt;/ref&gt; Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought ''he'' had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. [Chapter 3 is an excellent survey, and its notes gives references to all the eyewitness accounts except Newton: see notes 61, 66, 67, 78, 79, 80, 81, 84, 86, 87, 89, 90, 93, 95: pp. 208–211]&lt;/ref&gt; The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley to Dr FD Dyster, 9 September 1860, Huxley Papers 15.117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|}} p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900|}} Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} pp. 276–281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;{{Harvnb|Lucas|1979|}} p. 313–330. A pro-Wilberforce account; lists many sources, but ''not'' Alfred Newton's letter to his brother. Many of Lucas' points are treated adversely in Jensen 1991, for example, note 77, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1991}} Chapter 26 'Knight takes Bishop?' is Gould's take on the Huxley-Wilberforce debate.&lt;/ref&gt;

One effect of the debate was to increase hugely Huxley's visibility amongst educated people, through the accounts in newspapers and periodicals. Another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate: a lesson he never forgot. A third effect was to serve notice that Darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed: on the contrary, they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin F. (ed) 1897–99. ''Life and letters of Charles Darwin''. 2 vols, Murray, London. I, 156-7 Darwin to Huxley: "It is of enormous importance the showing the world that a few first-rate men are not afraid of expressing their opinion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin F. and A.C.Seward (eds) 1903. ''More letters of Charles Darwin''. 2 vols, Murray, London. II, 204 Leonard Huxley: "The importance... lay in the open resistance that was made to authority".&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science, with its implied need for scientific education. A fifth consequence was indirect: as Wilberforce had feared, a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the [[Old Testament]], especially the [[Book of Genesis]]. Many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate; they were supporters, perhaps, of the controversial ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''. Thus both on the side of science, and on the side of religion, the debate was important, and its outcome significant.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. p. 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[#Schools and the Bible|below]])

That Huxley and Wilberforce remained on courteous terms after the debate (and able to work together on projects such as the Metropolitan Board of Education) says something about both men, whereas Huxley and Owen were never reconciled.

====Man's place in nature====
{{See also|Man's Place in Nature}}

For nearly a decade his work was directed mainly to the relationship of man to the apes. This led him directly into a clash with [[Richard Owen]], a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability. The struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for Owen. Huxley's [[Croonian Lecture]], delivered before the Royal Society in 1858 on ''The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull'' was the start. In this, he rejected Owen's theory that the bones of the skull and the spine were [[homology (biology)|homologous]], an opinion previously held by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Lorenz Oken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898–1903|}} p. 538–606.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:T.H.Huxley 1857.jpg|thumb|THH in 1857|&lt;center&gt;Huxley at 32]]

From 1860–63 Huxley developed his ideas, presenting them in lectures to working men, students and the general public, followed by publication. Also in 1862 a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets, later bound up as a little green book; the first copies went on sale in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1862b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other lectures grew into Huxley's most famous work ''Evidence as to Man's place in Nature'' (1863) where he addressed the key issues long before [[Charles Darwin]] published his ''[[Descent of Man]]'' in 1871.

Although Darwin did not publish his ''Descent of Man'' until 1871, the general debate on this topic had started years before (there was even a precursor debate in the 18th century between [[Monboddo]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]). Darwin had dropped a hint when, in the conclusion to the ''Origin'', he wrote: "In the distant future... light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=506 p. 490].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not so distant, as it turned out. A key event had already occurred in 1857 when [[Richard Owen]] presented (to the Linnean Society) his theory that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus ''Homo''. Having reached this opinion, Owen separated man from all other mammals in a subclass of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1858|}} p. 1–37.&lt;/ref&gt; No other biologist held such an extreme view. Darwin reacted "Man...as distinct from a chimpanzee [as] an ape from a platypus... I cannot swallow that!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burkhardt|1984 onwards (continuing series)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither could Huxley, who was able to demonstrate that Owen's idea was completely wrong.
[[Image:Huxley7.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt; Huxley with sketch&lt;br /&gt;of a gorilla skull (c1870)]]

The subject was raised at the 1860 BA Oxford meeting, when Huxley flatly contradicted Owen, and promised a later demonstration of the facts. In fact, a number of demonstrations were held in London and the provinces. In 1862 at the Cambridge meeting of the B.A. Huxley's friend [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]] gave a public dissection to show that the same structures (the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor) were indeed present in apes. The debate was widely publicised, and parodied as the ''[[Great Hippocampus Question]]''. It was seen as one of Owen's greatest blunders, revealing Huxley as not only dangerous in debate, but also a better anatomist.

Owen conceded that there was something that could be called a hippocampus minor in the apes, but stated that it was much less developed and that such a presence did not detract from the overall distinction of simple brain size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cosans|2009}} pp. 109–111&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's ideas on this topic were summed up in January 1861 in the first issue (new series) of his own journal, the ''Natural History Review'': "the most violent scientific paper he had ever composed".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; This paper was reprinted in 1863 as chapter 2 of ''[[Man's Place in Nature]]'', with an addendum giving his account of the Owen/Huxley controversy about the ape brain.&lt;ref&gt;For the full text of the addendum see [[s:The cerebral structure of man and apes]]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Collected Essays'' this addendum was removed.

The extended argument on the ape brain, partly in debate and partly in print, backed by dissections and demonstrations, was a landmark in Huxley's career. It was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy, and in the long run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists than was the debate with Wilberforce. It also marked the start of Owen's decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists.

The following was written by Huxley to [[George Rolleston|Rolleston]] before the BA meeting in 1861:
:"My dear Rolleston... The obstinate reiteration of erroneous assertions can only be nullified by as persistent an appeal to facts; and I greatly regret that my engagements do not permit me to be present at the British Association in order to assist personally at what, I believe, will be ''the seventh public demonstration during the past twelve months'' of the untruth of the three assertions, that the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and the hippocampus minor, are peculiar to man and do not exist in the apes. I shall be obliged if you will read this letter to the Section" Yours faithfully, Thos. H. Huxley.&lt;ref&gt;''Athenaeum'' 21 September 1861, p. 498. [key sentence italicised]&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years there was also work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology. In 1862 he examined the [[Neanderthal]] skull-cap, which had been discovered in 1857. It was the first pre-''sapiens'' discovery of a fossil man, and it was immediately clear to him that the brain case was surprisingly large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1862a|}}, pp. 420–422&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps less productive was his work on [[physical anthropology]], a topic which fascinated the Victorians. Huxley classified the human races into nine categories, and discussed them under four headings as: Australoid, Negroid, Xanthocroic and Mongoloid types. Such classifications depended mainly on appearance and anatomical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Thomas Henry.

====Natural selection====
Huxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so there was a difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.

Huxley's reservations on natural selection were of the type "until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other, natural selection cannot be proved".&lt;ref&gt;Variously worded in {{Harvnb|Huxley|1860a}}, {{Harvnb|Huxley|1860b}}, {{Harvnb|Huxley|1861}}, {{Harvnb|Huxley|1862b}} and {{Harvnb|Huxley1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Poulton|1896}} chapter 18 gives detailed quotations from Huxley and discussion—Darwin's letters to Huxley being not yet published&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's position on selection was agnostic; yet he gave no credence to any other theory.  Despite this concern about evidence, Huxley saw that if evolution came about through variation, reproduction and selection then other things would also be subject to the same pressures. This included ideas because they are invented, imitated and selected by humans: ‘The struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world. A theory is a species of thinking, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huxley|first=T. H.|title=The coming of age of 'The origin of species'|journal=(1880) Science|volume=1, 15-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same idea as [[meme]] theory put forward by Richard Dawkins in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Selfish Gene.|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's part in the discussion came mostly in letters, as was his wont, along the lines: "The [[empirical evidence]] you call for is both impossible in practical terms, and in any event unnecessary. It's the same as asking to see every step in the transformation (or the splitting) of one species into another. My way so many issues are clarified and problems solved; no other theory does nearly so well".&lt;ref&gt;Letters CD to THH in {{Harvnb|Darwin|Seward|1903}} vol 1, pp. 137–8, 225–6, 230–2, 274, 277, 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's reservation, as Helena Cronin has so aptly remarked, was contagious: "it spread itself for years among all kinds of doubters of Darwinism".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronin|1991|}} p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent, ''but not the question of mechanism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayr|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pallbearer====
Huxley was a pallbearer at the funeral of [[Charles Darwin]] on 26 April 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doug Linder|Linder, Doug]] (2004)  [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/huxleyt.html "Thomas Huxley"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The X Club==
{{Main|X Club}}

In November 1864, Huxley succeeded in launching a dining club, the [[X Club]], composed of like-minded people working to advance the cause of science; not surprisingly, the club consisted of most of his closest friends. There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more. The members were: Huxley, [[John Tyndall]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|J. D. Hooker]], [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] (banker, biologist and neighbour of Darwin), [[Herbert Spencer]] (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), [[William Spottiswoode]] (mathematician and the Queen's Printer), [[Thomas Archer Hirst|Thomas Hirst]] (Professor of Physics at University College London), [[Edward Frankland]] (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and [[George Busk]], zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for [[HMS Dreadnought (1801)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]). All except Spencer were [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day. On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter's trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in [[glaciology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1857|}} p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1896|Ref=CITEREFTyndall1896|}} pp. 338–339, 359, 379–383, 406. "During the summer of 1857 he carefully experimented with coloured liquids on the [[Mer de Glace]] and its tributaries..." ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' 1857, vol xiv, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1857|}} p. 327–346.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Drawing of Thomas Henry Huxley.jpg|thumb|right|From the portrait of A. Legros.]]

There were also some quite significant X-Club satellites such as [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]] and [[George Rolleston]], (Huxley protegés), and liberal clergyman [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley|Arthur Stanley]], the Dean of Westminster. Guests such as [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] were entertained from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|1970|}} pp. 63–72&lt;/ref&gt;

They would dine early on first Thursdays at a hotel, planning what to do; high on the agenda was to change the way the Royal Society Council did business. It was no coincidence that the Council met later that same evening. First item for the Xs was to get the [[Copley Medal]] for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle.

The next step was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas. This was the weekly ''Reader'', which they bought, revamped and redirected. Huxley had already become part-owner of the ''[[Natural History Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} pp. 284, 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt; bolstered by the support of Lubbock, Rolleston, Busk and Carpenter (X-clubbers and satellites). The journal was switched to pro-Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861. After a stream of good articles the ''NHR'' failed after four years; but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution. The ''Reader'' also failed, despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science. The periodical market was quite crowded at the time, but most probably the critical factor was Huxley's time; he was simply over-committed, and could not afford to hire full-time editors. This occurred often in his life: Huxley took on too many ventures, and was not so astute as Darwin at getting others to do work for him.

However, the experience gained with the ''Reader'' was put to good use when the X Club put their weight behind the founding of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1869. This time no mistakes were made: above all there was a permanent editor (though not full-time), [[Joseph Norman Lockyer|Norman Lockyer]], who served until 1919, a year before his death. In 1925, to celebrate his centenary, ''Nature'' issued a supplement devoted to Huxley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barr|1997|}} p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak of the X Club's influence was from 1873 to 1885 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were [[List of Presidents of the Royal Society|Presidents of the Royal Society]] in succession. Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1892 it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet. Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now [[Baron Avebury|Lord Avebury]]) was the last surviving member.

Huxley was also an active member of the [[Metaphysical Society]], which ran from 1869 to 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Irvine|1955}} Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions. Tyndall and Huxley later joined [[The Club (Literary Club)|The Club]] (founded by [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson]]) when they could be sure that Owen would not turn up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational influence==
When Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses. Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees. When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation.

===School of Mines and Zoology===
In the early 1870s the Royal School of Mines moved to new quarters in South Kensington; ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of Imperial College London. The move gave Huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching, an idea suggested by practice in German universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In the main, the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types, and depended on the dissection of anatomy, supplemented by microscopy, museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of Foster.

The typical day would start with Huxley lecturing at 9am, followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Osborn|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's demonstrators were picked men—all became leaders of biology in Britain in later life, spreading Huxley's ideas as well as their own. [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]] became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge; [[Ray Lankester|E. Ray Lankester]] became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London (1875–91), Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford (1891–98) and Director of the Natural History Museum (1898–1907); S.H. Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge; [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer|W.T. Thiselton-Dyer]] became Hooker's successor at Kew (he was already Hooker's son-in-law!); T. Jeffery Parker became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at [[University College, Cardiff]]; and William Rutherford&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 14, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; became the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh. William Flower, Conservator to the Hunterian Museum, and THH's assistant in many dissections, became Sir [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]], Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and, later, Director of the Natural History Museum.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It's a remarkable list of disciples, especially when contrasted with Owen who, in a longer professional life than Huxley, left no disciples at all. "No one fact tells so strongly against Owen... as that he has never reared one pupil or follower".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin to Asa Gray 1860 in {{Harvnb|Darwin|Seward|1903|}} p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Huxley, Thomas Henry (1825 - 1895) by Daniel Downey (1829-1881) - 1863-9.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Huxley (c. 1890)]]

Huxley's courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: "The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism";&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lester|1995|}} p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir [[Arthur Shipley]] said "Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wollaston|1921|}} p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; E.W MacBride said "Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacBride|1934|}} p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes.

This largely [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] program of [[comparative anatomy]] remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink. It is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]], [[Fritz Müller]], [[Henry Walter Bates|Henry Bates]]) were scarcely represented at all in Huxley's program. Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non-existent, and theory, evolutionary or otherwise, was at a discount. [[Michael Ruse]] finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley, and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruse|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Darwin, Wallace and Bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers (and Műller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley's program went uncorrected. It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Desmond suggests that "[biology] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [because] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 273, note 20.&lt;/ref&gt; That must be part of the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology. But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man.

Huxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy, at which he was the greatest master of the day. He was not an all-round naturalist like Darwin, who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life. Huxley chose, in his teaching (and to some extent in his research) to take a more straightforward course, concentrating on his personal strengths.

===Schools and the Bible===
Huxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by British schools: in November 1870 he was voted onto the [[London School Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In primary schooling, he advocated a wide range of disciplines, similar to what is taught today: reading, writing, arithmetic, art, science, music, etc. In secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper-division work, focusing on a more specific area of study. A practical example of the latter is his famous 1868 lecture ''[[On a Piece of Chalk]]'' which was first published as an essay in ''Macmillan's Magazine'' in London later that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE8/Chalk.html On a Piece of Chalk (1868)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The piece reconstructs the geological history of Britain from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as "organized common sense".

Huxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools. This may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions, but he believed that the Bible's significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to English life. "I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches".&lt;ref&gt;Said of those who wished to abolish all religious teaching, when really all they wanted was to free education from the Church. THH 1873. ''Critiques and Addresses'' p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, what Huxley proposed was to create an ''edited version'' of the Bible, shorn of "shortcomings and errors... statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur... These tender children [should] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1893-94b|}} p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959|}} p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools. Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail. Huxley said "I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools".&lt;ref&gt;School Board Chronicle vol. 2, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bibby 1959 p=155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959|}} p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught.

It may be right to see Huxley's life and work as contributing to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said "It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayr|1982|}} p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;— and Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain. Some modern [[Christian apologists]] consider Huxley the father of [[antitheism]], though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic, not an atheist. He was, however, a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all [[organised religion]] throughout his life, especially the "Roman Church... carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature, in the intellectual freedom, and in the political freedom of mankind".&lt;ref name="Bibby 1959 p=155"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;School Board Chronicle vol 2, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same line of thought, in an article in ''[[Popular Science]]'', Huxley used the expression "the so-called Christianity of Catholicism," explaining: "I say 'so-called' not by way of offense, but as a protest against the monstruous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implicitly contained in any trust-worthy record of the teaching of [[Jesus of Nazareth]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bonnier Corporation. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Popular Science]'' April 1887, Vol. 30, No. 46. {{ISSN|0161-7370}}. ''Scientific and pseudo-scientific realism pp. 789-803&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, during preparation for the second [[Romanes Lecture]], Huxley expressed his disappointment at the shortcomings of [[Liberal theology|'liberal' theology]], describing its doctrines as 'popular illusions', and the teachings they replaced 'faulty as they are, appear to me to be vastly nearer the truth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Huxley | first= Leonard | title= Life and Letters of T H Huxley | volume=3 | page= 118 | publisher= Wentworth Press | year= 2016 | url=http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/5799/118.html| archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/72urOUy4t | archive-date= 4 October 2018 |isbn= 9781371175252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] remarked (in ''Materialism and empirio-criticism'') "In Huxley's case... agnosticism serves as a fig-leaf for materialism" (see also the [[#Debate with Wilberforce|Debate with Wilberforce]] above).

===Adult education===
Huxley's interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms; he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, many of which were published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public. For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', the ''Saturday Review'', the ''Reader'', the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', ''Macmillan's Magazine'', the ''Contemporary Review''. Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|White|2003|}} p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: articles are listed, and some are available, in The Huxley File at [[Clark University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the [[South London Working Men's College]] in [[Blackfriars Road]]. The moving spirit was a portmanteau worker, Wm. Rossiter, who did most of the work; the funds were put up mainly by [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F.D. Maurice]]'s [[Christian Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959|}} p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p. 361–362.&lt;/ref&gt; At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994}} Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective. A good example was ''The physical basis of life'', a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme&amp;nbsp;— that vital action is nothing more than "the result of the molecular forces of the [[protoplasm]] which displays it"&amp;nbsp;— shocked the audience, though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'' for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said "No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morley|1917}} p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was reprinted seven times and [[protoplasm]] became a household word; ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.

The topic had been stimulated by Huxley seeing the [[cytoplasmic streaming]] in plant cells, which is indeed a sensational sight. For these audiences Huxley's claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality, but by the working of its constituent chemicals, was surprising and shocking. Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do, but little of that was known in the nineteenth century.

When the Archbishop of York thought this 'new philosophy' was based on [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]], Huxley corrected him: "Comte's philosophy [is just] Catholicism minus Christianity" (Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays ''Methods &amp; Results'' 156). A later version was "[positivism is] sheer Popery with M. Comte in the chair of St Peter, and with the names of the saints changed". (lecture on [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/Posit.html ''The scientific aspects of positivism''] Huxley 1870 ''Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews'' p.&amp;nbsp;149). Huxley's dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that Comte's ideas withered in Britain.

==Huxley and the humanities==
During his life, and especially in the last ten years after retirement, Huxley wrote on many issues relating to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barr|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradis, James G. ''T. H. Huxley: Man's place in nature''. University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Houston 1932. ''Huxley: prophet of science''. Longmans Green, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley T. H. 1893-4. ''Collected essays'': vol 4 ''Science and Hebrew tradition''; vol 5 ''Science and Christian tradition''; vol 6 ''Hume, with helps to the study of Berkeley''; vol 7 ''Man's place in nature''; vol 9: ''Evolution and ethics, and other essays''. Macmillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known of these topics is ''Evolution and Ethics'', which deals with the question of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy. Both Huxley and his grandson [[Julian Huxley]] gave [[Romanes Lecture]]s on this theme.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley T.H. and Huxley J. 1947. ''Evolution and ethics 1893–1943''. Pilot, London. In USA as ''Touchstone for ethics'', Harper, N.Y. [includes text from the Romanes lectures of both T. H. Huxley and Julian Huxley]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradis, James &amp; Williams, George C 1989. ''Evolution and Ethics: T. H. Huxley's 'Evolution and Ethics', with new essays on its Victorian and sociobiological context''. Princeton, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reed J. R. 'Huxley and the question of morality'. In {{Harvnb|Barr|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a start, Huxley dismisses religion as a source of [[moral authority]]. Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects. Thus, our emotions, our intellect, our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution, and therefore [[Heredity|inherit]]ed.

Despite this, the ''details'' of our values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly determined by our culture, and partly chosen by ourselves. Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the ''struggle for existence'': "Of moral purpose I see not a trace in nature. That is an article of exclusively human manufacture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900|}} vol. 2, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore our responsibility to make ethical choices (see [[Ethics]] and [[Evolutionary ethics]]). This seems to put Huxley as a [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] in the [[Free will|Free Will]] vs [[Determinism]] debate. In this argument Huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend [[Herbert Spencer]].

Huxley's dissection of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s views on man and society is another example of his later work. The essay undermines Rousseau's ideas on man as a preliminary to undermining his ideas on the ownership of property. Characteristic is: "The doctrine that all men are, in any sense, or have been, at any time, free and equal, is an utterly baseless fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley T. H. 1890. The natural inequality of man. ''Nineteenth Century'' January; reprinted in ''Collected Essays'' vol. 1, p. 290–335.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's method of argumentation (his strategy and tactics of persuasion in speech and print) is itself much studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|1991|}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career included controversial debates with scientists, clerics and politicians; persuasive discussions with Royal Commissions and other public bodies; lectures and articles for the general public, and a mass of detailed letter-writing to friends and other correspondents. A large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|1991|}}, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal and other commissions==
Huxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions (titles somewhat shortened here).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Commission]] is the senior investigative forum in the British constitution. A rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education; three involved medicine and three involved fisheries. Several involve difficult ethical and legal issues. All deal with possible changes to law and/or administrative practice.

===Royal Commissions===
*1862     Trawling for herrings on the coast of Scotland.
*1863–65  Sea fisheries of the United Kingdom.
*1870–71  The [[Contagious Diseases Acts]].
*1870–75  Scientific instruction and the advancement of science.
*1876     The practice of subjugating live animals to scientific experiments ([[vivisection]]).
*1876–78  The universities of Scotland.
*1881–82  The Medical Acts. [i.e. the legal framework for medicine]
*1884     Trawl, net and beam trawl fishing.

====Other commissions====
*1866     On the [[Royal College of Science for Ireland]].
*1868     On science and art instruction in Ireland.

{{See also|Huxley family}}

In 1855, he married Henrietta Anne Heathorn (1825–1915), an English émigrée whom he had met in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]]. They kept correspondence until he was able to send for her. They had five daughters and three sons:

* Noel Huxley (1856–60), died aged 4.
* Jessie Oriana Huxley (1858&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huxley|first=T.H.|title=To Lizzie, March 27, 1858|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/letters/58.html|work=Letters and Diary:  1858|publisher=Clark University|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; −1927), married architect Fred Waller in 1877.
* Marian Huxley (1859–87), married artist [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]] in 1879.
* [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]], (1860–1933) author, father of [[Julian Huxley|Julian]], [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous]] and [[Andrew Huxley]].
* Rachel Huxley (1862–1934) married civil engineer Alfred Eckersley in 1884; he died 1895.  They were parents of the physicist [[Thomas Eckersley]] and the first BBC Chief Engineer [[Peter Eckersley (engineer)|Peter Eckersley]].
* Henrietta (Nettie) Huxley (1863–1940), married Harold Roller, travelled Europe as a singer.
* Henry Huxley (1865–1946), became a fashionable general practitioner in [[London]].
* Ethel Huxley (1866–1941), married artist [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]] (widower of sister) in 1889.

Huxley's relationships with his relatives and children were genial by the standards of the day—so long as they lived their lives in an honourable manner, which some did not. After his mother, his eldest sister Lizzie was the most important person in his life until his own marriage. He remained on good terms with his children, more than can be said of many Victorian fathers. This excerpt from a letter to Jessie, his eldest daughter is full of affection:
*"Dearest Jess, You are a badly used young person—you are; and nothing short of that conviction would get a letter out of your still worse used Pater, the bête noir of whose existence is letter-writing. Catch me discussing the Afghan question with you, you little pepper-pot! No, not if I know it..." [goes on nevertheless to give strong opinions of the Afghans, at that time causing plenty of trouble to the [[Indian Empire]]—see [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]]] "There, you plague—ever your affec. Daddy, THH." (letter 7 December 1878, Huxley L 1900)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/letters/78.html T. H. Huxley Letters and Diary 1878]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's descendants include children of Leonard Huxley:

* [[Julian Huxley|Sir Julian Huxley]] FRS was the first Director of [[UNESCO]] and a notable evolutionary biologist and humanist.
* [[Aldous Huxley]] was a famous author (''[[Brave New World]]'' 1932, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]'' 1936, ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' 1954).
* [[Andrew Huxley|Sir Andrew Huxley]] OM PRS won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1963. He was the second Huxley to become President of the Royal Society.

Other significant descendants of Huxley, such as Sir [[Crispin Tickell]], are treated in the [[Huxley family]].

===Mental problems in the family===
Biographers have sometimes noted the occurrence of mental illness in the Huxley family. His father became "sunk in worse than childish imbecility of mind",&lt;ref&gt;letter THH to eldest sister Lizzie 1853 HP 31.21&lt;/ref&gt;  and later died in [[Barming Asylum]]; brother George suffered from "extreme mental anxiety"&lt;ref&gt;THH to Lizzie 1858 HP 31.24&lt;/ref&gt;  and died in 1863 leaving serious debts. Brother James, a well known psychiatrist and Superintendent of Kent County Asylum, was at 55 "as near mad as any sane man can be";&lt;ref&gt;THH to Lizzie HP 31.44&lt;/ref&gt;  and there is more. His favourite daughter, the artistically talented Mady (Marian), who became the first wife of artist [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]], was troubled by mental illness for years. She died of pneumonia in her mid-twenties.&lt;ref&gt;THH to JT 1887 HP 9.164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;

About Huxley himself we have a more complete record. As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner, aged thirteen or fourteen, Huxley was taken to watch a post-mortem dissection. Afterwards he sank into a 'deep lethargy' and though Huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning, Bibby&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1972|}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and others may be right to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the [[clinical depression|depression]]. Huxley recuperated on a farm, looking thin and ill.

The next episode we know of in Huxley's life when he suffered a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS ''Rattlesnake'' in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1935}} Chapter 5 'Wanderings of a human soul'&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley had further periods of depression at the end of 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1884 he sank into another depression, and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885, at the age of only 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; This is enough to indicate the way depression (or perhaps a moderate [[bi-polar disorder]]) interfered with his life, yet unlike some of the other family members, he was able to function extremely well at other times.

The problems continued sporadically into the third generation. Two of Leonard's sons suffered serious depression: Trevennen committed suicide in 1914 and Julian suffered a breakdown in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five more later in life.

== Satires ==
[[File:Water-babies 2.jpg|thumb|Huxley (right) and Richard Owen inspect a "water baby" in [[Edward Linley Sambourne]]'s 1881 illustration]]

Darwin's ideas and Huxley's controversies gave rise to many cartoons and satires. It was the debate about man's place in nature that roused such widespread comment: cartoons are so numerous as to be almost impossible to count; Darwin's head on a monkey's body is one of the visual clichés of the age. The "[[Great Hippocampus Question]]" attracted particular attention:

* ''Monkeyana'' (Punch vol 40, 18 May 1861). Signed 'Gorilla', this turned out to be by [[Sir Philip Grey Egerton, 10th Baronet|Sir Philip Egerton MP]], amateur naturalist, fossil fish collector and&amp;nbsp;— Richard Owen's patron!&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The last two stanzas include a reference to Huxley's comment that "Life is too short to occupy oneself with the slaying of the slain more than once.":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Athenaeum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evbfIPxyEW4C&amp;pg=PA498|year=1861|publisher=British Periodicals Limited|page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Next HUXLEY replies&lt;br /&gt;That OWEN he lies&lt;br /&gt;And garbles his Latin quotation;&lt;br /&gt;That his facts are not new,&lt;br /&gt;His mistakes not a few,&lt;br /&gt;Detrimental to his reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To twice slay the slain&lt;br /&gt;By dint of the Brain&lt;br /&gt;(Thus HUXLEY concludes his review)&lt;br /&gt;Is but labour in vain,&lt;br /&gt;unproductive of gain,&lt;br /&gt;And so I shall bid you "Adieu"!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''The Gorilla's Dilemma'' (Punch 1862, vol 43, p.&amp;nbsp;164). First two lines: &lt;blockquote&gt;Say am I a man or a brother,&lt;br /&gt;Or only an anthropoid ape?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* ''Report of a sad case recently tried before the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley''.&lt;ref&gt;pamphlet, published by George Pycraft, London 1863; Huxley Papers 79.6&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Mayor asks whether either side is known to the police: &lt;blockquote&gt;Policeman X&amp;nbsp;— Huxley, your Worship, I take to be a young hand, but very vicious; but Owen I have seen before. He got into trouble with an old bone man, called Mantell, who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his bones. People did say that the old man never got over it, and Owen worritted him to death; but I don't think it was so bad as that. Hears as Owen takes the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury. I don't think it will be a harmonic meeting altogether. And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street.&lt;/blockquote&gt; (Tom Huxley's 'low set' included Hooker 'in the green and vegetable line' and 'Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier'; Owen's 'crib in Bloomsbury' was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department. [[Jermyn Street]] is known for its shops of men's clothing, possibly implying that Huxley was a [[dandy]].)
* ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies, a fairy tale for a land baby]]'' by [[Charles Kingsley]] (serialised in ''Macmillan's Magazine'' 1862–63, published in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', having "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|}} [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=303 287]&lt;/ref&gt; and the story includes a [[satire]] on the [[reaction to Darwin's theory]], with the main scientific participants appearing, including [[Richard Owen]] and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson [[Julian Huxley|Julian]] saw the illustration by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]] (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: &lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Grandpater&amp;nbsp;– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did you put it in a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?&amp;nbsp;– Your loving Julian.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Huxley wrote back: &lt;blockquote&gt;My dear Julian&amp;nbsp;– I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did&amp;nbsp;– There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
