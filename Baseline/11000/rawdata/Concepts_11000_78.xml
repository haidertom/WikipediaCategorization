'''Brief psychotherapy''' (also '''brief therapy''', '''planned short-term therapy''')&lt;ref&gt;Bandler, Richard. Time for a Change. Cupertino, Calif.: Meta Publications, 1993. 20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches to short-term, solution-oriented [[psychotherapy]].

==Overview==
Brief therapy differs from other schools of therapy in that it emphasizes (1) a focus on a specific problem and (2) direct intervention. In brief therapy, the therapist takes responsibility for working more pro-actively with the client in order to treat clinical and subjective conditions faster. It also emphasizes precise observation, utilization of natural resources, and a temporary [[suspension of disbelief]] to consider new perspectives and multiple viewpoints.

Rather than the formal analysis of historical causes of distress, the primary approach of brief therapy is to help the client to view the present from a wider context and to utilize more functional understandings (not necessarily at a [[consciousness|conscious]] level). By becoming aware of these new understandings, successful clients will ''de facto'' undergo spontaneous and generative change.

Brief therapy is often highly strategic, exploratory, and solution-based rather than problem-oriented. It is less concerned with how a problem arose than with the current factors sustaining it and preventing change. Brief therapists do not adhere to one "correct" approach, but rather accept that there being many paths, any of which may or may not in combination turn out to be ultimately beneficial.

==Founding proponents==
[[Milton Erickson]] was a practitioner of brief therapy, using clinical [[hypnosis]] as his primary tool. To a great extent he developed this himself. His approach was popularized by [[Jay Haley]], in the book "Uncommon therapy: The psychiatric techniques of Milton Erickson M.D."
{{quote|"The analogy Erickson uses is that of a person who wants to change the course of a river. if he opposes the river by trying to block it, the river will merely go over and around him. But if he ''accepts'' the force of the river and diverts it in a new direction, the force of the river will cut a new channel."&lt;ref&gt;Haley, Jay. ''Uncommon Therapy; the Psychiatric Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D.'' New York: Norton, 1973. 24. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Richard Bandler]], the co-founder of [[neuro-linguistic programming]], is another firm proponent of brief therapy. After many years of studying Erickson's therapeutic work, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Bandler, Richard. ''Time for a Change''. Cupertino, Calif.: Meta Publications, 1993. 20. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"It's easier to cure a phobia in ten minutes than in five years... I didn't realize that the speed with which you do things makes them last... I taught people the phobia cure. They'd do part of it one week, part of it the next, and part of it the week after. Then they'd come to me and say "It doesn't work!" If, however, you do it in five minutes, and repeat it till it happens very fast, the brain understands. That's part of how the brain learns... I discovered that the human mind does not learn slowly. It learns quickly. I didn't know that."}}

'''Capacitance''' is the ratio of the change in an [[electric charge]] in a system to the corresponding change in its [[electric potential]]. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: ''self capacitance'' and ''mutual capacitance''. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits ''self capacitance''. A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given [[voltage]] than one with low capacitance. The notion of ''mutual capacitance'' is particularly important for understanding the operations of the [[capacitor]], one of the three elementary [[nonlinear circuit|linear]] electronic components (along with [[resistors]] and [[inductors]]).

The capacitance is a function only of the geometry of the design (e.g. area of the plates and the distance between them) and the [[permittivity]] of the [[dielectric]] material between the plates of the capacitor. For many dielectric materials, the permittivity and thus the capacitance, is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.

The [[SI]] unit of capacitance is the [[farad]] (symbol: F), named after the English physicist [[Michael Faraday]]. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 [[coulomb]] of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 [[volt]] between its plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/farad |title=Definition of 'farad' |publisher=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reciprocal of capacitance is called [[elastance]].

==Self-capacitance==
In electrical circuits, the term ''capacitance'' is usually a shorthand for the ''[[mutual capacitance]]'' between two adjacent conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, for an isolated conductor, there also exists a property called ''self-capacitance'', which is the amount of electric charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its [[electric potential]] by one unit (i.e. one volt, in most measurement systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Greason|title=Electrostatic discharge in electronics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=404fAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=1992|publisher=Research Studies Press|isbn=978-0-86380-136-5 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference point for this potential is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere, of infinite radius, with the conductor centered inside this sphere.

Mathematically, the ''self-capacitance'' of a conductor is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{q}{V},&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''q'' is the charge held by the conductor,
:&lt;math&gt;V = {1\over 4\pi\varepsilon_0}\int {\sigma \, dS\over r}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric potential,
:σ is the surface charge density.
:''dS'' is an infinitesimal element of area,
:''r'' is the length from dS to a fixed point ''M'' within the plate
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]]

Using this method, the self-capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius ''R'' is:&lt;ref name=NSW&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090226225105/http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/COURSES/FIRST_YEAR/pdf%20files/5Capacitanceanddielectr.pdf Lecture notes]; University of New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=4\pi\varepsilon_0R \,&lt;/math&gt;

Example values of self-capacitance are:
*for the top "plate" of a [[van de Graaff generator]], typically a sphere 20&amp;nbsp;cm in radius: 22.24 pF,
*the planet [[Earth]]: about 710 µF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Paul | last2 = Mosca | first2 = Gene | title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2004 | edition = 5th | page = 752 | isbn = 978-0-7167-0810-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inter-winding capacitance of a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] is sometimes called self-capacitance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Self-capacitance of inductors|doi=10.1109/63.602562 |author1=Massarini, A. |author2=Kazimierczuk, M.K. |year=1997 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=671–676 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics |postscript=: example of the use of the term 'self-capacitance'.|bibcode=1997ITPE...12..671M }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is a different phenomenon. It is actually [[mutual capacitance]] between the individual turns of the coil and is a form of stray, or [[parasitic capacitance]]. This self-capacitance is an important consideration at high frequencies: It changes the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the coil and gives rise to parallel [[Electrical resonance|resonance]]. In many applications this is an undesirable effect and sets an upper frequency limit for the correct operation of the circuit.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Mutual capacitance==
{{Main article|Mutual capacitance}}

A common form is a parallel-plate [[capacitor]], which consists of two conductive plates insulated from each other, usually sandwiching a [[dielectric]] material. In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is very nearly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates.

If the charges on the plates are +''q'' and −''q'', and ''V'' gives the [[voltage]] between the plates, then the capacitance ''C'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{q}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the voltage/[[electric current|current]] relationship
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = C \frac{\mathrm{d}v(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] the work ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = \frac{1}{2}CV^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Capacitance matrix===

The discussion above is limited to the case of two conducting plates, although of arbitrary size and shape.
The definition
&lt;math&gt;C = Q/V&lt;/math&gt; does not apply when there are more than two charged plates, or when the net charge on the two plates is non-zero. To handle this case, Maxwell introduced his ''[[coefficients of potential]]''. If three (nearly ideal) conductors are given charges &lt;math&gt;Q_1, Q_2, Q_3&lt;/math&gt;, then the voltage at conductor 1 is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V_1 = P_{11}Q_1 + P_{12} Q_2 + P_{13}Q_3, &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the other voltages. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Sir William Thomson]] showed that the coefficients of potential are symmetric, so that &lt;math&gt;P_{12}=P_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, etc. Thus the system can be described by a collection of coefficients known as the ''elastance matrix'' or ''reciprocal capacitance matrix'', which is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = \frac{\partial V_{i}}{\partial Q_{j}}&lt;/math&gt;

From this, the mutual capacitance &lt;math&gt;C_{m}&lt;/math&gt; between two objects can be defined&lt;ref name=Jackson1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=John David |title=Classical Electrodynamic |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1999 |edition=3rd |page=43 |isbn=978-0-471-30932-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; by solving for the total charge ''Q'' and using &lt;math&gt;C_{m}=Q/V&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;C_m = \frac{1}{(P_{11} + P_{22})-(P_{12} + P_{21})}&lt;/math&gt;

Since no actual device holds perfectly equal and opposite charges on each of the two "plates", it is the mutual capacitance that is reported on capacitors.

The collection of coefficients &lt;math&gt;C_{ij} =\frac{\partial Q_{i}}{\partial V_{j}}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''capacitance matrix'',&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;{{cite book| last =Maxwell | first =James | author-link =James Clerk Maxwell | title = A treatise on electricity and magnetism |volume=1 | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1873 | chapter =3 | at =p. 88ff | url = https://archive.org/details/electricandmagne01maxwrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Capacitance : Charge as a Function of Voltage |url=http://www.av8n.com/physics/capacitance.htm |website=Av8n.com |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of the elastance matrix.

==Capacitors==
{{Main article|Capacitor}}
The capacitance of the majority of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the [[farad]]. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the [[micro-|micro]]farad (µF), [[nano-|nano]]farad (nF), [[pico-|pico]]farad (pF), and, in microcircuits, [[femto-|femto]]farad (fF). However, specially made [[supercapacitors]] can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad. In the past, alternate subunits were used in historical electronic books; "mfd" and "mf" for microfarad (µF); "mmfd", "mmf", "µµF" for picofarad (pF); but are rarely used any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justradios.com/MFMMFD.html |title=Capacitor MF-MMFD Conversion Chart |website=Just Radios}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/FundamentalsOfElectronics93400A1b |title=Fundamentals of Electronics |volume=Volume 1b — Basic Electricity — Alternating Current |publisher=Bureau of Naval Personnel |year=1965 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capacitance can be calculated if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. A qualitative explanation for this can be given as follows.&lt;br&gt; Once a positive charge is put unto a conductor, this charge creates an electrical field, repelling any other positive charge to be moved onto the conductor; i.e., increasing the necessary voltage. But if nearby there is another conductor with a negative charge on it, the electrical field of the positive conductor repelling the second positive charge is weakened (the second positive charge also feels the attracting force of the negative charge). So due to the second conductor with a negative charge, it becomes easier to put a positive charge on the already positive charged first conductor, and vice versa; i.e., the necessary voltage is lowered. &lt;br&gt; As a quantitative example consider the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area ''A'' separated by a distance ''d''. If ''d'' is sufficiently small with respect to the smallest chord of ''A'', there holds, to a high level of accuracy:
:&lt;math&gt;\ C=\varepsilon_0\frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''C'' is the capacitance, in farads;
:''A'' is the area of overlap of the two plates, in square meters;
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity|electric constant]] (''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ {{val|8.854|e=-12|u=F.m-1}}); and
:''d'' is the separation between the plates, in meters;

Capacitance is proportional to the area of overlap and inversely proportional to the separation between conducting sheets. The closer the sheets are to each other, the greater the capacitance.
The equation is a good approximation if ''d'' is small compared to the other dimensions of the plates so that the electric field in the capacitor area is uniform, and the so-called ''fringing field'' around the periphery provides only a small contribution to the capacitance.

Combining the equation for capacitance with the above equation for the energy stored in a capacitance, for a flat-plate capacitor the energy stored is:

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{stored} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{0} \frac{A}{d} V^2.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the energy, in joules; ''C'' is the capacitance, in farads; and ''V'' is the voltage, in volts.

==Stray capacitance==
{{Main article|Parasitic capacitance}}
Any two adjacent conductors can function as a capacitor, though the capacitance is small unless the conductors are close together for long distances or over a large area. This (often unwanted) capacitance is called parasitic or "stray capacitance". Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits (an effect called [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]), and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at [[high frequency]].

Stray capacitance between the input and output in amplifier circuits can be troublesome because it can form a path for [[Feedback#Electronic engineering|feedback]], which can cause instability and [[parasitic oscillation]] in the amplifier. It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance with a combination of one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration — including the input-to-output capacitance — is often referred to as a pi-configuration. Miller's theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is 1/''K'', then an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of ''Z'' connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a ''Z''/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'') impedance between the first node and ground and a ''KZ''/(''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, ''C'', is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of (''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''C''/''K'' from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.

==Capacitance of conductors with simple shapes ==
Calculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the [[Laplace equation]] ''∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0'' with a constant potential ''φ'' on the surface of the conductors. This is trivial in cases with high symmetry. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.

For two-dimensional situations analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other. See also [[Schwarz–Christoffel mapping]].

==Energy storage==
The [[energy]] (measured in [[joule]]s) stored in a capacitor is equal to the ''work'' required to push the charges into the capacitor, i.e. to charge it. Consider a capacitor of capacitance ''C'', holding a charge +''q'' on one plate and −''q'' on the other. Moving a small element of charge d''q'' from one plate to the other against the potential difference {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} ''q/C''}} requires the work d''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}W = \frac{q}{C}\,\mathrm{d}q &lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the work measured in joules, ''q'' is the charge measured in coulombs and ''C'' is the capacitance, measured in farads.

The energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] this equation. Starting with an uncharged capacitance ({{nowrap|''q'' {{=}} 0}}) and moving charge from one plate to the other until the plates have charge +''Q'' and −''Q'' requires the work ''W'':

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C} \, \mathrm{d}q = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C} = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = W_\text{stored}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Nanoscale systems==
The capacitance of nanoscale dielectric capacitors such as [[quantum dots]] may differ from conventional formulations of larger capacitors. In particular, the electrostatic potential difference experienced by electrons in conventional capacitors is spatially well-defined and fixed by the shape and size of metallic electrodes in addition to the statistically large number of electrons present in conventional capacitors. In nanoscale capacitors, however, the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device. In such devices, the number of electrons may be very small, however, the resulting spatial distribution of equipotential surfaces within the device are exceedingly complex.

===Single-electron devices===
The capacitance of a connected, or "closed", single-electron device is twice the capacitance of an unconnected, or "open", single-electron device.&lt;ref name= Tsu&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact may be traced more fundamentally to the energy stored in the single-electron device whose "direct polarization" interaction energy may be equally divided into the interaction of the electron with the polarized charge on the device itself due to the presence of the electron and the amount of potential energy required to form the polarized charge on the device (the interaction of charges in the device's dielectric material with the potential due to the electron).&lt;ref name= LaFave-DCD&gt;

===Few-electron devices===
The derivation of a "quantum capacitance" of a few-electron device involves the thermodynamic chemical potential of an ''N''-particle system given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(N) = U(N) - U(N-1)&lt;/math&gt;

whose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schr&amp;ouml;dinger equation. The definition of capacitance,

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over C} \equiv {\Delta \,V\over\Delta \,Q}&lt;/math&gt;,

with the potential difference

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,V = {\Delta \,\mu \,\over e} = {\mu(N+\Delta \,N) -\mu(N) \over e}&lt;/math&gt;

may be applied to the device with the addition or removal of individual electrons,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \,N = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \,Q=e&lt;/math&gt;.

Then

:&lt;math&gt;C_Q(N) = {e^2\over\mu(N+1)-\mu(N)} = {e^2 \over E(N)}&lt;/math&gt;

is the "quantum capacitance" of the device.&lt;ref&gt;

|bibcode = 1995PhRvB..5210737I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This expression of "quantum capacitance" may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;C_Q(N) = {e^2\over U(N)}&lt;/math&gt;

which differs from the conventional expression described in the introduction where &lt;math&gt;W_\text{stored} = U&lt;/math&gt;, the stored electrostatic potential energy,

:&lt;math&gt;C = {Q^2\over 2U}&lt;/math&gt;

by a factor of 1/2 with &lt;math&gt;Q = Ne&lt;/math&gt;.

However, within the framework of purely classical electrostatic interactions, the appearance of the factor of 1/2 is the result of integration in the conventional formulation,

:&lt;math&gt; W_\text{charging} = U = \int_0^Q \frac{q}{C} \, \mathrm{d}q&lt;/math&gt;

which is appropriate since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}q = 0&lt;/math&gt; for systems involving either many electrons or metallic electrodes, but in few-electron systems, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}q \to \Delta \,Q= e&lt;/math&gt;. The integral generally becomes a summation. One may trivially combine the expressions of capacitance and electrostatic interaction energy,

:&lt;math&gt;Q=CV&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U=QV&lt;/math&gt;,

respectively, to obtain,

:&lt;math&gt;C = Q{1\over V} = Q {Q \over U} = {Q^2 \over U}&lt;/math&gt;

which is similar to the quantum capacitance. A more rigorous derivation is reported in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, to circumvent the mathematical challenges of the spatially complex equipotential surfaces within the device, an ''average'' electrostatic potential experiences by ''each'' electron is utilized in the derivation.

The reason for apparent mathematical differences is understood more fundamentally as the potential energy, &lt;math&gt;U(N)&lt;/math&gt;, of an isolated device (self-capacitance) is twice that stored in a "connected" device in the lower limit ''N''=1. As ''N'' grows large, &lt;math&gt;U(N)\to U&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=LaFave-DCD/&gt; Thus, the general expression of capacitance is

:&lt;math&gt;C(N) = {(Ne)^2 \over U(N)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In nanoscale devices such as quantum dots, the "capacitor" is often an isolated, or partially isolated, component within the device. The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic (conventional) capacitors are the number of excess electrons (charge carriers, or electrons, that contribute to the device's electronic behavior) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes. In nanoscale devices, [[nanowires]] consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.

==Capacitance in electronic and semiconductor devices==

In electronic and semiconductor devices, transient or frequency-dependent current between terminals contains both conduction and displacement components. Conduction current is related to moving charge carriers (electrons, holes, ions, etc.), while displacement current is caused by time-varying electric field. Carrier transport is affected by electric field and by a number of physical phenomena - such as carrier drift and diffusion, trapping, injection, contact-related effects, impact ionization, etc. As a result, device [[admittance]] is frequency-dependent, and a simple electrostatic formula for capacitance &lt;math&gt;C = q/V,&lt;/math&gt; is not applicable. A more general definition of capacitance, encompassing electrostatic formula, is:&lt;ref name=LauxCapacitance&gt;{{cite journal |first=S.E. |last=Laux |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1270145/ |title=Techniques for small-signal analysis of semiconductor devices |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=472–481 |doi=10.1109/TCAD.1985.1270145 |date=Oct 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C =  \frac{\operatorname{Im}(Y(\omega))}{\omega}   ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Y(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the device admittance, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency.

In general case, capacitance is a function of frequency. At high frequencies, capacitance approached a constant value, equal to "geometric" capacitance, determined by the terminals' geometry and dielectric content in the device.
A paper by Steven Laux&lt;ref name=LauxCapacitance /&gt; presents a review of numerical techniques for capacitance calculation. In particular, capacitance can be calculated by a Fourier transform of a transient current in response to a step-like voltage excitation:

:&lt;math&gt;C(\omega) = 1/(\Delta V) \int_0^\infty [i(t)-i(\infty)] cos(\omega t) dt.&lt;/math&gt;

==Negative capacitance in semiconductor devices==

Usually, capacitance in semiconductor devices is positive. However, in some devices and under certain conditions (temperature, applied voltages, frequency, etc.), capacitance can become negative. Non-monotonic behavior of the transient current in response to a step-like excitation has been proposed as the mechanism of negative capacitance.&lt;ref name=JonscherNegCap&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.K. |last=Jonscher |title=The physical origin of negative capacitance |journal=J.

A '''causal loop diagram''' ('''CLD''') is a [[causal diagram]] that aids in visualizing how different variables in a system are interrelated. The diagram consists of a set of [[node (computer science)|nodes]] and edges. Nodes represent the variables and edges are the links that represent a connection or a relation between the two variables. A link marked '''positive''' indicates a positive relation and a link marked negative indicates a negative relation. A positive causal link means the two nodes change in the same direction, i.e. if the node in which the link starts decreases, the other node also decreases. Similarly, if the node in which the link starts increases, the other node increases as well. A '''negative''' causal link means the two nodes change in opposite directions, i.e. if the node in which the link starts increases, the other node decreases and vice versa. &lt;br /&gt;
Closed cycles in the diagram are very important features of the CLDs. A closed cycle is either defined as a '''reinforcing''' or '''balancing''' [[feedback]] loop. A reinforcing loop is a cycle in which the effect of a variation in any variable propagates through the loop and returns to the variable reinforcing the initial deviation i.e. if a variable increases in a reinforcing loop the effect through the cycle will return an increase to the same variable and vice versa. A balancing loop is the cycle in which the effect of a variation in any variable propagates through the loop and returns to the variable a deviation opposite to the initial one i.e. if a variable increases in a balancing loop the effect through the cycle will return a decrease to the same variable and vice versa.

If a variable varies in a reinforcing loop the effect of the change reinforces the initial variation. The effect of the variation will then create another reinforcing effect. Without breaking the loop the system will be caught in a vicious cycle of circular chain reactions. For this reason, closed loops are critical features in the CLDs.

Example of positive [[reinforcing loop]]:
*The amount of the ''Bank Balance'' will affect the amount of the ''Earned Interest'', as represented by the top blue arrow, pointing from ''Bank Balance'' to ''Earned Interest''.
*Since an increase in ''Bank balance'' results in an increase in ''Earned Interest'', this link is positive, which is denoted with a "+".
*The ''Earned interest'' gets added to the ''Bank balance'', also a positive link, represented by the bottom blue arrow.
*The causal effect between these nodes forms a '''positive''' [[reinforcing loop]], represented by the green arrow, which is denoted with an "R".&lt;ref name="sterman"&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|System Dynamics}}
The use of nodes and arrows to construct [[directed graph]] models of cause and effect dates back to the invention of  [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] by [[Sewall Wright]] in 1918, long before System Dynamics. Due to the limitations of genetic data, however, these early causal graphs contained no loops — they were [[directed acyclic graph]]s. The first formal use of Causal Loop Diagrams was explained by Dr. Dennis Meadows at a conference for educators (Systems Thinking &amp; Dynamic Modeling Conference for K-12 Education in New Hampshire sponsored by Creative Learning Exchange &lt;ref&gt;http://www.clexchange.org/&lt;/ref&gt;).

Meadows explained that when he and others were working on the [[World3]] model (circa 1970–72), they realized they would not be able to use the computer output to explain how the feedback loops worked in their model when presenting their results to others. They decided to show feedback loops (without the stocks, flows and every variable), using arrows connecting the names of major model components in the feedback loops. This may have been the first formal use of Causal Loop Diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Anecdote by Richard Turnock attending informal discussion where Dennis Meadows explained origin of CLD&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive and negative causal links==
* '''Positive causal link''' means that the two nodes change in the same direction, i.e. if the node in which the link starts decreases, the other node also decreases. Similarly, if the node in which the link starts increases, the other node increases.
* '''Negative causal link''' means that the two nodes change in opposite directions, i.e. if the node in which the link starts increases, then the other node decreases, and vice versa.

===Example===
[[File:CLD links ANI.gif|centre|Dynamic causal loop diagram: positive and negative links|frame]]

==Reinforcing and balancing loops==
To determine if a causal loop is reinforcing or balancing, one can start with an assumption, e.g. "Node 1 increases" and follow the loop around. The loop is:
* '''reinforcing''' if, after going around the loop, one ends up with the same result as the initial assumption.
* '''balancing''' if the result contradicts the initial assumption.
Or to put it in other words:
* [[reinforcing loop]]s have an even number of negative links (zero also is even, see example below)
* [[balancing loop]]s have an odd number of negative links.

Identifying reinforcing and balancing loops is an important step for identifying ''Reference Behaviour Patterns'', i.e. possible dynamic behaviours of the system.
* Reinforcing loops are associated with exponential increases/decreases.
* Balancing loops are associated with reaching a plateau.
If the system has delays (often denoted by drawing a short line across the causal link), the system might fluctuate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2648">'''Comparative law wikis''' are [[wiki]]s that allow users to create empirical cross-reference datasets for the analysis of the world's myriad [[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]. Wikis are adaptable to use by any cross-geographical comparative study, such as [[comparative politics]], [[comparative religion]].

==Examples==

Over the past decade, there have been several attempts to create a global legal wiki,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ler.edu.au/pdf/vol19_fullpapers/ler_vol19_paper3.pdf|title=Normann Witzleb, Engaging with the World: Students of Comparative Law Write for Wikipedia|publisher=Legal Education Review (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; though as of April 2017 none have gained primacy.  Examples include the World Encyclopedia of Law, by LAWi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawin.org/comparative-law/|title=World Encyclopedia of Law|publisher=LAWi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wex]], the online legal encyclopedia created by [[Cornell Law School]]'s [[Legal Information Institute]]. Parallel efforts to create crowdsourced data structures to map global legal/regulatory authorities include projects like [[Intellipedia]], an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC).

== Usefulness ==

Comparative law wikis are an efficient method of performing [[comparative law|comparative legal]] analysis.  Wikis are particularly useful for comparative global analysis because of the use with which sources from multiple jurisdictions can be gathered in one place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=Dennis|last2=Mighell|first2=Tom|title=Wikis for the Legal Profession|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=12 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911023153/http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|archivedate=11 April 2014|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crowdsourcing]] permits gathering up-to-date legal authorities from contributors who have local expertise, particularly knowledge of languages and administrative structures that background implementation of particular legal/regulatory norms.  

Comparative law wikis can also be useful for comparative study in federal legal systems, such as in the U.S., where 50-state law surveys are particularly useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">'''Dishmaker''' is a machine which creates cups, bowls, and plates from acrylic material and can recycle them into their raw material when they are done being used. 

It was designed by Leonardo Bonanni and made by The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]]’s Counter Intelligence Group.

Dishmaker uses the shape-memory property of [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] to make the dishes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4690">The '''dot-probe paradigm''' is a test used by [[cognitive psychologist]]s to assess [[selective attention]].

Developed by Halkiopoulos (1981), the method initially examined [[attentional bias]]es to threatening auditory information, when threatening and non-threatening information was presented simultaneously to both ears in a [[dichotic listening]] task (&lt;ref&gt;Halkiopoulos (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, MacLeod, &amp; Matthews, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;). The method was then adapted to the visual modality (also known as the visual-probe task) by MacLeod, Mathews and Tata (1986).  In many cases, the dot-probe paradigm is used to assess selective attention to threatening [[stimulation|stimuli]] in individuals diagnosed with [[anxiety disorders]]. Biases have also been investigated in other disorders via this paradigm, including [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and [[chronic pain]]. Attention biases toward positive stimuli have been associated with a number of positive outcomes such as increased social engagement, increased prosocial behavior, decreased externalizing disorders, and decreased emotionally withdrawn behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Troller-Renfree|first1=S.|last2=Martin McDermott|first2=J.|last3=Nelson|first3=C.A.|last4=Zeanah|first4=C.H.|last5=Fox|first5=N.A.|title=The effects of early foster care intervention on attention biases in previously institutionalized children in Romania|journal=Developmental Science|date=2014|page=1-10|doi=10.1111/desc.12261|pmc=4447605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure and method==

During the dot-probe task, participants are situated in front of a computer screen with their chin securely placed on a chin rest.  Participants are asked to stare at a fixation cross on the center of the screen. Two stimuli, one of which is neutral and one of which is threatening, appear randomly on either side of the screen. The stimuli are presented for a predetermined length of time (most commonly 500ms), before a dot is presented in the location of one former stimulus. Participants are instructed to indicate the location of this dot as quickly as possible, either via keyboard or response box.

Latency is measured automatically by the computer.  The fixation cross appears again for several seconds and then the cycle is repeated.  Quicker reaction time to the dot when it occurs in the previous location of a threatening stimulus is often interpreted as vigilance to threat.

==Clinical uses==

Researchers have recently begun using a modified version of the dot-probe task to retrain the attentional bias. In this version, the probe replaces the neutral stimuli 100% of the time or the salient stimuli 100% of the time. Over the course of a number of trials the attentional bias for salient stimuli can be reduced (in the case of the 'replace-neutral' condition) or enhanced (in the case of the 'replace-salient' condition).&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, A., &amp; MacLeod, C. (2002). Induced processing biases have causal effects on anxiety. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 16(3), 331-354.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of retraining the attentional bias is called [[attentional retraining]].

{{Environmental law}}
{{Progressivism}}

'''Environmental justice''' emerged as a concept in the United States in the early 1980s. The term has two distinct uses with the more common usage describing a [[social movement]] that focuses on the fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.  The other use is an interdisciplinary body of social science literature that includes theories of the environment and justice, environmental laws and their implementations, environmental policy and planning and governance for development and sustainability, and political ecology.&lt;ref name="Schlosberg"&gt;Schlosberg, David. (2007) ''Defining Environmental Justice: Theories, Movements, and Nature''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller, Jr. |first=G. Tyler |title=Environmental Science: Working With the Earth |edition=9th |year=2003 |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Pacific Grove, California |isbn=0-534-42039-7 |page=G5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] defines environmental justice as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. EPA has this goal for all communities and persons across this Nation{{sic}}. It will be achieved when everyone enjoys the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards and equal access to the decision-making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Justice|publisher=U.S. EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/|accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other definitions include: equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits; fair and meaningful participation in environmental decision-making; recognition of community ways of life, local knowledge, and cultural difference; and the capability of communities and individuals to function and flourish in society.&lt;ref name="Schlosberg"/&gt; An alternative meaning, used in social sciences, of the term "justice" is "the distribution of social goods".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral and Political Reasoning in Environmental Practice|last=Schlosberg|first=David|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0262621649|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental discrimination==

Environmental discrimination is one issue that environmental justice seeks to address. [[Racism]] and [[discrimination]] against minorities center on a socially-dominant group's belief in its superiority, often resulting in privilege for the dominant group and the mistreatment of non-dominant minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Racism|url=http://www.pollutionissues.com/Ec-Fi/Environmental-Racism.html|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined impact of these privileges and prejudices are just one of the potential reasons that waste management and high pollution sites tend to be located in minority-dominated areas. A disproportionate quantity of minority communities (for example in [[Warren County, North Carolina|Warren County]], [[North Carolina]]) play host to landfills, incinerators, and other potentially toxic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skelton|first=Renee|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|url=http://www.nrdc.org/ej/history/hej.asp|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental discrimination can also be the placement of a harmful factory in a place of minority. This can be seen as environmental discrimination because it is placing a harmful entity in a place where the people often don't have the means to fight back against big corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor|last=Lerner|first=Steve|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental discrimination has historically been evident in the process of selecting and building environmentally hazardous sites, including [[waste disposal]], [[manufacturing]], and energy production facilities. The location of transportation infrastructures, including highways, ports, and airports, has also been viewed as a source of environmental injustice. Among the earliest documentation of environmental racism was a study of the distribution of toxic waste sites across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Chavis, Benjamin F., Goldman, Benjamin A. and Charles Lee. (1987) Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States: A National Report on the Racial and Socio-economic Characteristics of Communities with Hazardous Waste Sites. Commission for Racial Justice, United Church of Christ.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the results of that study, waste dumps and waste incinerators have been the target of environmental justice lawsuits and protests.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Luke and Sheila R. Foster. (2001) From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement. New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===

Some environmental justice lawsuits are based on violations of [[civil rights]] laws.&lt;ref name="Section 602 Lawsuits"&gt;{{Cite journal

Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an environmental justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601. This section is useful because the plaintiff must only prove that the rule or regulation in question had a discriminatory impact. There is no need to prove discriminatory intent. ''Seif v. Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living'' set the precedent that citizens can sue under section 601. There has not yet been a case in which a citizen has sued under section 602, which calls into question whether this right of action exists.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous environmental justice cases.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

==Initial barriers to minority participation==

When [[environmentalism]] first became popular during the early 20th century, the focus was wilderness protection and wildlife preservation. These goals reflected the interests of the movement's initial supporters. The actions of many mainstream environmental organizations still reflect these early principles.&lt;ref name="Sandler, R. 2007 pp. 27-55"&gt;Sandler, R., &amp; Phaedra, P. (2007). Environmental justice and environmentalism. (pp. 27-55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous low-income minorities felt isolated or negatively impacted by the movement, exemplified by the Southwest Organizing Project's (SWOP) Letter to the Group of 10, a letter sent to major environmental organizations by several local environmental justice activists.&lt;ref&gt;"SWOP Letter to the Group of 10 ." Southwest Organizing Project. N.p.. Web. 7 May 2013. &lt;[http://www.swop.net/node/26]&gt;. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514131800/http://www.swop.net/node/26 |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter argued that the environmental movement was so concerned about cleaning up and preserving nature that it ignored the negative side-effects that doing so caused communities nearby, namely less job growth.&lt;ref name="Sandler, R. 2007 pp. 27-55"/&gt; In addition, the [[NIMBY]] movement has transferred [[locally unwanted land use]]s (LULUs) from middle-class neighborhoods to poor communities with large minority populations. Therefore, vulnerable communities with fewer political opportunities are more often exposed to hazardous waste and toxins.&lt;ref name="NIMBY Victims"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in the [[PIBBY]] principle, or at least the PIMBY (Place-in-minorities'-backyard), as supported by the United Church of Christ's study in 1987.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"&gt;{{Cite journal

{{anchor|Environmental elitism}}
As a result, some minorities have viewed the environmental movement as elitist. Environmental elitism manifested itself in three different forms:

# ''Compositional''&amp;nbsp;– Environmentalists are from the middle and upper class.
# ''Ideological''&amp;nbsp;– The reforms benefit the movement's supporters but impose costs on nonparticipants.
# ''Impact''&amp;nbsp;– The reforms have "regressive social impacts". They disproportionately benefit environmentalists and harm underrepresented populations.&lt;ref name="Environmental elitism"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of economic growth have taken advantage of environmentalists' neglect of minorities. They have convinced minority leaders looking to improve their communities that the economic benefits of industrial facility and the increase in the number of jobs are worth the health risks. In fact, both politicians and businesses have even threatened imminent job loss if communities do not accept hazardous industries and facilities. Although in many cases local residents do not actually receive these benefits, the argument is used to decrease resistance in the communities as well as avoid expenditures used to clean up pollutants and create safer workplace environments.&lt;ref name="Job Blackmail"&gt;{{Cite news

===Cost barriers===
{{Original research|section|date=January 2013}}
One of the prominent barriers to minority participation in environmental justice is the initial costs of trying to change the system and prevent companies from dumping their toxic waste and other pollutants in areas with high numbers of minorities living in them. There are massive legal fees involved in fighting for environmental justice and trying to shed environmental racism. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a rule that the claimant may have to cover the fees of their opponents, which further exacerbates any cost issues, especially with lower income minority groups; also, the only way for environmental justice groups to hold companies accountable for their pollution and breaking any licensing issues over waste disposal would be to sue the government for not enforcing rules. This would lead to the forbidding legal fees that most could not afford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=Elisabeth|title=What price environmental justice?|url=http://www.environmentalistonline.com/article/2011-03-09/what-price-environmental-justice|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen by the fact that out of 210 judicial review cases between 2005 and 2009, 56% did not proceed due to costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost Barriers to Environmental Justice|url=http://us.practicallaw.com/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1247269202785&amp;ssbinary=true|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions of the Civil Rights Movement==

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s, activists participated in a social movement that created a unified atmosphere and advocated goals of social justice and equality. The community organization and the social values of the era have translated to the Environmental Justice movement.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

===Similar goals and tactics===

The Environmental Justice movement and the Civil Rights Movement have many commonalities. At their core, the movements' goals are the same: "social justice, equal protection, and an end to institutional discrimination."  By stressing the similarities of the two movements, it emphasizes that environmental equity is a right for all citizens. Because the two movements have parallel goals, it is useful to employ similar tactics that often emerge on the grassroots level. Common confrontational strategies include protests, neighborhood demonstrations, picketing, political pressure, and demonstration.&lt;ref name="African American Community"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Existing organizations and leaders===

Just as the civil rights movement of the 1960s began in the South, the fight for environmental equity has been largely based in the South, where environmental discrimination is most prominent. In these southern communities, black churches and other voluntary associations are used to organize resistance efforts, including research and demonstrations, such as the protest in Warren County, North Carolina. As a result of the existing community structure, many church leaders and civil rights activists, such as Reverend [[Benjamin Chavis Muhammad]], have spearheaded the Environmental Justice movement.&lt;ref name="African American Community"/&gt;

[[The Bronx]], in New York City, has become a recent example of Environmental Justice succeeding. [[Majora Carter]] spearheaded the [[South Bronx Greenway]] Project, bringing local economic development, local [[urban heat island]] mitigation, positive social influences, [[Open Space Accessibility in California|access to public open space]], and aesthetically stimulating environments. The [[New York City Department of Design and Construction]] has recently recognized the value of the South Bronx Greenway design, and consequently utilized it as a widely distributed smart growth template. This venture is the ideal [[shovel-ready]] project with over $50 million in funding.&lt;ref name="southbronx"&gt;{{cite web

===Litigation===

Several of the most successful Environmental Justice lawsuits are based on violations of civil rights laws. The first case to use civil rights as a means to legally challenge the siting of a waste facility was in 1979. With the legal representation of Linda McKeever Bullard, the wife of Robert D. Bullard, residents of Houston's Northwood Manor opposed the decision of the city and Browning Ferris Industries to construct a solid waste facility near their mostly African-American neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Section 602 Lawsuits" /&gt;

In 1979, Northeast Community Action Group, or NECAG, was formed by African American homeowners in a suburban, middle income neighborhood in order to keep a landfill out of their home town. This group was the first organization that found the connection between race and pollution. The group, alongside their attorney Linda McKeever Bullard started the lawsuit Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, Inc., which was the first of its kind to challenge the sitting of a waste facility under civil rights law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Bullard, "Solid Waste Sites and the Black Houston Community," Sociological Inquiry 53 (Spring 1983): 273-288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert. "Dismantling Toxic Racism." Crisis 1 July 2007: 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous Environmental Justice cases.&lt;ref name="Civil Rights Learning"/&gt;

Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. The two most paramount sections in these cases are sections 601 and 602. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an Environmental Justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601; in ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'', the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs must also show intent to discriminate to successfully challenge the government under 602.

==Affected groups==

Among the affected groups of Environmental Justice, those in high-poverty and racial minority groups have the most propensity to receive the harm of environmental injustice. Poor people account for more than 20% of the human health impacts from industrial toxic air releases, compared to 12.9% of the population nationwide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Racial/Ethnic Inequality in Environmental-Hazard Exposure in Metropolitan Los Angeles Manuel Pastor, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not account for the inequity found among individual minority groups. Some studies that test statistically for effects of race and ethnicity, while controlling for income and other factors, suggest racial gaps in exposure that persist across all bands of income.&lt;ref&gt;Justice in the Air: Tracking Toxic Pollution from America's Industries and Companies to Our States, Cities, and Neighborhoods Michael Ash, {{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/justice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725114107/http://www.peri.umass.edu/justice/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

African-Americans are affected by a variety of Environmental Justice issues. One notorious example is the "[[Cancer Alley]]" region of Louisiana. This 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans is home to 125 companies that produce one quarter of the petrochemical products manufactured in the United States. The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] has concluded that the African-American community has been disproportionately affected by Cancer Alley as a result of Louisiana's current state and local permit system for hazardous facilities, as well as their low socio-economic status and limited political influence.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"&gt;Shrader-Frechette. 2002. ''Environmental Justice Creating Equality, Reclaiming Democracy''. Oxford University Press: New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; Another incidence of long-term environmental injustice occurred in the "West Grove" community of Miami, Florida. From 1925 to 1970, the predominately poor, African American residents of the "West Grove" endured the negative effects of exposure to carcinogenic emissions and toxic waste discharge from a large trash incinerator called Old Smokey.&lt;ref&gt;Alfieri, Anthony Victor, Paternalistic Interventions in Civil Rights and Poverty Law: A Case Study of Environmental Justice (November 14, 2013). Michigan Law Review, Vol. 112; University of Miami Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014-3. Available at SSRN: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ssrn.com/abstract=2354382&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite official acknowledgement as a public nuisance, the incinerator project was expanded in 1961. It was not until the surrounding, predominantly white neighborhoods began to experience the negative impacts from Old Smokey that the legal battle began to close the incinerator.

Indigenous groups are often the victims of environmental injustices. [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people|Native Americans have suffered abuses related to uranium mining]] in the American West. Churchrock, New Mexico, in Navajo territory was home to the longest continuous uranium mining in any Navajo land. From 1954 until 1968, the tribe leased land to mining companies who did not obtain consent from Navajo families or report any consequences of their activities. Not only did the miners significantly deplete the limited water supply, but they also contaminated what was left of the Navajo water supply with uranium. Kerr-McGee and United Nuclear Corporation, the two largest mining companies, argued that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act did not apply to them, and maintained that Native American land is not subject to environmental protections. The courts did not force them to comply with US clean water regulations until 1980.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"/&gt;

The most common example of environmental injustice among Latinos is the exposure to pesticides faced by farmworkers. After DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides were banned in the United States in 1972, farmers began using more acutely toxic organophosphate pesticides such as [[parathion]]. A large portion of farmworkers in the US are working as undocumented immigrants, and as a result of their political disadvantage, are not able to protest against regular exposure to pesticides or benefit from the protections of Federal laws.&lt;ref name="Shrader-Frechette 2002"/&gt; Exposure to chemical pesticides in the cotton industry also affects farmers in India and Uzbekistan. Banned throughout much of the rest of the world because of the potential threat to human health and the natural environment, [[Endosulfan]] is a highly toxic chemical, the safe use of which cannot be guaranteed in the many developing countries it is used in. [[Endosulfan]], like DDT, is an organochlorine and persists in the environment long after it has killed the target pests, leaving a deadly legacy for people and wildlife.&lt;ref name="ejfoundation.org"&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219205051/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html |date=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of cities along the US-Mexico border are also affected. [[Maquiladora]]s are assembly plants operated by American, Japanese, and other foreign countries, located along the US-Mexico border. The maquiladoras use cheap Mexican labor to assemble imported components and raw material, and then transport finished products back to the United States. Much of the waste ends up being illegally dumped in sewers, ditches, or in the desert. Along the Lower [[Rio Grande Valley]], maquiladoras dump their toxic wastes into the river from which 95 percent of residents obtain their drinking water. In the border cities of [[Brownsville, Texas]] and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros, Mexico]], the rate of [[anencephaly]] (babies born without brains) is four times the national average.&lt;ref name=bullard&gt;Bullard, Robert D.

Web. &lt;http://www.unc.edu/courses/2005spring/epid/278/001/Bullard2000JSocIssues.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

States may also see placing toxic facilities near poor neighborhoods as preferential from a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) perspective. A CBA may favor placing a toxic facility near a city of 20,000 poor people than near a city of 5,000 wealthy people.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, R., &amp; Phaedra, P. (2007). Environmental justice and environmentalism. (pp. 57-83).&lt;/ref&gt;  Terry Bossert of [[Range Resources]] reportedly has said that it deliberately locates its operations in poor neighbourhoods instead of wealthy areas where residents have more money to challenge its practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://powersource.post-gazette.com/powersource/latest-oil-and-gas/2016/04/18/Executive-s-remark-about-shale-gas-well-sites-prompts-sharp-criticism-calls-for-review/stories/201604180027 Range Resources exec's well-site remarks drawing sharp criticism: Does Range avoid rich neighborhoods?]—''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' (April 18, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Housing Discrimination in the East Bay|Northern California's East Bay Refinery Corridor]] is an example of the disparities associated with race and income and proximity to toxic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fractracker.org/2016/03/north-coast-refinery-corridor/|title=Petrochemical Industry in East Bay North Coast Refinery Corridor|date=2016-03-30|work=FracTracker Alliance|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that environmental justice issues generally tend to affect women in communities more so than they affect men. This is due to the way that women typically interact more closely with their environments at home, such as through handling food preparation and childcare. Women also tend to be the leaders in environmental justice activist movements. Despite this, it tends not to be considered a mainstream feminist issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Karen|year=2016|title=Bread and Roses: A Gender Perspective on Environmental Justice and Public Health|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.3390/ijerph13101005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government agencies==

===U.S. Department of Agriculture===

In its 2012 environmental justice strategy documents, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission, internal operations and programming. It identified ambitious timeframes for action and promised improved efforts to highlight, track and coordinate EJ activities among its many sub-agencies. Agency-wide the USDA expanded its perspective on EJ, so that in addition to preventing disproportionate environmental impacts on EJ communities, USDA voiced a commitment to improve public participation processes and use its technical and financial assistance programs to improve the quality of life in all communities. In 2011, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the USDA's focus on EJ in rural communities around the United States. USDA funds or implements many creative programs with social and environmental equity goals, however it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ, and faces the challenges of limited budgets and coordinating the efforts of a highly diverse agency.

====Background====

The USDA is the executive agency responsible for federal policy on food, agriculture, [[natural resources]], and [[quality of life]] in rural America.&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;USDA, Mission Statement, {{cite web |url=http://usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701232252/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA has more than 100,000 employees and delivers over $96.5 billion in public services to programs worldwide.&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;USDA, Performance and Accountability Report at ii, http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/mimedetector?url=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf&amp;text=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100505073828/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/mimedetector?url=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf&amp;text=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf |date=2010-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill its general mandate, USDA's departments are organized into seven mission areas:1) Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services; 2) Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services; 3) Food Safety; 4) Marketing and Regulatory Programs; 5) Natural Resources and Environment; 6) Research, Education and Economics and; 7) Rural Development.&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;USDA, Mission Areas, http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_MISSION_AREAS&amp;navtype=RT&amp;parentnav=AGENCIES_OFFICES.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, "Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations." Executive Order 12898 requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency's mission. Agency programs, policies and activities can lead to health and environmental effects that disproportionately impact minority and low-income populations. Under Executive Order 12898 agencies must develop strategies that identify and address these effects by:

# promoting enforcement of all health and environmental statutes in areas with minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# ensuring greater [[public participation]]&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
# improving research and data collection relating to the health and environment of minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;; &lt;/nowiki&gt;and
# identifying differential patterns of [[resource consumption|consumption of natural resources]] among minority and low-income populations.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that federal funds be used in a fair and equitable manner. Under Title VI any federal agency that receives federal funding cannot discriminate. Title VI also forbids federal agencies from providing grants or funding opportunities to programs that discriminate. An agency that violates Title VI can lose its federal funding.

Following E.O. 12898 and USDA's initial EJ strategic plan, USDA issued its internal Environmental Justice Department Regulation (DR 5600-002) in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002,{{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the definition of EJ was undergoing updates in 2012, DR 5600-002 defines environmental justice as "to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, all populations are provided the opportunity to comment before decisions are rendered on, are allowed to share in the benefits of, are not excluded from, and are not affected in a disproportionately high and adverse manner by, government programs and activities affecting human health or the environment."&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 4,{{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Holmes, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment at USDA, notes that this definition will be broadened in 2012 so that EJ also includes efforts to improve quality of life in all communities.&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;Patrick Homes, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment at USDA, interview with Shannon Kay Little(May 1, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, USDA will consider EJ to include avoiding adverse impacts ''and'' ensuring access to environmental benefits. Further, DR 5600-002 identified USDA's goals in implementing Executive Order 12898 as:

* To incorporate environmental justice considerations into USDA's programs and activities and to address environmental justice across mission areas&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* To identify, prevent, and/or mitigate, to the greatest extent practicable, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of USDA programs and activities on minority and low-income populations&lt;nowiki&gt;; &lt;/nowiki&gt;and
* To provide, to the greatest extent practicable, the opportunity for minority and low-income populations to participate in planning, analysis, and decisionmaking that affects their health or environment, including identification of program needs and designs.&lt;ref name="ftn7"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 5, .&lt;/ref&gt;

DR 5600-002 is "intended only to improve the internal management of USDA," and although it described concrete, mandatory actions by the agency, it did not establish new rights or benefits enforceable in court.&lt;ref name="ftn66"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 13, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has stated a more concrete priority to fulfill its mission of environmental justice in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ftn60"&gt;Secretary Vilsack, State of Environmental Justice Speech, http://irjci.blogspot.com/2011/04/vilsack-those-interested-in.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 Environmental Justice Strategy====

In compliance with the August 2011 Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898 (MOU), USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan: 2012 to 2014 on February 7, 2012 (Strategic Plan), which identifies new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a 1995 EJ strategy it adopted in response to E.O. 12898.&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same week, it also released its first annual implementation progress report (Progress Report), as the MOU also required.&lt;ref name="ftn11"&gt;USDA, Progress Report, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary's message accompanying the Strategic Plan described two immediate tasks: 1) each agency within USDA is required to identify a point of contact for EJ issues, at the Senior Executive Service (SES) level; and 2) each agency must develop its own EJ strategy prior to April 15, 2012, and begin implementing it as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="ftn31"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 3, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2012, it did not appear that such strategies had been made public, although sub-agencies provided internal reports to the USDA's EJ steering committee on April 9, 2012, according to Holmes.&lt;nowiki&gt; The Secretary's message contained strong language that, "Given that USDA programs touch almost every American every day, the Department is well positioned to help in [the environmental justice] effort."&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; USDA has determined that it can achieve the requirements of the Executive Order by integrating EJ into its programs, rather than implementing new and costly programs.&lt;ref name="ftn14"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 4, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency took this same approach in an EJ strategy it adopted in 1995.&lt;ref name="ftn15"&gt;USDA, 1995 Strategy at 3, {{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111061339/http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, such as agricultural chemicals and effects to migrant workers, USDA reviews its practices to identify potential disproportionate, adverse impacts on EJ communities, according to Blake Velde, Senior Environmental Scientist with the USDA Hazardous Materials Management Division.&lt;ref name="ftn16"&gt;Blake Velde, Senior Environmental Scientist with the USDA Hazardous Materials Management Division, interview with Shannon Kay Little (April 25, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, however, USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity, such as its initiatives on education, food deserts, and economic development in impacted communities, and ensuring access to environmental benefits is the focus of USDA's EJ efforts.

Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Harris Sherman is the political appointee generally responsible for USDA's EJ strategy, with Patrick Holmes, a senior staffer to the Under Secretary, playing a coordinating role. Although USDA has no staff dedicated solely to EJ, its sub-agencies have many offices dedicated to civil rights compliance, outreach and communication and environmental review whose responsibilities incorporate EJ issues.&lt;ref name="ftn68"&gt;Holmes interview.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan was developed with the input of an Environmental Justice Working Group, made up of staff and leadership representing the USDA's seven mission areas and the SES-level contacts, which were appointed in early 2012, serve as a steering committee for the agency's efforts.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; The Strategic Plan is organized according to six goals, which were purposefully left broad, and lists specific objectives and agency performance measures under each goal. The details and specific implementation of many of these programs and the performance measures are left to the departments and sub-agencies to develop.&lt;ref name="ftn19"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 5, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The six goals are to:

* Ensure USDA programs provide opportunities for EJ communities.
* Provide targeted training and capacity-building to EJ communities.
* Expand public participation in agency activities, to enhance the "credibility and public trust" of the USDA.
* Ensure USDA's activities do not have disproportionately high and adverse human health impacts, and resolve environmental justice issues and complaints.
* Increase the awareness of EJ issues among USDA employees.
* Update and/or Develop Departmental and Agency Regulations on EJ.

The Strategic Plan also lists existing programs that either currently support the goal, or are expected to in the future. According to Holmes, some of the challenges of the Strategic Plan process have stemmed from the diverse programs and missions that the agency serves, limitations on staff time, and budgets.&lt;ref name="ftn20"&gt;Holmes interview. With regards to budgets, Holmes noted that in April 2012 the USDA's Programs for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers, which provides loans to women, African Americans, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for farm and ranch property purchases, improvements and soil and water conservation projects, was facing a loss of its entire $75 million budget in the Farm Bill.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental Justice initiatives====

The Strategic Plan requires that EJ must be integrated into the strategies and evaluations for sub-agencies' technical and financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn34"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 5, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; It also emphasizes public participation, community capacity-building, EJ awareness and training within the USDA.

=====Transparency, accountability, accessibility and community participation=====

A stated goal of USDA's Strategic Plan is to expand public participation in agency activities, to enhance the "credibility and public trust" of the USDA.&lt;ref name="ftn22"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the agency will update its public participation guidelines to include EJ, beginning this process by April 15, 2012. The Strategic Plan emphasizes capacity-building in EJ communities, and includes objectives that emphasize communication between USDA and environmental justice communities, including Tribal consultation. Sub-agencies must announce schedules for training programs in EJ communities and to develop new, preliminary outreach materials on USDA programs by April 15, 2012.&lt;ref name="ftn23"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 7, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional performance standard is to encourage EJ communities to participate in the NEPA process, an effort the Strategic Plan requires on or before February 29, 2012,&lt;ref name="ftn24"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 10, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; although the Strategic Plan does not articulate a standard by which this could be measured. The Strategic Plan also reiterates compliance with the Executive Orders on Tribal consultation and outreach to non-proficient English speakers, and seeks more diverse representation on regional forest advisory committees. [community participation, outreach]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Generally, the USDA's process for developing the Strategic Plan demonstrates a commitment to public involvement. The USDA EJ documents are currently housed obscurely within the Departmental Management section of the USDA website, under the Hazardous Materials Management Division, although the agency plans to update its entire site in 2012 and create a more robust EJ page.&lt;ref name="ftn25"&gt;USDA, Brownfields Environmental Justice, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/brownfields.htm&lt;nowiki&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226175222/http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/brownfields.htm |date=February 26, 2012 }}; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Velde interview.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan was released in draft form in December 2011 for a 30-day public comment period, and responses to general types of comments received are in the Progress Report, although the comments themselves are not online.&lt;ref name="ftn26"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 3-7, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary's message accompanying the Strategic Plan requests that organizations and individuals to continue to contact USDA with comments on the Strategic Plan and to identify USDA programs that have been the most beneficial to their communities.&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; The agency has a dedicated email address for this purpose. Agency leadership has asked its sub-agencies to prepare responses to additional comments that have been received, and the agency will release an interim progress report, prior to winter 2013.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[community participation, outreach, education]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=====Internal evaluation and training=====

The Strategic Plan also seeks to increase the awareness of environmental justice issues among USDA employees.&lt;ref name="ftn29"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 12-13, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strategic Plan does not list any existing programs in this area, but does list a series of performance measures going forward, most of which must be met by April 15, 2012. The measures include environmental justice trainings, new web pages, and potential revisions to staff manuals and handbooks. Sub-agencies began reviewing their existing training in 2012 and in their April 9, 2012 reports to the USDA EJ steering committee, sub-agencies were asked to describe their goals for enhanced EJ training.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; This internal, educational undertaking appears to be new in the 2012 Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan targets Responsible Officials, meaning office and program managers, for the trainings, as well as the SES-level points of contact required by the Secretary's message. [education, study, compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The EJ Strategy tasked each sub-agency with developing its own EJ strategy document by spring 2012, although as of May 2012 the sub-agencies were still in an evaluation stage and had not issued final documents.&lt;ref name="ftn31"/&gt; For many sub-agencies, the 2012 process has been their first focused assessment of their EJ impact and opportunities.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; Going forward, sub-agencies will submit twice-yearly reports to NRE about their implementation of the Strategic Plan's goals; the first of these was due April 9, 2012, and as of May 2012, the USDA's EJ steering committee was evaluating the first reports.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;

=====Establishment of performance metrics=====

As part of its effort to ensure that EJ communities have the opportunity to participate in USDA programs, the Strategic Plan requires each sub-agency to set measurements through which it can track increased EJ community participation in USDA technical and financial assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn34"/&gt; This must be done by April 15, 2012. As of late April 2012, the sub-agencies were still in the process of describing a baseline of current activities and determining the metrics to evaluate improvement, such as staff time, grant funding or increased programming.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; The ultimate metrics are likely to be somewhat subjective, and must be flexible given the broad range of undertakings by the sub-agencies.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; Also related to evaluation, the Strategic Plan requires the sub-agencies to determine an effective methodology with which they can evaluate whether USDA programs have disproportionate impacts.&lt;ref name="ftn37"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [study, redressing environmental racism, compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=====Other EJ initiatives=====

======Tribal outreach======

USDA has had a role in implementing Michelle Obama's ''Let's Move'' campaign in Tribal Areas, by increasing participation by Bureau of Indian Education schools in Federal nutrition programs, in the development of community gardens on Tribal lands, and in the development of Tribal food policy councils.&lt;ref name="ftn38"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This is combined with measures to provide Rural Development funding for community infrastructure in Indian Country.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [children's issues, education, diet, grants, Native Americans, public health].&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) is working to update its policy on protection and management of Native American Sacred Sites, an effort that has included listening sessions and government-to-government consultation.&lt;ref name="ftn78"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 10, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has also consulted with Tribes regarding management of reintroduced of species, where Tribes may have a history of subsistence-level hunting of those species. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is exploring a program to use meat from bisons raised on Tribal land to supply AMS food distribution programs to Tribes.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [Native Americans, diet, subsistence, community participation]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The Intertribal Technical Assistance Network works to improve access of Tribal governments, communities and individuals to USDA technical assistance programs.&lt;ref name="ftn50"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 8, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

======Technical and financial assistance to farmers======

The Progress Report highlights the NRCS Strike Force Initiative, which has identified impoverished counties in Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas to receive increased outreach and training regarding USDA assistance programs. USDA credits this increased outreach with generating a 196 percent increase in contracts, representing more than 250,000 acres of farmland, in its Environmental Quality Incentives Program.&lt;ref name="ftn50"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [economic benefit, equitable development, grants, outreach, ej as evaluation criteria] NRCS works with &lt;/nowiki&gt;"private landowners protect their natural resources"&lt;ref name="ftn44"&gt;USDA, NRCS EJ Guidance at 1, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045586.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; through conservation planning and assistance with the goal of maintaining "productive lands and healthy ecosystems."&lt;ref name="ftn45"&gt;USDA, About NRCS, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/about NRCS.&lt;/ref&gt; NRCS has its own civil rights compliance guidance document, and in 2001 NRCS funded and published a study, "Environmental Justice: Perceptions of Issues, Awareness and Assistance," focused on rural, Southern "Black Belt" counties and analyzing how the NRCS workforce could more effectively integrate environmental justice into impacted communities.&lt;ref name="ftn46"&gt;USDA, NRCS EJ Guidance, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045586.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [compliance and enforcement, redressing environmental racism, grants, study, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The Farm Services Agency in 2011 devoted $100,000 of its Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers program budget to improving its outreach to counties with persistent poverty, including improving its materials and building relationships with local universities and community groups.&lt;ref name="ftn47"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [economic benefit, equitable development, grants, outreach, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In addition, USDA's Risk Management Agency has initiated education and outreach to low-income farmers regarding use of biological controls, rather than pesticides, for pest control, efforts that the agency believes are valuable in the face of climate change.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [climate change, agricultural chemicals, education]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Green jobs and capacity building======

A 2011 MOU between a USDA sub-agency, the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) and the American Indian Science and Engineering Society that aims to increase the number of Native Americans entering the FSIS career path;&lt;ref name="ftn49"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 9, [http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [education, community participation, economic benefit, green jobs, Native Americans, diet, interagency collaboration]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A partnership between APHIS and the Rural Coalition (Coalicion)--an alliance of regionally and culturally diverse organizations working to build a more just and sustainable food system. The partnership focuses on outreach, fair returns to minority and other small farmers and rural communities, farmworker working conditions, environmental protection and food safety.&lt;ref name="ftn50"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [agricultural chemicals, community participation, diet, economic benefit, outreach, improving health and safety, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

USFS is also funding pilot initiatives, such as its Urban Water Ambassadors, summer internship positions for youth who coordinate and implement urban tree planting projects.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt; In 2011, USFS provided a grant to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources that funded 14 summer jobs for youth in Baltimore to work on urban watershed restoration programs.&lt;ref name="ftn52"&gt;USDA, Progress Report at 8-9, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalEJImplementationreport_1.pdf Report.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [community participation, green jobs, mapping, water]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Mapping======

USFS has established several Urban Field Stations, to research urban natural resources' structure, function, stewardship, and benefits.&lt;ref name="ftn54"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 6, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; By mapping urban tree coverage, the agency hopes to identify and prioritize EJ communities for urban forest projects.&lt;ref name="ftn54"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [community education, mapping, diet, improving health and safety, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Another initiative highlighted by the agency is the Food and Nutrition Service and Economic Research Service's Food Desert Locator.&lt;ref name="ftn55"&gt;USDA, Food Desert Locator, http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/FoodDesert/.&lt;/ref&gt; The Locator provides a spatial view of food deserts, defined as a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. It also shows, by census tract, the number and percentage of certain populations, such as children, seniors, or households without a vehicle, with low access to grocery stores. The mapped deserts can be used to direct agency resources to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other food assistance programs, according to Blake Velde, an agency scientist and spokesperson on EJ issues.&lt;ref name="ftn56"&gt;Velde interview.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [diet, mapping, improving health and safety, study, ej as evaluation criteria, services and data available to others]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

======Rural outreach======

USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has placed a clear emphasis on supporting EJ in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt; Although&lt;nowiki&gt; "often the highest profile battles on [environmental justice] issue[s] are waged in at-risk neighborhoods in major cities or at Superfund sites located near populated urban and &lt;/nowiki&gt;suburban areas" Vilsack highlighted the often overlooked rural areas where environmental justice is largely ignored.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt;

Through its Rural Utilities Service, the USDA supports a number of Water and Environmental Programs. These programs work to administer water and wastewater loans or grants to rural areas and cities to support water and wastewater, stormwater and solid waste disposal systems, including SEARCH grants that are targeted to financially distressed, small rural communities and other opportunities specifically for Alaskan Native villages and designated Colonias.;&lt;ref name="ftn59"&gt;USDA, Water and Environmental Programs Fact Sheet, {{cite web|url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/SupportDocuments/RUS%20Fact%20Sheet%201806%20new.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625211242/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/SupportDocuments/RUS%20Fact%20Sheet%201806%20new.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USDA, Water and Environmental Programs Website, http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/UWEP_HomePage.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Secretary Vilsack said that the USDA funded 2,575 clean water projects in rural areas during a two-year period to address problems ranging from wastewater treatment to sewage treatment.&lt;ref name="ftn60"/&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [water, land use, compliance and enforcement, improving health and safety, pollution cleanup, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The USDA also supports the Rural Energy for America Grant Program. This program provides grants and loans to farmers, ranchers and rural small businesses to finance renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements.&lt;ref name="ftn61"&gt;USDA, Rural Energy Grants, {{cite web |url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/busp/9006grant.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620054541/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/busp/9006grant.htm |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[grants, economic benefit, ej as evaluation criteria]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Regulations or Formalized EJ Guidelines====

In 1997 the USDA promulgated a departmental regulation providing "direction to&lt;nowiki&gt; [&lt;/nowiki&gt;sub-]agencies for integrating environmental justice considerations into USDA programs and activities" (DR 5600-002).&lt;ref name="ftn62"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 1, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Issuance of this regulation was a primary goal of USDA's 1995 EJ strategy document.&lt;ref name="ftn63"&gt;USDA, 1995 Strategy at 4, {{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111061339/http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/publications/interagency/usda-strategy-1995.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; DR 5600-002 includes guidelines for consideration of EJ in the NEPA process, but also stated that "efforts to address environmental justice are not limited to NEPA compliance."&lt;ref name="ftn64"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 6.b., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires evaluation of activities for potential disproportionate EJ impacts, outreach, and performance-metric based evaluation and reporting on sub-agencies' implementation of EJ goals.&lt;ref name="ftn65"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Secs. 6-10, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; DR 5600-002 is a forward-looking, permanent directive that applies to all USDA programs and activities. However, it was not published in the Federal Register as a formal rulemaking and does not create a private right of action or enforcement tool.&lt;ref name="ftn66"/&gt; A Strategic Plan goal is to update this regulation, as well as other departmental regulations and policies on EJ.&lt;ref name="ftn67"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 13,[http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; According to USDA, the EJ definition in DR 5600-002 will be modified in 2012—EJ to include measures to avoid disproportionate negative impacts as well as quality-of-life improvements that the agency believes can benefit impacted communities.&lt;ref name="ftn68" /&gt;

The Strategic Plan also has established a performance standard requiring that existing and new USDA regulations are evaluated for EJ impacts or benefits.&lt;ref name="ftn69"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11,[http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-agencies are required to develop a process for this evaluation by April 15, 2012. This performance standard reflects a requirement in DR 5600-002 that required the USDA departmental regulation on rulemaking, DR 1521-1, to be revised to require an EJ evaluation in the rulemaking process.&lt;ref name="ftn70"&gt;USDA, DR 5600-002, Sec. 11, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, DR 1521-1 requires that a cost-benefit analysis of major human health, safety and environmental regulations include analysis of risks to "persons who are disproportionately exposed or particularly sensitive," although DR 1521-1 does not mention EJ or impacts to minority or low-income communities explicitly.&lt;ref name="ftn71"&gt;USDA, DR 1521-1, Sec. 6.c(3), http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR1521-001.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[Land Use - permitting, community participation, compliance and enforcement, study]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Enforcement====

The Strategic Plan sets an enforcement-specific goal, which includes objectives to "effectively resolve or adjudicate all environmental justice-related Title VI complaints" and to include environmental justice as a key component of civil rights compliance reviews.&lt;ref name="ftn72"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 11, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies are also required to identify an assessment methodology by April 15, 2012, which can be used to determine whether programs have disproportionately high and adverse environmental and human health impacts. The NRCS has published and updated a Civil Rights Compliance Review Guide, which guides the NRCS Civil Rights Division's review of the compliance with Title VI and 12898 in the agency's state offices, field offices and other facilities.&lt;ref name="ftn73"&gt;USDA, NRCS Civil Rights Compliance Guide at 4, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1046364.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The guide was updated in November 2011 and it does not mention EJ explicitly.&lt;ref name="ftn74"&gt;USDA, NRCS Civil Rights Compliance Guide, https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1046364.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Strategic Plan identifies the NRCS compliance review and other outreach and research programs as supporting its EJ enforcement goals.&lt;ref name="ftn75"&gt;USDA, Strategic Plan at 12, http://www.dm.usda.gov/hmmd/FinalUSDAEJSTRATScan_1.pdf Plan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; [compliance and enforcement]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====NEPA====

The 1997 Regulation, DR 5600-2 required USDA sub-agencies to develop their own NEPA environmental justice guidance documents.&lt;ref name="ftn76"&gt;USDA, DR5600-2, Sec. 8, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-agencies have done so, with some additional details, such as a reminder that the EJ community should be involved in identifying the alternatives, suggested stakeholders and resources, and guidance to hold meetings at times when working people can get to them, and to translate notices.&lt;ref name="ftn77"&gt;USDA, RUS Environmental Guidance at 44, 67, {{cite web|url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/me/Misc/1794A-602.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224000332/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/me/Misc/1794A-602.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-24 |df= }} Guidance.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when DR 5600-02 is updated as required by the Strategic Plan, changes could be made to the NEPA section of the Regulation. The Strategic Plan sets a performance standard to encourage interested environmental justice communities to be involved in the public participation process for NEPA documents, although the Strategic Plan does not require updates to the NEPA portions of DR 5600-02.&lt;ref name="ftn78"/&gt;

Although the USDA has integrated EJ into each step of the NEPA process as required by Executive Order 12898, many of the NEPA documents completed by the USDA include only cursory analysis of environmental justice effects. This analysis most often includes a rote paragraph as to what Executive Order 12898 requires and a quick conclusion that the agency action does not affect minority and low-income populations. Some examples where the USDA included more in-depth analysis are:

* Descriptions of the minority and low-income populations that live in the study area&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn79"&gt;USDA, NRCS Logan Canal EJ Analysis, {{cite web |url=http://www.ut.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/EWP/LNCRP/data/Draft_EIS/Chapters/Appendices/7_LNCR-DEIS_appC4-demographics.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218170717/http://www.ut.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/EWP/LNCRP/data/Draft_EIS/Chapters/Appendices/7_LNCR-DEIS_appC4-demographics.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permitting====

The USDA does not have any permitting initiatives specific to EJ.

====Title VI====

The USDA has an Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights whose mission it is to provide leadership and direction "for the fair and equitable treatment of all USDA customers."&lt;ref name="ftn81"&gt;USDA, OASCR Website, http://www.ascr.usda.gov/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the USDA revised DR 4300-4, internal regulations requiring a Civil Rights Impact Analysis of all "policies, actions or decisions" affecting the USDA's federally conducted and federally assisted programs or activities.&lt;ref name="ftn82"&gt;USDA, DR4300-4, Sec. 3.b., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625183740/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis is used to determine the "scope, intensity, direction, duration, and significance of the effects of an agency's proposed ... policies, actions or decisions."&lt;ref name="ftn83"&gt;USDA, DR4300-4, Sec. 3.c., {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625183740/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR4300-4.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; USDA's departmental regulation on EJ, DR 5600-002, required DR 4300-4 to be revised to "require that Civil Rights Impact Analyses include a finding as to whether proposed or new actions have or do not have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on the human health or the environment of minority populations, and whether such effects can be prevented or mitigated".&lt;ref name="ftn84"&gt;USDA, DR5600-002, Sec. 11, {{cite web|url=http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625181250/http://www.ocio.usda.gov/directives/doc/DR5600-002.htm |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although DR 4300-4 was revised in 2003, the revised regulation does not explicitly require a finding on adverse environmental or health impacts. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;study, compliance and enforcement]

===Right-to-know movement===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}
A new movement, bent on educating the people, was born after the [[Bhopal disaster]], called the "[[Right to know|right-to-know]]" movement. A series of laws and reports was created, all built to inform the people of the [[pollutant]]s being dumped into our{{Who|date=August 2015}} neighborhoods and atmosphere, and exactly how much of each chemical is being exposed and dumped. The theory behind "right-to-know" is that once people are informed on what is polluting their neighborhood, then they will begin to take action in both bringing down their own emissions, as well as begin to make the companies causing the most pollution, through means such as protests, to take into account their actions.

====Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986====
After the [[Bhopal disaster]], where a Union Carbide plant released forty tons of [[methyl isocyanate]] into the atmosphere in a village just south of Bhopal, India, the U.S. government passed the [[Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/epcra/what-epcra|title=What is EPCRA?|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced by Henry Waxman, the act required all corporations to report their toxic chemical pollution annually, which was then gathered into a report known as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program|title=Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program|work=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program|url=http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program|website=epa.gov|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By collecting this data, the government was able to make sure that companies were no longer releasing excessive amounts of deadly toxins into populated areas, so to prevent another incident like that of the thousands of people killed and the tens of thousands of people injured in the Bhopal disaster.

====Corporate Toxics Information Report====
The Corporate Toxics Information Project (CTIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|title=PERI: Corporate Toxics Information Project|work=umass.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629000817/http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|archivedate=2015-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Toxics Information Project|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|website=PERI|publisher=Political Economy Research Institute|accessdate=27 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629000817/http://www.peri.umass.edu/ctip_research/|archivedate=29 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded on the guidelines that they will "[develop] and [disseminate] information and analysis on corporate releases of pollutants and the consequences for communities". The overarching goal was to help take corporations into account for their pollution habits, by collecting information and putting it in databases so to make it available to the general public. The four goals of the project were to develop 1) corporate rankings, 2) regional reports, based on state, region, and metropolitan areas, 3) industry reports, based on industrial sectors, and 4) to create a web-based resource open to the entire population, that can depict all the collected data. The data collection would be done by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/|website=epa.gov|publisher=EPA|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then analyzed and disseminated by the PERI institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peri.umass.edu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest projects of CTIP was the Toxic 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |title=PERI: Archive: Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index |work=umass.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629013855/http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |archivedate=2015-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxics 100 |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |website=PERI |publisher=Political Economy Research Institute |accessdate=27 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629013855/http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic_archive/ |archivedate=29 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toxic 100 is an index of the top 100 air polluters around the United States in terms of the country's largest corporations. The list is based on the EPA's Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI), which "assesses the chronic human health risk from industrial toxic releases", as well as the [[Toxics Release Inventory]] (TRI), which is where the corporations must report their chemical releases to the US government. Since its original publishing date in 2004, the Toxic 100 has been updated four more times, with the latest publishing date being August 2013.

==Around the world==
{{Green politics sidebar |Related}}

In recent years environmental justice campaigns have also emerged in other parts of the world, such as India, South Africa, Israel, Nigeria, Mexico, Hungary, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. In Europe for example, there is evidence to suggest that the [[Romani people]] and other minority groups of non-European descent are suffering from environmental inequality and discrimination.&lt;ref name="capacity.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/snapshot_for_ej.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920234947/http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/snapshot_for_ej.pdf |date=September 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Making the Case for Environmental Justice in Central and Eastern Europe|last = Steger, T.

===Europe===
''For further information, see [[Environmental racism in Europe]]''

In Europe, the [[Romani people]]s are ethnic minorities and differ from the rest of the European people by their culture, language, and history. The environmental discrimination that they experience ranges from the unequal distribution of environmental harms as well as the unequal distribution of education, health services and employment. In many countries Romani peoples are forced to live in the slums because many of the laws to get residence permits are discriminatory against them. This forces Romani people to live in urban "ghetto" type housing or in shantytowns. In the Czech Republic and Romania, the Romani peoples are forced to live in places that have less access to running water and sewage, and in Ostrava, Czech Republic, the Romani people live in apartments located above an abandoned mine, which emits methane. Also in Bulgaria, the public infrastructure extends throughout the town of Sofia until it reaches the Romani village where there is very little water access or sewage capacity.&lt;ref name="Steger, 2008"&gt;Steger, Tamara and Richard Filcak. 2009. ''Articulating the basis for Promoting Environmental Justice in Central and Eastern Europe''. Environmental Justice: Volume 1, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union is trying to strive towards environmental justice by putting into effect declarations that state that all people have a right to a healthy environment. The Stockholm Declaration, the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission]]'s Report&amp;nbsp;– "[[Our Common Future]]", the [[Rio Declaration]], and Article 37 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], all are ways that the Europeans have put acts in place to work toward environmental justice.&lt;ref name="Steger, 2008"/&gt; Europe also funds action-oriented projects that work on furthering Environmental Justice throughout the world. For example, '''EJOLT''' ('''Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade''') is a large multinational project supported through the FP7 Science in Society budget line from the [[European Commission]].{{Elucidate|date=March 2012}} From March 2011 to March 2015, 23 civil society organizations and universities from 20 countries in Europe, Africa, Latin-America, and Asia are, and have promised to work together on advancing the cause of Environmental Justice. EJOLT is building up case studies, linking organisations worldwide, and making an interactive global map of Environmental Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejolt.org/ |title=Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade |publisher=EJOLT |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====

Sweden became the first country to ban [[Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane|DDT]] in 1969 due to the efforts of women protesting its usage in forests. In the 1980s, women activists organized around preparing jam made from pesticide-tainted berries, which they offered to the members of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWEZCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;ots=vwscYvzeSK&amp;dq=sweden%20jam%20berries%20pesticides&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=sweden&amp;f=false|title=Women Pioneers For The Environment|last=Breton|first=Mary Joy|date=2016-02-01|publisher=Northeastern University Press|isbn=9781555538552|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radical Ecology: The Search for a Livable World|last=Merchant|first=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0415935784|location=New York, NY|pages=193|quote=In Sweden, feminists prepare jam from berries sprayed with herbicides and offer a taste to members of parliament: they refuse.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament members refused, and this has often been cited as an example of direct action within [[ecofeminism]].

====United Kingdom====

Whilst the predominant agenda of the Environmental Justice movement in the United States has been tackling issues of race, inequality, and the environment, environmental justice campaigns around the world have developed and shifted in focus. For example, the EJ movement in the United Kingdom is quite different. It focuses on issues of poverty and the environment, but also tackles issues of [[health inequalities]] and [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/environmental_justice.pdf|format=PDF|title=Environmental justice: Rights and means to a healthy environment for all|publisher=ESRC Global Environmental Change Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UK-based NGO, named the [[Environmental Justice Foundation]], has sought to make a direct link between the need for environmental security and the defense of basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejfoundation.org/page231.html |title=About Us |publisher=Environmental Justice Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907052127/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page231.html |archivedate=2012-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have launched several high profile campaigns that link environmental problems and social injustices. A campaign against illegal, unreported and unregulated ([[IUU]]) fishing highlighted how 'pirate' fisherman are stealing food from local, artisanal fishing communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/08/pirate-fishing-eco-disaster-report "Pirate fishing causing eco disaster and killing communities, says report"] The Guardian, June 8th 2009, retrieved 8th October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EJF. 2005.

Environmental Justice Foundation, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; They have also launched a campaign exposing the environmental and human rights abuses involved in cotton production in [[Uzbekistan]]. [[Cotton produced in Uzbekistan]] is often [[harvested by children]] for little or no pay. In addition, the mismanagement of water resources for crop irrigation has led to the near eradication of the [[Aral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejfoundation.org/page142.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410221416/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page142.html |archivedate=2010-04-10 |df= }}"Cotton in Uzbekistan: Environmental Justice Foundation"&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Justice Foundation has successfully petitioned large retailers such as [[Wal-mart]] and [[Tesco]] to stop selling [[Uzbek cotton]].&lt;ref name="Mathiason"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/24/retail-ethicalbusiness | title=Uzbekistan forced to stop child labor | work=[[The Observer]] | date=May 24, 2009 | accessdate=May 14, 2016 | author=Mathiason, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Building of alternatives to climate change====

In [[France]], numerous [[Alternatiba, Village of Alternatives|Alternatiba]] events, or villages of alternatives, are providing hundreds of alternatives to [[climate change]] and lack of environmental justice, both in order to raise people's awareness and to stimulate behaviour change. They have been or will be organized in over sixty different French and European cities, such as [[Bilbao]], [[Brussels]], [[Geneva]], [[Lyon]] or [[Paris]].

===South Africa===

Under colonial and [[apartheid]] governments in South Africa, thousands of black South Africans were removed from their ancestral lands to make way for game parks. Earthlife Africa was formed in 1988 (www.earthlife.org.za), making it Africa's first environmental justice organisation. In 1992, the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF), a nationwide umbrella organization designed to coordinate the activities of environmental activists and organizations interested in social and environmental justice, was created. By 1995, the network expanded to include 150 member organizations and by 2000, it included over 600 member organizations.&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

With the election of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in 1994, the environmental justice movement gained an ally in government. The ANC noted "poverty and environmental degradation have been closely linked" in South Africa.{{Attribution needed|date=March 2012}} The ANC made it clear that environmental inequalities and injustices would be addressed as part of the party's post-apartheid reconstruction and development mandate. The new South African Constitution, finalized in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights that grants South Africans the right to an "environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being" and "to have the environment protected, for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures that
#prevent pollution and ecological degradation;
#promote conservation; and
#secure [[ecologically sustainable development]] and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development".&lt;ref name=southafrica&gt;McDonald, David A. Environmental Justice in South Africa. Cape Town: Ohio UP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa's mining industry is the largest single producer of [[solid waste]], accounting for about two-thirds of the total waste stream.{{Vague|date=March 2012}} Tens of thousands of deaths have occurred among mine workers as a result of accidents over the last century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} There have been several deaths and debilitating diseases from work-related illnesses like [[asbestosis]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} For those who live next to a mine, the quality of air and water is poor. Noise, dust, and dangerous equipment and vehicles can be threats to the safety of those who live next to a mine as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These communities are often poor and black and have little choice over the placement of a mine near their homes. The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] introduced a new Minerals Act that began to address environmental considerations by recognizing the health and safety concerns of workers and the need for land rehabilitation during and after mining operations. In 1993, the Act was amended to require each new mine to have an Environmental Management Program Report (EMPR) prepared before breaking ground. These EMPRs were intended to force mining companies to outline all the possible environmental impacts of the particular mining operation and to make provision for environmental management.&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

In October 1998, the Department of Minerals and Energy released a White Paper entitled ''A Minerals and Mining Policy for South Africa'', which included a section on Environmental Management. The White Paper states "Government, in recognition of the responsibility of the State as custodian of the nation's natural resources, will ensure that the essential development of the country's mineral resources will take place within a framework of sustainable development and in accordance with national environmental policy, norms, and standards". It adds that any environmental policy "must ensure a cost-effective and competitive mining industry."&lt;ref name=southafrica/&gt;

===Australia===

In Australia, the "Environmental Justice Movement" is not defined as it is in the United States. Australia does have some discrimination mainly in the siting of hazardous waste facilities in areas where the people are not given proper information about the company. The injustice that takes place in Australia is defined as environmental politics on who get the unwanted waste site or who has control over where factory opens up. The movement towards equal environmental politics focuses more on who can fight for companies to build, and takes place in the parliament; whereas, in the United States Environmental Justice is trying to make nature safer for all people.&lt;ref name="Arcioni, 2005"&gt;Arcioni, Elisa and Mitchell, Glenn(2005).''Environmental Justice in Australia: When RATS became IRATE''. Environmental Politics. Volume 14 Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===

An example of the environmental injustices that indigenous groups face can be seen in the [[Chevron-Texaco incident]] in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. [[Texaco]], which is now Chevron, found oil in Ecuador in 1964 and built sub-standard oil wells to cut costs.&lt;ref name="chevrontoxico1"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rainforest Chernobyl|url=http://chevrontoxico.com/about/rainforest-chernobyl/|publisher=ChevronToxico|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberately used inferior technology to make their operations cheaper, even if detrimental to the local people and environment. After the company left in 1992, they left approximately one thousand [[toxic waste]] pits open and dumped billions of gallons of toxic water into the rivers.&lt;ref name="chevrontoxico1"/&gt;

===South Korea===

[[South Korea]] has a relatively short history of environmental justice compared to other countries in the west. As a result of rapid [[industrialization]], people started to have awareness on pollution, and from the environmental discourses the idea of environmental justice appeared. The concept of environmental justice appeared in South Korea in late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D2941%26context%3Detd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&amp;context=etd |archivedate=2015-04-24 |df= }}''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle &amp; Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy. The Florida State University DigiNole Commons'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea experienced rapid economic growth (which is commonly referred to as the '[[Miracle on the Han River]]') in the 20th century as a result of industrialization policies adapted by [[Park Chung-hee]] after 1970s. The policies and social environment had no room for environmental discussions, which aggravated the pollution in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aks.ac.kr/home/index.do]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Economy'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental movements in South Korea started from [[air pollution]] campaigns. As the notion of environment pollution spread, the focus on environmental activism shifted from existing pollution to preventing future pollution, and the organizations eventually started to criticize the government policies that are neglecting the environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=572765&amp;cid=46634&amp;categoryId=46634]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Environmental Movement'', Accessed 2015-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of environmental justice was introduced in South Korea among the discussions of environment after 1990s. While the environmental organizations analyzed the condition of pollution in South Korea, they noticed that the environmental problems were inequitably focused especially on regions where people with low social and economic status were concentrated.

The problems of environmental injustice have arisen by environment related organizations, but approaches to solve the problems were greatly supported by the government, which developed various policies and launched institution. These actions helped raise awareness of environmental justice in South Korea. Existing environment policies were modified to cover environmental justice issues.

Environmental justice began to be widely recognized in the 1990s through policy making and researches of related institutions. For example, the [[Ministry of Environment]], which was founded in 1992, launched Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) to raise awareness of the problem and figure out appropriate plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/bgreen-activism-and-civil-society-south-korea-b]''Green Activism and Civil Society in South Korea (2002)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of its activities, Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) held Environmental Justice forum in 1999, to gather and analyze the existing studies on the issue which were done sporadically by various organizations. Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) started as a small organization, but it is keep growing and expanding. In 2002, CMEJ had more than 5 times the numbers of members and 3 times the budget it had in the beginning year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&amp;context=etd]''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle &amp; Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy.

Environmental injustice is still an ongoing problem. One example is the construction of [[Saemangeum Seawall]]. The construction of Saemangeum Seawall, which is the world's longest dyke (33 kilometers) runs between [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Saemangeum]] estuary, was part of a government project initiated in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earth.esa.int/web/earth-watching/historical-views/content/-/article/saemangeum-dam-south-korea]''Earth Watching : Saemangeum Dam'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The project raised concerns on the destruction of ecosystem and taking away the local residential regions. It caught the attention of environmental justice activists because the main victims were low-income fishing population and their future generations. This is considered as an example of environmental injustice which was caused by the execution of exclusive development-centered policy.

The construction of [[Seoul-Incheon canal]] also raised environmental justice controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111063056/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |archivedate=2016-01-11 |df= }}''The Korea Times : Seoul-Incheon Canal Construction Kicks Off (2009)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction took away the residential regions and farming areas of the local residents. Also, the environment worsened in the area because of the appearance of wet fogs which was caused by water deprivation and local climate changes caused by the construction of canal. The local residents, mostly people with weak economic basis, were severely affected by the construction and became the main victims of such environmental damages. While the socially and economically weak citizens suffered from the environmental changes, most of the benefits went to the industries and conglomerates with political power.

Construction of [[Factory|industrial complex]] was also criticized in the context of environmental justice. The conflict in Wicheon region is one example. The region became the center of controversy when the government decided to build industrial complex of dye houses, which were formerly located in [[Daegu]] metropolitan region. As a result of the construction, [[Nakdong River]], which is one of the main rivers in South Korea, was contaminated and local residents suffered from environmental changes caused by the construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreascience.or.kr/search/articlepdf_ocean.jsp?url=http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kenss/KHGGB3/1996/v5n3/KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297.pdf&amp;admNo=KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297]''Koreascience : A Policy Study to Preserve the Water Quality through the Activation of Local Autonomy'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kfem.or.kr/wp-content/uploads/1997/08/data_envinfo_einter_179_casestudy-on-Environmental-Issue-in-Korea.doc&amp;prev=search]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''Choony, Kim.

Environmental justice is a growing issue in South Korea. Although the issue is not yet widely recognized compared to other countries, many organizations beginning to recognize the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yongin.eco.or.kr/main/main.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904005259/http://yongin.eco.or.kr/main/main.php |archivedate=2015-09-04 |df= }}''Yongin Environmental Justice website'', Accessed 2015-8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between Northern and Southern countries===

Environmental discrimination in a global perspective is also an important factor when examining the Environmental Justice movement. Even though the Environmental Justice movement began in the United States, the United States also contributes to expanding the amount of environmental injustice that takes place in less-developed countries.&lt;ref name="Clapp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clapp |first=Jennifer |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.2005.10.10Clapp.pdf |title=Distance of Waste: Overconsumption in a Global Economy |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605171715/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.2005.10.10Clapp.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies in the United States and in other developed nations around the world contribute to the injustice by shipping the toxic waste and byproducts of factories to less-developed countries for disposal. This act increases the amount of waste in the third world countries, most of which do not have proper sanitation for their own waste much less the waste of another country. Often, the people of the less-developed countries are exposed to toxins from this waste and do not even realize what kind of waste they are encountering or the health problems that could come with it.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"&gt;[[David Naguib Pellow|Pellow, David Naguib]]. 2007. ''Resisting Global Toxics''. The MIT Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

One prominent example of northern countries shipping their waste to southern countries took place in [[Haiti]]. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had ash from the incineration of toxic waste that they did not have room to dump. Philadelphia decided to put the ash into the hands of a private company, which shipped the ash and dumped it in various other parts of the world, outside of the United States. ''[[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|The Khian Sea]]'', the ship the ash was put on, sailed around the world and many countries would not accept the waste because it was hazardous for the environment and the people. The ship owners finally dumped the waste, labeled Fertilizer, in Haiti, on the beach, and sailed away in the night. The government of Haiti was infuriated and called for the waste to be removed, but the company would not come to take the ash away. The fighting over who was responsible for the waste and who would remove the waste went on for many years. After debating for over ten years, the waste was removed and taken back to a site just outside Philadelphia to be disposed of permanently.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"/&gt;

The reason that this transporting of waste from Northern countries to the Southern countries takes place is because it is cheaper to transport waste to another country and dump it there, than to pay to dump the waste in the producing country because the third world countries do not have the same strict industry regulations as the more developed countries. The countries that the waste is taken to are usually impoverished and the governments have little or no control over the happenings in the country or do not care about the people.&lt;ref name="Park, 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Transnational movement networks===

Many of the Environmental Justice Networks that began in the United States expanded their horizons to include many other countries and became Transnational Networks for Environmental Justice. These networks work to bring Environmental Justice to all parts of the world and protect all citizens of the world to reduce the environmental injustice happening all over the world. Listed below are some of the major Transnational Social Movement Organizations.&lt;ref name="Pellow, 2007"/&gt;

*GAIA (Global Anti-Incinerator Alliance) – works to find different ways to dispose of waste other than incineration. This company has people working in over 77 countries throughout the world.

'''Freedom''', generally, is having an ability to act or change without constraint. A thing is "free" if it can change its state easily and is not constrained in its present state. In philosophy and religion, it is associated with having [[free will]] and being without undue or unjust constraints, or [[slavery|enslavement]], and is an idea closely related to the concept of [[liberty]]. A person has the freedom to do things that will not, in theory or in practice, be prevented by other forces. Outside of the human realm, freedom generally does not have this political or psychological dimension. A rusty lock might be oiled so that the key has freedom to turn, undergrowth may be hacked away to give a newly planted sapling freedom to grow, or a mathematician may study an equation having many degrees of freedom. In mechanical engineering, "freedom" describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body or system, which is generally referred to as [[degrees of freedom]]."

==Free will==
{{Main|Free will}}
In philosophical discourse, freedom is discussed in the context of [[free will]] and self-determination, balanced by [[moral responsibility]].

Advocates of free will regard freedom of thought as innate to the human mind, while opponents regard the mind as thinking only the thoughts that a purely deterministic brain happens to be engaged in at the time.

==Social freedom or liberty==
[[File:OURS TO FIGHT FOR. 4 FREEDOMS ON ONE SHEET - NARA - 513635.jpg|thumb|right|[[Four Freedoms]], a series of paintings meant to describe the freedoms for which allied nations fought in World War II.]]
{{Main|Political freedom|Liberty}}
In political discourse, [[political freedom]] is often associated with [[liberty]] and [[autonomy]] in the sense of "giving oneself one's own laws", and with having [[rights]] and the [[civil liberties]] with which to exercise them without undue interference by the state. Frequently discussed kinds of political freedom include [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of choice]], and [[freedom of speech]].

In some circumstances, particularly when discussion is limited to political freedoms, the terms "freedom" and "liberty" tend to be used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Bertrand Badie, Dirk Berg-Schlosser, Leonardo Morlino, ''International Encyclopedia of Political Science'' (2011), p. 1447: "Throughout this entry, incidentally, the terms freedom and liberty are used interchangeably".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka"&gt;Anna Wierzbicka, ''Understanding Cultures Through Their Key Words'' (1997), p. 130-31: "Unfortunately... the English words freedom and liberty are used interchangeably. This is confusing because these two do not mean the same, and in fact what [Isaiah] Berlin calls "the notion of 'negative' freedom" has become largely incorporated in the word ''freedom'', whereas the word ''liberty'' in its earlier meaning was much closer to the Latin libertas and in its current meaning reflects a different concept, which is a product of the Anglo-Saxon culture".&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, however, subtle distinctions between freedom and liberty have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, ''Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics'' (2008), p. 9: "Although used interchangeably, freedom and liberty have significantly different etymologies and histories. According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the Old English ''frei'' (derived from Sanskrit) meant dear and described all those close or related to the head of the family (hence friends). Conversely in Latin, ''libertas'' denoted the legal state of being free versus enslaved and was later extended to children (''liberi''), meaning literally the free members of the household. Those who are one's friends are free; those who are not are slaves".&lt;/ref&gt; [[John&amp;nbsp;Stuart&amp;nbsp;Mill]], differentiated liberty from freedom in that freedom is primarily, if not exclusively, the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved. As such, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others.&lt;ref name=mill1&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869)., "Chapter I: Introductory", ''On Liberty''. http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explains the differences in terms of their relation to institutions:

{{quote|''Liberty is linked to human subjectivity; freedom is not. The Declaration of Independence, for example, describes men as having liberty and the nation as being free. Free will—''the quality of being free from the control of fate or necessity''—may first have been attributed to human will, but [[Newtonian physics]] attributes freedom—[[degrees of freedom]], [[free bodies]]—to objects.''&lt;ref name="Chun"&gt;Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, ''Control and Freedom: Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics'' (2008), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|''Freedom differs from liberty as control differs from discipline. Liberty, like discipline, is linked to institutions and political parties, whether liberal or libertarian; freedom is not. Although freedom can work for or against institutions, it is not bound to them—it travels through unofficial networks. To have liberty is to be liberated from something; to be free is to be self-determining, autonomous. Freedom can or cannot exist within a state of liberty: one can be liberated yet ''unfree,'' or ''free'' yet enslaved (Orlando Patterson has argued in ''Freedom: Freedom in the Making of Western Culture'' that freedom arose from the yearnings of slaves).''&lt;ref name="Chun"/&gt;}}

Another distinction that some political theorists have deemed important is that people may aspire to have freedom ''from'' limiting forces (such as [[freedom from fear]], [[freedom from want]], and [[freedom from discrimination]]), but descriptions of freedom and liberty generally do not invoke having liberty ''from'' anything.&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka"/&gt; To the contrary, the concept of [[negative liberty]] refers to the liberty one person may have to restrict the rights of others.&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka"/&gt;

Other important fields in which freedom is an issue include [[economic freedom]], [[academic freedom]], [[intellectual freedom]], and [[scientific freedom]].

==Freedom as a physical concept==
In purely physical terms, freedom is used much more broadly to describe the limits to which physical movement or other physical processes are possible. This relates to the philosophical concept to the extent that people may be considered to have as much freedom as they are physically able to exercise. The number of independent [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or parameters for a system is described as its number of [[degrees of freedom]]. For example the movement of a vehicle along a road has two degrees of freedom; to go fast or slow, or to change direction by turning left or right. The movement of a ship sailing on the waves has four degrees of freedom, since it can also pitch nose-to-tail and roll side-to-side. An aeroplane can also climb and sideslip, giving it [[six degrees of freedom]].

[[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|Degrees of freedom in mechanics]] describes the number of independent motions that are allowed to a body, or, in case of a [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] made of several bodies, the number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism. In the study of complex [[motor control]], there may be so many degrees of freedom that a given action can be achieved in different ways by combining movements with different degrees of freedom. This issue is sometimes called the [[degrees of freedom problem]].

==Freedom in mathematical theory==
In [[mathematics]] freedom is the ability of a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] to change in value.

Some equations have many such variables. This notion is formalized as the [[dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimension]] of a [[manifold]] or an [[algebraic variety]]. When ''degrees of freedom'' is used instead of ''dimension'', this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined. Such degrees of freedom appear in many mathematical and related disciplines, including [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] as used in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] to explain dependence on [[parameter]]s, or the [[dimensions]] of a [[phase space]]; and [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom in statistics]], the number of values in the final calculation of a [[statistic]] that are free to vary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12737">In mathematics, the '''Fréchet distance''' is a [[measure of similarity]] between [[curve]]s that takes into account the location and ordering of the points along the curves. It is named after [[Maurice Fréchet]].

==Intuitive definition==

Imagine a man traversing a finite curved path while walking his dog on a leash, with the dog traversing a separate one.  Assume that the dog varies its speed to keep as much slack in her leash as possible: the Fréchet distance between the two curves is the length of the shortest leash sufficient for both to traverse their separate paths.  Note that the definition is symmetric with respect to the two curves—the Frechet distance would be the same if the dog was walking its owner.

==Formal definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. A [[curve]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[map (mathematics)|map]] from the [[unit interval]] into &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;A : [0,1] \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;. A [[parametric equation|reparameterization]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous, [[monotonic function|non-decreasing]], [[surjection]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be two given curves in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the '''Fréchet distance''' between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[infimum]] over all reparameterizations &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of the maximum over all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of the distance in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt;. In mathematical notation, the Fréchet distance &lt;math&gt;F(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;F(A,B) = \inf_{\alpha, \beta}\,\,\max_{t \in [0,1]} \,\,  \Bigg \{d \Big ( A(\alpha(t)), \, B(\beta(t)) \Big ) \Bigg \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric (mathematics)|distance function]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

Informally, we can think of the parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as "time". Then, &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the dog and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the dog's owner at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (or vice versa). The length of the leash between them at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the infimum over all possible reparametrizations of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to choosing the walk along the given paths where the maximum leash length is minimized. The restriction that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; be non-decreasing means that neither the dog nor its owner can backtrack.

The Fréchet metric takes into account the flow of the two curves because the pairs of points whose distance contributes to the Fréchet distance sweep continuously along their respective curves. This makes the Fréchet distance a better measure of similarity for curves than alternatives, such as the [[Hausdorff distance]], for arbitrary point sets. It is possible for two curves to have small Hausdorff distance but large Fréchet distance.

The Fréchet distance and its variants find application in several problems, from [[morphing]]&lt;ref name="efrat02new"&gt;{{citation

The running time of their algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(mn \cdot \log(mn))&lt;/math&gt; for two polygonal curves with ''m'' and ''n'' segments.

== The free-space diagram ==
[[Image:free-space-diagram.png|thumb|alt=example of a free-space diagram|Free-space diagram of the red and the blue curve. In contrast to the definition in the text, which uses the parameter interval [0,1] for both curves, the curves are parameterized by arc length in this example.]]
An important tool for calculating the Fréchet distance of two curves is the free-space diagram, which was introduced by Alt and Godau.&lt;ref name="alt95frechet"/&gt;
The free-space diagram between two curves for a given distance threshold ε is a two-dimensional region in the parameter space that consist of all point pairs on the two curves at distance at most ε:

&lt;math&gt;D_\varepsilon(A,B) := \{\,(\alpha,\beta)\in[0,1]^2\mid d( A(\alpha), B(\beta))\le\varepsilon \,\}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Fréchet distance &lt;math&gt;F(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is at most ε if and only if the free-space diagram &lt;math&gt;D_\varepsilon(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; contains a path from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, which is monotone both in the horizontal and in the vertical direction.

==Variants==

The '''weak Fréchet distance''' is a variant of the classical Fréchet distance without the requirement that the endpoints move monotonically along their respective curves &amp;mdash; the dog and its owner are allowed to backtrack to keep the leash between them short. Alt and Godau&lt;ref name="alt95frechet"/&gt; describe a simpler algorithm to compute the weak Fréchet distance between polygonal curves, based on computing [[Widest path problem|minimax paths]] in an associated [[grid graph]].

The '''discrete Fréchet distance''', also called the '''coupling distance''', is an approximation of the Fréchet metric for polygonal curves, defined by Eiter and Mannila.&lt;ref name="eiter94discrete"&gt;{{citation

 | title = Computing discrete Fréchet distance
 | url = http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/staff/eiter/et-archive/cdtr9464.pdf
 | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The discrete Fréchet distance considers only positions of the leash where its endpoints are located at vertices of the two polygonal curves and never in the interior of an edge. This special structure allows the discrete Fréchet distance to be computed in polynomial time by an easy dynamic programming algorithm.

When the two curves are embedded in a metric space other than Euclidean space, such as a [[polyhedral terrain]] or some Euclidean space with obstacles, the distance between two points on the curves is most naturally defined as the length of the [[shortest path]] between them. The leash is required to be a [[geodesic]] joining its endpoints. The resulting metric between curves is called the '''geodesic Fréchet distance'''.&lt;ref name="efrat02new" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cook08geodesic"&gt;{{citation

If we further require that the leash must move continuously in the ambient metric space, then we obtain the notion of the '''homotopic Fréchet distance'''&lt;ref name="chambers09homotopic"&gt;{{citation

The leash cannot switch discontinuously from one position to another &amp;mdash; in particular, the leash cannot jump over obstacles, and can sweep over a mountain on a terrain only if it is long enough. The motion of the leash describes a [[homotopy]] between the two curves. Chambers ''et al.''&lt;ref name="chambers09homotopic"/&gt; describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the homotopic Fréchet distance between polygonal curves in the Euclidean plane with obstacles.

==Examples==
The Fréchet distance between two concentric circles of radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively is &lt;math&gt;|r_1 - r_2|.&lt;/math&gt;
The longest leash is required when the owner stands still and the dog travels to the opposite side of the circle (&lt;math&gt;r_1 + r_2&lt;/math&gt;), and the shortest leash when both owner and dog walk at a constant angular velocity around the circle (&lt;math&gt;|r_1 - r_2|&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:FBS Maximum.jpg|thumb|Simple function block diagram]]
The '''Function Block Diagram'''  ('''FBD''') is a graphical language for [[programmable logic controller]] design,&lt;ref&gt;R. W Lewis (2001) ''Modelling Distributed Control Systems Using IEC 61499''. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; that can describe the function between input variables and output variables. A function is described as a set of elementary blocks. Input and output variables are connected to blocks by connection lines.

Inputs and outputs of the blocks are wired together with connection lines, or links. Single lines may be used to connect two logical points of the diagram:
* An input variable and an input of a block
* An output of a block and an input of another block
* An output of a block and an output variable

The connection is oriented, meaning that the line carries associated data from the left end to the right end.  The left and right ends of the connection line must be of the same type.

Multiple right connection, also called divergence can be used to broadcast information from its left end to each of its right ends.  All ends of the connection must be of the same type.

Function Block Diagram is one of five languages for [[logic]] or [[Control theory|control]] [[computer configuration|configuration]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Bolton (2011) ''Programmable Logic Controllers''. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; supported by [[standardization|standard]] [[IEC 61131-3]] for a [[control system]] such as a [[Programmable Logic Controller]] (PLC) or a [[Distributed Control System]] (DCS).  The other supported languages are [[ladder logic]], [[sequential function chart]], [[structured text]], and [[instruction list]].

'''Gender polarization''' is a concept in [[sociology]] by American psychologist [[Sandra Bem]] which states that societies tend to define [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] as polar opposite [[gender]]s, such that male-acceptable behaviors and attitudes are not seen as appropriate for women, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=twsMonnier&gt;Christine Monnier, 2011, Global Sociology, [https://globalsociology.pbworks.com/w/page/14711182/Gendered%20Society%20%E2%80%93%20Basic%20Concepts Gendered Society – Basic Concepts], Retrieved Aug. 22, 2014, "... Another aspect of such a list of gender traits is that there is no overlap ... societies and cultures create polarized version of gender where one is the opposite of the other...Popular culture is indeed a major conveyor ... "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsRyle&gt;Questioning Gender: A Sociological Exploration, Robyn Ryle, Pine Forge Press, 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G6zKUEYYpwQC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22Gender+polarization%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GwRYikrZV6&amp;sig=GIWm0ArEiPzRIqGfkPrWjNr4-X8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1N33U--FGI6pyATMiYL4Dw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gender%20polarization%22&amp;f=false ], Retrieved Aug. 22, 2014, Chapter 4 page 135, "..Gender polarization ... describes the way in which behaviors and attitudes that are viewed as appropriate for men are seen as inappropriate for women and vice versa...."&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is an extension of the [[sex and gender distinction]] in sociology in which [[sex]] refers to the biological differences between men and women, while [[gender]] refers to the cultural differences between them, such that ''gender'' describes the "socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;[http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/ ''What do we mean by "sex" and "gender"?'' (World Health Organization (WHO &gt; Programmes and Projects &gt; Gender, Women and Health))], as accessed Aug. 24, 2010 (no author or date &amp; boldfacing omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bem, gender polarization begins when natural sex differences are exaggerated in culture; for example, women have less hair than men,&lt;ref&gt; 5 October 2013, BBC, [http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131004-why-do-men-grow-facial-hair Why can men grow facial hair but women cannot], Retrieved May 24, 2016, "...Androgens are present in both sexes ... Men have more androgens than women..."&lt;/ref&gt; and men have more muscles than women, but these physical differences are exaggerated culturally when women remove hair from their faces and legs and armpits, and when men engage in body building exercises to emphasize their muscle mass.&lt;ref name=twsBem&gt;Sandra Lipsitz Bem, A Nation Divided: Diversity, Inequality, and Community in American Society, edited by Phyllis Moen, Donna Dempster-McClain, Henry A.

Bem saw gender polarization as an organizing principle upon which many of the basic institutions of a society are built.&lt;ref name=twsDaniels&gt;Polygendered and Ponytailed: The Dilemma of Femininity and the Female Athlete, 2009, Women's Press, Dayna B.

According to Scott Coltrane and Michele Adams, gender polarization begins early in childhood when girls are encouraged to prefer pink over blue, and when boys are encouraged to prefer toy trucks over dolls, and the male-female distinction is communicated to children in countless ways.&lt;ref name=twsRowman&gt;Gender and Families, Scott Coltrane, Michele Adams, Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Hv2Rrj7ukwC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22Gender+polarization%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcqbRS-N5P&amp;sig=u_Ke-oATVkadDLNRNDsy250Huf8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1N33U--FGI6pyATMiYL4Dw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gender%20polarization%22&amp;f=false Engendering Children (chapter)], Retrieved Aug. 22, 2014, (page 183+) "...Gender polarization organizes the daily lives of children from the moment they are born: pink vs. blue to dolls vs. trucks...."&lt;/ref&gt; Children learn by observing others and by direct tutelage what they "can and cannot do in terms of gendered behavior", according to Elizabeth Lindsey and Walter Zakahi.&lt;ref name=twsDindia&gt;Sex Differences and Similarities in Communication, edited by Kathryn Dindia, Daniel J.

Further, any deviation from these scripts was seen as problematic, possibly defined as "immoral acts" which flout religious customs, or seen as "psychologically pathological".&lt;ref name=twsDaniels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. (1993). Gender polarization. The lenses of gender: transforming the debate on sexual inequality, (p. 80-82).  Binghamton, NY:  Vail-Ballou Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Bem argued that because of past polarization, women were often restricted to family-oriented roles in the private sphere, while men were seen as professional representatives in the [[public sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. (1995). Dismantling Gender Polarization and Compulsory Heterosexuality: Should We Turn the Volume Down or Up?.

There are many [[corollary|corollaries]] to Godwin's law, some considered more [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] (by being adopted by Godwin himself)&lt;ref name="Godwin95canonical version" /&gt; than others.&lt;ref name="GL FAQ" /&gt; For example, there is a tradition in many newsgroups and other Internet discussion forums that, when a Hitler comparison is made, the thread is finished and whoever made the comparison loses whatever [[debate]] is in progress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6408927/Internet-rules-and-laws-the-top-10-from-Godwin-to-Poe.html "Internet rules and laws: the top 10, from Godwin to Poe"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London), October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is itself frequently referred to as Godwin's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=North Korea|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07tMQs-5SD8|access-date=7 November 2017|series=Last Week Tonight|network=HBO|date=13 August 2017|transcript="There honestly aren't that many instances in modern American politics where you can honestly think: that guy really should have mentioned the nazis, but this is emphatically one of them. It's like the reversed Godwin's law - if you fail to mention Nazism, you lose the argument."|language=English|last=Oliver|first=John (host)}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin's law itself can be abused as a distraction, diversion or even as [[censorship]], fallaciously miscasting an opponent's argument as [[hyperbole]] when the comparisons made by the argument are actually appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;David Weigel, [http://www.reason.com/news/show/32944.html "Hands Off Hitler! It's time to repeal Godwin's Law"] ''Reason'' magazine, July 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://no-pasaran.blogspot.com/2012/05/adolf-hitler-and-double-standards.html Mitt Hitler and Double Standards: Godwin's Law Applies to Thee, But Not to Me], [[No Pasarán]], May 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticisms of the "law" (or "at least the distorted version which purports to prohibit all comparisons to German crimes") have been made by the American  lawyer, journalist, and author [[Glenn Greenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]] (July 1, 2010) [http://www.salon.com/2010/07/01/godwin/ The odiousness of the distorted Godwin's Law], [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin's law does not claim to articulate a [[fallacy]]; it is instead framed as a memetic tool to reduce the incidence of inappropriate hyperbolic comparisons. "Although deliberately framed as if it were a law of nature or of [[mathematics]]," Godwin wrote, "its purpose has always been [[Rhetorics|rhetorical]] and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]]: I wanted folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler to think a bit harder about [[the Holocaust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/post/i_seem_be_verb_18_years_godwins_law|title=I Seem To Be A Verb: 18 Years of Godwin's Law|date=April 30, 2008|publisher=Jewcy.com|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Mike Godwin June08 B recrop 5 to 7.jpg|thumb|Mike Godwin in 2008]]

Godwin has stated that he introduced Godwin's law in 1990 as an experiment in [[memetics]].&lt;ref name="Godwin94" /&gt;

In 2012, "Godwin's law" became an entry in the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/340583?redirectedFrom=Godwin%27s+law#eid|title=Godwin's law|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Godwin commented on the Nazi and fascist comparisons being made by several articles about [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], saying: "If you're thoughtful about it and show some real awareness of history, go ahead and refer to Hitler when you talk about Trump, or any other politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Godwin|first1=Mike|title=Sure, call Trump a Nazi.

In October 2018, Godwin made a similar statement when someone asked him, via [[Twitter]], if it would be OK to call Brazilian presidential candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] a "nazi", answering a direct question ("So, just to be clear, is it OK to call Bolsonaro a nazi?") with the [[Portuguese language|portuguese]] word "Sim!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/criador-da-lei-de-godwin-diz-que-e-ok-chamar-bolsonaro-de-nazista.shtml|title=Criador da Lei de Godwin diz que é ok chamar Bolsonaro de nazista|date=2018-10-17|work=Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2018-11-11|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/sfmnemonic/status/1052371927552135168|title=Mike Godwin #EleNão on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (meaning "yes" in English).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">[[Image:Chenal-beautemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in [[Velm]], Belgium, during a sunny day]]
A '''grassed waterway''' consists in a {{convert|2|m|ft|sing=on}} to 48-metre-wide (157 ft) native [[grassland]] strip of [[green belt]]. It is generally installed in the [[thalweg]], the deepest continuous line along a [[valley]] or [[watercourse]], of a cultivated dry valley in order to control [[erosion]]. A study carried out on a grassed waterway during 8 years in [[Bavaria]] showed that it can lead to several other types of positive impacts, e.g. on [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiener P., Auerswald K. (2003). Concept and effects of a multi-purpose grassed waterway. Soil Use and Management 19, 65-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==

Confusion between "grassed waterway" and "vegetative filter strips" should be avoided. The latter are generally narrower (only a few metres wide) and rather installed along rivers as well as along or within cultivated fields. However, [[buffer strip]] can be a [[synonym]], with shrubs and trees added to the plant component, as does a [[riparian zone]].

== Runoff and erosion mitigation ==
[[Image:Chenal-mauvaistemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in Velm, Belgium, after a thunderstorm]]
[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] generated on cropland during storms or long winter rains concentrates in the [[thalweg]] where it can lead to rill or [[gully]] erosion.   

Rills and gullies further concentrate runoff and speed up its transfer, which can worsen damage occurring downstream. This can result in a [[muddy flood]]. 

In this context, a grassed waterway allows increasing soil cohesion and roughness. It also prevents the formation of rills and gullies. Furthermore, it can slow down runoff and allow its re-infiltration during long winter rains. In contrast, its infiltration capacity is generally not sufficient to reinfiltrate runoff produced by heavy spring and summer storms. It can therefore be useful to combine it with extra measures, like the installation of earthen dams across the grassed waterway, in order to buffer runoff temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B., Bielders, C.L, 2008. A grassed waterway and earthen dams to control muddy floods from a cultivated catchment of the Belgian loess belt. Geomorphology  100, 419-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Group concept mapping integrates qualitative group processes with [[multivariate analysis]] to help a group organize and visually represent its ideas on any topic of interest through a series of related maps.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; It combines the ideas of diverse participants to show what the group thinks and values in relation to the specific topic of interest. It is a type of structured conceptualization used by groups to develop a conceptual framework, often to help guide evaluation and planning efforts.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; Group concept mapping is participatory in nature, allowing participants to have an equal voice and to contribute through various methods.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; A group concept map visually represents all the ideas of a group and how they relate to each other, and depending on the scale, which ideas are more relevant, important, or feasible.

==Process==

Group concept mapping involves a structured multi-step process, including [[brainstorming]], sorting and rating, [[multidimensional scaling]] and [[cluster analysis]], and the generation and interpretation of multiple maps.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; The first step requires participants to brainstorm a large set of statements relevant to the topic of interest, usually in response to a focus prompt. Participants are then asked to individually sort those statements into categories based on their perceived similarity and rate each statement on one or more scales, such as importance or feasibility.

The data is then analyzed using The Concept System software, which creates a series of interrelated maps using [[multidimensional scaling]] (MDS) of the sort data, [[hierarchical clustering]] of the MDS coordinates applying [[Ward's method]], and the computation of average ratings for each statement and cluster of statements.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;Rosas SR, Camphausen (2007). The use of concept mapping for scale development and validation in evaluation. Evaluation and Program Planning, 30, 125–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting maps display the individual statements in two-dimensional space with more similar statements located closer to each other, and grouped into clusters that partition the space on the map. The Concept System software also creates other maps that show the statements in each cluster rated on one or more scales, and absolute or relative cluster ratings between two cluster sets. As a last step in the process, participants are led through a structured interpretation session to better understand and label all the maps.

==History==
Group concept mapping was developed as a methodology in the late 1980s by William M.K. Trochim at [[Cornell University]]. Trochim is considered to be a leading evaluation expert, and he has taught evaluation and research methods at Cornell since 1980.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;Cornell University, College of Human Ecology (2012). William Trochim biographical statement. http://www.human.cornell.edu/bio.cfm?netid=wmt1.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called "concept mapping", the methodology has evolved since its inception with the maturation of the field and the continued advancement of the software, which is now a Web application.

==Uses==
Group concept mapping can be used with any group for any topic of interest. It is often used by government agencies, academic institutions, national associations, not-for-profit and community-based organizations, and private businesses to help turn the ideas of the group into measurable actions. This includes in the areas of organizational development, strategic planning, needs assessment, curriculum development, research, and evaluation.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Group concept mapping is well-documented, well-established methodology, and it has been used in hundreds of published papers.

==Versus concept mapping and mind mapping==
{{Main|Concept map|Mind map}}
More generally, concept mapping is any process used for visually representing relationships between ideas in pictures or diagrams.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; A [[concept map]] is typically a diagram of multiple ideas, often represented as boxes or circles, linked in a [[Graph drawing|graph (network) structure]] through arrows and words where each idea is connected to another.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt; The technique was originally developed in the 1970s by [[Joseph D. Novak]] at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;Novak JD, Gowin DB (1984). Learning How to Learn. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Concept mapping may be done by an individual or a group.

A [[mind map]] is a diagram used to visually represent information, centering on one word or idea with categories and sub-categories radiating off of it in a [[tree structure]].&lt;ref&gt;Buzan T (2010). The Mind Map Book: Unlock Your Creativity, Boost Your Memory, Change Your Life. Essex: British Broadcasting Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Popularized by [[Tony Buzan]] in the 1970s, mind mapping is often a spontaneous exercise done by an individual or group to gather information about what they think around a single topic.

Unlike Novak's concept maps and Buzan's mind maps, ''group concept mapping'' has a structured mathematical process (sorting and rating, [[multidimensional scaling]] and [[cluster analysis]]) for organizing and visually representing multiple ideas of a group through a series of specific steps.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; In other words, in group concept mapping, the resulting visual representations are mathematically generated from mixed ([[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]]) data collected from a group of [[Human subject research|research subject]]s, whereas in Novak's concept maps and Buzan's mind maps the visual representations are drawn directly by the subjects resulting in diagrams that are qualitative data and final product at the same time.

An '''honor system''' or '''honesty system'''  is a philosophical way of running a variety of endeavors based on [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[Honour|honor]], and [[honesty]]. Something that operates under the rule of the "honor system" is usually something that does not have strictly enforced rules governing its principles. In [[British English]], it would more often be called a '''"trust system"''' and should not be confused with the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British honours system]].

The '''honor system''' is also a system granting freedom from customary surveillance (as to students or prisoners) with the understanding that those who are so freed will be bound by their [[honor]] to observe regulations (e.g. prison farms are operated under the '''''honor system'''''),&lt;ref&gt;"honor system." Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (24 Feb. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and will therefore not abuse the trust placed in them.

A person engaged in an honor system has a strong negative concept of breaking or going against it. The negatives may include community shame, loss of status, loss of a personal sense of integrity and pride or in extreme situations, banishment from one's community.

==Types of honor systems==
There are various types of honor systems that may be employed. A total honor system makes no checks on its users to verify their honesty, thereby easily allowing the system to be cheated. Though the system may face occasional audits, there would be no way thereafter of learning the identity of the violator. Some are simply contingent upon the truthfulness presumed of users; others are present when the losses caused by those who may cheat the system are less costly than a higher security system.

Other honor systems employ random checks of selected users to ensure they are in compliance. A minority of users will undergo this check, while the remainder will be given a chance to get away with a violation. In these cases, the management of the system hopes that the fear of getting checked will coerce users into compliance.

== Examples ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Honor bar]] --&gt;

=== Transport ===
In some places, [[public transport]] such as [[train]]s, [[tram]]s and/or buses operate on an honor system called [[proof-of-payment]].  The local government authorities may find it impractical or overly expensive to install ticket-checking [[turnstile]]s at every [[railway station|station]], and instead rely on casual human surveillance to check if all riders possess tickets.  In such a system one could thus ride the train or bus without paying, and simply hope to be lucky enough to avoid a random ticket check during the trip.  Such behavior is impossible for an honor system by itself to prevent. High penalties tend to be used to offset the financial cost of non-paying riders.

Some toll roads, including the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] near [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], have unstaffed [[Toll house|toll booth]]s in which motorists are expected to pay their tolls. When a violation occurs, an alarm may sound, and the vehicle may be photographed, but {{cnspan|text=no officers will pursue the violator|date=November 2015}}.


At many Western airports, arriving international passengers are instructed by signs either to walk through one door (usually green) if they have nothing to declare, or a different door (usually red) if they have something to declare. Forcible screening is rare, though customs officers generally have authority to check persons suspected of falsely using the green channel. Items that must be declared commonly include cash, food, alcohol, luxury items, publications, weapons, tobacco, etc. Most other items, including personal belongings such as regular clothing, need not be declared. However, X-ray scans can reveal what items must be declared. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

=== Tourism ===
[[File:The Honor System.jpg|thumb|right|The honor system is used at [[Benicia State Recreation Area]].]]
Some hotels, mostly in [[continental Europe]], operate an [[honesty bar]], allowing guests to serve and record their own drinks and saving the cost of a night bartender. Patrons could theoretically lie about their drink consumption, and the hotel would have only limited powers to verify their claims. The concept of hotel "[[mini-bar]]s" in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] is similar, although the stock is quantified more carefully, making it difficult to lie. As well, most hotel minibars are now equipped with sensors which connect directly with the billing authority, making the honor system unnecessary.

In the [[Southern California]]n recreational [[sport fishing]] industry, the honor system is widely used, particularly on open party fishing boats. When the cook is occupied or in his bunk, passengers are permitted to get drinks and snacks on their own, providing they mark their own galley [[Bill (payment)|tab]].

Many publicly funded [[museum]]s and [[art galleries]] around the world ask for a certain "suggested donation" in exchange for admission. Patrons are almost never supervised during their donations, so there is no way of making sure the suggested minimum is being paid.  Strictly speaking this is not an honor system, as no payment obligation actually exists (merely a suggested donation); a true honor system is one in which there is an obligation, but it is not enforced.  However, these "suggested donation" schemes are often regarded as similar to an honor system, because they rely on the goodwill of patrons rather than the force of law.

[[National Park|National]] and [[State park]]s and some private parks often use an honor system to collect their admission fees. Rather than having a manned booth, they have a drop box known as an [[honesty box]] where money can be inserted, either directly, or in an envelope. Sometimes, the envelope contains a stub that is removed and placed on the guest's vehicle.

A lot of land [[International border]]s do not thoroughly check all persons passing the [[border checkpoint|checkpoint]]s for [[passport|required documents]] or [[contraband]]. When the security threat at the crossing is perceived by the nation's government to be low, checks may be conducted only on random persons or vehicles.

=== Education ===
{{main article|Academic honor code}}
The first honor system in America was penned by [[Thomas Jefferson]] at the [[College of William and Mary]], Jefferson's ''alma mater''.  In some colleges, the honor system is used to administer tests unsupervised. Students are generally asked to sign an [[honor code]] statement that says they will not cheat or use unauthorized resources when taking the test.  As an example, at [[Vanderbilt University]] students taking examinations are required to sign and include the following pledge: "On my honor as a student I have neither given nor received aid on this examination". Any student caught in violation of the Honor Code is referred to the Honor Council which investigates and determines the appropriate action, which can range from failing the course to expulsion from the University. At the [[University of Virginia]] a student taking an examination is also required to sign a pledge not to give or receive aid and there is but one penalty for transgression of the honor code, and that is dismissal from the University. Texas A&amp;M also has an Honor System which states, Aggies do not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do. This is listed at the beginning of all tests. Any student that does not follow the code is remanded to the Honor council so they can determine the severity of the case and how the student should be punished or if expulsion is necessary.  The students at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] also maintain a student-run honor system.  Students maintain the integrity of the university by pledging not to cheat, steal or lie.  Unlike the University of Virginia, the honor system at Chapel Hill allows for different sanctions, ranging from probation to expulsion. A single-sanction Honor Code exists at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], where a "drum out" ceremony is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal.

[[Washington and Lee University]] maintains an Honor System that was introduced by General [[Robert E. Lee]], who stated "We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman." The Washington &amp; Lee Honor System is entirely administered through the student body. It is one of the few universities in the [[United States]] to have a non-codified system. As a result, students decide what constitutes a breach of honor. These breaches are commonly named as lying, cheating, or stealing, but what constitutes an honor violation is open to the interpretation of the current student body. A single sanction of dismissal is enforced when a student is found guilty of an honor violation.

The [[California Institute of Technology]] implements an honor code that states "No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community."  Applications of this code range from professors trusting the students not to cheat with unsupervised take-home exams, laptops and bikes left unsecured in the dormitory lounges and courtyards (though the lounges and courtyards are secured against people who are not members of the Caltech community), and the food service trusting the students not to conduct food-hoarding raids during open kitchen hours.  The primary enforcement of the Caltech Honor Code is through student-run councils, but a few members of the Caltech faculty are involved.

=== Crime and justice ===

Some lower security [[Incarceration|inmate]]s at [[prison]]s are granted [[furlough]]s and allowed to temporarily leave the boundaries of the penitentiary for various reasons with the expectation they will return voluntarily when due without absconding. The reasons for departure may be for employment, education, recreation, or attending family events (such as [[wedding]]s or [[funeral]]s).

=== Non-profit ===
Another example can be seen in fundraising drives. Many [[charities]] distribute boxes of [[confectionery]] to businesses, which are placed in waiting rooms or similar for people to purchase items from. The confectionery is free to be removed by anyone who wishes to take it, and there is no enforcing of payment other than through the expectation of [[honesty]]. Indeed, most such boxes of confectionery bear the comment ''Your honesty is appreciated'' near where money is deposited.

In many places of [[worship]], those partaking in events with compulsory fees are expected to pay their dues, though most institutions such as these do not enforce payment. There is a general assumption of trust in most religious settings.

=== Retail ===
[[File:Martin's EasyShop system.jpg|right|thumb|200px|These handheld scanning devices at [[Giant-Carlisle#Martin's|Martin's]] allow customers to scan their own groceries while shopping. Such activity is not closely monitored by employees, and is therefore an honor system. Martin's has not reported an increase in shoplifting since introducing the system.]]
[[File:Gandhigiri Shop.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Example of the honor system at an unmanned Gandhigiri Shop in Mumbai, India]]

Some [[supermarket]] chains allow customers to scan their own groceries with handheld [[barcode reader]]s while placing them in their own carts (see [[self-checkout]]). While the system gives customers the ability to place groceries in their bags without paying, and customers can be randomly audited, participating supermarkets have reported that this experimental system has not increased the amount of [[shoplifting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19276534/ Wait in self-check line? That’s so last month - U.S. business - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hardware superstores, including [[Home Depot]], allow customers to place small items, such as [[screw]]s, into bags, then label the bags along with the exact price and quantity of the item they are purchasing. The system, which can be easily cheated, is contingent upon the honesty of customers, and is labeled in many stores as an "honor system."

In some countries, farmers leave bags of produce beside the road outside their houses with prices affixed. Passers-by pay by leaving cash in a container. In [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] this is called the [[honesty box]] system. In other countries, small unmanned stores are run, where customers are able to enter, obtain what they need, and pay the bill in a secure container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basu|first=Mihika|title=Unmanned Shop|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/unmanned-shop/913972|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=28 October 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
In the sport of [[airsoft]], players rely on an honor system to tell whether or not an opponent is hit, because unlike [[paintballs]], airsoft pellets leave no visible markings on clothing.

Two combat sports practiced by the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], [[SCA Armored Combat|Armored Combat]] and [[SCA fencing|Rapier Combat]], use an honor system to judge valid strikes.  The individual who is hit is responsible for acknowledging if the impact was valid.

[[Ultimate (sport)|Disc ultimate]] has historically relied on the honor system and encodes it as part of the “Spirit of the Game,” to the point where very few competitions use referees and players are allowed to call fouls on their opponents.

Sports that deliberately incorporate alternative sexualities, by necessity, rely on the honor system for enforcement. The [[National Gay Flag Football League]] limits heterosexual competition to 20% of a team's roster. [[Muggle quidditch]] requires a minimum number of players to be of a second gender, while allowing players to identify as any number of [[gender identity|gender identities]] to qualify under the rule.

==Advantages==
In many places where an honor system is used, it has been found to be cost-effective. Many businesses and organizations using an honor system have determined that the cost of maintaining staff to enforce proper payment outweighs the losses caused by the percentage of the population who are willing to cheat the system. In addition, efficiency is high when an honor system is used. For example, buses/trains do not have to wait to sell or check passenger tickets when boarding and can instead leave immediately, and customs green channels allow for much faster exits than if every passenger is routinely checked.

For the remainder of the population, the honor system gives a more welcoming feeling to customers. Those who are treated with trust may be more likely to return to the location, and thereby increase the amount of business.

==Criticism of the concept==
Deciding whether or not to obey an honor system can be a [[dilemma]], especially if one places his/her personal financial [[self-interest]] above the interest of the institution they are patronizing. This can lead to a future negative impact towards their personal financial self-interest. Honor systems are often criticized for promoting laziness and bad behavior. Some have suggested it is [[paradox]]ical to ask people to obey a law if there is no apparent law.

[[File:Unstable3.svg|thumb|A ball on the top of a hill is an unstable situation.]]
In numerous fields of study, the component of '''instability''' within a [[system]] is generally characterized by some of the outputs or internal [[state (controls)|states]] growing without [[bound state|bounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/instability|title=Definition of INSTABILITY|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all systems that are not [[Stability theory|stable]] are unstable; systems can also be [[marginal stability|marginally stable]] or exhibit [[limit cycle]] behavior.

In [[structural engineering]], a structure can become unstable when excessive load is applied. Beyond a certain threshold, structural [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]s magnify [[stress (physics)|stresses]], which in turn increases deflections. This can take the form of [[buckling]] or crippling. The general field of study is called [[structural stability]].

[[Atmospheric instability]] is a major component of all [[weather system]]s on Earth.

==Instability in control systems==
{{See also|Stabilizability}}

In the theory of [[dynamical systems]], a [[state variable]] in a system is said to be unstable if it evolves without bounds. A system itself is said to be unstable if at least one of its state variables is unstable.

In [[continuous time]] [[control theory]], a system is unstable if any of the [[Root of a function|roots]] of its [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] has [[real part]] greater than zero (or if zero is a repeated root).  This is equivalent to any of the [[eigenvalues]] of the [[State space (controls)|state matrix]] having either real part greater than zero, or, for the eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, the algebraic multiplicity being larger than the geometric multiplicity.{{clarification needed|reason=what is the difference between these two types of multiplicity?|date=September 2015}} The equivalent condition in [[discrete time]] is that at least one of the eigenvalues is greater than 1 in absolute value, or that two or more eigenvalues are equal and of unit absolute value.

==Instability in solid mechanics==

* [[Elastic instability]]
* [[Drucker stability]] of a nonlinear constitutive model
* Biot instability (surface wrinkling in elastomers)
* Baroclinic instability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/baroclinic+instability|title=Definition of BAROCLINIC INSTABILITY|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluid instabilities==
[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|thumb|[[Hydrodynamic]]s simulation of the [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=Shengtai Li, Hui Li |title=Parallel AMR Code for Compressible MHD or HD Equations |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |url=http://math.lanl.gov/Research/Highlights/amrmhd.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
[[File:Fluid Instability.jpg|thumb|Unstable flow structure generated from the collision of two impinging jets.]]

[[Fluid]] instabilities occur in [[liquids]], [[gases]] and [[Plasma physics|plasmas]], and are often characterized by the shape that form; they are studied in [[fluid dynamics]] and [[magnetohydrodynamics]]. Fluid instabilities include:

* Ballooning mode instability (some analogy to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability); found in the [[magnetosphere]]
* [[Atmospheric instability]]
** [[Hydrodynamic instability]] or [[dynamic instability]] ([[atmospheric dynamics]])
*** [[Inertial instability]]; [[baroclinic instability]]; [[symmetric instability]], [[conditional symmetric instability|conditional symmetric]] or [[conditional symmetric instability|convective symmetric instability]]; [[barotropic instability]]; [[Helmholtz instability|Helmholtz]] or [[Helmholtz instability|shearing instability]]; [[rotational instability]]
** [[Hydrostatic instability]] or [[static instability]]/[[static instability|vertical instability]] ([[static instability|parcel instability]]), [[thermodynamic instability]] ([[atmospheric thermodynamics]])
*** [[Conditional instability|Conditional]] or [[static instability]], [[buoyant instability]], [[latent instability]], [[nonlocal static instability]], [[conditional-symmetric instability]]; [[convective instability|convective]], [[convective instability|potential]], or [[convective instability|thermal instability]], [[convective instability of the first kind|convective instability of the first]] and [[convective instability of the second kind|second kind]]; [[absolute instability|absolute]] or [[absolute instability|mechanical instability]]
* [[Bénard cells|Bénard instability]]
* Drift mirror instability
* [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability]] (similar, but different from the [[diocotron instability]] in plasmas)
* [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]]
* [[Plateau-Rayleigh instability]] (similar to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability)
* [[Richtmyer-Meshkov instability]] (similar to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability)
* [[shock wave|Shock Wave]] Instability
* [[Modulational instability|Benjamin-Feir Instability]] (also known as modulational instability)

==Plasma instabilities==
{{Main|Plasma stability#Plasma instabilities}}
[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] instabilities can be divided into two general groups (1) hydrodynamic instabilities (2) kinetic instabilities. Plasma instabilities are also categorised into different modes&amp;nbsp;– see [[Plasma stability#Plasma instabilities|this paragraph in plasma stability]].

==Instabilities of stellar systems==

[[Galaxies]] and [[star cluster]]s can be unstable, if small perturbations in the [[gravitational potential]] cause changes in the density that reinforce the original perturbation.  Such instabilities usually require that the motions of stars be highly correlated, so that the perturbation is not "smeared out" by random motions. After the instability has run its course, the system is typically "hotter" (the motions are more random) or rounder than before. Instabilities in stellar systems include:

* [[Bar instability]] of rapidly rotating disks
* [[Jeans instability]]
* [[Firehose instability]]&lt;ref name="MS94"&gt;{{citation

==Joint instabilities==
The most common residual disability after any sprain in the body is instability.  Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed the physiological limits.  Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the injured joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guskiewicz |first=K. M. |first2=David H. |last2=Perrin |title=Effect of Orthotics on Postural Sway Following Inversion Ankle Sprain |journal=Journal of Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=326–331  |date=1996 |doi=10.2519/jospt.1996.23.5.326 |pmid=8728531 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Injuries cause [[proprioceptive]] deficits and impaired postural control in the joint.  Individuals with muscular weakness, occult instability, and decreased postural control are more susceptible to injury than those with better postural control.  Instability leads to an increase in postural sway, the measurement of the time and distance a subject spends away from an ideal [[Center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)|center of pressure]].  The measurement of a subject’s postural sway can be calculated through testing center of pressure (CoP), which is defined as the vertical projection of center of mass on the ground.  Investigators have theorized that if injuries to joints cause [[deafferentation]], the interruption of sensory nerve fibers, and functional instability, then a subject’s postural sway should be altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Pintsaar |last2=Brynhildsen |first2=J. |first3=H. |last3=Tropp |title=Postural Corrections after Standardised Perturbations of Single Limb Stance: Effect of Training and Orthotic Devices in Patients with Ankle Instability |journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=151–155 |date=1996 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.30.2.151 |pmid=8799602 |pmc=1332381 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Joint stability can be enhanced by the use of an external support system, like a brace, to alter body mechanics.  The mechanical support provided by a brace provides cutaneous afferent feedback in maintaining postural control and increasing stability.

Marichal also played for the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for the final two seasons of his career.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; Although he won more games than any other pitcher during the 1960s, he appeared in only one [[World Series]] game and he was often overshadowed by his contemporaries [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Bob Gibson]] in post-season awards.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zioDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=juan+marichal+baseball+digest&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=juan%20marichal%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false ''Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s'', by John Lowe, Baseball Digest, August 1998, Vol. 57, No. 8, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dzIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=juan+marichal+baseball+digest&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=juan%20marichal%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false ''Juan Marichal-A Man In Many Shadows'', by Michael R.

==Early life==
Juan Marichal was born on October 20, 1937, in the small farming village of Laguna Verde, [[Dominican Republic]], the youngest of Francisco and Natividad Marichal's four children.&lt;ref name="Marichal13"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  He has two brothers, Gonzalo and Rafael, and a sister, Maria. His father died of an unknown illness when Marichal was three years old.&lt;ref name="Marichal13"/&gt;  His house did not have electricity, but food was plentiful since his family owned a farm.&lt;ref name="Marichal14"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, Marichal worked on the farm daily and was responsible for taking care of his family's horses, donkeys, and goats.&lt;ref name="Marichal14"/&gt; He lived near the [[Yaque del Norte River]] and often spent time swimming and fishing.&lt;ref name="Marichal20"&gt;Marichal, Freeman, 2011. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  One day while Marichal was playing by the river, he fell unconscious owing to poor digestion and was in a [[coma]] for nine days.&lt;ref name="Marichal21"&gt;Marichal, Freeman, 2011. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctors did not expect him to survive, but he slowly regained consciousness after his family gave him steam baths by doctor's orders.&lt;ref name="Marichal21"/&gt;

His older brother Gonzalo instilled a love of baseball in young Marichal and taught him the fundamentals of pitching, fielding, and batting.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Every weekend, Marichal played the sport with his brother and friends.  For their games, they found [[golf ball]]s and paid the local shoemaker one [[Dominican peso|peso]] to sew thick cloth around the ball to make it the proper size.&lt;ref name="Marichal16"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  They employed branches from a wassama tree for [[Baseball bat|bats]] and canvas tarps for [[Baseball glove|gloves]].&lt;ref name="Marichal16"/&gt;  Among his childhood playmates were the Alou brothers, [[Felipe Alou|Felipe]], [[Jesús Alou|Jesús]], and [[Matty Alou|Matty]], who all later played with Marichal on the [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref name="Marichal16"/&gt; From the age of six, Marichal aspired to become a professional baseball player, but his mother discouraged this, instead urging him to get an education.&lt;ref name="Marichal17"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, there were no players from the Dominican Republic in [[Major League Baseball]], and his goal was viewed to be unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Marichal17"/&gt; At age 11, he briefly held a job cutting sugar cane for the J.W. Tatem Shipping conglomerate.

In 1954, sixteen-year-old Marichal joined a summer league in [[Monte Cristi (Dominican Republic)|Monte Cristi]], playing for a team called Las Flores.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"/&gt; Although he began at shortstop, Marichal switched to pitcher after taking inspiration from Bombo Ramos of the Dominican national team.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"/&gt;  He left high school after being recruited to play for the [[United Fruit Company]] team in 1956.&lt;ref name="Marichal23"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
Marichal's delivery was renowned for one of the fullest windups in modern baseball, with a high kick of his left leg that went nearly vertical (even more so than [[Warren Spahn]]'s delivery).&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"/&gt; Marichal maintained this delivery his entire career, and photographs taken near his retirement show the vertical kick only diminished. The windup was the key to his delivery in that he was consistently able to conceal the type of pitch until it was on its way.

Marichal was discovered by [[Ramfis Trujillo]], the son of late Dominican dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]]. Ramfis was the primary sponsor of the [[Dominican Air Force]] Baseball Team (Aviación Dominicana), against which Marichal pitched a 2–1 victory game in his native Monte Cristi. From the very moment the game ended, Marichal was a member of Aviación Dominicana team, enlisted to the Air Force right on the spot by Ramfis's orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942040-1,00.html "The Dandy Dominican", ''Time'' magazine, June 10, 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Juan Marichal 1962.png|thumb|180px|left|Marichal in 1962]]

Marichal entered the major leagues on July 19, {{Baseball year|1960}} with the [[San Francisco Giants]] as the second native pitcher to come from the Dominican Republic. He made an immediate impression: in his debut, on July 19, [[1960 San Francisco Giants season|1960]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], he  took a [[no hitter]] into the eighth [[inning]] only to surrender a two-[[Out (baseball)|out]] [[Single (baseball)|single]] to [[Clay Dalrymple]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y7EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=clay+dalrymple+baseball+digest&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Baseball Digest, June 1990, Vol. 49, No. 6, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up with a one-hit shutout, walking one and striking out 12.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196007190.shtml July 19, 1960 Phillies-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He started 10 more games that season, finishing at 6–2 with a 2.66 [[earned run average|ERA]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He improved his victory totals to 13 and 18 over the following two seasons, respectively, before finally cracking the 20-victory plateau in [[1963 San Francisco Giants season|1963]], when he went 25–8 with 248 [[strikeout]]s and a 2.41 ERA.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He appeared in every All-Star game of the 1960s beginning in 1962.  In May [[1966 in baseball|1966]], he was named [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award|NL Player of the Month]] with a 6-0 record, a 0.97 ERA, and 42 SO. On July 14, 1967, he surrendered the 500th Home Run of [[Eddie Mathews]]' career.

Marichal enjoyed similar success through the [[1969 San Francisco Giants season|1969]] season, posting more than 20 victories in every season except [[1967 San Francisco Giants season|1967]], and never posting an ERA higher than 2.76.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He led the league in victories in [[1963 San Francisco Giants season|1963]] and [[1968 San Francisco Giants season|1968]] when he won 26 games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963-pitching-leaders.shtml 1963 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1968-pitching-leaders.shtml 1968 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he also finished in the highest rank of his career in [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|MVP]] voting, finishing fifth behind [[Bob Gibson]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Willie McCovey]], and [[Curt Flood]].  He and [[Sandy Koufax]] were the only two Major League pitchers in the post-war era (1946–present) to have more than one season of 25 or more wins; both pitchers had three such seasons in their careers.

Marichal won more games during the decade of the 1960s (191) than any other major league pitcher,&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"/&gt; but did not receive any votes for the [[Cy Young Award]] until 1970, when baseball writers started voting for the top three pitchers in each league rather than one per league (or, until 1967, only the top pitcher in MLB). Marichal finished in the top 10 in ERA seven consecutive years, starting in 1963 and culminating in 1969, in which year he led the league.&lt;ref name="1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1969-pitching-leaders.shtml 1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, he also finished in the top 10 in strikeouts six times, top 10 in innings pitched eight times (leading the league twice), and top 10 in [[complete game]]s 10 times, with a career total of 244.&lt;ref name="haft"/&gt; He led the league twice in shutouts, throwing 10 of them in 1965.&lt;ref name="1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1965-pitching-leaders.shtml 1965 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marichal exhibited exceptional control. He had 2,303 strikeouts with only 709 walks,&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; a [[strikeout]]-to-walk ratio of 3.25 to 1. This ranks among the top 20 pitchers of all time, ahead of such notables as [[Bob Gibson]], [[Nolan Ryan]], [[Steve Carlton]], [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Don Drysdale]], [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Roger Clemens]], who each have strikeout-to-walk ratios of less than 3:1. Over his career, he led the league in the fewest walks per nine innings four times, and finished second three times – totaling eleven years in which he finished in the top 10, all while also finishing in the top 10 for strikeouts six years.

===The Greatest Game Ever Pitched===
One regular-season game in Marichal's career deserves mention, involving him and [[1963 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves']] Hall of Famer [[Warren Spahn]] in a night contest played July 2, 1963, before almost 16,000 at [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco. The two great pitchers matched scoreless innings until Giants [[outfielder]] [[Willie Mays]] homered off Spahn to win the game 1–0 in the 16th inning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138463/index.htm ''July 2, 1963'', by Ron Fimrite, Sports Illustrated, July 19, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196307020.shtml July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Spahn and Marichal tossed 15-plus inning complete games,&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; something that had not happened before or since in the big leagues. Marichal allowed eight hits (all singles except for a double hit by Spahn) in the 16 innings, striking out 10, and saddling eventual career home run king [[Hank Aaron]] with an 0-for-6 collar.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; Spahn permitted nine hits in 15{{frac|1|3}} innings, walking just one (Mays intentionally, in the 14th, after [[Harvey Kuenn]]'s leadoff double) and striking out two.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; The game, almost the innings-duration of two contests, lasted only 4 hours, 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; By coincidence, future Major League Baseball commissioner [[Bud Selig]] attended the game as a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2013/07/01/marichal-spahn-epic-duel-was-50-years-ago/ |title=Marichal-Spahn epic duel was 50 years ago |work=[[The Mercury News]] |last=Brown |first=Daniel |date=August 12, 2016 |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roseboro incident===
Marichal is also remembered for a notorious incident that occurred with [[John Roseboro]] during a game between the Giants and [[1965 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] at [[Candlestick Park]] on August 22, {{Baseball year|1965}}.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Richard|title=John Roseboro, a Dodgers Star, Dies at 69|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/20/sports/john-roseboro-a-dodgers-star-dies-at-69.html|accessdate=26 December 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=August 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Jack |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1965/08/30/605969/the-battle-of-san-francisco |title=The Battle Of San Francisco |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=August 30, 1965 |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giant-Dodger rivalry was, at the time, the fiercest in baseball - a rivalry which began when both teams played in the New York City market.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball |agency=Associated Press |work=The Times-News |page=18 |date=22 August 1990 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19900822&amp;id=llYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6791,5769085&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1965 season neared its climax, the Giants were involved in a tight pennant race, entering the game trailing the Dodgers by a game and a half while the [[1965 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] were one game behind the Dodgers.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=John |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/04/21/juan-marichal-johnny-roseboro-brawl-excerpt |title=Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=2014 |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maury Wills]] led off the game with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] single off Marichal and scored when [[Ron Fairly]] hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196508220.shtml |title=August 22, 1965 Dodgers-Giants box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; When Wills came up to bat in the second [[inning]], Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; [[Willie Mays]] then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; In the top of the third inning with two [[Out (baseball)|outs]], Marichal threw a [[fastball]] that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; Marichal's act angered the Dodgers and home plate umpire [[Shag Crawford]] warned both teams any further retaliations would not be tolerated.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt;

Marichal came to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to throw at him. Instead, Marichal was startled when, after the second pitch, Roseboro's return throw to Koufax either brushed his ear or came close enough for Marichal to feel the breeze off the ball.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; When Marichal confronted Roseboro, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal later said he thought Roseboro was about to attack him. Marichal raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice on the head, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face. Roseboro later required 14 stitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |publisher=espn.go.com |accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other peacemakers restored order.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; Marichal was ejected from the game and afterwards, National League president [[Warren Giles]] suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MLBN Remembers ("Incident at Candlestick") |publisher=[[MLB Network|MLBN-tv]] |date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Inflation|US|1750|1965|r=-1|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} and also forbade him from traveling to [[Dodger Stadium]] for the final, crucial two-game series of the season.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident but, eventually settled out of court for $7,500.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

Many people protested the apparently light punishment meted out, since it would cost Marichal only two starts.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; The Giants were in a tight pennant race with the Dodgers (as well as the Pirates, Reds, and Braves) and the race was decided with only two games to play. The Giants, who ended up winning the August 22 game and were down only {{frac|1|2}} game afterward, eventually lost the pennant to the Dodgers by 2 games. Ironically, the Giants went on a 14-game win streak that started during Marichal's absence and by then it was a two-team race as the Pirates, Reds, and Braves fell further behind. But then the Dodgers won 15 of their final 16 games (after Marichal had returned) to win the pennant. Marichal won in his first game back, 2–1 vs. the Astros on September 9 (the same day Koufax pitched his perfect game vs. the Cubs), but lost his last three decisions as the Giants slumped in the season's final week.

Marichal didn't face the Dodgers again until [[spring training]] in April 3, {{Baseball year|1966}}. In his first at bat against Marichal since the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal |agency=Associated Press |work=The Day |page=25 |date=4 April 1966 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19660404&amp;id=yuwgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wnIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=873,438492&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco General Manager [[Chub Feeney]] approached Dodgers General Manager [[Buzzy Bavasi]] to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro however, Roseboro declined the offer.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"/&gt;

Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal having thrown at Wills.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He explained that Koufax would not throw at batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, "standard operating procedure", as a form of retribution.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; After years of bitterness, Roseboro and Marichal became close friends in the 1980s, getting together occasionally at Old-Timers games, golf tournaments and charity events.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

===1970–75===
In [[1970 San Francisco Giants season|1970]], Marichal experienced a severe reaction to penicillin which led to back pain and chronic arthritis. Marichal's career stumbled in {{Baseball year|1970}}, when he only posted 12 wins and his ERA shot up to 4.12, before straightening itself out with a stellar [[1971 San Francisco Giants season|1971]] season in which he won 18 games and his ERA dropped below 3.00.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; It was the only season in which Marichal earned any consideration for the [[Cy Young Award]], finishing in 8th place.  It was his final great season (and his final of nine All-Star appearances), however, as he posted 6–16 and 11–15 records in [[1972 San Francisco Giants season|1972]] and [[1973 San Francisco Giants season|1973]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt;

After the 1973 season, the Giants sold Marichal to the [[Boston Red Sox]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac"&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=maricju01 Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; He had a fairly solid [[1974 Boston Red Sox season|1974]], going 5–1 in 11 starts, but was released after the season.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He then signed with the Dodgers as a [[free agent]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac"/&gt; Dodger fans had never forgiven Marichal for his attack on Roseboro 10 years earlier, and it took a personal appeal from Roseboro to calm them down.  However, Marichal's [[1975 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1975]] didn't last long; he was lit up for nine runs, 11 hits and a 13.50 ERA in only two starts before retiring.&lt;ref name="TBT"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his career with 243 victories, 142 losses, 244 complete games, 2,303 strikeouts and a 2.89 ERA over 3,507 innings pitched.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He played in the [[1962 World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]] (one start, a [[Win–loss record (pitching)|no decision]]) and the [[1971 National League Championship Series]] against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (losing his only start).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maricju01.shtml#pitching_postseason Juan Marichal postseason pitching statistics at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1971, the Giants averaged 90 wins a season, and Marichal averaged 20 wins a year.

===No-hitter and All-Star performances===
Marichal pitched a [[no-hitter]] on June 15, {{Baseball year|1963}}, and was named to nine [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196306150.shtml June 15, 1963 Colt 45s-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected the [[Most Valuable Player]] of the [[1965 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1965 game in Minneapolis]], in which he pitched three shutout innings and faced the minimum nine batters, giving up one hit. His overall All-Star Game record was 2–0 with a 0.50 ERA in eight appearances facing 62 batters in 18 total innings, second-most in innings pitched only to [[Don Drysdale]] (19.1 innings; 2-1, 1.40 ERA and 69 batters faced).&lt;ref name="haft"&gt;Haft, Chris.

Marichal was passed over for election to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] during his first two years of eligibility, by all accounts because the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] voters still held his attack on Roseboro against him. However, after a personal appeal by Roseboro, Marichal was elected in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1983|1983]], and thanked Roseboro in his induction speech.&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TBT"/&gt; When Roseboro died in 2002, Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral and told the gathered, "Johnny's forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life. I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-roseboro-marichal-plaschke-20150823-column.html|first=Bill|last=Plaschke|title=Fifty years after Giants' Juan Marichal hit Dodgers' John Roseboro with a bat, all is forgiven|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marichal's uniform number 27 has been retired by the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/history/retired_numbers.jsp Giants retired numbers at MLB.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Baseball year|1990}}, Marichal, who was working as a broadcaster for Spanish radio, was on hand to see his son-in-law at the time, [[José Rijo]], win the [[1990 World Series|World Series]] Most Valuable Player Award. In {{Baseball year|1999}}, he ranked #71 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the [[The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players|100 Greatest Baseball Players]], and was a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ Juan Marichal at The Sporting News 100 Greatest Baseball Players] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227144518/http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp Juan Marichal at The Major League Baseball All-Century Team]&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored before a game between the Giants and [[Oakland Athletics]] with a statue outside [[AT&amp;T Park]] in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], and was named one of the three starting pitchers on Major League Baseball's [[Latino Legends Team]]. In 1976, sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Marichal was the right-handed pitcher on Stein's Latin team. The Giants also honored him by wearing jerseys that said "Gigantes." Marichal was inducted into the [[Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum]] Hall of Fame on July 20, 2003 in pregame on field ceremony at Pac Bell Park.&lt;ref name="HHBM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicbaseballmuseum.com/fme_marich.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030606064129/http://hispanicbaseballmuseum.com/fme_marich.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-06-06|title=Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum|work=|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2008, Marichal was filmed at a [[cockfighting|cockfight]] in the Dominican Republic along with [[New York Mets]] pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]]. The incident caused controversy in the United States, but Martinez defended their attendance at the cockfight by saying, "I understand that people are upset, but that is part of our Dominican culture and is legal in the Dominican Republic". He added, "I was invited by my idol, Juan Marichal, to attend the event as a spectator, not as a participant."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3234767 "Video showed Pedro, Marichal at cockfight"] ESPN&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of [[Uganda]], disabled children are put to death. In traditional rituals, infant body parts are claimed to bring benefits. Those who continue these practices describe it as "mercy killing", meaning that the children are spared from enduring painful disabilities.&lt;ref name=DR-1&gt;{{cite news|title=The untold story of ‘mercy killing’ of disabled children in Uganda|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Untold-story-mercy-killing-disabled-children/688342-4320562-7p6gsdz/index.html|accessdate=9 May 2018|work=Daily Record|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals==

===Process===
Most of the time, a witch doctor will resort to these rituals to save the disabled children from their painful disability after the failure of multiple attempts using other methods that include herbal remedies or animal sacrifices which are less powerful &lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Child Sacrifice is a business|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-15255357#story_continues_1|website=www.bbc.com|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the rituals of child sacrifice, the witch doctor is in presence of his accomplices and starts by verifying any evidence of demonization in the child &lt;ref name="jubilee campaign"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Sacrifice|url=http://www.jubileecampaign.co.uk/stories/child-sacrifice-report|website=www.jubileecampaign.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Then, he removes different parts of the child’s body by force and uses the blood to make a potion mixed with herbs &lt;ref name="jubilee campaign"/&gt;. These body parts are mostly heads, genitals, eyes, tongues, limbs, teeth, and organs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Sacrifice in Uganda in a global context of cultural violence|url=https://kidsrights.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/No%20Small%20Sacrifice%20-%20Child%20Sacrifice%20in%20Uganda%2C%20in%20a%20global%20context%20of%20cultural%20violence_0.pdf|website=www.kidsrights.org|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the perpetrators, these rituals are necessary to bring about success, healing or wealth &lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;.

===Practitioners===
The ‘killing’ of disabled children in Uganda is perpetrated by [[witchdoctor]]s who praise the power of these rituals to their clients in search of wealth, health or fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=witch doctors in Uganda sacrificing children in bid to end drought|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/26/witch-doctors-in-uganda-sacrificing-children-in-bid-to-end-drought-report-says.html|website=www.foxnews.com|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those witchdoctors are often compared to traditional healers which have resulted in the propaganda stating that witchcraft is associated with the healing practices of the indigenous culture although they are, in reality, responsible of horrible crimes unlike traditional healers who do not use human organs &lt;ref name="jubilee campaign"/&gt;. The parents of disabled children also play a major role in the rituals by allowing it and leading their children to death because they believe that the so-called ‘mercy killing’ would avoid them the pain of enduring these disabilities.&lt;ref name=DR-1/&gt;

==Investigations==
The parliament of Uganda highly condemns "mercy" killing of newborn disabled children in Uganda as they regard it as an inhumane act.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://africadiplomatic.com/2018/03/19/meps-condemn-killings-of-disabled-children-in-uganda/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings===
The European Parliament was involved in finding resolutions for the killings of disabled people in Uganda. They argued that the killings should not take place because: human rights should be respected at all times,  everyone has a right to life despite their disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion for Resolution|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+B8-2018-0166+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with are often excluded from community activities. Disabled children are usually hidden from the public, cast out, and even killed. Mothers of these children experience isolation from their extended families, while most of the fathers neglect their families. The Ugandan National Household Survey reports only record disabled people of age 5 and above; leaving out most children. 7.1% of Ugandans, which is equivalent to 2.1 million people are reported to be disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.malteser-international.org/en/our-work/africa/uganda/helping-mothers-and-disabled-children.html|title=Helping mothers and disabled children - Uganda - AfricaOur Work - Home -|website=www.malteser-international.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions and penalties===
In [[Uganda]], the [[laws]] the [[law]] prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, [[intellectual]],or mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation,access to health care, and the provision of other state services.&lt;ref name="human rights report"&gt;url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/uganda/231771/PDFs/2012_Human_Rights_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the government's efforts in enforcing these laws have not been effective.&lt;ref name="human rights report"/&gt;

The form of treatment given to people with disability has not been encouraging of late. A July report released by the [[National Council on Disability]] (NCD) indicated 55 percent of persons with disabilities lacked functional literacy skills,and only 33 percent studied to primary grade seven.&lt;ref name="human rights report"/&gt; The report found some children with mental disabilities were sometimes denied food and were tied to trees and beds with ropes in order to control their movements. The report further stated the needs of children with autism and learning difficulties were ignored due to an insufficient number of special needs schools.&lt;ref name="human rights report"/&gt;

Government agencies responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities included the Ministry of State for Disabled Persons,the NCD, and the Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development, but these entities lacked sufficient funding to undertake any significant initiatives.&lt;ref name="human rights report"/&gt;

In the governments effort to ensure that there is adequate representation of people with disability in roles of position, there are 5 seats in parliament which have been reserved for persons with disability.&lt;ref&gt; Read Final Report On Elections for Member of Parliament Representing People with Disabilities 2016 http://www.ncd.go.ug/publication?title=&amp;tid=All &lt;/ref&gt;
These initiatives by the government will ensure that the minority group which have been oppressed systematically for decades will now have a form of empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/23833_Pages_494_497.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘’’Laius complex’’’ revolves around the paternal wish for [[filicide]], particularly for the extinction of the male heir, in an attempt to ensure one will have no successors.

==Mythological background==
Indo-European mythology contains a number of stories of foundlings, like [[Cyrus the Great]] or [[Romulus and Remus]], outcast after a prophesy that they will replace the dynasty into which they are born.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marino, in R. Preiss ed., ''Childhood, Education and the Stage in Early Modern England'' (Cambridge 2017) pp. 232–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In Greek mythology, [[Cronus]] (Roman [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]) had devoured his young because of his fear that one would supersede him.&lt;ref&gt;F Guirand, ''New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology'' (London 1968) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laius]] in the story of [[Oedipus]] similarly casts the latter out to die as an infant because of (in the words of [[Sophocles]]) "some wicked spell … . Saying the child would kill its father".&lt;ref&gt;Sophocles, ''The Theban Plays'' (Penguin 1973) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==From myth to complex==
Whereas [[Freud]] had laid stress on Oedipus’s filial violence against his father, [[George Devereux]] in 1953 introduced the term 'Laius complex' to cover the corresponding feelings on the part of the father – what he called the "'counter-oedipal' (Laius) complex".&lt;ref&gt;G Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Later explorations of [[masculinity]] have placed the aggressive aspects of the Laius complex within the broader frame of mammalian aggression against their young:&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Ross, ''What Men Want'' (1995) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; what [[Gershon Legman]] called "the killing of the male (i.e. sexually uninteresting) children by the father".&lt;ref&gt;G Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke I'' (1973) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Two specific psychosexual aspects of the complex have been particularly highlighted.  One lays stress on the magical thinking behind the complex – the unconscious belief that if one has no successors, one will be effectively immortal.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marino, in R. Preiss ed., ''Childhood, Education and the Stage in Early Modern England'' (Cambridge 2017) p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; The other emphasises the [[narcissism]] in the Laius/Oedipus relationship – the belief that there is only room for a single figure to exist in life, leading inevitably to the destruction of the one or the other competitor, father or son.&lt;ref&gt;H. Faimberg, ''The Telescoping of Generations'' (2005) pp. 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

How far the playing down of the Laius neurosis (in orthodox psychoanalysis)&lt;ref&gt;H. Faimberg, ''The Telescoping of Generations'' (2005) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; can be linked to what [[Julia Kristeva]] called Freud's "paternal vision of childhood",&lt;ref&gt;J. Kristeva, ''Desire in Language'' (New York 1980) pp. 274–5 &lt;/ref&gt; remains for the 21st century an open question.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marino, in R. Preiss ed., ''Childhood, Education and the Stage in Early Modern England'' (Cambridge 2017) pp. 229–31&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''late bloomer''' is a person whose talents or capabilities are not visible to others until later than usual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/late-bloomer Yourdictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/late%20bloomer?s=t Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/late-bloomer Collinsdictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used metaphorically to describe a child or adolescent who develops slower than others in their age group, but eventually catches up and in some cases overtakes their peers, or an adult whose talent or genius in a particular field only appears later in life than is normal – in some cases only in old age.

This article discusses late-blooming children, adolescents, and adults.

==Children==
[[File:Young Thomas Edison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Thomas Edison]] as a boy]]

"Late Bloomer" is commonly used to refer to young children who develop skills such as language, reading, or social interaction later than others of their age.

There are many theories of the way in which children develop, proposed by authorities such as [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept05/Bronfenbrenner.ssl.html "Urie Bronfenbrenner, father of Head Start program and pre-eminent 'human ecologist,' dies at age 88"] Cornell University 26 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome Bruner]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. S. &amp; Goodman, C. C. (1947). Value and need as organizing factors in perception. ''Journal of Abnormal Social Psychology'', 42, 33–44. [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Bruner/Value/ Available online at the Classics in the History of Psychology archive]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Erikson]], [[Jerome Kagan]], [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;*Piaget, J.  (1977). "The essential Piaget" ed by Howard E. Gruber and J. Jacques Voneche Gruber, New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lev Vygotsky]]. Although they disagree about how stages of development should be defined, and about the primary influences on development, they agree that a child's development can be measured as a predictable series of advances in physical, intellectual and social skills which almost always occur in the same sequence, although the rate may vary from one child to another.

When a child falls behind their peers at some stage of development, their teacher may perceive that the child is "backward". There is strong evidence that this perception may become self-fulfilling: although the child catches up, the teacher may continue to rate their performance poorly, imposing a long-term handicap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135424/http://www.se.rit.edu/~swami/LearningPapers/alvidrez1999TeacherPerceptions.pdf "Early Teacher Perceptions and Later Student Academic Achievement"] Journal of Educational Psychology, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Heatherton | first =  Edited by Todd F. | year = 2003 | title = The social psychology of stigma Chapter 13: Stigma and Self-Fulfilling Prophecies | isbn = 1-57230-942-3 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Edison]]'s mind often wandered and his teacher was overheard calling him "addled." This ended Edison's three months of official schooling. His mother then [[Homeschooling|home schooled]] him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectshum.org/Edison/ "Thomas Edison biography"] ProjectShum.org. Retrieved 8 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Edison may have had some form of [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), which the American Psychiatric Institute says affects about 3 – 5% of children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/164/6/856 "Why does the worldwide prevalence of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder matter?"] American Psychiatric Association.

[[File:Albert Einstein as a child.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Albert Einstein]] in 1893 (age 14)]]

==Adolescents==
[[File:William Butler Yeats by John Butler Yeats 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of young William Butler Yeats by his father, John Butler Yeats]]
During adolescence a child goes through physical and [[Adolescent psychology|mental]] changes that lead to them becoming an adult. Adolescence is usually considered to start with the first stages of [[puberty]] and to continue until physical growth is complete, although the [[World Health Organization]] defines adolescence simply as the period between ages 10 and 20. There is a wide range of normal ages, but generally girls begin the process of puberty between the ages of 9 to 14, reaching adult height and reproductive maturity within 4 years, while boys usually start between the ages of 10 to 17, and continue to grow for about 6 years after the first visible pubertal changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marshall | first = William A. |author2=Tanner, JM  | editor = Falkner F |editor2=Tanner JM, eds. | title = Human Growth: A Comprehensive Treatise | edition = 2nd | year = 1986 | publisher = Plenum Press | location = New York | isbn=0-306-41952-1 | pages = 171–209 | chapter =Chapter 8: Puberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescence is often a period of turbulent emotions and [[mood swings]] combined with rapid, intellectual development.&lt;ref name=Viner_2005&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Viner  | first = Russell  |author2=Christie, Deborah   | title = Adolescent development  | journal = British Medical Journal  | volume = 330  | issue =  7486| pages = 301–304  | date = 5 February 2005  | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7486/301  | doi = 10.1136/bmj.330.7486.301  | id =  | accessdate =20 June 2007  | pmid = 15695279  | pmc = 548185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Late bloomer" can refer to children who suffer from [[delayed puberty]], who are late in reaching their full height. [[W. B. Yeats]] (age 30),&lt;ref&gt;Foster, R. F. (1997). ''W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. I: The Apprentice Mage''. New York: [[Oxford University Press|Oxford UP]]. {{ISBN|0-19-288085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Trudeau]] (age at least 28),&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs'', by Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Toronto 1993, [[McClelland &amp; Stewart]] publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] (age 34), and [[Johann von Goethe]] (age 39) are all "late bloomers" in this last sense.

In most [[public education]]al systems, children and adolescents of the same age are put in the same classes. Because of the wide variance in the onset of adolescence, this means that one class may include individuals who have not yet started puberty, others who are [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]] but not fully grown and yet others who are effectively adult. During this period, there is a high risk of an adolescent dropping out of formal education (due most commonly to laziness, intellectual boredom, [[bullying]], or rebellion) without having achieved their full learning potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericdigests.org/1996-1/dropout.htm "Dropout Intervention and Language Minority Youth"] ERIC Digest. Retrieved 5 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The term "late-bloomer" may refer to such an individual who develops serious intellectual interests in their 20s or 30s and enrols in college, where he or she performs particularly well and subsequently establishes a professional career.

==Adults==

A late blooming adult is a person who does not discover their talents and abilities until later than normally expected. In certain cases retirement may lead to this discovery.

Although there is a common perception that intellectual development peaks in a young adult and then slowly declines with increasing age, this may be simplistic. Although the ability to form new memories and concepts may indeed diminish, the older person has the advantage of accumulated knowledge, associations between concepts, and mental techniques that may give them an advantage in some fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1147163-1,00.html "The Surprising Power of the Aging Brain"] ''Time'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable examples of late bloomers in different fields follow.

===Acting===
It was common for many actors to not get their big 'break' into the [[film industry]] until their late twenties or well into their thirties. [[Meryl Streep]] did not graduate [[Yale School of Drama]] until the age of twenty seven. The actor [[Alan Rickman]] did not begin his career until he was twenty eight, having operated a graphic-design company before then. He did not get his first real break into theatre until he was in his forties. [[Danny Aiello]] did not start acting until he was forty. [[Peg Phillips]] might be one of the best examples as she first pursued acting as a professional after her retirement from accounting; she started acting professionally in her late sixties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/95227_phillips12.shtml "Actress realized her dream on 'Northern Exposure'"] SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 12 November 2002.

[[George Wendt]] who played Norm on ''Cheers'' became active at the age of thirty two. [[Brian Dennehy]] had dreams of stage and screen at an early age, but chose to first pursue other interests such as service in the U.S. Marine Corps prior to becoming active at the age of thirty eight. Irish actor [[Brendan Gleeson]], who appeared as [[Mad Eye Moody]] in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films and alongside [[Colin Farrell]] in ''[[In Bruges]]'', started acting professionally at thirty four, having previous work as a school teacher. The Indian (Bengali) actor [[Paran Bandopadhyay]] is another late bloomer, who started his acting career in television and films at the age of sixty, after retiring from his government job. [[Jerry Doyle]], of ''[[Babylon 5]]'' fame, did not start acting until he was thirty six after working as a stockbroker and pilot. [[Sylvester Stallone]] was thirty when he wrote and starred in the first ''[[Rocky]]''. All throughout his life, he has pushed his body through rigorous training routines for his film roles. Most notably at age forty three, he developed his now-famous ''Rambo 3'' physique which got him named as "body of the '80s". The veteran Indian (Malayalam) actor [[Sathyan (actor)|Sathyan]] started his career at the age of forty, after resigning from Police Service. He later came to be known as one of the greatest actors ever in Malayalam film industry.

Musical ability is inherent in almost all people, to a greater or lesser extent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040615022738/http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/copp.htm "Musical Ability"] Evelyn Fletcher Copp. Originally published in The Journal of Heredity, Volume 7, pages 297–305, July 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; However, those who develop it to a high level are generally encouraged to play an instrument or to sing at an early age.

===Filmmaking===
[[File:Manuel de Oliveira répondant à Antonio Tabucchi (2008.07.03)-Romanceor.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Manoel de Oliveira]]

Though many filmmakers begin directing in their late 20s or early 30s, many of the most notable directors in film history waited until their mid-to-late-30s to direct their first feature. These directors include [[Nicholas Ray]], [[Alain Resnais]], [[Edward Yang]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Frank Tashlin]], [[Robert Aldrich]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Anthony Mann]], [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Tsai Ming-liang]], [[Don Siegel]], [[Melvin Van Peebles]], [[Gaspar Noé]], [[Lloyd Bacon]], [[Alexander Kluge]], [[Mrinal Sen]], [[Jean-Marie Straub]], [[Ida Lupino]], [[Sam Mendes]], [[Alexander Payne]], [[Ang Lee]] and [[Jacques Rivette]]. [[David Mamet]] directed his first feature at 40, having already found success and been awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]] as a playwright. [[Éric Rohmer]] directed his first feature film at 39, though he didn't become a full-time filmmaker until he was in his late 40s. 

Many notable directors started even later: [[Robert Bresson]], [[Jacques Tati]], and [[Takeshi Kitano]] directed their first features at 42; [[Maurice Pialat]] at 43; [[Michael Haneke]] at 47; [[Jim Sheridan]] at 40; and his peer and collaborator [[Terry George]] at 46. [[Yevgeni Bauer]] at 48. [[Clint Eastwood]], the oldest person to win the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], directed his first film at 41.

One of the most shining examples of late bloomers in filmmaking is the Portuguese director [[Manoel de Oliveira]]. Born in 1908, he worked sporadically in filmmaking from the 1930s. He completed his first feature film in 1941 called ''Aniki-Bobo''. Due to circumstances beyond his control (difficulty in financing, having to deal with his family's business), he did not complete his second feature film until 1971 (when he turned 63). 2 years later, he completed his third feature film, ''Benilde or the Virgin Mother'' (1973). Five years later, he made his breakthrough film (originally commissioned by Portuguese TV) called ''Doomed Love''. After his critically acclaimed film ''Francisca'' (1981), he became a full-time filmmaker (at the age of 73).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/en/article/12/12/2008/portugals-oliveira-still-making-films-at-100 Portugal’s Oliveira – still making films at 100!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116202228/http://www.euronews.net/en/article/12/12/2008/portugals-oliveira-still-making-films-at-100/ |date=16 January 2009 }} Euronews 12 December 2008.

===Politics===
[[File:Churchill HU 90973.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Winston Churchill]], failed thrice at high school.]] 
It is common for politicians to achieve prominence late in life, often after a career in business, law or academia. For example, in the [[111th United States Congress#Members|United States Congress]] of January 2009, of 540 elected officials, 215 had worked in the legal profession, and 189 had worked in private sector business.

Some highly successful politicians come from more unusual backgrounds.

[[Václav Havel]], born in 1936, was a playwright and writer with an interest in human rights. He became the voice of the opposition in [[Czechoslovakia]] in the 1980s and President of Czechoslovakia at age 53 after the collapse of the communist regime in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Kriseová, Eda.

===Writing===
Many writers have published their first major work late in life. [[Mary Wesley]] might be a classic example. She wrote two children's books in her late fifties, but her writing career did not gain note until her first novel at 70, written after the death of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2617393.stm "Author Mary Wesley dies"] BBC News.

Media pluralism is often recognized by [[International organization|international organizations]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] as being an essential part of a [[Democracy|democratic]] state, [[Reporters Without Borders]] considers ''"access to a plurality of editorial lines and analyses [as] essential for citizens to be able to confront ideas, to make their own informed choices and to conduct their life freely"''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Expanded access to the [[Internet]] and the [[Digital television transition|digital switch-over]] has enabled an increased availability of [[Content (media)|media content]], largely through sharing and [[user-generated content]] on [[social media]], in addition to the digital channels to which individuals have access across television and radio. The diversity of content is however accompanied by what [[Comparing Media Systems|Hallin and Mancini]] call polarized pluralism in a media system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics|last=Hallin|first=Daniel C.|last2=Mancini|first2=Paolo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0521543088|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the [[World Trends Report]], a sharper division in the way we use news is coming up due to the interaction between consumption habits, changing [[Economic model|economic models]] and technical systems. This signifies that even if multiple kinds of information and programming are available, each segmented group may only ingest one branch of the whole. The increase of Internet penetration and reliance on online sources for news is thought of to producing siloed debates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At the [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] level, ‘[[Zero-rating|zero rating]]’— in which Internet or [[Mobile network operator|mobile service providers]] allow users to access specific content or applications without counting towards the user’s data ‘cap’— expands in parallel to mobile uptakes, particularly in [[Emerging markets|emerging countries]]. Traditional business models for the news media continue to be disrupted, leading to vertical and horizontal concentration and introduction of new types of ownership. Challenges to media funding introduce new types of economic models such as [[Paywall|pay-walls]] and [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding]] initiatives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Gender equality|Gender]] is a part of media pluralism and is characterized by the under-representation of [[Women in media|women in the media]] workforce, in [[decision-making]] and in media content. People with disabilities are also under-represented in the media system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/disability-and-the-media.html|title=Disability and the Media {{!}} United Nations Enable|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Understanding media pluralism ==

* Pluralism means choice for media consumption and production, as distinct from monopolization of offerings and opportunities.
* Pluralism involves sensitivity to a variety of economic ownership models and a technical architecture of delivery in which multichannel and multi-platform distribution is available.
* Pluralism often resonates with strong commitments on behalf of governments to public service and community media to provide for diversity.

== Access ==
{{Main|Access to information}}Access to information, as the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively, is an aspect of media pluralism. It can include or allow "scientific, [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], and traditional knowledge; freedom of information, building of open knowledge resources, including open Internet and open standards, and open access and availability of data; preservation of digital heritage; respect for cultural and linguistic diversity, such as fostering access to local content in accessible languages; quality education for all, including lifelong and [[Educational technology|e-learning]]; diffusion of new media and information [[literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on skills, education, gender, age, race, ethnicity, and accessibility by those with disabilities; and the development of connectivity and affordable ICTs, including mobile, the Internet, and broadband infrastructures".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=261065&amp;set=005B054385_2_76&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Buckland defines six types of barriers that have to be overcome in order for access to information to be achieved: identification of the source, availability of the source, price of the user, cost to the provider, cognitive access, acceptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/access.html|title=Access to information.|website=people.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While “[[access to information]]”, “right to information”, “right to know” and “freedom of information” are sometimes used as synonyms, the diverse terminology does highlight particular (albeit related) dimensions of the issue.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Internet and mobile ===
According to the World Trends Report, access to all types of media has increased between 2012 and 2017, but this is especially true for access to the Internet. International commitments such as the [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]], the work of the [[Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development]] and the [[Internet Governance Forum]]’s intersessional work on ‘Connecting the Next Billion’ testify of this.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Number_of_mobile_cellular_subscriptions_2012-2016.svg|thumb|344x344px|Number of mobile cellular subscriptions 2012-2016]]
[[Mobile Web|Mobile Internet]] connectivity has an impact in expanding access. The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.89 billion in 2012 to 4.83 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world’s population, with more than half of subscriptions located in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]]. The number of subscriptions is predicted to rise to 5.69 billion users in 2020. As of 2016, almost 60 per cent of the world’s population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50 per cent in 2015 and 11 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;GSMA. 2017. The Mobile Economy 2017. Available at https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the open web affords explorations beyond a user’s immediate range of interests, Mobile Internet has the singularity of creating siloed information spaces predisposing mobile users to access only a limited portion of the available information. [[Censorship]] and [[surveillance]] are also factors of media pluralism as they cause different experiences for users accessing the Internet in different States.

==== Zero-rating ====
The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the Internet. [[Zero-rating]], the practice of internet providers allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a ‘two-tiered’ internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of ‘equal rating’ and is being tested in experiments by [[Mozilla]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] in Africa. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [[Colombia]], offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.&lt;ref&gt;Galpaya, Helani. 2017. Zero-rating in Emerging Economies. London: Chatham House. Available at https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/GCIG%20 no.47_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study led by the [[Alliance for Affordable Internet]] (A4AI) of eight countries in the [[Global South]] found that zero-rated data plans exist in every country, although there is a great range in the frequency with which they are offered and actually used in each.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI). 2015. Models of Mobile Data Services in Developing Countries. Research brief. The Impacts of Emerging Mobile Data Services in Developing Countries. Available at http://a4ai.org/the-impacts-of-emerging-mobile-data-services-in-developing-countries/ The study looked at the top three to five carriers by market share in Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru and Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the 181 plans examined, 13 per cent were offering zero-rated services. Another study, covering [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]], found Facebook’s Free Basics and [[Wikipedia Zero]] to be the most commonly zero-rated content.&lt;ref&gt;Gillwald, Alison, Chenai Chair, Ariel Futter, Kweku Koranteng, Fola Odufuwa, and John Walubengo. 2016.

=== Broadcast media ===
[[File:Main_source_of_news_by_age.svg|thumb|248x248px|Main source of news by age]]
In Western Europe and North America, the primacy of [[television]] as a main source of information is being challenged by the internet, while in other regions, such as Africa, television is gaining greater audience share than [[radio]], which has historically been the most widely accessed media platform.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In the Arab region, geopolitical interests has contributed to the growing reach of state-owned global news broadcasters and has determined the launching of Arabic-language channels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Generational trends ====
Age plays a profound role in determining the balance between radio, television and the Internet as the leading source of news. According to the 2017 [[Reuters]] Institute Digital News Report, in 36 countries and territories surveyed, 51 per cent of adults 55 years and older consider television as their main news source, compared to only 24 per cent of respondents between 18 and 24.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Newman, Nic, Richard Fletcher, Antonis Kalogeropoulos, David A. L. Levy, and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen. 2017. Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Available at https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Digital%20News%20Report%202017%20 web_0.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern is reversed when it comes to [[Digital media|online media]], chosen by 64 per cent of users between 18 and 24 as their primary source, but only by 28 per cent of users 55 and older.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  According to the Arab Youth Survey, in 2016, 45 per cent of the young people interviewed considered social media as a major source of news.&lt;ref&gt;ASDA’A Burson-Marsteller. 2016.

==== Digital transition ====
{{See also|Digital television transition}}Digital transition is the process in which older [[Analog TV|analog television]] [[broadcasting]] is converted to and replaced by [[digital television]].The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) has been mapping the progress in [[Digital television transition|digital switchovers]] across the globe. According to them, the switch from [[Analog television|analogue television]] to [[digital television]] has been completed in 56 countries in 2017, and was ongoing in 68, steadily increasing the range of channels to which individuals have access.&lt;ref&gt;International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 2017b.

[[File:Status_of_the_transition_to_Digital_Terrestrial_Television_Broadcasting.svg|thumb|275x275px|Status of the transition to Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting]]

==== Expansion strategies ====

* Satellite television has continued to add global or transnational alternatives to national viewing options for many audiences. Global news providers such as the [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Agence France-Presse]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly Russia Today) and the Spanish-language [[EFE|Agencia EFE]], have used the internet and satellite television to better reach audiences across borders and have added specialist broadcasts to target specific foreign audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Reflecting a more outward looking orientation, [[China]] [[Global Television Network]] (CGTN), the multi-language and multi-channel grouping owned and operated by [[China Central Television]], changed its name from CCTV-NEWS in January 2017.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* After years of budget cuts and shrinking global operations, in 2016 BBC announced the launch of 12 new language services (in [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]], [[Amharic]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Pidgin]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), branded as a component of its biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’.&lt;ref&gt;BBC. 2016. BBC World Service announces biggest expansion ‘since the 1940s’. BBC News, sec. Entertainment &amp; Arts. Available at https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainmentarts-37990220. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also expanding access to content are changes in usage patterns with non-linear viewing, as [[Streaming media|online streaming]] is becoming an important component of users’ experience. Since expanding its global service to 130 new countries in January 2016, [[Netflix]] experienced a surge in subscribers, surpassing 100 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2017, up from 40 million in 2012. The audience has also become more diverse with 47 per cent of users based outside of the [[United States]], where the company began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Huddleston, Tom. 2017. Netflix Has More U.S. Subscribers Than Cable TV. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/15/netflix-more-subscribersthan-cable/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newspaper industry ===
The [[Internet]] has challenged the press as an alternative source of information and opinion but has also provided a new platform for newspaper organizations to reach new audiences. Between 2012 and 2016, print newspaper circulation continued to fall in almost all regions, with the exception of Asia and the Pacific, where the dramatic increase in sales in a few select countries has offset falls in historically strong Asian markets such as [[Japan]] and the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]]. Between 2012 and 2016, [[India]]’s print circulation grew by 89 per cent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Campbell, Cecilia. 2017. World Press Trends 2017. Frankfurt: WAN-IFRA.&lt;/ref&gt; As many newspapers make the transition to online platforms, revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]] have been growing significantly. How to capture more of this growth remains a pressing challenge for newspapers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Advertising issues ====
Print media is continuously affected by changing trends in advertising: in 2012 its share of total news media revenues globally dropped below 50 per cent and continued falling to 38 per cent in 2016. Newspapers transition to online platforms increase the volume of revenues from digital subscriptions and [[Online advertising|digital advertising]]. The main challenge that [[Newspaper|newspapers]] face, according to Cecilia Campbell, is how to capture more of the digital subscriptions and advertising growth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Economic models ==
Media systems are built from a variety of economic models including mixes of [[Market economy|market]], [[public service]], [[community]] and [[State-owned enterprise|state entities]]. A plurality of media owners and economic models serves as an essential element of external pluralism, guaranteed by competition in the market. Nonprofit public service and [[community media]] can help achieve internal pluralism by incorporating social and [[cultural diversity]] in the content they produce. Community media, drawing especially on volunteers, can be a unique source of local dialogue and [[information exchange]]. The lack of adaption and of efficient economic strategies from [[Old media|traditional media]] has led to proliferation of privately owned media. This involves a diversification of newspapers but may also affects quality journalism and [[media independence]], especially with the financial contributions from "backers".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Pluralism in media ownership ===

==== State-owned media ====
In 2012, the [[Arab States Broadcasting Union]] (ASBU) counted 1,230 television stations broadcasting via Arab and international satellites, of which 133 were state-owned and 1,097 private.&lt;ref&gt;Arab States Broadcasting Union. 2015. Arab Satellite Broadcasting Annual Report 2015. Available at http://www.asbu.net/medias/NewMedia_2016/text/asbu_report_2015.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of [[government]] owned channels in the media sector is paralleled by a growth in outlets with a [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] agenda. In some countries, private media outlets often maintain close ties to governments or individual politicians , while media houses owned by politically non-aligned individuals have struggled to survive, often in the face of advertising boycotts by state agencies. According to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), public service broadcasting tend to struggle with fundings and to decline since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;European Broadcasting Union (EBU). 2015. Funding of Public Service Media 2015. Available at https://www.ebu.ch/publications/funding-of-public-service-med-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Controlled liberalization ====
Media [[privatization]] and the lessening of the State dominance over media content is a global trend, according to the [[World Trends Report]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Establishing profitable models of [[State ownership|state-owned]] but relatively independent papers is part of the controlled liberalization process and is a common practice in the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific]] region.
* State owned papers are top selling in Africa and the Arab region but often lack in reflecting society's plurality.
* [[Vertical integration]] and concentration in [[Mature market|mature markets]] are found in Central and Eastern Europe, but they tend to lack [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] on ownership and of institutional safeguards with regard to pluralism (e.g. monitoring of concentration and regulatory intervention).
* Limits to [[Concentration of media ownership|concentration]] are clearly set out in Western Europe but they face [[Lobbying|lobbies]] from media actors who are able to loosen norms and the enforcement of the law.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== New types of cross-ownership ====
{{See also|Cross ownership}}[[Cross ownership|Cross-ownership]] is a method of reinforcing business relationships by owning stock in the companies with which a given company does business. Drawing the line between the media and other industries is a challenge for new types of cross-ownership. The acquisition of the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] by the founder of online retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] raised concerns about the newspaper independence, the newspaper has significantly increased its standing in the [[Digital media|online media]]—and print—and introduced significant innovations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Community-centered media ownership model ====
Most common in isolated, rural or disadvantaged areas [[Community media|community-centered media]] ownership is also mostly pertaining to radio. Through this model, not-for-profit media outlets are run and managed by the communities. They are also characterized as "independent and governed by and in the service of the communities they serve"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/community-media-sustainability/policy-series/defining|title=Community media sustainability|last=|first=|date=2017-04-07|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represent what UNESCO calls &lt;ref&gt;Steve Buckley, 2011, Community Media: A Good Practice Handbook.

=== Advertising, between old and new models ===
[[File:Internet_advertising_revenue_2012-2016.svg|thumb|286x286px|Internet advertising revenue 2012-2016]]
One of the challenges to [[Old media|traditional media]] is [[Advertising|advertisement]], which has evolved since 2010. According to the World Trends Report&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, between 2012 and 2016, revenues from advertisement in print have decreased by 27 percent In 2012, print advertising’s share of total news advertising revenue was 48 per cent, falling to 38 per cent by 2016.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Circulation of [[Digital newspaper|digital versions of traditional newspapers]] and digital advertisements have grown significantly, but have not been sufficient to offset losses in print. Once the transitioning phase from old media to digital media is over, revenues from digital advertisement tend to increase.&lt;ref&gt;PwC. 2017. IAB internet advertising revenue report 2016 full year results. Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). The trend captured by the study of the Internet Advertising Bureau is limited to the USA, where the largest multinational companies  that are responsible for transformations in digital advertisement are headquartered&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon pushed advertisers to pay premium prices to quality publications.

Tauel Harper considers that with the rise of [[big data]], media have been seen to lose the "advertising [[subsidy]]" for journalistic content, through which "private" advertising paid for "[[Civic journalism|public journalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Tauel. 2016.

=== New platforms and business models ===
The [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in the [[United States]], or the [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] in [[South Africa]] use extensions or variations of existing schemes such as pay-walls created by publications considered to be of particularly high quality or addressing a particular niche.

The [[The Guardian|Guardian]] uses [[Wikipedia]]'s borrowed strategy of frequently asking readers for [[Donation|donations]] in support to quality journalism or [[free content]].

In various sectors, the number of [[Crowdfunded Journalism|crowdfunded journalism]] projects has increased significantly. While in 2012, 88 projects received funding through the platform, in 2015, the number of projects rose to 173, scattered across 60 countries (even if North America continues to register the majority of funded projects). The funds collected grew from $1.1 million in 2012 to $1.9 million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Nancy, and Amy Mitchell. 2016. Crowdfunded Journalism: A Small but Growing Addition to Publicly Driven Journalism. Available at http://www.journalism.org/2016/01/20/crowdfunded-journalism/. Accessed 23 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Share_of_Internet_advertising_revenue_by_platform_2012-2016.svg|thumb|284x284px|Share of Internet advertising revenue by platform 2012-2016]]
Economic models also depend on larger structural reconfiguration of the market. While in 2012 advertising revenues from [[Mobile advertising|mobile]] represented a tiny portion of the market in the [[United States]], in 2016 they surpassed revenues from all other platforms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Media actors have also started testing new formats and technologies of journalism, experimenting with how [[virtual reality]] or [[Video game journalism|gaming]] can facilitate immersive experiences of relatively distant events. In 2015 for example, the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] opened its Virtual Reality Lab, seeking to provide original perspectives on issues ranging from the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], to the [[South Sudanese Civil War|conflict in South Sudan]], to the thinning of the [[Antarctica|ice cap in Antarctica]]. The [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]] app proved the most downloaded in the history of interactive applications launched by the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, Madeline. 2015.

== Content ==
According to [[Cisco Systems]], in 2016 an average of 96,000 [[Petabyte|petabytes]] was transferred monthly over the Internet, more than twice as many as in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cisco Systems. 201.

Total number of websites.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== User-generated content ===
Reaching two billion daily active users in June 2017, [[Facebook]] has emerged as the most popular social media platform globally.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. 2017. Mark Zuckerberg Says Facebook Now Has 2 Billion Users Worldwide. Fortune. Available at http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-userbase/. Accessed 21 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Other social media platforms are also dominant at the regional level such as: [[Twitter]] in [[Japan]], [[Naver]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Instagram]] (owned by Facebook) and [[LinkedIn]] (owned by [[Microsoft]]) in [[Africa]], [[VKontakte]] (VK) and [[Odnoklassniki]] in [[Russia]] and other countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], [[WeChat]] and [[Tencent QQ|QQ]] in [[China]].

However, a concentration phenomenon is occurring globally giving the dominance to a few online platforms that become popular for some unique features they provide, most commonly for the added privacy they offer users through disappearing messages or [[end-to-end encryption]] (e.g. [[WhatsApp]], [[Snapchat]], [[Signal (software)|Signal]], and [[Telegram (service)|Telegram]]), but they have tended to occupy niches and to facilitate the exchanges of information that remain rather invisible to larger audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Production of freely accessible information has been increasing since 2012. In January 2017, [[Wikipedia]] had more than 43 million articles, almost twice as many as in January 2012. This corresponded to a progressive diversification of content and increase in contributions in languages other than English. In 2017, less than 12 per cent of Wikipedia content was in English, down from 18 per cent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Wikimedia Foundation. 2017. Wikipedia Statistics. Available at https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham, Straumann, and Hogan say that increase in the availability and diversity of content has not radically changed the structures and processes for the production of knowledge. For example, while content on Africa has dramatically increased, a significant portion of this content has continued to be produced by contributors operating from North America and Europe, rather than from Africa itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Divisions of Labor and Informational Magnetism: Mapping Participation in Wikipedia.|last=Graham|first=Mark|last2=Staumann|first2=Ralph K.|last3=Hogan|first3=Bernie|publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers 105 (6): 1158–1178.|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Algorithms, echo chambers and polarization ===
The proliferation of online sources represents a vector leading to an increase in pluralism but [[Algorithm|algorithms]] used by [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]] and [[Web search engine|search engines]] to provide users with a personalized experience based on their individual preferences represent a challenge to pluralism, restricting exposure to differing viewpoints and news feed. This is commonly referred to as "eco-chambers" and "[[Filter bubble|filter-bubbles]]".

With the help of algorithms, filter bubbles influence users choices and perception of reality by giving the impression that a particular point of view or representation is widely shared. Following the 2016 [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum of membership of the European Union in the United Kingdom]] and the [[United States presidential election|United States presidential elections]], this gained attention as many individuals confessed their surprise at results that seemed very distant from their expectations. The range of pluralism is influenced by the personalized individualization of the services and the way it diminishes choice.

The term "[[fake news]]" gained importance with the electoral context in Western Europe and North America. It is determined by [[Fraud|fraudulent]] content in news format and its velocity. According to Bounegru, Gray, Venturini and Mauri, fake news is when a deliberate lie "is picked up by dozens of other [[Blog|blogs]], retransmitted by hundreds of websites, cross-posted over thousands of social media accounts and read by hundreds of thousands" that it then effectively becomes "fake news".&lt;ref&gt;Bounegru, Liliana, Jonathan Gray, Tommaso Venturini, and Michele Mauri. 2017.

While a large proportion of the European press initially articulated a sympathetic and empathetic response towards the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict in [[Syria]], according to Georgiou and Zaborowski, this sentiment was gradually replaced by suspicion and, in some cases, hostility towards [[Refugee|refugees]] and migrants.&lt;ref&gt;Georgiou, Myria, and Rafal Zaborowski. 2016. Media coverage of the “refugee crisis”: A cross-European perspective. London: London School of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the quality and [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid press]] tended to employ ‘established, stereotyped narratives’ of security threats and economic costs.&lt;ref&gt;Greussing, Esther, and Hajo G. Boomgaarden. 2017. Shifting the refugee narrative? An automated frame analysis of Europe’s 2015 refugee crisis. Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 0 (0): 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Gábor and Messing consider that a portion of the press, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, turned to systematic hostility towards migrants and refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor, Bernáth, and Vera Messing. 2016. Infiltration of political meaning-production: security threat or humanitarian crisis? The coverage of the refugee ‘crisis’ in the Austrian and Hungarian media in early autumn 2015. Budapest: Centre for Media, Data, and Society&lt;/ref&gt;

=== News players ===
[[Gatekeeping (communication)|Gate-keeping]] mechanisms continue to influence not only what is being communicated, but also who is given the opportunity to frame events. Citizens’ voices have indeed increased in new stories, individuals included in these stories tend to be treated, not as agents capable of asserting their world views and their interpretation of events, but rather as [[Vox populi|vox-pol]], employed to add color to a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, Toni G.L.A., Piet Verhoeven, Johannes W.J. Beentjes, and Rens Vliegenthart. 2016. Disrupting gatekeeping practices: Journalists’ source selection in times of crisis. Journalism 18 (9): 1107-1124&lt;/ref&gt; Harlow and Johnson consider that in the case of protests, demonstrations or conflicts, established institutions and elites tend to prevail as news sources.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow, Summer, and Thomas J. Johnson. 2011. The Arab Spring| Overthrowing the Protest Paradigm? How The New York Times, Global Voices and Twitter Covered the Egyptian Revolution. International journal of Communication 5: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although novel media operations and actors have had a smaller impact on mainstream reporting, they have been instrumental in animating intermediate spaces, which aggregate content in ways that can reach broader audiences.

As users increasingly move from broadcast to online media to access information, the same large media institutions tend to predominate online spaces, even if filtered and mediated in much of their social media presence. A decade later, the majority of the most visited and viewed news websites remain traditional media outlets ([[CNN]], New York Times, the Guardian, [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]], [[BBC News|BBC]]), although news aggregation websites such as [[Reddit]] and [[Google News]] have emerged among the top five sites with the highest [[web traffic]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexa. 2017.

=== Media and information literacy ===
Authors Frau-Meigs, Velez, and Michel (2017) and Frau-Meigs and Torrent (2009) consider diversity in media can also be enhanced by [[Information and media literacy|media and information literacy]] (MIL).&lt;ref&gt;Frau-Meigs, Divina, and Jordi Torrent. 2009. Mapping media education policies in the world: visions, programmes and challenges. Revista Comunicar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frau-Meigs, Divina, Irma Velez, and Julieta Flores Michel. 2017. Public policies in media and information literacy in Europe: cross-country comparisons. Taylor &amp; Francis. Available at https://books.google.fr/books?lr=&amp;id=aiMlDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Public+Policies+in+Media+and+Information+Literacy+in+Europe:+C+ross-Country+Comparison&amp;ots=hBxkvVWX-M&amp;sig=Npioa_AVLOBy5KcvZX8nqMd95E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Public%20Policies%20in%20Media%20and%20Information%20Literacy%20in%20Europe%3A%20C%20ross-Country%20Comparison&amp;f=false. Accessed 22 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that it can be useful in understanding the consequences of algorithms on modes of diffusion. Many types of MIL exist from [[information literacy]], [[media literacy]], news literacy, advertising literacy, [[digital literacy]], media education, to digital and media literacy. A few initiatives already exist in the field:

* UNESCO launched in 2013 the Global Alliance for Partnerships on Media and Information Literacy (GAPMIL), as an "effort to promote international cooperation to ensure that all citizens have access to media and information competencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/media-development/media-literacy/global-alliance-for-partnerships-on-media-and-information-literacy/about-gapmil/|title=About GAPMIL - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The recent annual yearbook by the [[The International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media|International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media]] focuses on trends and opportunities for MIL in the [[Arab world|Arab region]].
* There have also been efforts to embed media and information literacy initiatives and requirements into legislation in countries such as [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/five-serbian-ministries-government-joined-forces-enable-media-and-information-literacy-policies|title=Five Serbian Ministries Government Joined Forces to Enable Media and Information Literacy Policies|last=|first=|date=2017-03-16|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Finland]]&lt;ref&gt;Finnish Media Education.

* Education initiatives have been proliferating online reflecting a growth of [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]] or massive online courses. Available on platforms such as [[Coursera]] and [[edX]], as well as by [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]], these courses target both students and consumers of media, as well as teachers.
* There have also been a growing number of initiatives launched by internet companies to combat [[online hate speech]] or the proliferation of ‘fake news’, largely built on users’ inputs and support in flagging content that appears to not comply with a platform’s [[terms of service]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanford History Education Group. 2016.

== Gender equality ==
[[File:Invisible_women_-_Gender_equality_in_media_content,_decision-making_and_media_workforce.png|thumb|329x329px|Invisible women? Gender equality in media content, decision-making and media workforce]]
Tuchman, Daniels, and Benoit (1978) use the term "[[symbolic annihilation]]" (originally credited to [[George Gerbner]]) to describe women's relationship to and visibility in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]], women’s visibility in newspaper, television and radio increased by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Makes the News? Global Media Monitoring Project 2015|last=Macharia|first=Sarah|publisher=London, Toronto: World Association for Christian Communication (WACC).|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://cdn.agilitycms.com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_report_en.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regional organization|Regional]] and [[International organization|international organizations]] also recognize gender and media pluralism as often being problematic:

* In 2010, [[UNESCO]] developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In 2013, the Council of the [[European Parliament]] adopted the recommendation made by the European Institute for Gender Equality, that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In 2016, [[UN Women]] launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on eradicating all forms of inequalities. The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The media workforce ===
According to Byerly, in many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programmes and entering the industry.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: intercultural dialogue. Nordicom. Available at http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A769151&amp;dswid=-8862. Accessed 22 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of [[Women in media|women media]] professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media workforce.&lt;ref&gt;National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the US, Harp, Bachmann, and Loke, show that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of columnist at the major dailies.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 GMMP found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Closer analysis shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent), for example, and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65. Part of this is likely due to recent improvements that have allowed more young women to enter the field, but it could also relate to the differences in how aging is perceived between men and women, as well as limitations in career advancement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Women's Media Center|Women’s Media Center]] (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the USA shows that at 20 of the nation’s top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Women’s Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at https://www.womensmediacenter.com/reports/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.-media-2017. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In broadcast news, women’s presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016.

=== Women and decision-making ===
[[File:Gender_equality_in_decision-making_positions_and_on_boards_in_media_organizations_in_Europe.svg|thumb|439x439px|Gender equality in decision-making positions and on boards in media organizations in Europe]]
The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top [[management]] (27 per cent) and [[governance]] (26 per cent) positions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The regions that fared best for women representation were [[Central Europe|Central]] (33 per cent) and [[Eastern Europe]] (43 per cent) and the [[Nordic countries]] (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]] region. A major European project funded by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) found very similar findings: men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017. Gender Statistics Database. Available at http://eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/dgs. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Asia and Pacific region, a joint report by the UNESCO Office in [[Bangkok]], UN Women and the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) Asia Pacific&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Bangkok Office, UN Women and International Federation of Journalists 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; found women were significantly under-represented in decision-making roles.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In [[Southern Africa]], a Gender Links study found that women constitute 40 per cent of media employees and 34 per cent of media managers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Ndlovu, Sikhonzile, and Tarisai Nyamweda. 2016. Whose news, whose views? Southern Africa Gender and Media Progress Study 2015. Johannesburg: Gender Links. Available at http://genderlinks.org.za/shop/whose-news-whose-views/. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that [[sexual harassment]] remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague.

=== Representation ===
The 2015 [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|GMMP]] made a comparison across 20 years of women's representation in the media and assessed that between 1995 (17 percent) and 2015 (24 percent), female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sarah Macharia highlights the fact that where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of [[Spokesperson|spokespersons]] and 19 per cent of [[Expert|experts]] featured in stories are women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in [[North America]], followed by the [[Caribbean]] (29 per cent) and [[Latin America]] (27 per cent). In the [[Southern Africa|southern African]] region, Gender Links’ 2016 Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women’s views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== The picture of women in media ===

* Women have won only a quarter of [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer prizes]] for foreign reporting and only 17 per cent of awards of the [[Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/women-foreign-correspondents/472596/|title=Why Don't Female Journalists Win More Awards?|first=Christina|last=Asquith|date=7 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the [[African Development Bank]] began sponsoring a category for [[Women's rights|Women’s Rights]] in Africa, designed to promote gender equality through the media, as one of the prizes awarded annually by [[One World Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/african-development-bank-promotes-gender-equality-in-the-media-through-womens-rights-in-africa-award-14447/|title=African Development Bank promotes gender equality in the media through 'Women's Rights in Africa' Award|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Created in 1997, the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] is an annual award that honors a person, organization or institution that has made a notable contribution to the defense and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world. Nine out of 20 winners have been women.
* The [[Poynter Institute]] since 2014 has been running a Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media, expressly focused on the skills and knowledge needed to achieve success in the digital media environment.

In their 2016 handbook, WINing Strategies: Creating Stronger Media Organizations by Increasing Gender Diversity, they highlight a range of positive action strategies undertaken by a number of their member organizations from [[Germany]] to [[Jordan]] to [[Colombia]], with the intention of providing blueprints for others to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wan-ifra.org/reports/2018/05/28/winning-strategies-creating-stronger-news-media-organizations-by-increasing-gende|title=WINning Strategies – Creating Stronger News Media Organizations by Increasing Gender Diversity (2018 update) - WAN-IFRA|website=www.wan-ifra.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mental operations''' are operations that affect [[mind|mental]] contents. Initially, operations of [[reasoning]] have been the object of [[logic]] alone. [[Pierre Janet]] was one of the first to use the concept in psychology. Mental operations have been investigated at a developmental level by [[Jean Piaget]], and from a [[psychometric]] perspective by [[J. P. Guilford]]. There is also a cognitive approach to the subject, as well as a systems view of it.

==History==
Since [[Ancient history|Antiquity]], mental operations, more precisely, formal operations of [[reasoning]] have been the object of [[logic]].&lt;ref name="hobh"&gt;[[Hobhouse, LT]] (2005). ''The Theory of Knowledge: A Contribution to Some Problems of Logic and Metaphysics'', Kessinger Publishing, p. 223. {{ISBN|978-1-4179-6206-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, Pierre Janet described two types of mental operations:&lt;ref name="vals"&gt;Valsiner, Jaan; van der Veer, René (2000). ''The social mind: construction of the idea.'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 103-106. {{ISBN|0-521-58973-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* reality operations - mental operations under the control of logic;
* disinterested operations - escaping the control of reason.
Jean Piaget differentiated a [[preoperational stage]], and operational stages of [[cognitive development]], on the basis of presence of mental operations as an [[adaptation]] tool.&lt;ref name="gins"&gt;Ginsburg, Herbert; Opper, Sylvia (1979). ''Piaget's Theory of Intellectual Development.'' Prentice Hall, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-13-675140-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

J. P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect model described up to 180 different intellectual abilities organized along three dimensions—Operations, Content, and Products.&lt;ref name="guilf"&gt;Guilford, Joy Paul (1980). Some changes in the structure of intellect model. ''Educational and Psychological Measurement'' '''48''': 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical view==
According to 
most logicians, the three primary mental operations are [[apprehension (understanding)]], [[judgement]], and [[inference]].&lt;ref name="hobh" /&gt;

===Apprehension===
Apprehension is the mental operation by which an idea is formed in the mind. If you were to think of a sunset or a baseball, the action of forming that picture in your mind is apprehension. The verbal expression of apprehension is called a term.

===Judgment===
Judgment is the mental operation by which we predicate something of a subject. Were you to think, "That sunset is beautiful" or "Baseball is the all-American sport" is to make a judgment. The verbal expression of judgment is the statement (or proposition).

===Inference===
Inference (or reasoning) is the mental operation by which we draw conclusions from other information. If you were to think, "I like to look at that sunset, because I enjoy beautiful things, and that sunset is beautiful" you would be reasoning. The verbal expression of reasoning is the logical argument.&lt;ref name="hobh"/&gt;

==Developmental view==
[[Jean Piaget]] identifies several mental operations of the [[concrete operational stage]] of [[cognitive development]]:&lt;ref name="gins"/&gt;
[[File:Piagetian operations.jpg|thumb|400px|Mental operations according to Jean Piaget.]]
*''Seriation''—the ability to sort objects in an order according to size, shape, or any other characteristic. For example, if given different-shaded objects they may make a color gradient.
*''Transitivity''—The ability to recognize logical relationships among elements in a serial order, and perform 'transitive inferences' (for example, If A is taller than B, and B is taller than C, then A must be taller than C).
*''Classification''—the ability to name and identify sets of objects according to appearance, size or other characteristic, including the idea that one set of objects can include another.
*''Decentering''—where the child takes into account multiple aspects of a problem to solve it. For example, the child will no longer perceive an exceptionally wide but short cup to contain less than a normally-wide, taller cup.
*''Reversibility''—the child understands that numbers or objects can be changed, then returned to their original state. For this reason, a child will be able to rapidly determine that if 4+4 equals t, t−4 will equal 4, the original quantity.
*''Conservation''—understanding that quantity, length or number of items is unrelated to the arrangement or appearance of the object or items.

Piaget also describes a [[formal operational stage]], with formal operations of [[abstract thinking]]: hypothesizing, [[hypothesis]] testing, and [[deductive reasoning|deduction]].&lt;ref name="gins" /&gt;

==Psychometric view==
[[File:Guilford model.jpg|thumb|400px|Guilford's Structure of Intellect.]]
According to [[J. P. Guilford]]'s Structure of Intellect (SI) theory, an individual's performance on intelligence tests can be traced back to the underlying mental abilities or factors of intelligence. SI theory comprises multiple intellectual abilities organized along three dimensions—Operations, Content, and Products.&lt;ref name="guil"&gt;Guilford, Joy Paul (1950). Creativity.

SI includes six operations or general intellectual processes:
Cognition—The ability to understand, comprehend, discover, and become aware of information.
Memory recording—The ability to encode information.
Memory retention—The ability to recall information.
Divergent production—The ability to generate multiple solutions to a problem; creativity.
Convergent production—The ability to deduce a single solution to a problem; rule-following or problem-solving.
Evaluation—The ability to judge whether or not information is accurate, consistent, or valid.

*''Content dimension''

SI includes five broad areas of information to which the human intellect applies the six operations:
Visual—Information perceived through seeing.
Auditory—Information perceived through hearing.
Kinesthetic -through actions
Symbolic—Information perceived as symbols or signs that have no meaning by themselves; e.g., Arabic numerals or the letters of an alphabet.
Semantic—Information perceived in words or sentences, whether oral, written, or silently in one's mind.
Behavioral—Information perceived as acts of people.

*''Product dimension''

As the name suggests, this dimension contains results of applying particular operations to specific contents. The SI model includes six products, in increasing complexity:
Units—Single items of knowledge.
Classes—Sets of units sharing common attributes.
Relations—Units linked as opposites or in associations, sequences, or analogies.
Systems—Multiple relations interrelated to comprise structures or networks.
Transformations—Changes, perspectives, conversions, or mutations to knowledge.
Implications—Predictions, inferences, consequences, or anticipations of knowledge.

Therefore, according to Guilford there are 6 x 5 x 6 = 180 intellectual abilities or factors. Each ability stands for a particular operation in a particular content area and results in a specific product, such as Comprehension of Figural Units or Evaluation of Semantic Implications.&lt;ref name="guilf" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13447">In [[formal ontology]], a branch of [[metaphysics]], and in [[ontology (computer science)|ontological computer science]], '''mereotopology''' is a [[first-order theory]], embodying [[mereology|mereological]] and [[topological]] concepts, of the relations among wholes, parts, parts of parts, and the [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]] between parts. 

==History and motivation==
Mereotopology begins in philosophy with theories articulated by [[A. N. Whitehead]] in several books and articles he published between 1916 and 1929, drawing in part on the mereogeometry of De Laguna (1922). The first to have proposed the idea of a point-free definition of the concept of topological space in mathematics was [[Karl Menger]] in his book ''Dimensionstheorie'' (1928) -- see also his (1940). The early historical background of mereotopology is documented in Bélanger and Marquis (2013) and Whitehead's early work is discussed in Kneebone (1963: chpt. 13.5) and Simons (1987: 2.9.1).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Peter Simons, "Whitehead and Mereology", in Guillaume Durand et [[Michel Weber]] (éditeurs), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279950/Les_principes_de_la_connaissance_naturelle_dAlfred_North_Whitehead_-_Alfred_North_Whiteheads_Principles_of_Natural_Knowledge Les principes de la connaissance naturelle d’Alfred North Whitehead — Alfred North Whitehead’s Principles of Natural Knowledge]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, ontos verlag, 2007. See also the relevant entries of [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond, (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Whitehead's 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'' augmented the part-whole relation with topological notions such as [[contact (mathematics)|contiguity]] and [[connected space|connection]]. Despite Whitehead's acumen as a mathematician, his theories were insufficiently formal, even flawed. By showing how Whitehead's theories could be fully formalized and repaired, Clarke (1981, 1985) founded contemporary mereotopology.&lt;ref&gt;Casati &amp; Varzi (1999: chpt. 4) and Biacino &amp; Gerla (1991) have reservations about some aspects of Clarke's formulation.&lt;/ref&gt; The theories of Clarke and Whitehead are discussed in Simons (1987: 2.10.2), and Lucas (2000: chpt. 10). The entry [[Whitehead's point-free geometry]] includes two contemporary treatments of Whitehead's theories, due to Giangiacomo Gerla, each different from the theory set out in the next section.

Although mereotopology is a mathematical theory, we owe its subsequent development to [[logic]]ians and theoretical [[computer science|computer scientists]]. Lucas (2000: chpt. 10) and Casati and Varzi (1999: chpts. 4,5) are introductions to mereotopology that can be read by anyone having done a course in [[first-order logic]]. More advanced treatments of mereotopology include Cohn and Varzi (2003) and, for the mathematically sophisticated, Roeper (1997). For a mathematical treatment of [[point-free geometry]], see Gerla (1995).  [[lattice (order)|Lattice]]-theoretic ([[algebraic structure|algebraic]]) treatments of mereotopology as [[contact algebra]]s have been applied to separate the [[topology|topological]] from the [[mereology|mereological]] structure, see Stell (2000), Düntsch and Winter (2004).

==Applications==
[[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] (1996), Anthony Cohn, [[Achille Varzi (philosopher) | Achille Varzi]] and their co-authors have shown that mereotopology can be useful in [[formal ontology]] and [[ontology (computer science)|computer science]], by allowing the formalization of relations such as [[contact (mathematics)|contact]], [[connected space|connection]], [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], [[interior (topology)|interior]]s, holes, and so on. Mereotopology has been applied also as a tool for qualitative [[spatial-temporal reasoning]], with constraint calculi such as the [[Region Connection Calculus]] (RCC). It provides the starting point for the theory of fiat boundaries developed by Smith and Varzi (2000), which grew out of the attempt to distinguish formally between 
*boundaries (in geography, geopolitics, and other domains) which reflect more or less arbitrary human demarcations and
*boundaries which reflect bona fide physical discontinuities (Smith 1995, 2001). 
Mereotopology is being applied by Salustri in the domain of digital manufacturing (Salustri, 2002) and by Smith and Varzi to the formalization of basic notions of ecology and environmental biology (Smith and Varzi, 1999, 2002). It has been applied also to deal with vague boundaries in geography (Smith and Mark, 2003), in [[ecological psychology]] (Smith, 2000), and in the study of vagueness and granularity (Smith and Brogaard, 2002, Bittner and Smith, 2001, 2001a).

==Preferred approach of Casati &amp; Varzi==
Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt.4) set out a variety of mereotopological theories in a consistent notation. This section sets out several nested theories that culminate in their preferred theory '''GEMTC''', and follows their exposition closely. The mereological part of '''GEMTC''' is the conventional theory '''[[mereology|GEM]]'''. Casati and Varzi do not say if the [[model theory|models]] of '''GEMTC''' include any conventional [[topological space]]s.

We begin with some [[domain of discourse]], whose elements are called [[individual]]s (a [[synonym]] for [[mereology]] is "the calculus of individuals"). Casati and Varzi prefer limiting the ontology to physical objects, but others freely employ mereotopology to reason about geometric figures and events, and to solve problems posed by research in [[machine intelligence]].

An upper case Latin letter denotes both a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] and the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] letter referring to that relation in [[first-order logic]]. Lower case letters from the end of the alphabet denote variables ranging over the domain; letters from the start of the alphabet are names of arbitrary individuals. If a formula begins with an [[atomic formula]] followed by the [[biconditional]], the subformula to the right of the biconditional is a definition of the atomic formula, whose variables are [[bound variable|unbound]]. Otherwise, variables not explicitly quantified are tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]]. The axiom '''Cn''' below corresponds to axiom '''C.n''' in Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt. 4).

We begin with a topological primitive, a [[binary relation]] called ''connection''; the atomic formula ''Cxy'' denotes that "''x'' is connected to ''y''." Connection is governed, at minimum, by the axioms:

'''C1'''. &lt;math&gt;\ Cxx.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Reflexive relation|reflexive]])

'''C2'''. &lt;math&gt; Cxy \rightarrow Cyx.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Symmetric relation|symmetric]])

Now posit the binary relation ''E'', defined as:

&lt;math&gt;Exy \leftrightarrow [Czx \rightarrow Czy].&lt;/math&gt;

''Exy'' is read as "''y'' encloses ''x''" and is also topological in nature. A consequence of '''C1-2''' is that ''E'' is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]], and hence a [[preorder]]. If ''E'' is also assumed [[axiom of extensionality|extensional]], so that:

&lt;math&gt; (Exa \leftrightarrow Exb) \leftrightarrow (a=b),&lt;/math&gt;

then ''E'' can be proved [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and thus becomes a [[partial order]]. Enclosure, notated ''xKy'', is the single primitive relation of the [[Whitehead's point-free geometry|theories in Whitehead (1919, 1925)]], the starting point of mereotopology. 

Let ''parthood'' be the defining primitive [[binary relation]] of the underlying [[mereology]], and let the [[atomic formula]] ''Pxy'' denote that "''x'' is part of ''y''". We assume that ''P'' is a [[partial order]]. Call the resulting minimalist mereological theory '''M'''. 

If ''x'' is part of ''y'', we postulate that ''y'' encloses ''x'':

'''C3'''. &lt;math&gt;\ Pxy \rightarrow Exy.&lt;/math&gt;

'''C3''' nicely connects [[mereology|mereological]] parthood to [[topological]] enclosure.

Let ''O'', the binary relation of mereological ''overlap'', be defined as:

&lt;math&gt; Oxy \leftrightarrow \exist z[Pzx \land\ Pzy].&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''Oxy'' denote that "''x'' and ''y'' overlap." With ''O'' in hand, a consequence of '''C3''' is:

&lt;math&gt;Oxy \rightarrow Cxy.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the [[Conversion (logic)|converse]] does not necessarily hold. While things that overlap are necessarily connected, connected things do not necessarily overlap. If this were not the case, [[topology]] would merely be a model of [[mereology]] (in which "overlap" is always either primitive or defined).

Ground mereotopology ('''MT''') is the theory consisting of primitive ''C'' and ''P'', defined ''E'' and ''O'', the axioms '''C1-3''', and axioms assuring that ''P'' is a [[partial order]]. Replacing the '''M''' in '''MT''' with the standard [[axiom of extension|extensional]] mereology '''[[mereology|GEM]]''' results in the theory '''GEMT'''.

Let ''IPxy'' denote that "''x'' is an internal part of ''y''." ''IP'' is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;IPxy \leftrightarrow (Pxy \land (Czx \rightarrow Ozy)).&lt;/math&gt;

Let σ''x'' φ(''x'') denote the mereological sum (fusion) of all individuals in the domain satisfying φ(''x''). σ is a [[bound variable|variable binding]] [[Substring|prefix]] operator. The axioms of '''GEM''' assure that this sum exists if φ(''x'') is a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]]. With σ and the relation ''IP'' in hand, we can define the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''x'', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}x,&lt;/math&gt; as the mereological sum of all interior parts ''z'' of ''x'', or:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}x =&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;df&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sigma z[IPzx].&lt;/math&gt;

Two easy consequences of this definition are:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}W = W,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the universal individual, and

'''C5'''.&lt;ref&gt;The axiom '''C4''' of Casati and Varzi (1999) is irrelevant to this entry.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\ P(\mathbf{i}x)x.&lt;/math&gt; ([[inclusion (set theory)|Inclusion]])

The operator '''i''' has two more axiomatic properties:

'''C6'''. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{i}x) = \mathbf{i}x.&lt;/math&gt; ([[Idempotence]])

'''C7'''. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}(x \times y) = \mathbf{i}x \times \mathbf{i}y,&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''a''&amp;times;''b'' is the mereological product of ''a'' and ''b'', not defined when ''Oab'' is false. '''i''' distributes over product.

It can now be seen that '''i''' is [[isomorphic]] to the [[interior operator]] of [[topology]]. Hence the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of '''i''', the topological [[closure operator]] '''c''', can be defined in terms of '''i''', and [[Kuratowski]]'s axioms for '''c''' are theorems. Likewise, given an axiomatization of '''c''' that is analogous to '''C5-7''', '''i''' may be defined in terms of '''c''', and '''C5-7''' become theorems.  Adding '''C5-7''' to '''GEMT''' results in Casati and Varzi's preferred mereotopological theory, '''GEMTC'''.

''x'' is ''self-connected'' if it satisfies the following predicate:

&lt;math&gt; SCx \leftrightarrow ((Owx \leftrightarrow (Owy \lor Owz)) \rightarrow Cyz).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the primitive and defined predicates of '''MT''' alone suffice for this definition. The predicate ''SC'' enables formalizing the necessary condition given in [[A. N. Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Process and Reality]]'' for the mereological sum of two individuals to exist: they must be connected. Formally:

'''C8'''. &lt;math&gt; Cxy \rightarrow \exist z[SCz \land Ozx \land (Pwz \rightarrow (Owx \lor Owy)).&lt;/math&gt;

Given some mereotopology '''X''', adding '''C8''' to '''X'''  results in what Casati and Varzi call the ''Whiteheadian extension'' of '''X''', denoted '''WX'''. Hence the theory whose axioms are '''C1-8''' is '''WGEMTC'''.

The converse of '''C8''' is a '''GEMTC''' theorem. Hence given the axioms of '''GEMTC''', ''C'' is a defined predicate if ''O'' and ''SC'' are taken as primitive predicates.

If the underlying mereology is [[Atomic formula|atom]]less and weaker than '''GEM''', the axiom that assures the absence of atoms ('''P9''' in Casati and Varzi 1999) may be replaced by '''C9''', which postulates that no individual has a [[boundary (topology)|topological boundary]]:

'''C9'''. &lt;math&gt; \forall x \exist y[Pyx \land (Czy \rightarrow Ozx) \land \lnot (Pxy \land (Czx \rightarrow Ozy))].&lt;/math&gt;

When the domain consists of geometric figures, the boundaries can be points, curves, and surfaces. What boundaries could mean, given other ontologies, is not an easy matter and is discussed in Casati and Varzi (1999: chpt. 5).

In [[DC Comics]]' [[DC Universe]], a '''metahuman''' is a [[human]] with [[superpowers]]. The term is roughly synonymous with both ''[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]'' and ''[[mutate (comics)|mutate]]'' in the [[Marvel Universe]] and ''[[posthuman]]'' in the [[Wildstorm]] and [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universes. In DC Comics, the term is used loosely in most instances to refer to any human-like being with extranormal powers and abilities, be they cosmic, mutant, science, mystic, skill or tech in nature. A significant portion of these are normal human beings born with a genetic variant called the "metagene",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burlingame|first1=Russ|title=The Flash: What are Metahumans?|url=http://comicbook.com/2014/10/04/the-flash-what-are-metahumans-/|website=Comicbook.com|accessdate=23 July 2016|language=en|date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which causes them to gain powers and abilities during freak accidents or times of intense psychological distress.

The term as a referent to superheroes began in 1986 by author [[George R. R. Martin]], first in the ''[[Superworld]]'' role playing system, and then later in his ''[[Wild Cards]]'' series of novels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==DC Comics==
{{main article|Invasion! (DC Comics)}}
The term was first used by a fictitious race of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] known as the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]] when they appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''Invasion!'' mini-series. The Dominators use this term to refer to any human native of the planet [[Earth]] with "fictional superhuman abilities". The prefix "''meta-''" simply means "''beyond''", denoting persons and abilities beyond human limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meta-|title=the definition of meta-|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metahuman may also relate to an individual who has exceeded what is known as "The Current Potential", meaning one's ability to move matter with mind. (See [[Telekinesis]]).

===''Xenobrood''===
{{main article|Xenobrood}}
Before the White Martians arrived on Earth, Lord Vimana, the Vimanian overlord from the Xenobrood mini-series, claimed credit for the creation of the human race both normal and metahuman, due to their introduction of superpowered alien genetic matter into human [[germline]] [[dna|DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Xenobrood |issue=6 |date=April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vimanians in the series forced their super powered worker drones to mate with humanity's ancestors ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' (3 million years ago), and later ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.5 million years ago) in order to create a race of superpowered slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Xenobrood |issue=3-4 |date=January–February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Metagene===
The ''Invasion!'' mini-series provided a concept for why humans in the DC Universe would survive catastrophic events and develop superpowers. One of the Dominators discovered that select members of the human race had a "biological variant," which he called the meta-gene (also spelled "metagene"). This gene often lay dormant until an instant of extraordinary physical and emotional stress activates it. A "spontaneous chromosomal combustion" then takes place, as the metagene takes the source of the biostress – be it chemical, radioactive or whatever – and turns the potential catastrophe into a catalyst for "genetic change," resulting in metahuman abilities. It should also be noted that DC does not use the "metagene concept" as a solid editorial rule, and few writers explicitly reference the metagene when explaining a character's origin.

DC also has characters born with superhuman abilities, suggesting the metagene can activate spontaneously and without any prior appearance in the ancestry. One well-known example involves Dinah Laurel Lance, the second [[Black Canary]]. Although her mother (Dinah Drake Lance, the original Black Canary) was a superhero, neither she nor her husband Larry Lance were born with any known metagenes. However, Dinah Laurel ''was'' born with a metagene, the infamous ultrasonic scream known as the Canary Cry.

The prefix ''[[meta]]-'', in this context, simply means "beyond"&amp;mdash;as in ''[[metastable]]'', which is beyond regular stability and ready to collapse at the slightest disruption, or ''[[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]'', which is the state of going beyond a single shape. In the DC comic mini-series ''Invasion!'', the Dominators point out that the Meta-gene is contained inside every cell of the human body.

In the DC Comics universe, metahuman criminals are incarcerated in special metahuman prisons, like the prison built on Alcatraz Island, which is outfitted not only with provisions to hold criminals whose powers are [[science]] and [[technology]]-based, but even mystical dampeners to hold villains (including ''[[Homo Magi|Homo magi]]'') whose powers are [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] based. Prisoners in this facility are tagged with nanobyte tracers injected into their [[bloodstream]] that allow them to be located wherever they are.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12 (July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for individuals skilled in science and biology to manipulate, dampen or modify the activities of the metagene. During the [[Final Crisis]] while the Dominators were devised a ''Gene Bomb'' able to accelerate the metagene activity to the point of cellular and physical instabilities, an ''anti-metagene virus'' was spread as a last-ditch weapon in the invaded [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] quarters. This ''metavirus'' has the opposite effects of the Gene Bomb, curbing and shutting down the metagene and stripping the metahumans of their powers for an unspecified amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Resist'' Oneshot (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===White Martians===
{{main article|White Martian}}
The genetic potential for a future metagene was discovered in ancient [[Archaic humans|Homo sapien's]] DNA (500,000 - 250,000 years ago) by the White Martian race. The White Martians performed experiments on these primitive humans, changing how the metahuman [[phenotype]] was [[Gene expression|expressed]] by the metagene.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA'' #4 (April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Martian Manhunter'' (vol. 2) #25-27 (December 2000-February 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vulcan"&gt;''Son of Vulcan'' (vol.) 2 #5 (December 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their experiments, they altered the destiny of the human race. Whereas before, evolution would have eventually made mankind into a race of superhumans similar to the [[Daxamites]] and [[Kryptonians]], now only a select few humans would develop metahuman powers. As punishment for this, the group of renegades known as the '''[[Hyperclan]]''' was exiled to the ''Still Zone'', a version of the [[Phantom Zone]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Metavirus===
The White Martians also created a metavirus, a metagene that could be passed from host to host via touch. This metavirus was responsible for the empowerment of the very first [[Vulcan (DC Comics)|Son of Vulcan]]. From that time onwards, the Sons of Vulcan passed the metavirus down in an unbroken line, sworn to hunt and kill White Martians.&lt;ref name="vulcan"/&gt;

===Population===
The terms "meta" and "metahuman" do not refer only to humans born with biological variants. [[Superman]] and [[Martian Manhunter]] (aliens) as well as [[Wonder Woman]] (a near-goddess) and [[Aquaman]] (an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]]) are referred to in many instances as "metahumans." It can refer to anyone with extraordinary powers, no matter the origins and including those not born with such power. According to ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', roughly 1.3 million metahumans live on Earth, 99.5% of whom are considered "nuisance-level" (such as kids who can bend spoons with their mind and the old lady "who keeps hitting at [[Powerball]]"). The other 0.5% are what [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] and the [[One-Man Army Corps|OMACs]] consider alpha, beta and gamma level threats. For example, [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] are categorized as alpha level, while [[Metamorpho]] is considered a beta level and [[Ratcatcher (comics)|Ratcatcher]] is considered a gamma level.

===Exo-gene===
The ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' mini-series introduced a toxic mutagen called the Exo-gene (also referred to as the Exogene). It is a toxic [[gene therapy]] treatment created by [[LexCorp]] for the [[Everyman Project]] which creates metahuman abilities in compatible non-metahumans. It first appeared in ''52'' #4 with the first announcement of the Everyman Project in ''52'' #8. The project was controversial, creating unstable heroes that gave Luthor an "off switch" for their powers, creating countless mid-flight deaths.

===Amalgam===
In the short-lived DC/[[Marvel Comics]] crossover "[[Amalgam Comics]]" event, in the ''JLX'' series (combining ''[[Justice League]]'' and Marvel's ''[[X-Men]]''), metahumans are replaced with metamutants (a portmanteau of metahumans and Marvel's [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]) who are said to carry a 'metamutant gene'.

==Television==

===DC animated universe===
In [[DC animated universe|animated versions of the DC universe]], the term metahuman is used in the animated series ''[[Static Shock]]''.

===''Birds of Prey''===
On the television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', metahumans included heroines [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] and [[Black Canary|Dinah Lance]]. New Gotham has a thriving metahuman underground, mostly made of metahumans who are trying to live their own lives, although a self-hating metahuman, Claude Morton ([[Joe Flanigan]]), tries to convince the police that all metahumans are evil. In ''Birds of Prey'', metahumans are treated seemingly as a race or species; the Huntress is described as being "half-metahuman" on her mother's side.

===''Smallville''===
On the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', metahumans can occur naturally. However, the majority are the result of exposure to [[Kryptonite in Smallville|kryptonite]], which in the ''Smallville'' universe can turn people into superpowered "'''meteor freaks'''", often with psychotic side effects. For many seasons of ''Smallville'', all superpowered people other than Kryptonians were so-called meteor freaks, but as the show went on it began to explore further corners of the DC universe. Non-kryptonite metahumans include the ''Smallville'' versions of [[Aquaman]], [[Bart Allen|the Flash]], [[Black Canary]], and [[Zatanna]].

===''Young Justice''===
On the animated series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', the alien antagonists known as the Kroloteans have frequently used the term and have even researched into the discovery of a "metagene" by abducting and testing on random humans. The alien [[Reach (comics)|reach]] conduct similar experiments and kidnap a cadre of teen runaways to test for the metagene, leading several of these individuals to develop superpowers. In the episode "Runaways," a [[STAR Labs|S.T.A.R. Labs]] scientist surmises that the gene is "opportunistic" in as much as it causes its user to develop powers seemingly based on their personal experiences or surroundings.

===Arrowverse===
In the [[Arrowverse]] family of live-action shows, "metahuman" is used more narrowly than in comics, typically referring to a human being who has powers, often acquired following some kind of accident.
* In the 2014 television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', Dr. [[Harrison Wells]] and his team at Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Laboratories (S.T.A.R. Labs) developed an advanced particle accelerator in Central City. When it was activated, the device went critical and exploded, releasing a variety of theoretical elements such as dark matter and negative energy. Many Central City residents who were affected by the blast wave were genetically altered by the dark matter, granting them superhuman abilities. People with such abilities are called "metahumans," coined by Wells and his staff. The nature of a metahuman's powers appear to be a result of an external element that they were near or exposed to when hit by the blast. Eventually, under Harrison Wells and Cisco Ramon, S.T.A.R. Labs develops effective metahuman-power dampening technology and prison to confine metahumans. Over the course of the series, many more metahuman villains appear, including some from alternate universes or timelines and others who have no connection to the particle accelerator accident. In season three, S.T.A.R. Labs uses metahuman-detecting [[application software|apps]] to alert the Flash's team to attacks; this technology is later used by city police and government agencies. In season five, Team Flash discovers meta-technology has created following their battle with the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], resulting that any dark matter-powered device such as a [[smartphone]] can be used by anyone to utilize the power of a metahuman. 
* After ''The Flash'' established the existence of metahumans, its sister series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' began to feature them, beginning with the arrival of metahuman villain [[Deathbolt]] in Starling City (later changed to Star City); the team learns that Deathbolt's powers were not derived from the particle accelerator blast, revealing the existence of metahumans from other means, including S.T.A.R. Labs' scientist [[Killer Frost#Arrowverse|Caitlin Snow (Killer Frost)]], who is already a metahuman since childhood long before her dark matter exposure. Later on, the metahuman [[List of Flash enemies|Double Down]] arrives in Star City to kill the [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Green Arrow]] and his teammates under the employment of the mystic [[Damien Darhk]], though he fails to do so. Magical characters such as Darhk, [[John Constantine|Constantine]], and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] recur in subsequent episodes, as well as occasional metahuman threats. 
* ''Arrow'' and ''Flash'' spin-off ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' features numerous metahumans, including [[Hawkman]], [[Hawkgirl]], and [[Vandal Savage]] (introduced in [[Heroes Join Forces|an ''Arrow''/''Flash'' crossover]]), as well as characters from other Arrowverse shows. Later seasons introduce versions of Vixen, [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], and [[Commander_Steel#Nathan_Heywood|Steel]]. 
* The television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' is set in a parallel universe to [[Arrowverse|that of ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'']], in which a variant of Earth where [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] resides is later coined as Earth-38 by [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]]. Humanity is aware of superpowered [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] such as Supergirl, her cousin [[Superman]], and [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]], but the existence of metahumans is not widely known on Earth-38 until the first season's episode "[[Worlds Finest]]," a crossover with ''The Flash''. In this episode, the [[Silver Banshee]] and [[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]] publicly battle Supergirl and the Flash, revealing the case of human-derived beings with uncanny abilities in the process. Silver Banshee's powers are mystical in origin and nature, while Livewire's are from an anomalous mutagenic accident. Since the inhabitants of Supergirl's Earth have no experience with metahuman threats, the Flash provides [[National City (DC Comics)|National City]]'s authorities with the means to combat and contain them before returning to his universe. Later, in season two's episode "[[We Can Be Heroes (Supergirl)|We Can Be Heroes]]", shows that a prison facility at National City is using the Flash's world's (Earth-1) metahuman-power dampeners to restrain its superhuman prisoners; the technology is later used by [[Department of Extranormal Operations]] (DEO) and eventually they align with Earth-1's S.T.A.R. Labs. Human criminals begin experimenting on metahumans in hopes of acquiring powers for themselves, of which three metahumans were created with Livewire's powers. In season three, more metahumans begin to appear, including [[Psi (comics)|Psi]], whose powers surface following her maturity.

===''Gotham''===
In the television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', Professor Hugo Strange experiments with dead (and alive) bodies of criminals, Arkham Asylum patients, and civilians under the orders of the Court of Owls. There, Strange gives his victims superhuman abilities such as shapeshifting ([[Clayface]]), mind control (Fish Mooney) and super strength ([[Azrael (DC Comics)|Azrael]]). By the end of Season 2, Strange's victims escape and wreak havoc over the city. Throughout the series, the metahumans are commonly referred to as Strange's Monsters, simply Monsters (an allusion to Batman &amp; the Monster Men), or the Freaks from Indian Hill.

===''Black Lightning''===
In the television series ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'', [[Black Lightning|Jefferson Pierce / Black Lightning]] and his daughters [[Thunder (comics)|Anissa]] and [[Lightning (DC Comics)|Jennifer]] are metahumans. The A.S.A. are tracking young metahumans with abilities. As the series progresses, it is revealed that decades ago, because of the city of Freeland's prevailing racial and political conflicts, the A.S.A. developed a substance supposedly as a suppressant to turn its citizens docile in the interest of controlling them but failed. Instead, it turned out to be a [[mutagen]] which transforms some of its citizens into metahumans, including Jefferson Pierce and his daughters who inherited his metagene after his fatherhood. Under Martin Procter, the agency illegally developed an addictive derivative of the drug called Green Light, which is distributed as a [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]] in hopes to create more metahumans for Procter's agendas. Because the metahumans are dying from unstable mutations, Procter seeks to capture Black Lightning and his offspring because they are the only known stable specimens of the agency's drug. After Procter's death, the A.S.A.'s experiments are exposed and Freeland's metahumans' origin has become a public knowledge. However, it ignites an anti-metahuman bigotry amongst the people in Freeland.

==Film==

===DC Extended Universe===
*In ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', Lex Luthor is stated to be a supporter of the "metahuman thesis." Secretly, he is already conducting studies on them, with particular interest on Wonder Woman, the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg, all of whom he classifies as metahumans.
*Also, metahumans appear in the movie ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' as Amanda Waller talks about their abilities when forming the squad. El Diablo, Killer Croc and Enchantress appear in the film.

'''My Boyfriend Came Back From the War''' is a browser-based [[internet art]]work created in 1996 by Russian artist [[Olia Lialina]].&lt;ref name="MBCBFTW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://myboyfriendcamebackfromth.ewar.ru/ | title=My Boyfriend Came Back From the War | publisher=Olia Lialina | accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Work ==
''My Boyfriend Came Back From the War'' is an example of [[interactive art|interactive]] [[hypertext]] storytelling. The work consists of nested [[Framing (World Wide Web)|frames]] with black and white web pages and (sometimes animated) grainy [[GIF]] images. When clicking [[hyperlink]]s in the work, the frame splits into smaller frames and the user reveals a [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] story about a couple that is reunited after a nameless [[military conflict]].  The lovers find it difficult to reconnect; the woman confesses that she has had an [[affair]] with a neighbour while the returned soldier proposes marriage. The story unfolds to the point where the screen has become a [[mosaic]] of empty black frames.

Olia Lialina calls the work a ''netfilm'', because of its similarity with [[cinematic techniques|cinematic]] narrative. The grainy black-and-white images and [[intertitles]] refer to early silent movies.&lt;ref name="Tribe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/MarkTribe/Olia+Lialina|title=Mark Tribes teaching wiki: Olia Lialina|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of its filmic qualities, curator Michael Connor wrote of the work, "the work adapts cinematic montage to the web ... separate frames are joined together by HTML code and the browser itself and experienced in both space and in time, employing what [[Lev Manovich]] has characterized as spatial and temporal montage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2016/nov/10/my-boyfriend-came-back-from-the-war/|title=Speaking in Net Language: My Boyfriend Came Back from the War|work=Rhizome|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remixes==

Starting in 1998, ''My Boyfriend Came Back From the War'' was remixed and adapted by a number of artists. Some examples of these adaptations include [[Jodi (art collective)|JODI]]'s [[Wolfenstein 3D|Wolfenstein]] mod and [[Marton Fernezelyi]]'s video adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c3.hu/~marci/olia/ Video Adaptation of ''My Boyfriend Came Back From the War'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and Exhibitions ==
''My Boyfriend Came Back From the War'' is recognized a seminal internet artwork; art critic Josephine Bosma has called it "one of the most influential net art pieces of the mid nineties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.josephinebosma.com/web/node/112|title=Olia Lialina - 20 Years of My Boyfriend Came Back From The War {{!}} Josephine Bosma|website=www.josephinebosma.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is included in various college syllabi, including the [[University of Maryland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~mgk/courses/spring2003/668/syllabus.html University of Maryland Syllabus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ecuad.ca/~harmen/classschedule.html Emily Carr University Syllabus]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucsc.edu/~lkelley/classes/fdm20c_spring/20c_spring.pdf UC Santa Cruz Syllabus]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">In mathematics, a '''nearly Kähler manifold''' is an [[almost Hermitian manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with [[almost complex structure]] &lt;math&gt; J&lt;/math&gt;,
such that the (2,1)-tensor &lt;math&gt;\nabla J &lt;/math&gt; is [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]]. So,

:&lt;math&gt; (\nabla_X J)X =0 &lt;/math&gt;

for every vector field &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, a [[Kähler manifold]] is nearly Kähler. The converse is not true. 
For example, the nearly Kähler six-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^6&lt;/math&gt; is an example of a nearly Kähler manifold that is not Kähler.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title=Handbook of Differential Geometry| volume =II |ISBN =978-0-444-82240-6
|editors=Franki Dillen and Leopold Verstraelen
|publisher=[[North Holland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The familiar almost complex structure on the six-sphere is not induced by a complex atlas on &lt;math&gt;S^6&lt;/math&gt;.
Usually, non Kählerian nearly Kähler manifolds are called "strict nearly Kähler manifolds".

Nearly Kähler manifolds, also known as almost Tachibana manifolds, were studied by Shun-ichi Tachibana in 1959&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|first=Bang-Yen|last=Chen|title=Pseudo-Riemannian geometry, [delta]-invariants and applications|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|year=2011|isbn=978-981-4329-63-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then by [[Alfred Gray (mathematician)|Alfred Gray]] from 1970 on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|
title=Nearly Kähler manifolds|
journal=J.Diff.Geometry|volume= 4 |year=1970 |pages=283-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, it was proved that any 6-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifold is an [[Einstein manifold]] and has vanishing first Chern class
(in particular, this implies spin). 
In the 1980s, strict nearly Kähler manifolds obtained a lot of consideration because of their relation to [[Killing spinor|Killing
spinors]]: [[Thomas Friedrich (Mathematiker)|Thomas Friedrich]] and Ralf Grunewald showed that a 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold admits
a Riemannian Killing spinor if and only if it is nearly Kähler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|
last=Friedrich |first=Thomas |last2=Grunewald |first2=Ralf|
title=On the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator on 6-dimensional manifolds|
journal=Ann. Global Anal. Geom. |volume=3 |year=1985 |pages=265-273}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later given a more fundamental  explanation &lt;ref&gt;B&amp;auml;r, Christian (1993) Real Killing spinors and holonomy. Comm. Math. Phys. 154, 509–521. &lt;/ref&gt; by Christian B&amp;auml;r, who pointed out  that
these  are exactly the 6-manifolds for which the corresponding 7-dimensional Riemannian cone has holonomy G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 

The only compact 6-manifolds known to admit strict nearly Kähler metrics are &lt;math&gt;S^6,\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^3, \mathbb{P}(T\mathbb{CP}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S^3\times S^3&lt;/math&gt;. Each of these admits such a unique nearly K&amp;auml;hler metric that is also homogeneous, and these examples are in fact  the only compact  homogeneous strictly nearly Kähler 6-manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|
author=Butruille, Jean-Baptiste|
title= Classification of homogeneous nearly Kähler manifolds|
journal=Ann. Global Anal. Geom. |volume=27 |year=2005 |pages=201-225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Foscolo and Haskins recently showed that &lt;math&gt;S^6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^3\times S^3&lt;/math&gt;  also admit strict nearly Kähler metrics that are not homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| author = Foscolo, Lorenzo and Haskins, Mark | title = New G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-holonomy cones and exotic nearly Kähler structures on S&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; x S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; | journal = Ann. of Math. |series =  2 | volume = 185| year = 2017|number = 1 | pages = 59--130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

B&amp;auml;r's observation about the  holonomy of Riemannian cones might seem to indicate that the nearly-Kähler condition is 
most natural and interesting in dimension 6.  This actually borne out by a theorem of  Nagy, who proved that any strict,  complete nearly Kähler manifold is locally a Riemannian product of homogeneous nearly Kähler spaces, twistor spaces over quaternion-Kähler manifolds, and 6-dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|
author=Nagy, Paul-Andi|
title=Nearly Kähler geometry and Riemannian foliations|
journal=Asian J. Math. |volume=6 |year=2002 |pages=481-504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly Kähler manifolds are also an interesting class of manifolds admitting a metric connection with
parallel totally antisymmetric torsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|
last=Agricola|first= Ilka|authorlink= Ilka Agricola |
title=The Srni lectures on non-integrable geometries with torsion|
journal=Archivum Mathematicum |year=2006|volume=42 |issue=5|pages=5–84|arxiv=math/0606705|bibcode=2006math......6705A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly Kähler manifolds should not be confused with  [[almost Kähler manifold|almost Kähler manifolds]].
An almost Kähler manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an almost Hermitian manifold with a closed [[Kähler manifold|Kähler form]]:
&lt;math&gt;d\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The Kähler form or fundamental 2-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the metric on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The  nearly Kähler condition and the almost Kähler condition are essentially exclusive: an almost Hermitian manifold is both nearly Kähler and almost Kahler if and only if it is Kähler.

The '''Northwest Territorial Imperative''' (often shortened to the '''Northwest Imperative'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/portland-murder-suspect-appears-unlinked-northwest-s-racist-groups-n765681&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[white separatist]] idea popularized since the 1980s within [[white nationalist]] and [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] groups in the [[United States]]. According to it, adherents of these groups are encouraged to relocate to a five-state region of the [[Northwestern United States]] — ''[[viz.]]'', [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Western Montana]] (or the western part at least to [[Interstate 15]]). [[Northern California]], [[Northwestern Colorado]], [[Northern Utah]], [[Alaska]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]] are sometimes also included. The intent is to eventually declare the region an [[Aryan race|Aryan]] homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=140|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|title=White Rage: The Extreme Right and American Politics|author=Martin Durham|isbn=0415362334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PC power management''' refers to the mechanism for controlling the power use of [[personal computer hardware]].  This is typically through the use of software that puts the hardware into the lowest power demand state available.  It is an aspect of [[Green computing]].

A typical office PC might use on the order of 90 watts when active (approximately 50 watts for the base unit, and 40 watts for a typical LCD screen); and three to four watts when ‘asleep’. Up to 10% of a modern office’s electricity demand might be due to PCs and monitors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sleepless of Seattle; Why Windows Power Management Doesn't Always Work, Mark Blackburn, Strategy Analyst, 1E, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some PCs allow low power settings, there are many situations, especially in a networked environment, where processes running on the computer will prevent the low power settings from taking effect.  This can have a dramatic effect on energy use that is invisible to the user. The monitor may have gone into standby mode, and the PC may appear to be idle, but operational testing has shown that on any given day an average of over 50% of an organisation's computers would fail to go to sleep, and over time this happened to over 90% of the machines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Windows 'Insomnia' (Sleepless PCs) ==
The Windows power management system is based upon an idle timer. If the computer is idle for longer than the preset timeout then the PC may be configured to sleep or hibernate. The user may configure the timeout using the Control Panel. Windows uses a combination of user activity and CPU activity to determine when the computer is idle.

Applications can temporarily inhibit this timer by using the ''SetThreadExecutionState'' API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa373208(VS.85).aspx |title= SetThreadExecutionState Function |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate reasons why this may be necessary such as burning a DVD or playing a video. However, in many cases applications can unnecessarily prevent power management from working. This is commonly known as Windows 'Insomnia' and can be a significant barrier to successfully implementing power management.

Common causes of 'insomnia' include:

* Legacy or non-power management aware applications
* Open file handles on remote computers
* Faulty mice which can cause pointer drift. This makes the operating system believe that a user is present
* Scheduled maintenance tasks causing significant CPU activity
* High network activity

== Software solutions ==
Operating systems have built-in settings to control power use.  [[Microsoft Windows]] supports predefined power plans and custom [[Sleep mode|sleep]] and [[hibernation (computing)|hibernation]] settings through a [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] Power Options applet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-create-delete-power-plan-scheme#1TC=windows-7 |title= Windows 10 help|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's [[OS X]] includes idle and sleep configuration settings through the Energy Saver [[System Preferences]] applet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201714 | title= Use the Energy Saver settings on your Mac|publisher=Apple|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Linux distribution]]s include a variety of power management settings and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management | title= Power management|publisher=ArchLinux|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant market in third-party [[Comparison of power management software suites|PC power management software]] offering features beyond those present in the Windows operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/buyers-guide/Power-Management-Software-for-Windows-Workstations-Buyers-Guide.aspx|title=Power Management Software for Windows Workstations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|title=Energy Star Commercial Packages List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|author=The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|title=HMC: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Building for Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315230900/http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products are targeted at enterprise environments offering [[Active Directory]] integration and per-user/per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans, scheduled power plans, anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting.

The '''Petter Chamor''' ({{lang-he|פטר חמור}}) or '''Redemption of the firstborn donkey''', is a [[mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]] in which a male firstborn ([[Firstborn (Judaism)|bechor]]) [[donkey]] is redeemed by the owner of the donkey, who gives a [[sheep|lamb]] or [[goat|kid]] to a [[Kohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/44853/ |title=Petter Chamor &amp;ndash; Redeeming A Donkey |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2011 |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rabbi Gershon |work=[[The Jewish Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228044820/http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/44853/ |archivedate=December 28, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lamb is not required to be firstborn. 
  
The mitzvah, albeit rare in modern times, is listed as an "obligation of the body" &lt;ref&gt;("chovath haguf" vs. "chovath hakarka" -an obligation required solely on one of the [[land of Israel]])&lt;/ref&gt; and thus mandatory for diasporic Jewry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12384">'''[[Queer]] [[pornography]]''' depicts performers with various [[gender]] identities and [[sexual orientation]]s interacting and exploring genres of desire and pleasure in unique ways. These conveyed interactions distinctively seek to challenge the conventional modes of portraying and experiencing sexually explicit content.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koller|first=Veronika|date=2015-01-01|title=The subversive potential of queer pornography: A systemic-functional analysis of a written online text|journal=Journal of Language and Sexuality|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=254–271|doi=10.1075/jls.4.2.04kol|issn=2211-3770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Ingrid Ryberg additionally includes two main objectives of queer pornography in her definition as "interrogating and troubling gender and sexual categories and aiming at sexual arousal."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingrid|first=Ryberg,|date=2012-01-01|title=Imagining Safe Space : The Politics of Queer, Feminist and Lesbian Pornography|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:477159|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer porn works to have authentic representations with respect to the [[sexual orientation]]s, [[gender identities]] and [[desire]]s of the performers in it.&lt;ref name="seise"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seise|first=Cherie|date=April 2010|year=|title=Fucking Utopia: Queer Porn and Queer Liberation|url=http://freireproject.org/wp-content/journals/sprinkle/Sprinkle_vol3.pdf|journal=Sprinkle: A Journal of Sexual Diversity Studies|volume=3|pages=19–29|via=|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[heterosexual]] pornography, [[gay pornography]], or [[lesbian pornography]], because queer porn will often be a partnering of performers outside traditional pornographic categories.&lt;ref name="seise" /&gt; Gay porn falls into a similar situation as heterosexual porn by putting an emphasis on androcentric imagery of pleasure, as scholar [[Richard Dyer]] argues, and often glorifies the homonormative, masculine body-type and behavior. To appear as inclusive, gay porn will exotify differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Columbia Reader: On lesbians and gay men in media, society, and politics|last=Dyer|first=Richard|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=|editor-last=Gross|editor-first=Larry|location=New York|pages=479–485|chapter=Coming to Terms: Gay Pornography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers' bodies in queer pornography are key to providing a difference between it and other categories of pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Katrien, Marije Janssen, and matteo Pasquinelli. ''C’lickme : A Netporn Studies Reader''. Amsterdam: Institute of Network Cultures, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[DVD]] may have one scene which shows a [[transgender lesbian]] with a [[cisgender]] femme-identified queer woman, while the next scene may showcase two transgender queer-identified men.&lt;ref name="seise" /&gt;

The genre of queer pornography as defined above is relatively recent and has been popularized and distributed by adult film companies such as [[Pink and White Productions]], Trouble Films, Real Queer Productions among others. While porn is not limited to adult cinema and can exist in the context of a variety of media such as queer written pornography, the currently produced queer porn is mostly in the form of video.

Some prominent queer producers include [[Shine Louise Houston]], Chelsea Poe, and [[April Flores]] who attempt to challenge the filming methods within the [[porn industry]].  Typically within the Porn Industry, the producer and director have the majority of control over how each scene will be performed, who is showcased in each set, and creating a differential of performers’ salaries based on their popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKee|first=Alan|date=2016-04-02|title=Pornography as a creative industry: challenging the exceptionalist approach to pornography|journal=Porn Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=107–119|doi=10.1080/23268743.2015.1065202|issn=2326-8743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer pornography counters these practices by actively engaging performers in the creations of scenes allowing them to form more organically as a collaboration with a more horizontal access of control rather than a hierarchically vertical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goldengatexpress.org/2015/10/20/the-underside-of-the-porn-industry/|title=The underside of the porn industry|last=Wright|first=Cody|date=2015-10-20|website=Golden Gate Xpress|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dar-dowling/shine-louise-houston-jiz-_b_7595976.html|title=Shine Louise Houston &amp; Jiz Lee: Crowdfunding Queer Porn Their Way.…|last=Dowling|first=Dar|date=2015-06-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer porn similarly celebrates ejaculation but with some signification differences to conventional porn. Unlike in the mainstream industry, the performer does not have a financial bonus for providing such a "money shot." Directors only encourage performers to perform an orgasm if/when the actors feel like it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the [[money shot]] in conventional porn relies of visibility for the camera, it necessarily centers on showing external ejaculation of the penis as the ultimate climax. This reflects attention back to the male centered gaze and a representative instance of phallic power and pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/838864947|title=Hard core : power, pleasure, and the "frenzy of the visible"|last=Linda|first=Williams,|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520219434|oclc=838864947|date=1999-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer porn attempts to broaden such a delineation of phallic centered climax and the pornographic production.

== Discourses on Queer Pornography ==
Queer Pornography has been attracting academic attention since the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pinkwhite.biz/PWWP/superfreaky-queerness-feminism-and-aesthetics-in-queer-pornography/|title=Superfreaky: Queerness, Feminism, and Aesthetics in Queer Pornography {{!}} Pink &amp; White Productions|website=pinkwhite.biz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963852414|title=The feminist porn book : the politics of producing pleasure|last=Tristan.|first=Taormino,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=9781558618183|oclc=963852414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/942285669|title=Porn.com : making sense of online pornography|last=Feona.|first=Attwood,|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433102073|oclc=942285669}}&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge within queer pornography is that some labeled queer porn may depict scenarios that could be part of any [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]  mainstream pornographic film. This follows academic Niels van Doorn’s concept of the “pornoscript,” eroticizing heterosexual difference and focusing on the male subject position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Doorn|first=Niels|date=2010-11-01|title=Keeping it Real: User-Generated Pornography, Gender Reification, and Visual Pleasure|journal=Convergence|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=411–430|doi=10.1177/1354856510375144|issn=1354-8565}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a scene from Real Queer Productions’s ''Fluid'' depicts a threesome with elements of submissions and dominance, rough vaginal and anal penetration, and external male ejaculation. The film’s adherence to the pornographic conventions is predictable and serialized. However, further inspection into queer porn that appears like [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]]  pornography reveals particular parody of serial strategy to expose [[Gender Construction|gender construction]] within most conventional pornography.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880439054|title=Pornography and seriality : the culture of producing pleasure|last=1983-|first=Schaschek, Sarah,|isbn=9781137363121|oclc=880439054}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process creates a queer version of the model of "subversive repetition" theorized by academic [[Judith Butler]].  Drawing particular attention to such a facet through imitation permits its productive act of deconstruction. Thus, queer pornography can disassemble the pornographic norm by mimicking it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, queer pornography clearly reveals the imitative process of gender identification when introducing the figure of the transgender man. Compared to trans woman(male-to-female) individuals depicted across other types of pornography, female-to-male [[Trans man|trans men]] appear significantly in [[Feminist pornography|feminist]] and queer pornography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Films of queer pornography make "deviant" sexualities more visible by simultaneously starting a process of their [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]]. So, in order to avoid creating a new kind of norm, queer pornography constantly works along the edge of the [[Gender systems|gender system]]. For example, when strap-on dildos made their appearance in queer pornography leaving viewers guessing whether they were faced with a "real" penis or a dildo, they soon became a common sight. While these strap-on dildos originally offered new ways of thinking about gender and sexuality, their ubiquitous use risked losing their subversive power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As scholar Sarah Schaschek writes, “If heterosexual pornography accentuates clearly defined identity categories such as class, age, ethnicity, sexuality, or gender, queer films tend to reveal the high degree of stylization behind these identities”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Romance''' is an [[Emotion|emotional]] [[Feeling#Emotion work|feeling]] of [[love]] for, or a [[Interpersonal attraction|strong attraction]] towards, [[Other (philosophy)|another]] [[person]], and the [[Courtship|courtship behaviors]] undertaken by an individual to express those overall feelings and resultant emotions.

Although the [[Psychophysiology|emotions and sensations]] of ''romantic love'' are widely associated with [[sexual attraction]], romantic feelings can exist without expectation of [[Consummation|physical consummation]] and be subsequently expressed. [[History|Historically]], the [[Terminology|term]] ''romance'' originates with the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[chivalry]] as set out in the literature of [[chivalric romance]].

== General definitions ==
Romantic love is a [[Relativism|relative]] term{{when defined as|date=September 2018}} that distinguishes moments and situations within [[intimate relationship]]s as contributing to a deepened relational connection.
#The addition of [[Melodrama|"drama"]] to {{clarify span|text=relationships of close, deep and strong love|reason=at least four potential weasel-terms there; please improve|date=April 2018}}.
#Anthropologist [[Charles Lindholm]] defined love as "an intense attraction that involves the idealization of the other, within an erotic context, with expectation of enduring sometime into the future".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. J. (2001). Romance, parenthood, and gender in a modern African society. ''Ethnology'', 129-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical usage ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
The word "romance" comes from the French [[vernacular]] where initially it indicated a [[Narrative poetry|verse narrative]].  The word was originally an adverb of Latin origin, "romanicus," meaning "of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] style". European medieval vernacular tales, [[Epic poetry|epics]], and [[Ballad|ballads]] generally dealt with chivalric adventure, not bringing in the concept of [[love]] until late into the seventeenth century.

The word ''romance'' developed other meanings, such as the early nineteenth century Spanish and Italian definitions of "adventurous" and "passionate," which could intimate both "love affair" and "idealistic quality."

[[File:Codex Manesse Bernger von Horheim.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bernger von Horheim]] in the ''Codex Manesse'' (early 14th century)]]
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] show that there were complex forms of courtship in ancient as well as contemporary primitive societies. There may not be evidence, however, that members of such societies formed loving relationships distinct from their established customs in a way that would parallel modern romance.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss pioneered the scientific study of the betrothal of cross cousins in such societies, as a way of solving such technical problems as the [[avunculate]] and the [[incest taboo]] (''Introducing Lévi-Strauss''), pp. 22–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 18th century, many marriages were not arranged, but rather developed out of more or less spontaneous relationships. After the 18th century, illicit relationships took on a more independent role. In bourgeois marriage, illicitness may have become more formidable and likely to cause tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordan dayal wiki|url=http://nordan.daynal.org/wiki/index.php?title=Romance|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ladies of the Leisure Class'', [[Rutgers University]] professor Bonnie G. Smith depicts courtship and marriage rituals that may be viewed as oppressive to modern people. She writes "When the young women of the Nord married, they did so without illusions of love and romance. They acted within a framework of concern for the reproduction of bloodlines according to financial, professional, and sometimes political interests." Subsequent [[sexual revolution]] has lessened the conflicts arising out of liberalism, but not eliminated them.

[[Anthony Giddens]], in his book ''The Transformation of Intimacy: Sexuality, Love and Eroticism in Modern Society'', states that romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual's life. He adds that telling a story was one of the meanings of romance. According to Giddens, the rise of romantic love more or less coincided with the emergence of the [[novel]]. It was then that romantic love, associated with freedom and therefore the ideals of romantic love, created the ties between freedom and [[self-realization]].

David R. Shumway, in his book ''Romance, Intimacy, and The Marriage Crisis'', states that the discourse of intimacy emerged in the last third of the 20th century and that this discourse claimed to be able to explain how marriage and other relationships worked. For the discourse of intimacy emotional closeness was much more important than [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. This does not mean by any means that intimacy is to replace romance. On the contrary, intimacy and romance coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KdVa73vN1BgC&amp;dq=modern+love+by+David+R.+Shumway&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Romance, Intimacy, and The Marriage Crisis|accessdate= 2010-07-08|isbn=978-0-8147-9831-7|author1=Shumway, David R|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century has seen the growth of [[globalization]] and people now live in a world of transformations that affect almost every aspect of our lives, and love has not been the exception. One example of the changes experienced in relationships was explored by Giddens regarding [[homosexual]] relationships. According to Giddens since homosexuals were not able to marry they were forced to pioneer more open and negotiated relationships. These kinds of relationships then permeated the heterosexual population.

Shumway also states that together with the growth of [[capitalism]] the older social relations dissolved, including marriage. Marriage meaning for women changed as they had more socially acceptable alternatives and were less willing to accept unhappy relations and, therefore, divorce rates substantially increased.

The discourse of romance continues to exist today together with intimacy. Shumway states that on the one hand, romance is the part that offers [[adventure]] and intense emotions while offering the possibility to find the perfect mate. On the other hand, intimacy offers deep communication, [[friendship]], and long lasting sharing.

=== Popularization of love ===
The conception of romantic love was popularized in [[Western culture]] by the concept of [[courtly love]]. [[Knight|Chevaliers]], or knights in the [[Middle Ages]], engaged in what were usually non-physical and non-marital relationships with women of nobility whom they served. These relations were highly elaborate and ritualized in a complexity that was steeped in a framework of tradition, which stemmed from theories of etiquette derived out of [[chivalry]] as a moral code of conduct.

Courtly love and the notion of [[domnei]] were often the subjects of [[troubadours]], and could be typically found in artistic endeavors such as lyrical narratives and poetic prose of the time. Since [[marriage]] was commonly nothing more than a formal arrangement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/courtly-love.htm Middle Ages.com - Courtly Love]&lt;/ref&gt; courtly love sometimes permitted expressions of emotional closeness that may have been lacking from the union between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/medieval/love.html Courtly Love and the origins of romance]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of courtly love, "lovers" did not necessarily refer to those engaging in [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] acts, but rather, to the act of caring and to emotional intimacy.

The bond between a knight and his [[Lady]], or the woman of typically high stature of whom he served, may have escalated psychologically but seldom ever physically.&lt;ref name="employees.oneonta.edu"&gt;[http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/ARTH/arth214_folder/courtly_love_.html A History of Women: Silences of the Middle Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[knighthood]] during the Middle Ages, the intrinsic importance of a code of conduct was in large part as a value system of rules codified as a guide to aid a knight in his capacity as champion of the downtrodden, but especially in his service to the Lord.

In the context of dutiful service to a woman of high social standing, ethics designated as a code were effectively established as an institution to provide a firm moral foundation by which to combat the idea that unfit attentions and affections were to ever be tolerated as "a secret game of trysts" behind closed doors. Therefore, a knight trained in the substance of "chivalry" was instructed, with especial emphasis, to serve a lady most honorably, with purity of heart and mind. To that end, he committed himself to the welfare of both Lord and Lady with unwavering discipline and devotion, while at the same time, presuming to uphold core principles set forth in the code by the religion by which he followed.&lt;ref name="employees.oneonta.edu"/&gt;

Religious meditations upon the [[Virgin Mary]] were partially responsible for the development of chivalry as an ethic and lifestyle:  the concept of the honor of a lady and knightly devotion to her, coupled with an obligatory respect for all women, factored prominently as central to the very identity of medieval knighthood. As knights were increasingly emulated, eventual changes were reflected in the inner-workings of [[feudal]] society. Members of the [[aristocracy]] were schooled in the principles of chivalry, which facilitated important changes in attitudes regarding the value of women.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1994 {{ISBN|0-8028-3783-2}} page 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, a knight was to regard himself towards a lady with a transcendence of premeditated thought—his virtue ingrained within his character. A [[Knight|chevalier]] was to conduct himself always graciously, bestowing upon her the utmost courtesy and attentiveness. He was to echo shades of this to all women, regardless of class, age, or status.&lt;ref name=sweeney&gt;[[James Ross Sweeney]] (1983). "Chivalry", in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', Volume III.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the concept of chivalry and the notion of the courtly [[gentleman]] became synonymous with the ideal of how love and romance should exist between the sexes. Through the timeless popularization in art and literature of tales of knights and princesses, kings and queens, a formative and long standing (sub)consciousness helped to shape relationships between men and women.

[[De amore (Andreas Capellanus)|De amore]] or ''The Art of Courtly Love'', as it is known in English, was written in the 12th century. The text is widely misread as permissive of extramarital affairs. However, it is useful to differentiate the physical from without: romantic love as separate and apart from [[courtly love]] when interpreting such topics as: "Marriage is no real excuse for not loving", "He who is not jealous cannot love", "No one can be bound by a double love", and "When made public love rarely endures".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.umd.edu/~marshall/chivalry.html The Art of Courtly Love by Andreas Capellanus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123205411/http://www.astro.umd.edu/~marshall/chivalry.html |date=2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that romantic love evolved independently in multiple cultures. For example, in an article presented by Henry Grunebaum, he argues "[[Psychotherapy|therapists]] mistakenly believe that romantic love is a [[phenomenon]] unique to Western cultures and first expressed by the troubadours of the Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.1997.tb01037.x | volume=23 | title=THINKING ABOUT ROMANTIC/EROTIC LOVE | year=1997 | journal=Journal of Marital and Family Therapy | pages=295–307 | last1 = Grunebaum | first1 = Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more current and Western traditional terminology meaning "court as lover" or the general idea of "romantic love" is believed to have originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily from that of the French culture. This idea is what has spurred the connection between the words "romantic" and "lover", thus [[neologism|coining]] English phrases for romantic love such as "loving like the Romans do". The precise origins of such a connection are unknown, however. Although the word "romance" or the equivalents thereof may not have the same connotation in other cultures, the general idea of "romantic love" appears to have crossed cultures and been accepted as a concept at one point in time or another.

== Types ==
Romantic love is contrasted with [[platonic love]], which in all usages, precludes sexual relations, yet only in the modern usage does it take on a fully [[nonsexual]] sense, rather than the classical sense, in which sexual drives are sublimated. [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]] tends to be forgotten in casual thought about love aside from its emergence in psychoanalysis and Nietzsche.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[Unrequited love]] can be romantic in different ways: comic, tragic, or in the sense that sublimation itself is comparable to romance, where the spirituality of both art and [[egalitarian]] ideals is combined with strong character and emotions. Unrequited love is typical of the period of [[romanticism]], but the term is distinct from any romance that might arise within it.&lt;ref&gt;Beethoven, however, is the case in point. He had brief relationships with only a few women, always of the nobility. His one actual engagement was broken off mainly because of his conflicts with noble society as a group. This is evidenced in his biography, such as in Maynard Solomon's account.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romantic love may also be classified according to two categories, "popular romance" and "divine or spiritual" romance:

;Popular romance: may include but is not limited to the following types: idealistic, normal intense (such as the emotional aspect of "[[falling in love]]"), predictable as well as unpredictable, consuming (meaning consuming of time, energy and emotional withdrawals and bids), intense but out of control (such as the aspect of "falling out of love") material and commercial (such as societal gain mentioned in a later section of this article), physical and sexual, and finally grand and demonstrative.
;Divine (or spiritual) romance: may include, but is not limited to these following types: realistic, as well as plausible unrealistic, optimistic as well as pessimistic (depending upon the particular beliefs held by each person within the relationship.), abiding (e.g. the theory that each person had a predetermined stance as an agent of choice; such as "choosing a husband" or "choosing a soul mate."), non-abiding (e.g. the theory that we do not choose our actions, and therefore our romantic love involvement has been drawn from sources outside of ourselves), predictable as well as unpredictable, self-control (such as obedience and sacrifice within the context of the relationship) or lack thereof (such as disobedience within the context of the relationship), emotional and personal, soulful (in the theory that the mind, soul, and body, are one connected entity), intimate, and infinite (such as the idea that love itself or the love of a [[god]] or God's "unconditional" love is or could be everlasting)&lt;ref&gt;Romance In Marriage: Perspectives, Pitfalls, and Principles, by Jason S. Carroll http://ce.byu.edu/cw/cwfamily/archives/2003/Carroll.Jason.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
=== Plato ===
[[File:Eros bow Musei Capitolini MC410.jpg|thumb|Roman copy of a Greek sculpture by [[Lysippus]] depicting [[Eros]], the Greek personification of romantic love]]

Greek philosophers and authors have had many theories of love. Some of these theories are presented in [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium''. Six Athenian friends, including Socrates, drink wine and each give a speech praising the [[deity]] [[Eros]]. When his turn comes, [[Aristophanes]] says in his [[myth]]ical speech that sexual partners seek each other because they are descended from beings with spherical torsos, two sets of human limbs, genitalia on each side, and two faces back to back. Their three forms included the three permutations of pairs of gender (i.e. one masculine and masculine, another feminine and feminine, and the third masculine and feminine) and they were split by the gods to thwart the creatures' assault on heaven, recapitulated, according to the comic playwright, in other myths such as the [[Aloadae]].&lt;ref&gt;''Symposium 189d ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

This story is relevant to modern romance partly because of the image of reciprocity it shows between the sexes. In the final speech before [[Alcibiades]] arrives, [[Socrates]] gives his encomium of love and desire as a lack of being, namely, the being or form of [[beauty]].

=== René Girard ===

Though there are many theories of romantic love—such as that of [[Robert Sternberg]], in which it is merely a mean combining liking and [[sexual desire]]—the major theories involve far more insight. For most of the 20th century, Freud's theory of the family drama dominated theories of romance and sexual relationships. This gave rise to a few counter-theories. Theorists like Deleuze counter Freud and [[Jacques Lacan]] by attempting to return to a more naturalistic philosophy:

[[René Girard]] argues that romantic attraction is a product of [[jealousy]] and rivalry—particularly in a [[love triangle|triangular form]].

Girard, in any case, downplays romance's individuality in favor of [[jealousy]] and the [[love triangle]], arguing that romantic attraction arises primarily in the observed attraction between two others. A natural objection is that this is [[circular reasoning]], but Girard means that a small measure of attraction reaches a critical point insofar as it is caught up in [[mimesis]]. Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''As You Like It'', and ''The Winter's Tale'' are the best known examples of competitive-induced romance.&lt;ref&gt;In works such as ''A Theatre of Envy'' and ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World'', Girard presents this mostly original theory, though finding a major precedent in Shakespeare on the structure of rivalry, claiming that it—rather than Freud's theory of the primal horde—is the origin of religion, ethics, and all aspects of sexual relations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girard's theory of mimetic desire is controversial because of its alleged [[sexism]]. This view has to some extent supplanted its predecessor, Freudian Oedipal theory. It may find some spurious support in the supposed attraction of women to aggressive men. As a technique of attraction, often combined with irony, it is sometimes advised that one feign toughness and disinterest, but it can be a trivial or crude idea to promulgate to men, and it is not given with much understanding of mimetic desire in mind. Instead, cultivating a spirit of self-sacrifice, coupled with an attitude of appreciation or contemplation, directed towards the other of one's attractions, constitutes the ideals of what we consider to be true romantic love. Mimesis is always the desire to possess, in renouncing it we offer ourselves as a sacrificial gift to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Things Hidden from the Foundation of the World, Rene Girard, Stanford University Press, 1978, pp. 283–350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mimetic desire is often challenged by [[feminists]], such as [[Toril Moi]],&lt;ref&gt;The Missing Mother: The Oedipal Rivalries of René Girard. Toril Moi, Diacritics Vol. 12, No. 2, Cherchez la Femme Feminist Critique/Feminine Text (Summer, 1982), pp. 21–31&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that it does not account for the woman as inherently desired.

Though the centrality of rivalry is not itself a cynical view, it does emphasize the mechanical in love relations. In that sense, it does resonate with [[capitalism]] and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] native to post-modernity. Romance in this context leans more on fashion and irony, though these were important for it in less emancipated times. [[Sexual revolution]]s have brought change to these areas. Wit or irony therefore encompass an instability of romance that is not entirely new but has a more central social role, fine-tuned to certain modern peculiarities and subversion originating in various social revolutions, culminating mostly in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;A contemporary irony toward romance is perhaps the expression "throwing game" or simply game. In Marxism the romantic might be considered an example of alienation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arthur Schopenhauer ===

The process of courtship also contributed to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism, despite his own romantic success,&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms''&lt;/ref&gt; and he argued that to be rid of the challenge of courtship would drive people to suicide with boredom. Schopenhauer theorized that individuals seek partners who share certain interests and tastes, while at the same time looking for a "complement" or completing of themselves in a partner, as in the [[cliché]] that "opposites attract", but with the added consideration that both partners manifest this attraction for the sake of the species:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what ultimately draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to each other with such power is the will-to-live which manifests itself in the whole species, and here anticipates, in the individual that these two can produce, an objectification of its true nature corresponding to its aims. 
—''World as Will and Representation'', Volume 2, Chapter XLIV&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
Later modern philosophers such as [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[David Hume]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] also focused on [[morality]], but desire was central to French thought and Hume himself tended to adopt a French worldview and temperament. Desire in this milieu meant a very general idea termed "the passions", and this general interest was distinct from the contemporary idea of "passionate" now equated with "romantic". Love was a central topic again in the subsequent movement of [[Romanticism]], which focused on such things as absorption in nature and the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], as well as [[Platonic love|platonic]] and unrequited love in German philosophy and literature.

French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] linked this idea of love as a lack mainly to [[Sigmund Freud]], and Deleuze often criticized it.

== In literature ==
[[File:DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg|thumb|upright|Archetypal lovers [[Romeo and Juliet]] portrayed by [[Frank Bernard Dicksee|Frank Dicksee]]]]

Shakespeare and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] share a similar viewpoint that marriage and romance are not harmoniously ''in tune'' with each other. In Shakespeare's ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', for example, "...there has not been, nor is there at this point, any display of affection between Isabella and the Duke, if by affection we mean something concerned with sexual attraction. The two at the end of the play love each other as they love virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nathan | first1 = Norman | year = 1956 | title = The Marriage of Duke Vincentio and Isabella | url = | journal = Shakespeare Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 43–45 | doi=10.2307/2866112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', in saying "all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage", [[Romeo]] implies that it is not marriage with Juliet that he seeks but simply to be joined with her romantically.

Kierkegaard addressed these ideas in works such as ''Either/Or'' and ''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'':
{{quote|''In the first place, I find it comical that all men are in love and want to be in love, and yet one never can get any illumination upon the question what the lovable, i.e., the proper object of love, really is.''
— ''Stages'', p. 48}}
In ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', British writer [[Iain King]] tried to establish rules for romance  applicable across most cultures.  He concluded on six rules, including:
# Do not flirt with someone unless you might mean it.
# Do not pursue people who you are not interested in, or who are not interested in you.
# In general, express your affection or uncertainty clearly, unless there is a special reason not to.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', 2008, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tragedy and other social issues ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The "tragic" contradiction between romance and society is most forcibly portrayed in literature, in Tolstoy's ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', in Flaubert's ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The female protagonists in such stories are driven to suicide as if dying for a cause of freedom from various oppressions of marriage.

Even after sexual revolutions, on the other hand, to the extent that it does not lead to procreation (or child-rearing, as it also might exist in [[same-sex marriage]]), romance remains peripheral though it may have virtues in the relief of [[Stress (physics)|stress]], as a source of inspiration or adventure, or in development and the strengthening of certain social relations. It is difficult to imagine the tragic heroines, however, as having such practical considerations in mind.

Romance can also be tragic in its conflict with society. The [[Tolstoy]] family focuses on the romantic limitations of marriage, and [[Anna Karenina]] prefers death to being married to her fiancé, however this is because she is tired of waiting and being hidden away from public, when her fiance makes failed attempts to get his mother's approval of the marriage. Even being aristocrats did not make them both free, as the society was nevertheless equally binding for all. Furthermore, in the speech about marriage that is given in Kierkegaard's ''[[Either/Or]]'', Kierkegaard attempts to show that it is because marriage is lacking in passion fundamentally, that the nature of marriage, unlike romance, is explainable by a man who has experience of neither marriage nor love.

Reciprocity of the sexes appears in the ancient world primarily in myth where it is in fact often{{when|date=July 2018}} the subject of tragedy, for example in the myths of [[Theseus]] and [[Atalanta]]. Noteworthy female freedom or power was an exception rather than the rule, though this is a matter of speculation and debate.

== Psychology ==
{{cleanup|date=September 2018|reason=Very awkward prose. No indication why the cited authors are significant.}}
Many theorists attempt to analyze the process of romantic love.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Anthropologist [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], in her book ''Why We Love'',&lt;ref&gt;Helen Fisher, 2004, "Why We Love" Henry Holt and Company LLC, 175 Fifth Ave. New York, NY 10010, {{ISBN|0-8050-7796-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses brain scans to show that love is the product of a chemical reaction in the brain. [[Norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], among other brain chemicals, are responsible for excitement and bliss in humans as well as non-human animals. She is famous{{peacock term|date=September 2018}} for the use of MRI to study the brain activity of a person "in love", discovering the importance of the [[ventral tegmental area]] and the [[caudate nucleus]]{{jargon inline|date=September 2018}} in this biological drive. Fisher concludes that these reactions have a genetic basis, and therefore love is a natural drive as powerful as hunger.

In his book ''What Women Want, What Men Want'',&lt;ref&gt;John Townsend, 1998, "What Women Want, What Men Want" Oxford University Press, United Kingdom {{ISBN|978-0-19-511488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist John Townsend takes the genetic basis of love one step further by identifying how the sexes are different in their predispositions. Townsend's compilation of various research projects concludes that men are susceptible to youth and beauty, whereas women are susceptible to status and security. These differences are part of a natural selection process where males seek many healthy women of childbearing age to mother offspring, and women seek men who are willing and able to take care of them and their children.

Psychologist Karen Horney in her article "The Problem of the Monogamous Ideal",&lt;ref&gt;Karen Horney, 1967, "Feminine Psychology," W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., New, York, NY {{ISBN|0-393-31080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the overestimation of love leads to disillusionment; the desire to possess the partner results in the partner wanting to escape; and the friction against sex result in non-fulfillment. Disillusionment plus the desire to escape plus non-fulfillment result in a secret hostility, which causes the other partner to feel alienated. Secret hostility in one and secret alienation in the other cause the partners to secretly hate each other. This secret hate often leads one or the other or both to seek love objects outside the marriage or relationship.

Psychologist Harold Bessell in his book ''The Love Test'',&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bessell, 1984 "The Love Test," Warner Books, 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10103, {{ISBN|0-446-32582-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; reconciles the opposing forces noted by the above researchers and shows that there are two factors that determine the quality of a relationship. Bessell proposes that people are drawn together by a force he calls "romantic attraction", which is a combination of genetic and cultural factors. This force may be weak or strong and may be felt to different degrees by each of the two love partners. The other factor is "emotional maturity", which is the degree to which a person is capable of providing good treatment in a love relationship. It can thus be said that an immature person is more likely to overestimate love, become disillusioned, and have an affair whereas a mature person is more likely to see the relationship in realistic terms and act constructively to work out problems.

Romantic love, in the abstract sense of the term, is traditionally considered to involve a mix of emotional and sexual desire for another as a [[person]]. However, [[Lisa M. Diamond]], a [[University of Utah]] [[psychology]] professor, proposes that sexual desire and romantic love are functionally independent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that romantic love is not intrinsically oriented to same-gender or other-gender partners. She also proposes that the links between love and desire are bidirectional as opposed to unilateral. Furthermore, Diamond does not state that one's sex has priority over another sex (a male or female) in romantic love because her theory suggests{{according to whom|date=September 2018}} it is as possible for someone who is [[homosexual]] to fall in love with someone of the other gender as for someone who is [[heterosexual]] to fall in love with someone of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Martie Haselton, a psychologist at [[UCLA]], considers romantic love a "commitment device" or mechanism that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond. She has explored the evolutionary rationale that has shaped modern romantic love and has concluded that long-lasting relationships are helpful to ensure that children reach reproductive age and are fed and cared for by two parents. Haselton and her [[colleagues]] have found evidence in their experiments that suggest love's [[adaptation]]. The first part of the [[experiment]]s consists of having people think about how much they love someone and then suppress thoughts of other attractive people. In the second part of the experiment the same people are asked to think about how much they sexually desire those same partners and then try to suppress thoughts about others. The results showed that love is more efficient in pushing out those rivals than [[sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1704665,00.html| title=Romance Is An Illusion|date=2008-01-17|accessdate= 2010-07-08 | work=Time | first=Carl | last=Zimmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the University of Pavia{{who|date=September 2018}} suggests that romantic love lasts for about a year (similar to [[limerence]]) before being replaced by a more stable, non-passionate "[[companionate love]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4478040.stm | work=BBC News | title=Romantic love 'lasts just a year' | date=2005-11-28 | accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In companionate love, changes occur from the early stage of love to when the relationship becomes more established and romantic feelings seem to end. However, research from Stony Brook University in New York suggests that some couples keep romantic feelings alive for much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/04/true.love.found/index.html | work=CNN | title=Scientists: True love can last a lifetime | accessdate=2010-04-10 | date=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment patterns===

[[Attachment styles]] that people develop as children can influence the way that they interact with partners in adult relationships, with secure attachment styles being associated with healthier and more trusting relationships than avoidant or anxious attachment styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ainsworth|first=M|title=Infant-mother attachments|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|issue=10|pages=932–937|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.34.10.932|pmid=517843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=J|title=Influence of attachment styles on romantic relationships|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=59|issue=5|pages=971–980|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazen and Shaver found that adult romantic attachment styles were similar to the categories of secure, avoidant, and anxious that had previously been studied in children’s attachments to their caregivers, demonstrating that attachment styles are stable across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazen|first=C|author2=Shaver, P |title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1987|volume=52|issue=3|pages=511–524|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511|pmid=3572722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, researchers distinguished between dismissive avoidant attachment and fearful avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartholomew|first=K|author2=Horowitz, L |title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=61|issue=2|pages=226–244|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226|pmid=1920064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have found that secure adult attachment, leading to the ability for intimacy and confidence in relationship stability, is characterized by low attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, while the fearful style is high on both dimensions, the dismissing style is low on anxiety and high on avoidance, and the preoccupied style is high on anxiety and low on avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=K|author2=Clark, C |author3=Shaver, P |title=Self-report measurement of adult attachment.

=== Romantic love definition/operationalization ===
Singer (1984a,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Irving|title=The Nature of Love: Vol. 1. Plato to Luther|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1984b,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Irving|title=The Nature of Love: Vol. 2. Courtly and romantic.|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1987&lt;ref name="Singer 1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Irving|title=The Nature of love: Vol. 3. The modern world|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;) first defined love based on four [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] terms: ''eros'', meaning the search for beauty; ''philia'', the feelings of affection in close friendships, ''nomos'', the submission of and obedience to higher or divine powers, and ''agape'', the bestowal of love and affection for the divine powers. While Singer did believe that love was important to world culture, he did not believe that romantic love played a major role (Singer, 1987&lt;ref name="Singer 1987"/&gt;). However, Susan Hendrick and Clyde Hendrick at Texas Tech University (1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrick|first=S. S.|title=Romantic Love|year=1992|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|author2=Hendrick, C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrick|first=C.|title=Oxford handbook of positive psychology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=447–454|author2=Hendrick, S. S. |editor=S. J. Lopez &amp; C. R.  Snyder}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have theorized that romantic love will play an increasingly important cultural role in the future, as it is considered an important part of living a fulfilling life. They also theorized that love in long-term romantic relationships has only been the product of cultural forces that came to fruition within the past 300 years. By cultural forces, they mean the increasing prevalence of individualistic ideologies, which are the result of an inward shift of many cultural worldviews.

=== Passionate and companionate love ===
Researchers have determined that romantic love is a complex emotion that can be divided into either passionate or companionate forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brogaard|first=B.|title=On Romantic Love|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berscheid and Walster (1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berscheid|first=E.|title=Interpersonal Attraction (2nd ed.)|year=1978|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=Reading, MA|author2=Walster, E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Hatfield (1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatfield|first=E.|title=The Psychology of Love|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|pages=191–217|editor=R. J. Sternberg &amp; M. I. Barnes|chapter=Passionate and companionate love}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that these two forms can co-exist, either simultaneously or intermittently. Passionate love is an arousal-driven emotion that often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Companionate love is a form that creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Researchers have described the stage of passionate love as "being on cocaine", since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansari|first1=Aziz|last2=Klinenberg|first2=Eric|title=Modern Romance|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9781594206276|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that passionate love (as with [[limerence]]) lasts for about twelve to eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansari|first1=Aziz|last2=Klinenberg|first2=Eric|title=Modern Romance|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9781594206276|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Firestone, a psychologist, has a theory of the fantasy bond, which is what is mostly created after the passionate love has faded. A couple may start to feel really comfortable with each other to the point that they see each other as simply companions or protectors, but yet think that they are still in love with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Firestone|first1=Robert|title=The Fantasy Bond: A substitute for a truly loving relationship|url=http://www.psychalive.org/the-fantasy-bond-substitute-for-a-loving-relationship/|website=PSYCHALIVE|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results to the fantasy bond is the leading to companionate love. 
Hendrick and Hendrick (1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendrick|first=S. S.|author2=Hendrick, C. |title=Gender differences and similarities in sex and love|journal=Personal Relationships|year=1995|volume=2|issue=1|pages=55–65|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00077.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) studied college students who were in the early stages of a relationship and found that almost half reported that their significant other was their closest friend, providing evidence that both passionate and companionate love exist in new relationships. Conversely, in a study of long-term marriages, researchers (Contreras, Hendrick, and Hendrick, 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Contreras|first=R.|author2=Hendrick, S. S. |author3=Hendrick, C. |title=Perspectives of Marital Love and Satisfaction in Mexican American and Anglo-American Couples|journal=Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|year=1996|volume=74|issue=4|pages=408–415|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1996.tb01887.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that couples endorsed measures of both companionate love and passionate love and that passionate love was the strongest predictor of marital satisfaction, showing that both types of love can endure throughout the years.

=== The triangular theory of love ===
Psychologist Robert Sternberg (1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=R. J.|title=A Triangular Theory of love|journal=Psychological Review|year=1986|volume=93|pages=119–135|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.93.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;) developed the [[triangular theory of love]]. He theorized that love is a combination of three main components: passion (physical arousal); intimacy (psychological feelings of closeness); and commitment (the sustaining of a relationship). He also theorized that the different combinations of these three components could yield up to seven different forms of love. These include popularized forms such as romantic love (intimacy and passion) and consummate love (passion, intimacy, and commitment). The other forms are liking (intimacy), companionate love (intimacy and commitment), empty love (commitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and infatuation (passion).
Studies on Sternberg’s theory love found that intimacy most strongly predicted marital satisfaction in married couples, with passion also being an important predictor (Silberman, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silberman|first=S.|title=The relationships among love, marital satisfaction and duration of marriage|journal=Doctoral dissertation, Arizona State University|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On the other hand, Acker and Davis (1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acker|first=M.|author2=Davis, M. H. |title=Intimacy, passion and commitment in adult romantic relationships: A test of the triangular theory of love|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|year=1992|volume=9|issue=1|pages=21–50|doi=10.1177/0265407592091002}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that commitment was the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction, especially for long-term relationships.

=== The self-expansion theory of romantic love ===
Researchers Arthur and Elaine Aron (1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aron|first=A.|title=Love and the expansion of self: Understanding attraction and satisfaction|year=1986|publisher=Hemisphere|location=New York|author2=Aron, E. N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) theorized that humans have a basic drive to expand their self-concepts. Further, their experience with Eastern concepts of love caused them to believe that positive emotions, cognitions, and relationships in romantic behaviors all drive the expansion of a person’s self-concept. A study following college students for 10 weeks showed that those students who fell in love over the course of the investigation reported higher feelings of self-esteem and self efficacy than those who did not (Aron, Paris, and Aron, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aron|first=A.|author2=Paris, M. |author3=Aron, E. N. |title=Falling in love: Prospective studies of self-concept change|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1102–1112|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1102}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Mindful relationships ===
Harvey and Ormarzu (1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=J. H.|author2=Ormarzu, J. |title=Minding the close relationship|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=1997|volume=1|pages=223–239|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0103_3|pmid=15659351}}&lt;/ref&gt;) developed a model of minding relationships with five key components: seeking to know and be known by the other; using knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship; accepting the other person; being motivated to continue this process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and developing a sense of appreciation in the relationship. Each of these components is considered adaptive, however, nonadaptive steps to minding a relationship were also theorized by the research team. The five nonadaptive components include: one or both partners out of step in seeking to know and be known by the other; not using the knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship (or using that knowledge to hurt the other); low acceptance and respect for the other person; not being motivated to continue the process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and failing to develop a sense of appreciation in a relationship. Gottman studies the components of a flourishing romantic relationship have been studied in the lab (1994;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=What predicts divorce?: The relationship between marital processes and marital outcomes|year=1994|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottman &amp; Silver, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=The seven principles for making marriage work|year=1999|publisher=Random House LLC.|location=New York|author2=Silver, N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;). He used physiological and behavioral measures during couples’ interactions to predict relationship success and found that five positive interactions to one negative interaction are needed to maintain a healthy relationship. He established a therapy intervention for couples that focused on civil forms of disapproval, a culture of appreciation, acceptance of responsibility for problems, and self-soothing (Gottman, Driver, &amp; Tabares, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=Clinical Handbook of Couple Therapy, 3rd Edition|year=2002|publisher=Guilford PRess|location=New York|author2=Driver, J. |author3=Tabares, A. |editor=A. S. Gurman and N. S. Jacobson|chapter=Building the Sound Marital House: An empirically-derived couple therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Relationship behaviors ===
The most recent{{cn|date=April 2018}} research on romantic love and relationships focuses on behaviors that either sustain a relationship or aid in its dissolution. These behaviors can be considered either appetitive or aversive. Appetitive relationship processes are considered the promotion of positive relationship behaviors, as determined by psychologists Gable and Reis (2001,&lt;ref name="Gable 2001 169–194"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gable|first=S. L.|title=Close romantic relationships: Maintenance and Enhancement|year=2001|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=169–194|author2=Reis, H. T. |editor=J. Harvey &amp; A. Wenzel|chapter=Appetitive and aversive social interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003&lt;ref name="Gable 2003 349–372"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gable|first=S. L.|author2=Reis, H. T. |author3=Elliot, A. J. |title=Evidence for bivariate systems: An empirical test of appetition and aversion across domains|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=2003|volume=37|issue=5|pages=349–372|doi=10.1016/s0092-6566(02)00580-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Aversive relationship processes are described as eliminating behaviors that have a negative effect on relationships (Gable and Reis 2001,&lt;ref name="Gable 2001 169–194"/&gt; 2003&lt;ref name="Gable 2003 349–372"/&gt;). This new research has also allowed relationship success to be predicted as a function of these appetitive and aversive processes. This is all related to research that shows that sharing positive life events with one’s partner is related to greater relationship satisfaction and intimacy (Gable et al., 2004&lt;ref name="Gable 2004 511–524"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gable|first=S. L.|author2=Reis, H. T. |author3=Impett, E. A. |author4=Asher, E. R. |title=What do you do when things go right? The intrapersonal and interpersonal benefits of sharing positive events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=87|issue=2|pages=511–524 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228 |pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In research by Gable et al. (2003) appetitive (promotion of positive relationship behaviors) and aversive (elimination of negative relationship behaviors) processes are independent constructs. A specific type of appetitive processing, capitalization, leads to increased relationship satisfaction and intimacy when one member of the relationship tells the other about positive life events and receive quality reactions and feedback from the partner (Gable, Reis, Impett, &amp; Asher, 2004&lt;ref name="Gable 2004 511–524"/&gt;).

==Physiology==
Researchers such as Feeney and Noller question the stability of attachment style across the life span since studies that measured attachment styles at time points ranging from 2 weeks to 8 months found that 1 out of 4 adults' attachment style changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feeney|first=J|author2=Noller, P |title=Adult Attachment|year=1996|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study by Lopez and Gormley found that attachment styles could change during the first year of college and that changes to more secure attachment styles were associated with adjustments in self-confidence ratings and coping styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lopez|first=F|author2=Gormley, B |title=Stability and change in adult attachment style over the first-year college transition: Relations to self-confidence, coping, and distress patterns|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|year=2002|volume=49|issue=3|pages=355–364|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.49.3.355}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, attachment styles in childhood mirror the ones found in adult romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=N|author2=Reads, S |title=Adult attachment, working models, and relationship quality in dating couples|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=58|issue=4|pages=644–663|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.4.644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research has shown that building interpersonal connections strengthens neural regulatory systems that are involved in emotions of empathy, enjoyment of positive social events, and stress management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schore|first=A|title=Affect regulation and the origin of the self: The neurobiology of emotional development|year=1994|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S|author2=Dickerson, S. |author3=Klein, L. |title=oward a biology of social support|journal=Handbook of positive psychology|year=2002|pages=556–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing evidence that early social interactions affect adult relationships.

Another topic of controversy in the field of romantic relationships is that of [[domestic abuse]]. Following the theory that romantic love evolved as a byproduct of survival, it can be said that in some instances, it has turned into a [[maladaptation]]. [[Oxytocin]] is a neurophysical hormone produced in the brain. It is known to cause a decrease in stress response. It also can cause an increase in feelings of [[attachment theory|attachment]]. In the beginning stages of a romantic relationship, OT levels surge and then remain relatively stable over the duration of the relationship. The higher the surge of OT, the greater the likelihood is of partners staying together.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, J., Caetano, R., &amp; Clark, C. L. (1998). Rates of intimate partner violence in the United States. American journal of public health, 88(11), 1702-1704.&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in increasing positive interpersonal behaviors such as trust, altruism, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kosfeld | first1 = M. | last2 = Heinrichs | first2 = M. | last3 = Zak | first3 = P. J. | last4 = Fischbacher | first4 = U. | last5 = Fehr | first5 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Oxytocin increases trust in humans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7042| pages = 673–676 | doi=10.1038/nature03701 | pmid=15931222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This response is not universal and can in fact, cause the opposite to occur depending on environment and individual. Individuals ranked high in [[rejection sensitivity]] exhibited aggressive tendencies and decreased willingness for cooperation, indicating a link between oxytocin and relationship maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Bartz, J., Simeon, D., Hamilton, H., Kim, S., Crystal, S., Braun, A., ... &amp; Hollander, E. (2010). Oxytocin can hinder trust and cooperation in borderline personality disorder. Social cognitive and affective neuroscience, nsq085.&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings associated with romantic love function to ensure the greater reproductive fitness of individuals. The obligations of individuals in romantic relationships to preserve these bonds are based in [[kin selection]] theory, where by exhibiting aggressive behavior, a mate can use intimidation and [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] to ward off other potential predators, thus protecting the pair bond and their actual or potential offspring. This has however evolved to the point where it has become detrimental to the fitness of individuals; what is causing attachment to occur in a relationship, is now causing one partner to harm the other.

In the search for the root of intimate partner violence, intranasal oxytocin was administered to a control group and a group of participants with aggressive tendencies. Participants were then surveyed on how willing they were to engage in 5 behaviors towards their romantic partner. What they found was that oxytocin increased IPV inclinations only among the participants with a predisposition towards aggressive tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;DeWall, C. N., Gillath, O., Pressman, S. D., Black, L. L., Bartz, J. A., Moskovitz, J., &amp; Stetler, D. A. (2014). When the Love Hormone Leads to Violence Oxytocin Increases Intimate Partner Violence Inclinations Among High Trait Aggressive People. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 1948550613516876&lt;/ref&gt; Oxytocin decreases trust and prosocial behavior in individuals with interpersonal difficulties. This, coupled with its role in relationship maintenance, illustrates that oxytocin serves to instill a sense of territoriality and protectiveness towards a mate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6399">The term '''Seattle Freeze''' refers to a widely held belief that it is especially difficult to make new friends in the city of [[Seattle, Washington]], particularly for transplants from other cities. A 2005 ''[[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]]'' article appears to be the first known use of the term, though a 1946 ''Seattle Daily Times'' excerpt also describes the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[KUOW-FM|KUOW]]|title=Is The Seattle Freeze A Real Thing?|author=Jim Gates|date=March 17, 2014|url=http://kuow.org/post/seattle-freeze-real-thing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sommerfeld2014&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/our-social-dis-ease-beyond-the-smiles-the-seattle-freeze-is-on/ |title=Our Social Dis-ease: Beyond the smiles, the Seattle Freeze is on |date=February 13, 2005 |last=Sommerfeld|first=Julia |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |department=Pacific NW Magazine |access-date=February 6, 2018 |deadurl=no |archive-date=January 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105082656/http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/our-social-dis-ease-beyond-the-smiles-the-seattle-freeze-is-on/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sectarian violence''' and/or '''sectarian strife''' is a form of [[communal violence]] inspired by [[sectarianism]], that is, between different [[sect]]s of one particular mode of ideology or religion within a nation/community. [[Religious segregation]] often plays a role in sectarian violence.

== Concept ==
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute:
{{Quote|Traditionally, sectarian violence implies a symmetrical confrontation between two or more non-state actors representing different population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=SIPRI Yearbook 2008: Armaments, Disarmament, and International Security |publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sectarian violence differs from the concept of [[List of ethnic riots|race riot]]. It may involve the dynamics of [[social polarization]], the [[balkanization]] of a geographic area along the lines of self-identifying groups, and [[protracted social conflict]].

Some of the possible enabling environments for sectarian violence include power struggles, political climate, social climate, cultural climate, and economic landscape.

Although the First Crusade was initially launched in response to an appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos for help in repelling the invading [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]] from [[Anatolia]], one of the lasting legacies of the Crusades was to "further separate the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity from each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The genealogy of violence: reflections on creation, freedom, and evil |first=Charles K.|last=Bellinger |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2001 |page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjBW2JsNPPcC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Crusades+Christianity+Orthodox+violence#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Hussite Wars}}
[[File:Schlacht am Weißen Berg C-K 063.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] in [[Bohemia]] (1620)—one of the decisive battles of the [[Thirty Years War]]]]
Following the onset of the [[Protestant Reformation]], a series of wars were waged in Europe starting [[circa]] 1524 and continuing intermittently until 1648. Although sometimes unconnected, all of these wars were strongly influenced by the religious change of the period, and the conflict and rivalry that it produced. According to [[Miroslav Volf]], the [[European wars of religion]] were a major factor behind the "emergence of secularizing modernity".

In the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] followers of the Roman Catholic Church killed up to 30,000 [[Huguenot]]s (French Protestants) in mob violence. The massacres were carried out on the national day celebrating [[Bartholomew the Apostle]]. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] sent the leader of the massacres a [[Golden Rose]], and said that the massacres "gave him more pleasure than fifty [[Battle of Lepanto|Battles of Lepanto]], and he commissioned [[Giorgio Vasari]] to paint frescoes of it in the Vatican".&lt;ref name="gilmour"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terrorism review|author1=Ian Gilmour |author2=Andrew Gilmour |journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=17|issue=2|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|page=136|doi=10.1525/jps.1988.17.3.00p0024k}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings have been called "the worst of the century's religious massacres",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=H.G. Koenigsberger|author2=George L. Mosse|author3=G.Q. Bowler|title=Europe in the Sixteenth Century, Second Edition|publisher=Longman|year=1989|isbn=0-582-49390-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the start of the ''fourth war'' of the [[French Wars of Religion]].

===Northern Ireland===
{{Further|The Troubles|Politics of Northern Ireland}}
Since the 16th century there has been sectarian conflict of varying intensity between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. This religious sectarianism is connected to a degree with nationalism. [[Northern Ireland]] has seen inter-communal conflict for more than four centuries and there are records of religious ministers or clerics, the agents for [[absentee landlord]]s, aspiring politicians, and members of the [[landed gentry]] stirring up and capitalizing on sectarian hatred and violence back as far as the late 18th century.

[[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|William E.H. Lecky]], an Irish historian, wrote in 1892 that, "If the characteristic mark of a healthy Christianity be to unite its members by a bond of fraternity and love, then there is no country where Christianity has more completely failed than Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Edward Hartpole Lecky|title=A History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Bruce, a sociologist, wrote;{{Quote|The Northern Ireland conflict is a religious conflict. Economic and social considerations are also crucial, but it was the fact that the competing populations in Ireland adhered and still adhere to competing religious traditions which has given the conflict its enduring and intractable quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Bruce|title=God Save Ulster|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986|page=249|isbn=0-19-285217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|249}} Reviewers agreed "Of course the Northern Ireland conflict is at heart religious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The English Historical Review|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=104|issue=413|date=October 1989|title=God Save Ulster: The Religion and Politics of Paisleyism by Steve Bruce (review)|author=David Harkness}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Hickey wrote;{{Quote|Politics in the North is not politics exploiting religion. That is far too simple an explanation: it is one which trips readily off the tongue of commentators who are used to a cultural style in which the politically pragmatic is the normal way of conducting affairs and all other considerations are put to its use. In the case of Northern Ireland the relationship is much more complex. It is more a question of religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion. It is a situation more akin to the first half of seventeenth century England than to the last quarter of twentieth‑century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hickey|title=Religion and the Northern Ireland Problem|publisher=Gill and Macmillan|year=1984|page=67|isbn=0-7171-1115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The period from 1969-98 is known as "[[The Troubles]]", a period of frequent violence and tense relations between Northern Ireland's communities. About one in eight females and one in five males in Northern Ireland identified themselves as belonging to no religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Background/RELIGION.html ''NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015'' results on religion], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, people of no religion and non-Christian faiths are still considered {{bywhom|date=September 2016}} as belonging to one of the two "sects" along with churchgoers. People of no religion are less likely to support the main, constitution-oriented main political parties, or more likely to support a more neutral political party such as the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=NILT1&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/POLPART2.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on political party support], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

About two thirds of people with no religion tend to think of themselves as neither [[British unionism|unionist]] or [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]], although a much higher percentage of those with no religion tend to think of themselves as unionist than nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/UNINATID.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on political identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

For people who describe themselves as Protestant or Roman Catholic, a small majority of them appear to favour one of the two main political parties on either side: the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] or the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] for Protestants; and [[Sinn Féin]] or the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] for Roman Catholics. In each case, the percentage in the ''Northern Irish Life &amp; Times Survey'' in 2015 was 57%.&lt;ref name=NILT1/&gt; Roman Catholics are more likely to reject the label British (59%) than Protestants are to reject the label Irish (48%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Political_Attitudes/IRBRIT.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Protestants are more likely to consider the British identity as the 'best' single way to describe themselves, at 67%, with Roman Catholics close behind at 63% who consider the best single way to describe themselves as Irish. There is an equal level of support for the more neutral Northern Irish identity, with 25% of people from each religion likely to choose that label as the best description. Over a third of people with no religion prefer to be described as Northern Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/2015/Community_Relations/NINATID.html NI Life &amp; Times Survey, 2015 results on best identity], ark.ac.uk; accessed 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are organizations dedicated to the reduction of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. The [[Corrymeela Community]] (in [[Ballycastle, County Antrim]]), operates a retreat centre on the northern coast of Northern Ireland to bring Catholics and Protestants together to discuss their differences and similarities. The [[Ulster Project]] works with teenagers from Northern Ireland and the United States to provide safe, [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational]] environments to discuss sectarianism in Northern Ireland. These organizations are attempting to bridge the gap of historical prejudice between the two religious communities.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Although [[Education in Northern Ireland|state schools]] in Northern Ireland are non-denominational, most Catholic parents still send their children to specifically Catholic schools or Irish-language medium schools, thus ensuring that state school students are almost wholly Protestant. There are some integrated schools and the [[Society of Friends]] (Quakers) have long been an advocate of co-education in terms of religion, operating the [[Friends' School, Lisburn|Friends' School]] in Lisburn (first established in 1774).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Yugoslav wars===
{{main|Yugoslav Wars}}
Howard Goeringer criticizes both the "Catholic Pope and the Orthodox Patriarch" for failing to condemn the "deliberate massacre of men, women and children in the name of 'ethnic cleansing' as incompatible with Jesus' life and teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haunts of Violence in the Church|first=Howard|last=Goeringer|year=2005|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rwandan genocide===
{{Main|Rwandan Genocide}}
{{Further|Religion in Rwanda}}

The [[Demographics of Rwanda|majority of Rwandans]], and [[Tutsi]]s in particular, are Catholic, so shared religion did not prevent genocide. Miroslav Volf cites a Roman Catholic bishop from Rwanda as saying, "The best cathechists, those who filled our churches on Sundays, were the first to go with machetes in their hands".&lt;ref name=SocialMeaning&gt;{{cite journal |first=Miroslav |last=Volf |title=The Social Meaning of Reconciliation |journal=Transformation: An International Journal of Holistic Mission Studies |date = January 1999|volume=16|number=1 |pages=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Linden asserts that "there is absolutely no doubt that significant numbers of prominent Christians were involved in sometimes slaughtering their own church leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Linden, I. (1997). The Church and Genocide. Lessons from the Rwandan Tragedy. In G. Baum (Ed.), The Reconciliation of Peoples. Challenge to the Churches (pp. 43–55). Geneva: WCC Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Volf, "what is particularly disturbing about the complicity of the church is that Rwanda is without doubt one of Africa’s most evangelized nations. Eight out of ten of its people claimed to be Christians."&lt;ref name=SocialMeaning /&gt;

When the Roman Catholic [[Missionary|missionaries]] came to Rwanda in the late 1880s, they contributed to the "[[Hamitic]]" [[Scientific racism|theory of race origins]], which taught that the Tutsi were a superior race. The Church has been considered to have played a significant role in fomenting racial divisions between [[Hutu]] and Tutsi, in part because they found more willing converts among the majority Hutu.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Genocide'', Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the colonial era, under German and then Belgian rule, Roman Catholic missionaries, inspired by the overtly racist theories of 19th century Europe, concocted a destructive ideology of ethnic cleavage and racial ranking that attributed superior qualities to the country's Tutsi minority, since the missionaries ran the colonial-era schools, these pernicious values were systematically transmitted to several generations of Rwandans…&lt;ref name=OAU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/OCHA-64DEEY?OpenDocument|title=Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide|publisher=Organization of African Unity|date=7 July 2000|accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Scotland===
{{See also|Sectarianism in Glasgow}}
Scotland, which is very close to Northern Ireland, suffers from a spill-over of sectarianism, largely owing to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland as many people, particularly in the West of Scotland, have links to Northern Ireland by genealogy or immigration. 

Scotland's two largest and best supported football clubs -- [[Rangers F.C.|Glasgow Rangers]], which, for many generations, has largely been identified with Protestants and unionism, and [[Celtic F.C.|Glasgow Celtic]], which, since its founding in the late 19th century, has been identified with Roman Catholics and Irish nationalism or republicanism -- both subscribe, with varying degrees of success, to government initiatives and charities like the [[Nil by Mouth (charity)|Nil by Mouth]] campaign are working in this area.

Celtic previously sent letters to every season ticket holder reminding supporters that no form of sectarianism is welcome at [[Celtic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eticketing.co.uk/celtic/staticpages/termsandconditions.aspx|title=Celtic F.C.'s Terms &amp; Conditions of sale - eTickets|author=|date=|website=www.eticketing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers' anti-sectarian policy is called ''Follow With Pride''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hymns of hatred at Ibrox Park|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/08/hymnsofhatredatibroxpark|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2010|date=8 August 2007|location=London, UK|first=Mike|last=Small}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among Muslims==
{{main|Sectarian violence among Muslims}}
Sectarian violence between the two major sects of Islam, Shia and Sunni, has occurred in countries like Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Lebanon etc. This violent conflict has roots in the political turmoil arising out of differences over the [[succession to Muhammad]]. [[Abu Bakr]], a [[Sahabah|companion of Muhammad]], was nominated by [[Umar]] and elected as the first Sunni [[Rashidun|Rightly Guided Caliph]]. However another group felt that [[Ali]], the cousin and son-in-law of [[Muhammad]], had been designated by Muhammad and is considered by Shia as the first [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]].

According to Sunnis, Abu Bakr was followed by Umar as [[caliph]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], then by [[Uthman ibn Affan]] and finally by Ali. Ali's right to rule was challenged by [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah bin Abu Sufian]], governor of Syria, who believed{{fact|date=October 2016}} that Ali should have acted faster against the murderers of Uthman. The situation deteriorated further when many of those responsible for the death of Uthman rallied behind Ali. However, later on, both the parties agreed to have some one as a judge between them. This led to the separation of an extremist group known as [[Kharijites]] from Ali's army, which pronounced the judgement belonged to [[God in Islam|God]] alone. A member of this group later assassinated Ali. By breaching, [[Hasan-Muawiyah Treaty]], Muawiyah appointed his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]] as his successor. The credentials and rule of Yazid were challenged by Ali's son [[Hussein ibn Ali]] (and grandson of Muhammad). A [[Battle of Karbala|battle at Karbala]] in Iraq led to the martyrdom of Hussein and dozens of others from ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'' (the members of the family of Muhammad).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

This tragic incident created deep fissures in the Muslim society. The conflict that had started at a political plane intervened with the dogma and belief systems.{{fact|date=October 2016}} Those who consider Ali to be the true heir to the [[Muhammad]] are known as "Shia" referring to Shian-e-Ali. The other Muslims are known as "Sunni" meaning "followers of the Traditions of The Prophet".{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===In Iraq===
{{main|Civil war in Iraq (2006–07)|Sectarian violence in Iraq}}
In February 2006, more than 100 people were killed across Iraq, when violence between the two Muslim rival sects erupted. It has left over a hundred people dead and dozens of mosques and homes destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/23/AR2006022300216.html|work=The Washington Post|first1=Jonathan|last1=Finer|first2=Bassam|last2=Sebti|title=Sectarian Violence Kills Over 100 in Iraq|date=24 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Pakistan===
{{main|Sectarian violence in Pakistan}}
In Pakistan sectarianism exhibited its first organized nature in early 1980 when two rival organizations were established: [[Tehrik-e-Jafaria]] (TFJ) (Organization of the Jafri (Shia) Law) represented Shia communities, and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]] (SSP) (Guardian of the Companions of the Prophet) representing Sunnis. The first major incident of this sectarian violence was killing of the [[Arif Hussain Hussaini]], founding leader of TFJ in 1986. 

In retaliation [[Haq Nawaz Jhangvi]], founder of the (SSP) was murdered. Since then internecine bloody vendetta has ensued. The focus of this violence has been [[Kurram Valley|Kurram]], [[Hangu District, Pakistan|Hangu]], [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Bahawalpur District|Bahawalpur]], [[Jhang District|Jhang]], [[Quetta District|Quetta]],Gigit- Baltistan and [[Karachi]].

The transformation of the sectarian conflict to a violent civil war in Pakistan coincided{{fact|date=October 2016}} with the establishment of the [[Islamic republic]] in Iran and promotion of the Sunni religion and its incorporation in the state institutions by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], regime in Pakistan.

The [[Iranian Revolution]] was led by Shia clerics, and it influenced Shia communities all over the world. In Pakistan Tehrik-e-Jafaria was established with the demands of enforcing the Sharia Law. {{fact|date=October 2016}} This demand was viewed as detrimental by the Sunni religious leaders. In response SSP was established by the Sunni extremist clerics. Many of these clerics had a background in the sectarian strife against the Ahmadis (a heterodox sect considered non-Muslim by majority of the Orthodox Schools)

===In Somalia===
[[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] is a [[Somali people|Somali]] paramilitary group consisting of [[Sufism|Sufis]] and moderates opposed to the radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]]. They are fighting in order to prevent [[Wahhabi]]sm from being imposed on Somalia and to protect the country's Sunni-Sufi traditions and generally moderate religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8077725.stm |work=BBC News | title=Somali rage at grave desecration | date=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Syria===
{{main|Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian Civil War}}
The [[Syrian civil war]] gradually shifted towards a more sectarian nature. Pro-Assad militant groups are largely{{fact|date=October 2016}} Shia, while anti-Assad militant groups are non-secular, fundamentalist Sunni.

A '''sensorium''' (/sɛnˈsɔːrɪəm/)&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionaries"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of sensorium|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sensorium|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (plural: '''sensoria''') is the sum of an organism's [[perception]], the "seat of [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]]" where it experiences and interprets the environments within which it lives. The term originally entered English from the Late Latin in the mid-17th century, from the stem ''sens-'' ("[[sense]]"). In earlier use it referred, in a broader sense, to the brain as the mind's organ (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 1989). In medical, psychological, and physiological discourse it has come to refer to the total character of the unique and changing sensory environments perceived by individuals. These include the sensation, perception, and interpretation of information about the world around us by using faculties of the [[mind]] such as senses, phenomenal and psychological perception, [[cognition]], and [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name="MedicineNet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Definition of Sensorium|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15732|website=MedicineNet|accessdate=July 21, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ratios of sensation ==
In the 20th century the sensorium became a key part of the theories of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] and [[Walter J. Ong]] (Carpenter and McLuhan 1960; Ong 1991).

McLuhan, like his mentor [[Harold Innis]], believed that media were biased according to [[Harold Innis's communications theories|time and space]]. He paid particular attention to what he called the sensorium, or the ''effects'' of media on our senses, positing that media affect us by manipulating the ratio of our senses. For example, the [[alphabet]] stresses the sense of sight, which in turn causes us to think in linear, objective terms. The medium of the alphabet thus has the effect of reshaping the way in which we, collectively and individually, perceive and understand our environment in what has been termed the [[Alphabet Effect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/002033-2010-e.html Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001082647/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/002033-2010-e.html |date=2007-10-01 }}, a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on variations in the sensorium across social contexts, these theorists collectively suggest that the world is explained and experienced differently depending on the specific "ratios of sense" that members of a [[culture]] share in the sensoria they learn to inhabit (Howes 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;8). More recent work has demonstrated that individuals may include in their unique sensoria perceptual proclivities that exceed their cultural norms; even when, as in the history of smell in the West, the sense in question is suppressed or mostly ignored (Classen, Howes and Synnott 1994).

This interplay of various ways of conceiving the world could be compared to the experience of [[synesthesia]], where stimulus of one sense causes a perception by another, seemingly unrelated sense, as in musicians who can taste the intervals between notes they hear (Beeli ''et al''., 2005), or artists who can smell colors. Many individuals who have one or more senses restricted or lost develop a sensorium with a ratio of sense which favors those they possess more fully. Frequently the blind or deaf speak of a compensating effect, whereby their sense of touch or smell becomes more acute, changing the way they perceive and reason about the world; especially telling examples are found in the cases of "wild children", whose early childhoods were spent in abusive, neglected, or non-human environments, both intensifying and minimizing perceptual abilities (Classen 1991).

== Development of unique sensoria in cultures and individuals ==
Although some {{who|date=April 2015}} consider these modalities abnormal, it is more likely that these examples demonstrate the contextual and socially learned nature of sensation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} A 'normal' sensorium and a 'synesthetic' one differ based on the division, connection, and interplay of the body's manifold sensory apparatus. A synesthete has simply developed a different set of relationships, including cognitive or interpretive skills which deliver unique abilities and understanding of the world (Beeli et al., 2005). The sensorium is a creation of the physical, biological, [[social environment|social]] and cultural [[natural environment|environments]] of the individual organism and its relationships while being in the world.

What is considered a strange blurring of sensation from one perspective, is a normal and [[nature#The natural and the artificial|'natural']] way of perception of the world in another, and indeed many individuals and their cultures develop sensoria fundamentally different from the vision-centric modality of most Western science and culture. One revealing contrast is the thought of a former Russian on the matter:
:The dictionary of the Russian language...defines the sense of touch as follows: "In reality all five senses can be reduced to one---the sense of touch. The tongue and palate sense the food; the ear, sound waves; the nose, emanations; the eyes, rays of light." That is why in all textbooks the sense of touch is always mentioned first. It means to ascertain, to perceive, by body, hand or fingers (Anonymous 1953).

As David Howes explains:
:The reference to Russian textbooks treating touch first, in contrast to American psychology textbooks which always begin with sight, is confirmed by other observers (Simon 1957) and serves to highlight how the hierarchization of the senses can vary significantly even between cultures belonging to the same general tradition (here, that of "the West") (2003, pp. 12-13).

== Sensory ecology and anthropology ==
These sorts of insights were the impetus for the development of the burgeoning field of [[sensory anthropology]], which seeks to understand other cultures from within their own unique sensoria. Anthropologists such as Paul Stoller (1989) and [[Michael Jackson (anthropologist)|Michael Jackson]] (1983, 1989) have focused on a critique of the [[hegemony]] of vision and textuality in the social sciences. They argue for an understanding and analysis that is embodied, one sensitive to the unique context of sensation of those one wishes to understand. They believe that a thorough awareness and adoption of other sensoria is a key requirement if ethnography is to approach true understanding.

A related area of study is [[sensory ecology|sensory (or perceptual) ecology]]. This field aims at understanding the unique sensory and interpretive systems all organisms develop, based on the specific ecological environments they live in, experience and adapt to. A key researcher in this field has been psychologist [[J. J. Gibson|James J. Gibson]], who has written numerous seminal volumes considering the senses in terms of holistic, self-contained perceptual systems. These exhibit their own mindful, interpretive behaviour, rather than acting simply as conduits delivering information for [[cognitive]] processing, as in more representational [[philosophy of perception|philosophies of perception]] or theories of [[psychology]] (1966, 1979). Perceptual systems detect [[affordance]]s in objects in the world, directing attention towards information about an object in terms of the possible uses it affords an organism.

The individual sensory systems of the body are only parts of these broader perceptual [[ecology|ecologies]], which include the physical apparatus of sensation, the [[natural environment|environment]] being sensed, as well as both learned and innate systems for directing attention and interpreting the results. These systems represent and enact the [[information]] ([[information#As an influence which leads to a transformation|as an influence which leads to a transformation]]) required to perceive, identify or reason about the world, and are distributed across the very design and structures of the body, in relation to the physical environment, as well as in the concepts and interpretations of the mind. This information varies according to species, physical environment, and the context of information in the social and cultural systems of perception, which also change over time and space, and as an individual learns through living. Any single perceptual modality may include or overlap multiple sensory structures, as well as other modes of perception, and the sum of their relations and the ratio of mixture and importance comprise a sensorium. The perception, understanding, and reasoning of an organism is dependent on the particular experience of the world delivered by changing ratios of sense.

== Clouded sensorium ==
A '''clouded sensorium''', also known as an '''altered sensorium''', is a medical condition characterized by the inability to think clearly or concentrate. It is usually [[synonym]]ous with, or substantially overlapping with, [[altered level of consciousness]]. It is associated with a huge variety of underlying causes from drug induced states to pathogenic states induced by disease or mineral deficiency.

[[Image:Mitbat-2007-bracket-large.png|thumb|250px|Example of a single-elimination tournament bracket]]

A '''single-elimination''', '''knockout''', or '''sudden death tournament''' is a type of [[elimination tournament]] where the loser of each match-up is immediately eliminated from the tournament. Each winner will play another in the next round, until the final match-up, whose winner becomes the tournament champion. Each match-up may be a single match or several, for example [[two-legged tie]]s in European football or [[best-of series]] in American pro sports. Defeated competitors may play no further part after losing, or may participate in "consolation" or "classification" matches against other losers to determine the lower final rankings; for example, a [[third place playoff]] between losing semi-finalists. In a shootout [[poker tournament]], there are more than two players competing at each table, and sometimes more than one progressing to the next round. Some competitions are held with a pure single-elimination tournament system. Others have many phases, with the last being a single-elimination final stage, often called [[playoffs]].

==Nomenclature==
In [[English language|English]], the round in which only eight competitors remain is generally called (with or without hyphenation) the ''quarter-final'' round; this is followed by the ''semi-final'' round, in which only four are left, the two winners of which then meet in the final or ''championship round''.

The round before the quarterfinals has multiple designations. Often it's called the ''round of sixteen'', ''last sixteen'', or (in South Asia) ''pre quarter-finals''. In many other languages the term used to describe these eight matches translates to ''eighth-final'', though this term is rare in English itself.

Earlier rounds are typically numbered counting forwards from the first round, or by the number of remaining competitors. If some competitors get a bye, the round at which they enter may be named the ''first round'', with the earlier matches called a ''preliminary round'', ''qualifying round'', or the ''play-in games"''.

==Classification==
When matches are held to determine places or prizes lower than first and second (the loser of the final-round match gaining the latter position), these typically include a match between the losers of the semifinal matches called [[Third place playoff|third place playoffs]], the winner therein placing third and the loser fourth. Many Olympic single-elimination tournaments feature the bronze medal match if they do not award bronze medals to both losing semifinalists. The [[FIFA World Cup]] has long featured the third place match, though the [[UEFA Euro]] has not held one since the [[Euro 1980|1980 edition]].

Sometimes, contests are also held among the losers of the quarterfinal matches to determine fifth to eighth places – this is most commonly encountered in the [[Olympic Games]], with the exception of [[boxing]], where both fighters are deemed to be third place. In one scenario, two "consolation semifinal" matches may be conducted, with the winners of these then facing off to determine fifth and sixth places and the losers playing for seventh and eighth; those are used often in qualifying tournaments where only the top five teams advance to the next round; or some method of ranking the four quarterfinal losers might be employed, in which case only one round of additional matches would be held among them, the two highest-ranked therein then playing for fifth and sixth places and the two lowest for seventh and eighth.

The number of distinct ways of arranging a single-elimination tournament (as an abstract structure, prior to seeding the players into the tournament) is given by the [[Wedderburn–Etherington number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Maurer | first = Willi
 | journal = The Annals of Statistics

 | volume = 3
 | year = 1975
 | doi = 10.1214/aos/1176343135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for instance, there are three different arrangements for five players:
*The players may be divided into brackets of two and three players, the winners of which meet in the final game
*The bottom four players may play a two-round tournament, the winner of which plays the top player
*The bottom two players may meet, after which each subsequent game pairs the winner of the previous game with the next player
However, the number of arrangements grows quickly for larger numbers of players and not all of them are commonly used.

==Seeding==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[FA Cup]] --&gt;
{{main|Seed (sports)}}

Opponents may be allocated randomly (such as in the FA Cup); however, since the "luck of the draw" may result in the highest-rated competitors being scheduled to face each other early in the competition, ''seeding'' is often used to prevent this. Brackets are set up so that the top two seeds could not possibly meet until the final round (should both advance that far), none of the top four can meet prior to the semifinals, and so on. If no seeding is used, the tournament is called a random knockout tournament.

One version of seeding is where brackets are set up so that the quarterfinal pairings (barring any upsets) would be the 1 seed vs. the 8 seed, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 6 and 4 vs. 5; however, this is not the procedure that is followed in most tennis tournaments, where the 1 and 2 seeds are placed in separate brackets, but then the 3 and 4 seeds are assigned to their brackets randomly, and so too are seeds 5 through 8, and so on. This may result in some brackets consisting of stronger players than other brackets, and since only the top 32 players are seeded at all in [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Tennis Grand Slam]] tournaments, it is conceivable that the 33rd-best player in a 128-player field could end up playing the top seed in the first round. A good example of this occurring was when World No. 33 [[Florian Mayer]] was drawn against (and eventually defeated by) then-World No. 1 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the first round of the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Men's Singles|2013 Wimbledon Championships]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://novakdjokovic.com/en/news/tennis/wimbledon-novak-vs-mayer-in-r1-andy-roger-and-rafa-all-in-bottom-half/ Wimbledon: Novak vs Mayer in R1; Andy, Roger, Rafa all in bottom half], ''[[Novak Djokovic]] official website'', 21 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in what was also a rematch of [[2012 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Gentlemen's Singles#Finals|a quarterfinal from the previous year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/06/22/wimbledon-2013-possible-mens-matches-to-watch-out-for/ Wimbledon 2013: Men's matches to watch out for], ''The Roar'', 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; While this may seem unfair to a casual observer, it should be pointed out that rankings of tennis players are generated by computers, and players tend to change ranking positions very gradually, so that a more equitable method of determining the pairings might result in many of the same head-to-head matchups being repeated over and over again in successive tournaments.

Sometimes the remaining competitors in a single-elimination tournament will be "re-seeded" so that the highest surviving seed is made to play the lowest surviving seed in the next round, the second-highest plays the second-lowest, etc. This may be done after each round, or only at selected intervals. In American team sports, for example, the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]], [[NFL]] and [[WNBA]] employ this tactic, but the [[NBA]] does not (and neither does the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA college basketball tournament]]). [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] does not have enough teams (10) in its playoff tournament where re-seeding would make a large difference in the matchups; ([[Major League Soccer|MLS]] and NFL are at the minimum, which is six from each conference [or league in MLB] for a total of 12). The NBA's format calls for the winner of the first-round series between the first and eighth seeds (within each of the two conferences the league has) to face the winner of the first-round series between the fourth and fifth seeds in the next round, even if one or more of the top three seeds had been upset in their first-round series; critics have claimed that this gives a team fighting for the fifth and sixth seeding positions near the end of the regular season an incentive to [[match fixing|tank]] (deliberately lose) games, so as to finish sixth and thus avoid a possible matchup with the top seed until one round later.

In some situations, a seeding restriction may be implemented; from 1975 until 1989 in the [[National Football League|NFL]], and from 1994 until 2011 in [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] there was a rule where at the conference or league semifinal, should the top seed and last seed (wild card) be from the same division, they could not play each other; in that case, the top seed plays the worst division champion; the second-best division champion plays the wild card team. This is due to the scheduling employed for the regular season, in which a team faces any given divisional opponent more often than any given non-divisional opponent &amp;ndash; the tournament favors matchups that took place fewer times in the regular season (or did not take place, in some cases). {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In international [[fencing]] competitions, it is common to have a [[group stage]]. Participants are divided in groups of 6–7 fencers who play a round-robin tournament, and a ranking is calculated from the consolidated group results. Single elimination is seeded from this ranking.

==Evaluation==
The single-elimination format enables a relatively large number of competitors to participate. There are no "dead" matches (perhaps excluding "classification" matches), and no matches where one competitor has more to play for than the other.

The format is less suited to games where [[tie (draw)|draws]] are frequent. In [[chess]], each fixture in a single-elimination tournament must be played over multiple matches, because [[draw (chess)|draws are common]], and because white has an advantage over black. In [[association football]], games ending in a draw may be settled in extra time and eventually by a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] or by replaying the fixture.

Another perceived disadvantage is that most competitors are eliminated after relatively few games. Variations such as the [[double-elimination tournament]] allow competitors a single loss while remaining eligible for overall victory.

In a random knockout tournament (single-elimination without any seeding), awarding the second place to the loser of the final is unjustified: any of the competitors knocked out by the tournament winner might have been the second strongest one, but they never got the chance to play against the losing finalist. In general, it is only fair to use a single-elimination tournament to determine first place. To fairly determine lower places requires some form of [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] in which each player/team gets the opportunity to face every other player/team.

Also, if the competitors' performance is variable, that is, it depends on a small, varying factor in addition to the actual strength of the competitors, then not only will it become less likely that the strongest competitor actually wins the tournament, in addition the seeding done by the tournament organizers will play a major part in deciding the winner.&lt;ref name="ryv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerge.cuni.cz/pdf/wp/Wp252.pdf|title=The Predictive Power of Noisy Elimination Tournaments|last=Ryvkin|first=Dmitry|date=March 2005|publisher=CERGE-EI|accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1061783|title=Who Can Win a Single-Elimination Tournament?|last1=Kim|first1=Michael P.|last2=Suksompong|first2=Warut|last3=Vassilevska Williams|first3=Virginia|author3-link= Virginia Vassilevska Williams |year=2017|journal=SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics|volume=31|issue=3|pages=1751–1764|doi=10.1137/16M1061783}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a random factor is always present in a real-world competition, this might easily cause accusations of unfairness.

==Other tournament systems==
Variations of the single-elimination tournament include:
* [[Double-elimination tournament]]
* [[McIntyre System]], a group of tournament formats that combine features of single- and double-elimination tournaments. Varieties of this system include:
** [[Page playoff system]] (four teams)
** [[Top five play-offs]]
** [[Top six play-offs]]
** [[McIntyre Final Eight System]]
** [[Super League play-offs]], which formerly used a McIntyre Final Eight variant
** [[AFL final eight system]], another variant of the McIntyre Final Eight, currently used by the Australian Football League
Other common tournament types include:
* [[Round-robin tournament]]
* [[Swiss-system tournament]]

'''Single-stream''' (also known as “fully commingled” or "single-sort") [[recycling]] refers to a system in which all [[paper]] fibers, plastics, metals, and other containers are mixed in a collection truck, instead of being sorted by the depositor into separate commodities ([[newspaper]], [[paperboard]], [[corrugated fiberboard]], [[plastic]], [[glass]], etc.) and handled separately throughout the collection process. In single-stream, both the collection and processing systems are designed to handle this fully commingled mixture of recyclables, with materials being separated for reuse at a [[materials recovery facility]] (MRF).&lt;ref&gt;City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation. [http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/supp_info/recycling1/what_is_single_streamrecycling.html "What is Single Stream Recycling."] Accessed 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery County, Maryland.

Single-stream recycling programs were first developed in several [[California]] communities in the 1990s. Subsequently, many large and small municipalities across the United States began single-stream programs. As of 2012, there are 248 MRFs operating in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;de Thomas, Dylan (2013-11-14).

* Reduced sorting effort by residents may mean more recyclables are [[Curbside collection|placed at the curb]] and more residents may participate in recycling;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Diehl |first=Phil |date=2013-03-05 |title=Single-stream system increases recycling |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/Mar/05/tp-single-stream-system-brings-increase-in/ |newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduced collection costs because single-compartment [[truck]]s are cheaper to purchase and operate, collection can be automated, and collection routes can be serviced more efficiently. Single-stream reduced the amount of time it takes for a driver to collect the recyclables, which reduces the driver time on the road. 
* Greater fleet flexibility, which allows single-compartment vehicles to be used to collect recycling, providing greater fleet flexibility and reducing the number of reserve vehicles needed. To avoid confusing customers, a large sign or banner is sometimes used to distinguish when a [[Garbage truck|refuse truck]] is being used to collect recycling (instead of refuse).
* Worker injuries may decrease because the switch to single-stream is often accompanied by a switch from bins to cart-based collection.
* Changing to single-stream may provide an opportunity to update the collection and processing system and to add new materials to the list of recyclables accepted; and
* More paper grades may be collected, including junk mail, [[telephone book]]s and mixed residential paper.

== Disadvantages ==
Potential disadvantages of single-stream recycling may include:
* Initial [[capital cost]] for:
** New carts
** Different collection vehicles
** Upgrading the processing facility
* Processing costs may increase compared to multiple stream systems. Overall, single-stream costs about $3 more per ton than dual-stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2004|title=Paper Recycling: Quality is Key to Long-Term Success|url=|journal=J.Poyry and Skumatz Economic Research Associates.|volume=|pages=32|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Potential for diminished public confidence if more recyclables are destined for [[landfill]] disposal because of contamination or inability to market materials.

==Single-stream system==

A single-stream system is a complex network of machinery that uses a combination of newer and older technologies to sort materials for recycling, including PET, HDPE, aluminum, tin cans, cardboard and paper.

'''List of equipment used in a single-stream system:'''
# '''Back Scraping Drum:''' spreads materials out on a conveyor belt
# '''OCC Screen:''' sorts cardboard/ old corrugated containers (OCC). Cardboard is sent to the American Baler to be baled.
# '''Fines Screen:''' all material except for cardboard go through Fines Screen. Fines Screen sorts out pieces of glass and fine materials less than two inches long. Glass is sent to the Glass Cleanup System for more separating.
# '''News Screen:''' sorts out newspaper from the rest of the recycling.
# '''Elliptical Separator:''' sorts 2D objects from 3D objects.
# '''Ferrous Magnet:''' pulls all ferrous metals to the magnet such as tin cans and steel. 
# '''Optical Sorter:''' reads the containers for PET plastic.
# '''Eddy Current Separator:''' pulls out all of the aluminum and non-ferrous materials.
# '''Two-Ram Baler:''' bales everything except for the cardboard and clear film.
# '''Glass CleanUp System:''' cleans glass coming off fines screen by pulling off all the light fractions.
# '''Closed Door Baler:''' bales the clear film plastic.
# '''Motion Floor:''' walking floor bunkers that stores corrugated and mixed paper.
# '''Single Ram Baler:''' bales all corrugated materials.

The '''social construction of gender''' is a notion in [[feminist theory|feminism]] and [[sociology]] about the operation of gender and gender differences in societies.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lindsey | first = Linda L. | chapter = The sociology of gender | chapterurl = http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0132448300.pdf | title = Gender roles: a sociological perspective | page = 4 | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston | year = 2015 | isbn = 9780205899685 | quote = Gender refers to those social, cultural, and psychological traits linked to males and females through particular social contexts.

Some supporters of this idea argue that the differences in behavior between men and women are entirely social conventions, whereas others believe that behavior is influenced by universal biological factors to varying degrees, with social conventions having a major effect on gendered behavior.

==Basic concepts==
{{See also|Socialization#Gender socialization|Sociology of gender#Gender and socialization}}

===Social constructionism===
{{main article|Social constructionism}}
The roots of the social constructionist movement in psychology are related to the criticism of the objectivism assumed by positivist/empiricist concepts of knowledge (Gergen, 1985).
Among the most popular variations of the social constructionist theories is the gender role theory, considered by Alsop, Fitzsimons and Lennon (2002) as an early form of social constructionism.
The focus on power and hierarchy reveals inspiration stemming from a Marxist framework, utilized for instance by materialist feminism, and Foucault's writings on discourse.
[[Social constructionism]], briefly, is the concept that there are many things that people "know" or take to be "reality" that are at least partially, if not completely, socially situated.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Berger | first1 = Peter | last2 = Luckmann | first2 = Thomas | title = The social construction of reality : a treatise in the sociology of knowledge | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 1966 | url = http://perflensburg.se/Berger%20social-construction-of-reality.pdf | isbn = 9780141931630 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] writes that "some categories really are social constructions: they exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist. Examples include money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | author-link = Steven Pinker | chapter = In touch with reality | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&amp;pg=PA310 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | page = 202 | publisher = Allen Lane, Penguin Books | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780713996722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic assumptions of social constructionism, as described by Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp,&lt;ref name="Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp" /&gt; are:
# ''[[Social constructionism]] is a theory of knowledge''. Social constructionism focuses on how meaning is created. Emerging from the criticism of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], social constructionism challenges concepts of knowledge put forward by [[positivism]], which postulates the externality of reality and that empirically-proved truths are mind-independent.&lt;ref name="Gergen, K. J."&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gergen | first = Kenneth J. | title = The social constructionist movement in modern psychology | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 266&amp;ndash;275 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.40.3.266 | date = March 1985 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.swarthmore.edu/Documents/faculty/gergen/Social_Constructionist_Movement.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp, knowledge is an "account of reality produced collaboratively by a community of knowers"&lt;ref name="Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp" /&gt; Thus, social constructionism focuses on how meaning is created.
# ''Knowledge is a social product''. According to Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp, knowledge is an "account of reality produced collaboratively by a community of knowers".&lt;ref name="Marecek, Crawford &amp; Popp" /&gt; Thus, social constructionists focus on how meaning is created and suggest that knowledge is not only a social product, but a product of a specifically situated society; various accounts of reality depend on place and time – in order to study knowledge as a social product, one has to historicize and contextualize the given description of reality.
# ''Power and hierarchy underlie social construction''. This focus results in showing how individuals differ in status, entitlement, efficacy, self-respect and other traits based on the kind of interactions one is involved in and subjected to.
# ''Language is at the core of knowledge''. Language is considered the building block of culture; it conveys meaning and creates the system of knowledge humans participate in. Ultimately, language has a huge influence on how humans perceive reality and, as a result, is the creator of this reality.
# ''Social construction is a dynamic process''. Social constructionists emphasize the complexity of how knowledge is created in social interactions. Knowledge and meanings are not stable or constant; they are co-constructed in interactions with others, negotiated, modified and shifted. People are active in their perception, understanding and sharing of knowledge acquired from their social milieu. It is prudent therefore to consider this process when explaining the social construction of knowledge, including knowledge concerning gender.
# ''The individual and society are indissoluble''. Social constructionists question the Western idea of an autonomous individual who can draw a clear line between the self and the society. According to social constructionism, individuals can create meaning only in relation to what they are exposed to in their environment. Paradoxically, the same individuals co-create the meanings that are available in this environment. Marecek et al. conclude therefore that the society and the individual are indissoluble and mutually constitutive.

Alsop, Fitzsimmons &amp; Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams:&lt;ref name="Alsop_Theorizing"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Alsop | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Fitzsimons | first2 = Annette | last3 = Lennon | first3 = Kathleen | chapter = The social construction of gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwxuGrcA_RgC | title = Theorizing gender | pages = 64&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745619446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Materialist theories'', which underline the structural aspects of the social environment that are responsible for perpetuating certain gender roles;
# ''Discursive theories'', which stress the creation, through language and culture, of meanings that are associated with gender.

They also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either [[Essentialism|essentialist]] or [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]]. This means that some of these theories assume a clear biological division between women and men when considering the social creation of masculinity and femininity, while other contest the assumption of the biological division between the sexes as independent of social construction.

===Gender===
{{main article|Gender}}
Gender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not a personal trait; it is "an emergent feature of social situations: both as an outcome of and a rationale for various social arrangements, and as a means of legitimating one of the most fundamental divisions of society."&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]

Contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, proposes treating gender as an activity ("doing") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These "gender activities" constitute our belonging to a sex as based on the socially accepted dichotomy of "women" and "men". It is noted, however, that these activities are not always perceived (by the audience) as being either "masculine" or "feminine", they are at constant risk of being assessed as more or less "womanly" or "manly"; ultimately, any behavior may be judged based upon its "manly" or "womanly" nature. "Doing gender" is in fact based on these interactions that are constituted of ongoing assessments in various situations. This in turn points to the situational nature of gender rather than its inherent, essentialist and individual nature.

====Gender roles====
[[Gender roles]] are often centred around the conceptions of femininity or masculinity.  In our society today, women are socialized as being the caretakers of the house, who nurture the children, cook and clean.  With men, they "should" be the workhorse, the provider, protector, a leader, and a teacher to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-roles-of-woman-as-leader-and-housewife-2167-0374-1000125.php?aid=55999}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical investigations suggest that gender roles are "social constructs that vary significantly across time, context, and culture".{{refn|name=Levant &amp; Alto}} [[Ronald F. Levant]] and Kathleen Alto write: {{quote |A recent synthesis of meta-analytic studies of gender differences provides strong evidence for a social construct understanding of gender. Ethan Zell and colleagues examined more than 20,000 findings from 12 million participants comparing men and women on topics ranging from risk-taking to body image. The authors found that the majority of effects were very small to small, indicating far more similarities than differences between genders.&lt;ref name="Levant &amp; Alto"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levant |first1=R.F. |last2=Alto |first2=K.M. |editor=Nadal, Kevin L. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Psychology and Gender |date=2017 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-48-338427-6 |page=718 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVYoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA718&amp;lpg=PA718&amp;dq=%22studies+of+gender+differences%22 |chapter=Gender Role Strain Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A study in 2017 found that health risks are set by the behaviors that are instilled in males and females by the time they're 10 or 11.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/20/health/geas-gender-stereotypes-study/index.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles, according to Berkowitz, are an acceptance of social construction as it pertains to gender and the roles we perform.  "The gender order is hierarchical in that, overall, men dominate women in terms of power and privilege; yet multiple and conflicting sources of power and oppression are intertwined, and not all men dominate all women. Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways".&lt;ref&gt;(Berkowitz 133){{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constructionism of gender and stereotyped roles can be examined through a given environment. A certain gendered patriarchy turns abstraction into material reality. This reality is negotiated into each interaction we have. For example, based on a simulation discussed in “Walk Like a Man, Talk Like a Woman”, the simulation used “demonstrates the social constructiveness of gender, maintaining that gender should be conceptualized and portrayed as a process, system of stratification, and social structure”.&lt;ref&gt;(Berkowitz 1){{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceptions of the social world in which these students view the world around them is as an “objective reality rather than as a product of human interaction and interpretation that is institutionalized and transformed over time”.&lt;ref&gt;(Berkowitz 1){{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most powerful notions that this simulation encourages is teaching from a constructionist perspective that requires instructors to “challenge perceptions by requiring students to unpack the “hows and whys” of sociological phenomena”.&lt;ref&gt;(Berkowitz 1){{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender identity and sexuality/sexual orientation====
{{Wiktionary|gender identity}}

[[Lisa M. Diamond]] argues that [[gender identity]] is not a stable, fixed trait – rather, it is socially constructed and may vary over time for an individual.&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3 |title=Questioning Gender and Sexual Identity: Dynamic Links over Time |journal=Sex Roles |volume=59 |issue=5–6 |pages=365–376 |year=2008 |last1=Diamond |first1=Lisa M |last2=Butterworth |first2=Molly }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]] and Bussey shows that kids want to be like others of their sex. Social [[conformity]] has been widely studied on adolescents. Results showed that 6-year-old children tend to conform to choices that their peers find more popular. They begin labeling objects as "for girls" or "for boys" and conform to what is expected of them. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5175193|year=2016|last1=Sun|first1=S|title=Social conformity persists at least one day in 6-year-old children|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=39588|last2=Yu|first2=R|doi=10.1038/srep39588|pmid=28000745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bussey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bussey | first1 = Kay | last2 = Bandura | first2 = Albert | author-link = Albert Bandura | title = Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation | journal = [[Psychological Review]] | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 676&amp;ndash;713 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.676 | pmid = 10560326 | date = October 1999 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; West and Zimmerman argue that the notion of womanhood or femininity is accomplished through an active process of creating gender through interacting with others in a particular social context.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt; Society typically only recognizes two genders.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Therefore, when transgender individuals want to have a sex change operation, they must prove that they can "pass" as a man or woman{{Disputed inline |text=they must prove that they can "pass" |for=The WPATH SOC criteria for SRS have no such requirement to "pass" |reason=sounds like the editor who added this is confusing RLE/RLT and "passing" but they are not at all the same, and passing is definitely not required |date=December 2017}} – so even the choice of changing one's gender is socially constructed.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In recent years, elementary schools in the U.S. have started carrying chapter books that include either non-traditional families with same-sex parents, homosexual role models, or (in fewer cases) an adolescent who is dealing with their own sexuality/sexual orientation. Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan acknowledge this rise in representation, while critiquing the way that the limited selection of books present these characters with an eye towards popularized characterizations of homosexuality.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan|first=Jill M. and Caitlin L.|date=December 2016|title=Queering Chapter Books with LGBT Characters for Young Readers: Recognizing and Complicating Representations of Homonormativity|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=37|pages=846-866|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors characterize this style of representation as "Homonormative," and in the only example of a book where the protagonist questions their gender identity, it is left ambiguous as to whether or not they are a transman or that they were simply pretending.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Diamond and Butterworth argue that gender identity and sexual identity are fluid and do not always fall into two essentialist categories (man or woman and gay or straight); they came to this conclusion via interviews with sexual minority women over the course of ten years.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; One woman had a relatively normal early childhood but around adolescence questioned her sexuality and remained stable in her gender and sexual identity until she started working with men and assumed a masculine "stance" and started to question her gender identity.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; When 'she' became a 'he' he began to find men attractive and gradually identified as a homosexual man.

The perception of sexuality by others is an extension of others' perceptions of one's gender. Heterosexuality is assumed for those individuals who appear to act appropriately masculine or appropriately feminine. If one wants to be perceived as a lesbian, one must first be perceived as a woman; if one wants to be seen as a gay man, one has to be seen as a man.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

=====Core gender identity=====
The sense of one's gender identity is acquired through the internalization of external knowledge.{{Cn|date=May 2018}}  However, it is in fact never fully acquired – it has to be constantly performed and reenacted in social interactions.{{cn|date=May 2018}}  According to Alsop, Fitzsimmons &amp; Lennon, "Gender is part of an identity woven from a complex and specific social whole, and requiring very specific and local readings".&lt;ref name="Alsop_Theorizing" /&gt;{{rp|86}} Thus, gender identity can be defined as part of socially situated understanding of gender. LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, "gender identity" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = LaFrance | first1 = Marianne | last2 = Paluck | first2 = Elizabeth Levy  | last3 = Brescoll | first3 = Victoria | chapter = Sex changes: a current perspective on the psychology of gender | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-014 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 328&amp;ndash;344 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Intersections of gender identity with other identities=====

The way gender is constructed for an individual depends on gendered interactions the individual has with others as well as other identities or roles he or she may have. Gender, race, class, and other oppressions are all potential omnirelevant categories, though they are not ALL identically salient in every set of social relationships in which inequality is done.{{Clarify|date=August 2014}} Multiple oppressions are not seen as having "additive" or "multiplicative" effects but are seen as simultaneously depending on each other to create a unique form of oppression. Although West and Fenstermaker do not elaborate on exactly how intersectionality can be incorporated into social constructionist theory, they do say that intersecting social identities are constant "interactional accomplishments".&lt;ref name="F&amp;W_Institutional"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Reply - (re)doing difference | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&amp;pg=PA95 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 95&amp;ndash;104 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}

While men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hurtado | first = Aída | title = Relating to privilege: seduction and rejection in the subordination of white women and women of color | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Women in Culture and Society]], special issue: Common Grounds and Crossroads: Race, Ethnicity, and Class in Women's Lives | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 833&amp;ndash;855 | doi = 10.1086/4945464 | jstor = 3174686  | date = Summer 1989 | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-31 }} [https://www.academia.edu/18709632/Relating_to_privilege_Seduction_and_rejection_in_the_subordination_of_white_women_and_women_of_color|doi=10.1086/494546 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the "patriarchal invitation to privilege".&lt;ref name="F&amp;W_Accomplish"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Power, inequality, and the accomplishment of gender: an ethnomethodological view | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&amp;pg=PR5 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | page = 52 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have with white women. White women are accountable for their gendered display as traditionally subservient to white men while women of color may be held accountable for their gendered performance as sexual objects and as [[wikt:recalcitrant|recalcitrant]] and [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] women in relations with white men. West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's "relational position" to white men.&lt;ref name="F&amp;W_Accomplish" /&gt;

====Gender as accomplishment====

Gender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does – it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : "the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt;{{rp|127}} People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. [[Doing gender|"Doing" gender]] is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles – it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.

The performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent – roles  are "situated identities" instead of "master identities".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt;{{rp|131}} The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people "know" as "reality" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives. In other words, individual perceptions of ""knowledge" or reality...must be the central focus."&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt;

These performances normalize the essentialism of sex categories. In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender – that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).

Institutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained – "both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations".&lt;ref name="Mumby"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mumby | first = Dennis K. | title = Organizing men: power, discourse, and the social construction of masculinity(s) in the workplace | journal = [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 164&amp;ndash;183, 169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00216.x | date = May 1998 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby&lt;ref name="Mumby"/&gt; argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior. This can be said for constructions of any identity in certain contexts (e.g. femininity, race, Black femininity, etc.).

====Accountability====

People hold themselves and each other accountable for their presentations of gender (how they 'measure up'). They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garfinkel | first = Harold | title = Studies in ethnomethodology | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | origyear = 1967 | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745600055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.

Accountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate – it is the ''possibility'' of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a [[machismo]] masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00265.x |title=Doing Machismo: Legitimating Speech Acts as a Selection Discourse |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=105–123 |year=2005 |last1=Stobbe |first1=Lineke |url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/33804/1/178738.pdf |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00263.x |title=The Third Sex: Women Leaders in Australian Agriculture |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |pages=73–88 |year=2005 |last1=Pini |first1=Barbara }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0959353505051728 |title=Making Sense of Gender, Age, Power and Disciplinary Position: Intersecting Discourses in the Academy |journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=189–208 |year=2016 |last1=Søndergaard |first1=Dorte Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though gender seems more salient in some situations – for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession – gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious. For instance, gender is maintained before the woman enters the male-dominated group through conceptions of masculinity.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt;{{rp|128–129}}

Race, class, and other oppressions can also be omnirelevant categories, though they are not ''all'' identically salient in every set of social relationships in which inequality is done. People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.).&lt;ref name="F&amp;W_Institutional" /&gt;{{rp|96}} This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context. Gender is created in different ways among uneducated and educated African Americans.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0891243206293577 |title=Undoing Gender |journal=Gender &amp; Society |volume=21 |pages=106–127 |year=2016 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Francine M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and sex category===

West and Zimmerman give this definition for sex in their paper ''Doing Gender'': "Sex is a determination made through the application of socially agreed upon biological criteria for classifying persons as females and males. The criteria for classification can be genitalia at birth or chromosomal typing before birth, and they do not necessarily agree with one another".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt; The differentiation between gender and sex did not arise until the late 1970s, when researchers began using "gender" and "sex" as two separate terms, with "gender" referring to one's self-identity and "sex" referring to one's chromosomal makeup and sex organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = DeFrancisco | first1 = Victoria Pruin | last2 = Palczewski | first2 = Catherine Helen | chapter = Developing a critical gender/sex lens | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xbGNAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 | title = Gender in communication: a critical introduction | page = 11 | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc. | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2014 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781452220093 }}

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] addresses the issues facing intersex people in her article ''The Five Sexes''. She claims that there is at minimum five sexes but probably more; this is based on the vast range of ways bodies show up in nature. She points out that, "recent advances in physiology and surgical technology now enable physicians to catch most intersexuals at birth...infants are entered into a program of hormonal and surgical management..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fausto-Sterling | first = Anne | author-link = Anne Fausto-Sterling | title = The five sexes: why male and female are not enough | journal = [[The Sciences]] | pages = 20&amp;ndash;24 | doi = 10.1002/j.2326-1951.1993.tb03081.x | date = March–April 1993 | url = http://capone.mtsu.edu/phollowa/5sexes.html | ref = harv | postscript = . | volume=33| issue = 2 }} [http://www.fd.unl.pt/docentes_docs/ma/TPB_MA_5937.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights the intense adherence to the binary instead of allowing bodies to present in the world without intervention.

West and Zimmerman also give a definition for sex category: "achieved through application of the sex criteria, but in everyday life, categorization is established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category".&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt; Sex category is applied to a person in everyday life through commonly recognized cues that are not necessarily fulfilling biological criteria of sex.

==Applications of gender performance==

The term "gender performativity" was first coined in American philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book ''[[Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith|authorlink=Judith Butler | chapter = Subversive bodily acts, IV Bodily Inscriptions, Performative Subversions | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity |page=179 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York |origyear=1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gender Trouble'', Butler sets out to criticize what she considers to be an outdated perception of gender. This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of performativity and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that "gender proves to be performance—that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith|authorlink=Judith Butler  | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity |page=25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York |origyear=1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: "When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way…To say that gender is performative is a little different…For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman…we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2016 | title= Judith Butler: Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler states that "there is no 'being' behind doing… 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed – the deed is everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.

On Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in [[Drag (clothing)#Drag kings and queens|drag]] performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where "there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today".&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Critically queer | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&amp;ndash;32 | doi = 10.1215/10642684-1-1-17 | date = November 1993 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent. Rather, Butler suggests that what is performed "can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility".&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler" /&gt;{{rp|24}}

[[Amelia Jones]] proposes that this mode of viewing gender offered a way to move beyond the theories of the [[gaze]] and [[sexual fetishism]], which had attained much prominence in academic feminism, but which by the 1980s Jones viewed as outdated methods of understanding women's societal status. Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Amelia | editor-link = Amelia Jones | title = The feminism and visual culture reader | page = 370 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415267069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy and young childhood===

The idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know "the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling &amp; Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | page = 183 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Susan D. |title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles |url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled ''Language and Gender'', states: "the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking".&lt;ref name="Language and Gender"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Penelope | last2 = McConnell-Ginet | first2 = Sally | title = Language and gender | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2013 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781107659360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because "sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering".&lt;ref name="Language and Gender"/&gt; Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy.

Butler suggests in both "Critically Queer" and "Melancholy Gender",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = The psychic life of power: theories in subjection | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780804728126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[melancholia]], such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that "a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself".&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

===Teen years===

One's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, "When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys…".&lt;ref name="Language and Gender" /&gt;{{rp|275}} This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburg|first=Patti M.|last2=Peter|first2=Jochen|date=February 2011|title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=48|issue=2|pages=121–127|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|issn=1054-139X}}&lt;/ref&gt;Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance.

=== Queer Identity ===
The Butlerian model presents a queer perspective on gender performance and explores the possible intersection between socially constructed gender roles and compulsory heterosexuality. This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim as heteronormative, contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIvor|first=David W.|date=2012|title=Bringing Ourselves to Grief: Judith Butler and the Politics of Mourning|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41703076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Political Theory|volume=40|issue=4|pages=409-436|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as [[ACT UP]] during the AIDS crisis. Many of the survivors that participated in this activism were homosexuals whom has lost their partners to the disease. The survivors commemorated the dead by quilting together their rags, repurposing their possessions, and displaying their own bodies for premature mourning. All of these protests amounted to a message that some part of them will be left in the world after they have expired&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Julia|date=Fall 1992|title=AIDS, Stigma, and Narratives of Containment|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26304009|journal=American Imago|volume=49|issue=3|pages=293-310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Queer Failure is a concept in queer theory that also calls gender into question, because it examines queer art and the bodies of LGBTQ+ people through the lens of what a parental figure may identify as "failure" on the part of their character. Instead of recognizing these instances as moral or psychological failures, this concept frames them as the resultants of a conflict between a person's sexuality and their gender&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takemoto|first=Tina|date=Spring 2016|title=Queer Art / Queer Failure|url=|journal=Art Journal|volume=75|issue=1|pages=85-88|doi=10.1080/00043249.2016.1171547|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Political potential and limits ===
Butler suggests that "[t]he critical promise of drag does not have to do with the proliferation of genders…but rather with the exposure of the failure of heterosexual regimes ever fully to legislate or contain their own ideals", although such remarks fail to indicate how the inadequacies of heterosexual regimes might be explicitly exposed.&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler" /&gt;{{rp|26}} {{failed verification|date=October 2015}}{{Original research inline|date=October 2015}}

According to Butler, gender performance is only subversive because it is "the kind of effect that resists calculation", which is to say that signification is [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicitous]], that the subject is unable to control it, and so subversion is always occurring and always unpredictable.&lt;ref name="GLQ_Butler" /&gt;{{rp|29}} Moya Lloyd suggests that the political potential of gender performances can be evaluated relative to similar past acts in similar contexts in order to assess their transgressive potential: "Even if we accept that there are incalculable effects to all (or most) statements or activities, this does not mean that we need to concede that there are no calculable effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lloyd | first = Moya | authorlink = Moya Lloyd | title = Performativity, parody, politics | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | page = 207 | doi = 10.1177/02632769922050476 | date = April 1999 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Rosalyn Diprose]] lends a hard-line [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] interpretation to her understanding of gender performance's political reach, as one's identity "is built on the invasion of the self by the gestures of others, who, by referring to other others, are already social beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diprose | first = Rosalyn | authorlink = Rosalyn Diprose | title = The bodies of women: ethics, embodiment, and sexual difference | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780415097833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diprose implies that the individual's will, and the individual performance, is always subject to the dominant discourse of an Other (or Others), so as to restrict the transgressive potential of performance to the inscription of simply another dominant discourse.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Martha Nussbaum]] criticizes Butler's concepts of gender performativity as a misguided retreat from engaging with real-world concerns:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha C. | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = The professor of parody | journal = [[The New Republic]] | url = http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Nussbaum-Butler-Critique-NR-2-99.pdf | date = 22 February 1999 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Butler suggests to her readers that this sly send-up of the ''status quo'' is the only script for resistance that life offers [...] Butlerian feminism is in many ways easier than the old feminism. It tells scores of talented young women that they need not work on changing the law, or feeding the hungry, or assailing power through theory harnessed to material politics. They can do politics in safety of their campuses, remaining on the symbolic level, making subversive gestures at power through speech and gesture. This, the theory says, is pretty much all that is available to us anyway, by way of political action, and isn't it exciting and sexy?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==During development==
Gender features strongly in most societies and is a significant aspect of self-definition for most people.&lt;ref name="Springer New York"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bussey | first = Kay | chapter = Gender identity development | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LkREWoAUrAUC&amp;pg=PA602 | editor1-last = Schwartz | editor1-first = Seth J. | editor2-last = Luyckx | editor2-first = Koen | editor3-last = Vignoles | editor3-first = Vivian L. | title = Handbook of identity theory and research |page=603 | publisher = Springer | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781441979889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to analyze the social influences that affect the development of gender is through the perspective of the social cognitive theory. According to Kay Bussey, social cognitive theory describes "how gender conceptions are developed and transformed across the life span".&lt;ref name="Springer New York"/&gt; The social cognitive theory views gender roles as socially constructed ideas that are obtained over one's entire lifetime. These gender roles are "repeatedly reinforced through socialization".&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackman|first=Heather W. | chapter = Chapter 5, Sexism: Introduction | chapter-url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/818464801 | editor1-last = Adams | editor1-first = Maurianne | editor2-last = et al | title = Readings for diversity and social justice | page = 318 | publisher = Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group | location = New York | year = 2013 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9780415892940 }} Preview of [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xltVgiCSFaUC&amp;pg=PA199 earlier edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hackman verifies that these gender roles are instilled in us from "the moment we are born".&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; For the individual, gender construction starts with assignments to a sex category on the basis of biological genitalia at birth.&lt;ref name="Lorber1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorber|first=Judith | chapter = Chapter 5, Sexism: 'Night to his day': the social construction of gender | chapter-url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/818464801 | editor1-last = Adams | editor1-first = Maurianne | editor2-last = et al | title = Readings for diversity and social justice | page = 324 | publisher = Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group | location = New York | year = 2013 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9780415892940 }} Preview of [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xltVgiCSFaUC&amp;pg=PA204 earlier edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this sexual assignment, parents begin to influence gender identity by dressing children in ways that clearly display this biological category. Therefore, biological sex becomes associated with a gender through naming, dress, and the use of other gender markers.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; Gender development continues to be affected by the outlooks of others, education institutions, parenting, media, etc. These variations of social interactions force individuals to "learn what is expected, see what is expected, act and react in expected ways, and thus simultaneously construct and maintain the gender order".&lt;ref name="Lorber2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorber|first=Judith | chapter = Chapter 5, Sexism: 'Night to his day': the social construction of gender | oclc=818464801 | editor1-last = Adams | editor1-first = Maurianne | editor2-last = et al | title = Readings for diversity and social justice | page = 327 | publisher = Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group | location = New York | year = 2013 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9780415892940 }} Preview of [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xltVgiCSFaUC&amp;pg=PA207 earlier edition (p. 208.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender-based harassment===
In high schools, gender-based harassment serves as a form of gender boundary policing. Girls are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are boys. Both male and female students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through [[bullying]]. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to [[machismo]] that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys.&lt;ref name="Martino"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Martino | first1 = Wayne | last2 = Pallota-Chiarollo | first2 = Maria | title = Being normal is the only way to be: adolescent perspectives on gender and school | publisher = UNSW Press | location = Sydney, NSW | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780868407708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls.&lt;ref name="Martino" /&gt; This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset. The way in which girls harass other girls is through gossiping, instead of confronting the other girls directly. Unique appearances and attempts to stand out among girls are regarded very negatively.&lt;ref name="Eder"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eder | first = Donna | title = School talk: gender and adolescent culture | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780813521794 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of female on female bullying sets the standard for appearance norms and the importance of appearance for females. Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of high school students by high school students.

===Adolescent view of adulthood===

Gender is a [[cultural]] construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints.  Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear [[gender difference]]s because "higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys".&lt;ref name="Crockett, Lisa J. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crockett | first1 = Lisa J. | last2 = Beal | first2 = Sarah J. | title = The life course in the making: gender and the development of adolescents' expected timing of adult role transitions | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 1727&amp;ndash;1738 | doi = 10.1037/a0027538 | pmid = 22448985 | date = November 2012 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; With "young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls. Crocket and Beal in their article "The Life Course in the Making: Gender and the Development of Adolescents", "gender differences in the anticipated timing of future role transitions, the impact of expectations and values on these  expected timings, and the extent to which expectations foreshadow actual behavior".&lt;ref name="Crockett, Lisa J. 2012"/&gt; The actions of a youth in high school greatly impact the choices the individual will have over a lifetime. Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of [[motherhood]].

Males can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity. According to [[Jack Halberstam]] (under the name Judith), people correlate masculinity with "maleness and to power to domination”, something that he believes is a result of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Halberstam | first = Judith | title = Female masculinity | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 1998 |language=en |url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/gustafson/FILM%20165A.W11/film%20165A%5BW11%5D%20readings%20/halbertsammasculinity.pdf | isbn = 9780822322436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 study published in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', researchers stated that gender construct can differ depending on the man's race or ethnicity and stated that for white men there was an emphasis on "education,employment, and socioeconomic status" whereas the expectations for black men focused on "sexual prowess, physical dominance, and gamesmanship”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Errol Lamont |last2=Bogart |first2=Laura M. |last3=Smith |first3=Katherine C. |last4=Malebranche |first4=David J. |last5=Ellen |first5=Jonathan |last6=Schuster |first6=Mark A. | title = "I always felt I had to prove my manhood": homosexuality, masculinity, gender role strain, and HIV risk among young Black men who have sex with men | journal = [[American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 122&amp;ndash;131 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2013.301866 | pmid = 24832150 | date = January 2015 | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmc=4265897}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations can make it harder for males to display emotions without receiving criticism and being seen as less of a man.

Adolescents view on [[adulthood]] is also determined by their employment in high school. Many boys work during high school and "unlike young women, young men who had not worked during high school did not quite match their peers".&lt;ref name="Mortimer 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mortimer | first = Jeylan | title = Working and growing up in America | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780674016149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many other boys are working, those who don't work may not be as successful after graduation.  In the book ''Working and Growing Up in America'', Jeylan T. Mortimer explains "youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more [[vocation]]ally successful after leaving high school".&lt;ref name="Mortimer 2005" /&gt; This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Marsh | first = Herbert W. | title = Employment during high school: character building or a subversion of academic goals? | journal = [[Sociology of Education (journal)|Sociology of Education]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 172&amp;ndash;189 | doi = 10.2307/2112850 | jstor = 2112850 | date = July 1991 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work.

===Depression===

High school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents. High school is a large transitional period for teenagers causing them to "cope with these various transitions in different ways; some negotiate the passages easily whereas others develop serious behavioral and psychological problems".&lt;ref name="Negriff, Sonya 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Negriff | first1 = Sonya | last2 = Susman | first2 = Elizabeth J. | title = Pubertal timing, depression, and externalizing problems: a framework, review, and examination of gender differences | journal = [[Journal of Research on Adolescence]] | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 717&amp;ndash;746 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00708.x | date = September 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these psychological problems is [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  While the environment of high school can be stressful biological functions also play a large role is [[psychological well-being]]. Negriff and  Susman explain in their article "Pubertal Timing, Depression, and Externalizing Problems" that "the same [[hormone]]s that increase during [[puberty]] are also related to depression and aggressive tendencies. Higher levels of [[testosterone]] are associated with increased [[aggression]] in boys and girls, whereas higher [[estrogen]] for girls is associated with increased depressive symptoms".&lt;ref name="Negriff, Sonya 2011"/&gt; The gender differences observed may not just be due to the cultural expectations, but rather a biological function of the sex the individuals are born with. Self-esteem has also been linked to depression in high school students. One study done by James Battle in 1980 took 26 student ages 15–18 showed a correlation between depression and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Battle"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Battle | first = James | title = Relationship between self-esteem and depression among high school students | journal = [[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 157&amp;ndash;158 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1980.51.1.157 | pmid = 7432952 | date = June 1980 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 80s, research had not looked past adults and Battle's research was some of the first of its kind which showed a direct correlation between self-esteem and depression.&lt;ref name="Battle" /&gt; [[Self-esteem]] is not a product of our biology but rather is culturally constructed.&lt;ref name="Battle" /&gt; Girls in high school also tend to have lower self-esteem due to body image.&lt;ref name="Gram 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = Melody A. | last2 = Eich | first2 = Carla | last3 = Kephart | first3 = Becky | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Dawn | title = Relationship among body image, sex, and popularity of high school students | journal = [[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] | volume = 90 | issue = 3s | pages = 1187&amp;ndash;1193 | doi = 10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1187 | pmid = 10939068 | date = June 2000 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; With depression and self-esteem being so closely linked the potential for having the disease can result in an educational experience which can be compromised. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] can be isolating, and without proper academics and societal support, high school can be challenging. Along with higher rates of [[self-esteem]] issues in adolescents, this can adversely affect girls' academics and social life in high school.

===Body image===

High school is a major transitional period for girls and boys as their bodies transition into men and women. The end of high school is usually marked by the 18th birthday, a major milestone in an individual's life. Boys and girls go through this transformation within high school where each gender faces body satisfaction differently. There are many different factors that affect [[body image]], "including [[sex]], [[mass media|media]], parental relationship, and [[puberty]] as well as weight and popularity".&lt;ref name="Gram 2000"/&gt; The [[intersectionality]] of these factors causes unique experiences for adolescents during this period within their lives. As their body changes, so does the environment in which they live in. Body image is closely linked to [[psychological well-being]] during adolescence and can cause harmful effects when a child has body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name="Winefield"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Delfabbro | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = Winefield | first2 = Anthony H. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Hammarström | first4 = Anne | last5 = Winefield | first5 = Helen | title = Body image and psychological well-being in adolescents: the relationship between gender and school type | journal = [[The Journal of Genetic Psychology]] | volume = 172 | issue = 1 | pages = 67&amp;ndash;83 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.2010.517812 | pmid = 21452753 | date = 2011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Winfield in her article "Body Image and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents: The Relationship between Gender and School Type" explains an adolescences high school experience is closely linked to their perceived [[body image]]. She analyzed over 336 teenagers and found "ratings of [[physical attractiveness]] and body image remain relatively stable across the early teenage years, but become increasingly negative around age 15–18 years because of pubertal changes".&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt; This shift during the high school years can cause serious psychological problems for adolescence.  These psychological problems can manifest as [[bulimia]] and [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] causing serious lifelong problems.&lt;ref name="Winefield" /&gt; These body image issues are especially prevalent in girls but as boys enter [[puberty]] expectations of height and muscle mass change as well.  Geoffrey H. Cohane, Harrison G. Pope Jr. in their article "Body image in boys: A review of the literature" argue "girls typically wanted to be thinner, boys frequently wanted to be bigger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohane | first1 = Geoffrey H. | last2 = Pope | first2 =  Harrison G. | title = Body image in boys: A review of the literature | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 373&amp;ndash;379 | doi = 10.1002/eat.1033 | pmid = 11285574 | date = May 2001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, they argue, shows the gender difference in body image cause different beauty ideals. An adolescent's gender affects their body image and their high school experience.

===Education===
{{See also|Sex and psychology#Mathematics}}
Due to the amount of time that children spend in school, "teachers are influential role models for many aspects of children's educational experiences, including gender socialization".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garrahy | first = Deborah A. | title = Three third-grade teachers' gender-related beliefs and behavior | journal = [[Elementary School Journal|The Elementary School Journal]] | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 81&amp;ndash;94 | doi = 10.1086/499694 | jstor = 1002170 | date = September 2001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers who endorse the culturally dominant gender-role stereotype regarding the distribution of talent between males and females distort their perception of their students' mathematical abilities and effort resources in mathematics, in a manner that is consistent with their gender-role stereotype and to a greater extent than teachers who do not endorse the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tiedemann | first = Joachim | title = Teachers' gender stereotypes as determinants of teacher perceptions in elementary school mathematics | journal = [[Educational Studies in Mathematics]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;62 | doi = 10.1023/A:1020518104346 | jstor = 3483051 | date = May 2002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1994 report ''[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]'' by the [[American Psychological Association]], "[m]ost standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males." Differences have been found, however, in specific areas such as mathematics and verbal measures.&lt;ref name="lrainc.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neisser | first1 = Ulric | last2 = et al | title = Intelligence: knowns and unknowns | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 77&amp;ndash;101 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77 | date = February 1996 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even within mathematics, it is noted that significant differences in performance as a result of gender do not occur until late in high school, a result of [[Sex differences in humans|biological differences]], the exhibition of stereotypes by teachers, and the difference in chosen coursework between individual students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leahey | first1 = Erin | last2 = Guo | first2 = Guang | title = Gender differences in mathematical trajectories | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 713&amp;ndash;732 | doi = 10.1353/sof.2001.0102 | jstor = 2675595 | date = December 2001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, on average, boys and girls perform similarly in math, boys are over represented among the very best performers as well as the very worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Winstein | first = Keith J. | title = Boys' math scores hit highs and lows | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121691806472381521 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | location = New York | date = July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benbow | first1 = Camilla Persson | last2 = Lubinski | first2 = David | last3 = Shea | first3 = Daniel L. | last4 = Eftekhari-Sanjani | first4 = Hossain | title = Sex differences in mathematical reasoning ability at age 13: their status 20 years later | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 474&amp;ndash;480 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00291 | date = November 2000 | ref = harv | postscript = .| url = https://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/ps/math_20years.pdf | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers have found that when certain types of teaching (such as experiments that reflect daily life), work for girls, they generally work for boys as well.&lt;ref name="Campbell and McGee-Bailey"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McGee Bailey | first1 = Susan | last2 = Campbell | first2 = Patricia B. | chapter = The gender wars in education | chapterurl = http://www.campbell-kibler.com/Gender_Wars.htm | title = Research and action report | publisher = Wellesley Centers for Women | location = Wellesley, Massachusetts |date=February 9, 1999 | id = 1999/2(X)0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although little difference in mathematics performance was found among younger students, a study of students grade 1-3 by Fennema et al. noted that significant differences in problem-solving strategies were found, with girls tending to use more standard [[algorithm]]s than the boys.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fennema | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Carpenter | first2 = Thomas P. | last3 = Jacobs | first3 = Victoria R. | last4 = Franke | first4 = Megan L. | last5 = Levi | first5 = Linda W. | title = New perspectives on gender differences in mathematics: a reprise | journal = [[Educational Researcher]] | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 19&amp;ndash;21 | doi = 10.3102/0013189x027005019 | jstor = 1176737 | date = July 1998 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that this may be due to both the teachers' stereotypical beliefs about mathematics and gender, as well as the study's design permitting "the children's stereotypical beliefs to influence strategy use and thus the development of understanding in these classrooms".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A study conducted at Illinois State University examined the effects of gender stereotypes on the teaching practices of three third grade teachers, noting that "[the teachers] claimed [[gender neutrality]], yet they expressed numerous beliefs about gender difference during the study", such as allowing boys (but not girls) to respond to questions without raising their hand or providing reading selections that promoted women in non-traditional roles, but not doing the same for men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Overall, differences in student performance that arise from gender tend to be smaller than that of other [[Demography|demographic]] differences, such as race or [[Social class|socioeconomic class]].&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Patricia B. | last2 = Storo | first2 = Jennifer N. | title = Girls are... boys are... : myths, stereotypes &amp; gender differences | publisher = Office of Educational Research and Improvement, U.S. Department of Education / Women's Educational Equity Act Resource Center | location = Newton, Massachusetts | url = http://www.campbell-kibler.com/stereo.pdf | year = 1996 | oclc = 52689711}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the 1992 [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|NAEP]] 12th grade science tests, on a 500-point scale, show that the differences of scores between white and African American students were around 48 points, while differences between male and female students were around 11 points.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

=== Media ===
Social gender construction (specifically for younger audiences) is also influenced by media. In the 21st century, modern technology is abundant in developed countries. In 2018, roughly 42% of tweens and teens experience feelings of anxiety when not near their phones. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/08/22/how-teens-and-parents-navigate-screen-time-and-device-distractions/|title=How Teens and Parents Navigate Screen Time and Device Distractions {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2018-08-22|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;There is a growing amount of teens that spend an average of 6.5 hours on media daily. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/8010.pdf|title=Media in the Lives of 8- to 18-Year-Olds|last=Rideout|first=Victoria et al.|date=January 2010|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;This data reflects how much of a teenager's personality is dependent on media.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Media influencing gender construction can be seen in advertising, social networking, magazines, television, music, and music videos.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

These platforms can affect how a developing human views themselves and those around them. There is both positive and negative media and each type can be perceived differently. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/entertainment-technology/media/media-influence-on-teens|title=Media influence on teenagers|last=Powell|first=Anastasia|date=12 July 2017|website=Raising Children Network Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media will often portray men and women in a stereotypical manner, reflecting their "ideal image" for society. These images often act as an extreme expectation for many developing teenagers.

Men are typically portrayed as assertive, powerful, and strong. Particularly in television, men are usually shown as being nonemotional and detached. Women are often portrayed as the opposite. Gender roles are generally more enforced for women in media than they are for men. Women are typically represented as the backbone of the household, the caretaker, and often even as stay at home mothers. Females in media are often given weak, dependent, and passive personalities. Media presence often perpetuates that men are not allowed to be caring and that women are not allowed to be strong and demanding. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Julia|date=1994|title=Gendered Media: The Influence of Media

=== Speech ===
Anatomical studies have shown that the larynx of a child, and by extension the fundamental frequency, is likely to vary directly as a result of size and height, rather than sex.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sachs | first1 = Jacqueline | last2 = Lieberman | first2 = Philip | last3 = Erickson | first3 = Donna | chapter = Anatomical and cultural determinants of male and female speech | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HThInAEACAAJ | editor1-last = Fasold | editor1-first = Ralph W. | editor2-last = Shuy | editor2-first = Roger W. | title = Language attitudes: current trends and prospects | pages = 74&amp;ndash;83 | publisher = Georgetown University Press | location = Washington | year = 1973 | oclc = 301750197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs et al. suggest that if there is no difference between the size of the articulatory mechanism in children, differences in [[formant]] production between boys and girls may be a result of "culturally determined patterns that are viewed as appropriate for each sex" and a result of the speaker's deliberate phonetic variation in vowel production or changing the configuration of the lips.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Research methods==

Inclusiveness and acceptance play significant roles in social constructionist practice – examples include sharing work with others in a cooperative manner, including a diverse sample, being open to other interpretations of data, and blurring the lines between scientific research, participatory research and social activism.&lt;ref name="Gergen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gergen, M.|year=2001|title=Feminist reconstructions in psychology: Narrative, gender, and performance|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blurring of scientific research also means incorporating other disciplines into psychological work (e.g. performative psychology includes artistic expression or humor) and thinking in terms that go beyond traditional scientific language.&lt;ref name="Gergen"/&gt; These methods are not currently valued in psychology because they are not seen as "scientific."

A social constructionist psychologist can make it explicit that his or her perspective is not universally true in all contexts across historical periods. Social constructionists recognize that every researcher has an opinion and is biased in some way. They acknowledge that their own views and findings/results of a study are open to deconstructive critique – no grand truth can be found because everything is context-specific and has potential to change across time periods and different situations. Related to this is the idea that social constructionists must constantly question their own work because their work can be constantly reinterpreted and have different meanings at different times.&lt;ref name="Gergen"/&gt;

The gender dichotomy is so ingrained that it is impossible for research findings to remain unaffected by it.  People are often convinced that there are inherent differences between men and women, which skews both studies and their findings.  That is, research questions are framed in ways that look for a difference between genders, and thus their methods will be constrained by this framework as well.&lt;ref name="Language and Gender" /&gt; Moreover, the actual outcome of the study, even if the claims are dubious or modest at best, often come to be accepted as facts if they support the gender discourse narrative and are often cited and discussed.  This phenomenon is labeled the "hall of mirrors" effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | title = Gender, language, and discourse: a review essay | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 945&amp;ndash;973 | doi = 10.1086/495297 | jstor = 3175199 | date = Summer 1998 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fully and accurately record the socialization processes at play regarding gender construction, ethnographic and longitudinal studies are ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munson | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Babel | first2 = Molly | title = Loose lips and silver tongues, or, projecting sexual orientation through speech | journal = [[Language and Linguistics Compass]] | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 416&amp;ndash;449 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00028.x | date = September 2007 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these methods have their constraints.  It is costly and time consuming to carry out such studies that would yield significant results, and there is an abundance of factors that influence an individual's gender construction.  Thus, more research is needed regarding the social construction of gender.

Research can either be qualitative or quantitative.  Qualitative data is beneficial because it can give a voice to the subjects of the study.  However, poorly-constructed qualitative research can lead to reproduction of race and class biases if findings are inappropriately generalized.&lt;ref name="sage-ereference.com"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marshall | first1 = Catherine | last2 = Young | first2 = Michelle | chapter = Gender and methodology | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4tVtro6MfksC&amp;pg=PA70 | editor1-last = Skelton | editor1-first = Christine | editor2-last = Francis | editor2-first = Becky | editor3-last = Smulyan | editor3-first = Lisa | title = The Sage handbook of gender and education | page = 70 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781848607996 | doi = 10.4135/9781848607996.n6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, qualitative research methods often involve small, homogeneous samples. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalize the findings of a study conducted on a specific group of people and then apply them to all people of that gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber Cannon | first1 = Lynn | last2 = Higginbotham | first2 = Elizabeth | last3 = Leung | first3 = Marianne L. A. | title = Race and class bias in qualitative research on women | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 449&amp;ndash;462 | doi = 10.1177/089124388002004003 | jstor = 190209 | date = December 1988 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative data is useful when hard data is needed, such as addressing policy issues, when hard data is needed to convince people unfamiliar with the topics.  However, quantitative research can reinforce gender and cultural assumptions as well through item construction.&lt;ref name="sage-ereference.com"/&gt; That is, for data to be quantitatively analysed, they must fit into specific categories.  However, such categories can be based on or at least influenced by gender stereotypes.

==Promoting social change and criticisms==

===Social change===

{{Refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
Gender often means adhering to gender normative behavior and roles. The performance of gender reinforces the essentialism of gender categories.&lt;ref name="West and Zimmerman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goffman | first = Erving | author-link = Erving Goffman | chapter = The nature of deference and demeanor | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-x0uDwAAQBAJ | title = Interaction ritual: essays in face-to-face behavior | publisher = Routledge, Taylor and Francis Group | location = Abingdon, Oxon New York | origyear = 1967 | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780203788387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentialism argues that there are essential differences between genders which manifest themselves in differences in gender performance. Gender performance consists of a stylized practice involving gestures, language, and speech and serves to form and build an identity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; When an individual performs their gender to the standards set by societal norms, this bolsters the argument of gender essentialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Performative acts and gender constitution: an essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | journal = [[Theatre Journal]] | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 519&amp;ndash;531 | doi = 10.2307/3207893 | jstor = 3207893 | date = December 1988 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://seas3.elte.hu/coursematerial/TimarAndrea/17a.Butler,performative%5B1%5D.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, men have assumed a dominant gender role, and women have been prescribed a role submissive to men. In order for subordination to go unquestioned, the structure must not appear as a cultural product – it must seem natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frye | first = Marilyn | title = The politics of reality: essays in feminist theory | publisher = Crossing Press | location = Trumansburg, New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780895940995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social movements can challenge the categories that appear "natural." Certain legislation can promote equality for men and women, which could call into question whether there needs to be two categories of gender at all (if both are treated equally). Social change relies on an understanding of how inequality is rooted in gender accomplishment.

Throughout history, women have fought for their rights regarding various issues.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} One of the most significant revolutions of this{{which|date=June 2016}} century is the [[feminist movement]]. The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]], which began in 1854{{where|date=June 2016}}, was a fight for women's rights to education and to the vote by the [[suffragette]]s. This movement was then followed by [[Second-wave feminism]] and [[Third-wave feminism]] which furthered the feminist cause. The feminist movement was not only about fighting for women's rights, but more essentially about earning recognition and respect from the general public acknowledging the fact that they are not inferior than men and thus deserving to be treated equally and granted fair opportunities.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Feminism emerged and started to challenge the idea that a woman's appropriate place was confined to that of the domestic and private sphere. Over time, men and women's attitudes have been becoming more liberalized with regard to gender roles. Men and women are agreeing on a more egalitarian responsibility distribution within the family sphere.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} They are also in agreement that women should and can have roles in the public sphere, especially in leadership positions and that men can have and involved role in the private and domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bolzendahl | first1 = Catherine I. | last2 = Myers | first2 = Daniel J. | title = Feminist attitudes and support for gender equality: opinion change in women and men, 1974-1998 | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 759&amp;ndash;789 | doi = 10.1353/sof.2005.0005 | jstor = 3598347 | date = December 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://inequality.stanford.edu/printpdf/4595 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; These markers of increasingly liberalized attitudes toward gender roles indicate the trajectory of social change in terms of what is deemed normative.

===Criticism and opportunities to "undo" gender===
{{Further information|Undoing Gender}}
Because the theory says that one can "do" gender whether they conform to gender norms or not (and is always held accountable for behaving in accordance with gender norms), change seems impossible. If essential differences between the sexes are problematic, a society where gender is omnirelevant could be argued to always uphold gender inequality. The language of "doing" gender implies doing difference instead of unraveling it. Most studies that rely on social constructionism explore the ways in which gender is constructed but nevertheless demonstrate how those gender constructions uphold gender as a construct and gender inequality.

However, because gender is "done" or constructed, it can also be "undone" or deconstructed.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"/&gt; The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine: (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered, (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions, (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality, (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change, and (5) interaction as the site of change.&lt;ref name="Deutsch"/&gt;

Theories that imply that gendered behavior is totally or mostly due to social conventions and culture fall into the nurture end of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate. Much empirical research has been done on to what extent gendered behavior stems from biological factors.

'''''Steve Perrin's Quest Rules''''', or '''''SPQR''''' for short, is a [[role-playing game system]] created and sold by [[Steve Perrin]].

== History ==

''SPQR'' rules are based on those Perrin created for the role-playing game ''[[RuneQuest]]'', first published in 1978 by [[Chaosium]] and set in [[Greg Stafford]]'s fantasy world, [[Glorantha]]. Stafford and [[Lynn Willis]] simplified the rules in order to publish a [[generic role-playing game system]] called ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' (''BRP''). First released in 1980, ''BRP'' served as a basic system of rules for almost all future role-playing games produced by Chaosium, including ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' (1981), ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'' (1981) and ''[[Pendragon (role-playing game)|Pendragon]]'' (1985). One of those games, ''[[Superworld]]'' (1983), proved a commercial failure and resulted in the departure of Perrin from Chaosium. He began then to work as a video game designer for companies such as [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay Productions]], [[Maxis]], and [[Spectrum Holobyte]]. He also worked freelance for many of the major players in the tabletop game industry including [[TSR, Inc.]], [[FASA Corporation]], [[Hero Games]], [[West End Games]], and [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]. Only years later, in 2002, he decided to pick up again in business with his former game system, which he calls now ''Steve Perrin's Quest Rules'' (''SPQR'').

== Game system ==
As was the case for ''BRP'', ''SPQR'' is both a simplified version of ''RuneQuest'' and a generic role-playing game system. For example, Strike Ranks and Resistance Table were eliminated. Perrin said in an interview in the September 2008 issue of ''[[RPG Review]]'', "the game does not need two separate systems for resolving situations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpgreview.net/files/rpgreview_1.pdf ''RPG Review'', September 2008, ''Interview With Steve Perrin'', p. 30]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Calculus|Vector}}

In [[vector calculus]], and more generally [[differential geometry]], '''Stokes' theorem''' (also called the '''generalized Stokes theorem''' or the '''Stokes–Cartan theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789400745575|title=Physics of Collisional Plasmas – Introduction to {{!}} Michel Moisan {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a statement about the [[integral|integration]] of [[differential form]]s on [[manifolds]], which both simplifies and generalizes several [[theorem]]s from [[vector calculus]].  Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form {{mvar|ω}} over the [[boundary of a manifold|boundary]] of some [[orientation (vector space)#Orientation on manifolds|orientable]] manifold {{math|Ω}} is equal to the integral of its [[exterior derivative]] {{mvar|dω}} over the whole of {{math|Ω}}, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial \Omega}\omega=\int_\Omega d\omega\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Stokes' theorem was formulated in its modern form by [[Élie Cartan]] in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Les Systèmes Différentiels Extérieurs et leurs Applications Géométriques|last=Cartan|first=Élie|publisher=Hermann|year=1945|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following earlier work on the generalization of the theorems of vector calculus by [[Vito Volterra]], [[Édouard Goursat]], and [[Henri Poincaré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|date=1979-01-01|title=The History of Stokes' Theorem|jstor=2690275|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=52|issue=3|pages=146–156|doi=10.2307/2690275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Topology|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|isbn=9780444823755|editor-last=James|editor-first=I.

This modern form of Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of a [[#Kelvin–Stokes theorem|classical result]] that [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] communicated to [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] in a letter dated July 2, 1850.&lt;ref&gt;See:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_\Gamma \mathbf{F}\, \cdot\, d{\mathbf{\Gamma}}  = \iint_S \nabla\times\mathbf{F}\, \cdot\, d\mathbf{S} &lt;/math&gt;

This classical statement, along with the classical [[divergence theorem]], the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], and [[Green's theorem]] are simply special cases of the general formulation stated above.

== Introduction ==
The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that the [[integral]] of a function {{mvar|f}} over the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} can be calculated by finding an [[antiderivative]] {{mvar|F}} of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|f}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. 
* By the choice of {{mvar|F}}, {{math|1={{sfrac|''dF''|''dx''}} = ''f''(''x'')}}. In the parlance of [[differential form]]s, this is saying that {{math|''f''(''x'')&amp;thinsp;''dx''}} is the [[exterior derivative]] of the 0-form, i.e. function, {{mvar|F}}: in other words, that {{math|1=''dF'' = ''f''&amp;thinsp;''dx''}}. The general Stokes theorem applies to higher differential forms {{mvar|ω}} instead of just 0-forms such as {{mvar|F}}.
* A closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a simple example of a one-dimensional [[manifold with boundary]].  Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. Integrating {{mvar|f}} over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be [[orientable]], and the form has to be [[compact support|compactly supported]] in order to give a well-defined integral.
* The two points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} form the boundary of the closed interval. More generally, Stokes' theorem applies to oriented manifolds {{mvar|M}} with boundary. The boundary {{math|∂''M''}} of {{mvar|M}} is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of {{mvar|M}}. For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, {{mvar|a}} inherits the opposite orientation as {{mvar|b}}, as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, "integrating" {{mvar|F}} over two boundary points {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} is taking the difference {{math|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}}.
In even simpler terms, one can consider the points as boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral ({{math|1=''f''&amp;thinsp;''dx'' = ''dF''}}) over a 1-dimensional manifold ({{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}) by considering the anti-derivative ({{mvar|F}}) at the 0-dimensional boundaries ({{math|{''a'', ''b''}|}}), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals ({{mvar|dω}}) over {{mvar|n}}-dimensional manifolds ({{math|Ω}}) by considering the antiderivative ({{mvar|ω}}) at the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional boundaries ({{math|∂Ω}}) of the manifold.

So the fundamental theorem reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{[a, b]} f(x)\,dx = \int_{[a, b]} dF = \int_{\{a\}^- \cup \{b\}^+} F = F(b) - F(a)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Formulation for smooth manifolds with boundary==
Let {{math|Ω}} be an oriented [[smooth manifold]] with boundary of [[dimension]] {{mvar|n}} and let {{mvar|α}} be a [[smooth function|smooth]] {{mvar|n}}-[[differential form]] that is [[Support (mathematics)#Compact support|compactly supported]] on {{math|Ω}}. First, suppose that {{mvar|α}} is compactly supported in the domain of a single, [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[coordinate chart]] {{math|{''U'', ''φ''}|}}. In this case, we define the integral of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|Ω}} as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \alpha = \int_{\varphi(U)} \left(\varphi^{-1}\right)^* \alpha\,,&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., via the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of {{mvar|α}} to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

More generally, the integral of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|Ω}} is defined as follows: Let {{math|{''ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} be a [[partition of unity]] associated with a [[locally finite collection|locally finite]] [[cover (topology)|cover]] {{math|{''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \alpha \equiv \sum_i \int_{U_i} \psi_i \alpha\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as described above.  This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity.

The generalized Stokes theorem reads:

{{quotebox|align=center|quote='''Theorem.''' ''(Stokes–Cartan) If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a [[infinitely differentiable|smooth]] &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-[[differential form|form]] with [[compact support]] on smooth &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[manifold|manifold-with-boundary]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[boundary of a manifold|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; given the induced [[orientation (mathematics)#Geometric algebra|orientation]], and &lt;math&gt;i:\partial \Omega\hookrightarrow \Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inclusion map]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega d\omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} i^*\omega&lt;/math&gt;.''}}

Conventionally, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial\Omega} i^*\omega&lt;/math&gt; is abbreviated as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial\Omega} \omega&lt;/math&gt;, since the pullback of a differential form by the inclusion map is simply its restriction to its domain: &lt;math&gt;i^*\omega=\omega|_{\partial\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;.  Here &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[exterior derivative]], which is defined using the manifold structure only.  The right-hand side is sometimes written as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\oint_{\partial\Omega} \omega&lt;/math&gt; to stress the fact that the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-manifold &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; has no boundary.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For  mathematicians this fact is known, therefore the circle is redundant and often omitted.  However, one should keep in mind here that in [[thermodynamics]], where frequently expressions as {{math|∮&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; {''d''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;''U''}|}} appear (wherein the total derivative, see below, should not be confused with the exterior one), the integration path {{mvar|W}} is a one-dimensional closed line on a much higher-dimensional manifold. That is, in a thermodynamic application, where {{mvar|U}} is a function of the temperature {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''T''}}, the volume {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''V''}}, and the electrical polarization {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''P''}} of the sample, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\{d_\text{total}U\}=\sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\partial U}{\partial\alpha_i}\,d\alpha_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the circle is really necessary, e.g. if one considers the ''differential'' consequences of the ''integral'' postulate
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_W\,\{d_\text{total}U\}\, \stackrel{!}{=}\,0\,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (This fact is also an implication of Stokes' theorem, since for a given smooth &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, application of the theorem twice gives &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial(\partial \Omega)}\omega=\int_\Omega d(d\omega)=0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;(n-2)&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;\partial(\partial\Omega)=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.) The right-hand side of the equation is often used to formulate ''integral'' laws; the left-hand side then leads to equivalent ''differential'' formulations (see below).

The theorem is often used in situations where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold, often &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^k&lt;/math&gt;, on which the form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined.

==Topological preliminaries; integration over chains==

Let {{mvar|M}} be a [[smooth manifold]]. A (smooth) singular [[Simplex|{{mvar|k}}-simplex]] in {{mvar|M}} is defined as a [[smooth map]] from the standard simplex in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{mvar|M}}. The group {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}} of singular {{mvar|k}}-[[chain (algebraic topology)|chains]] on {{mvar|M}} is defined to be the [[free abelian group]] on the set of singular {{mvar|k}}-simplices in {{mvar|M}}. These groups, together with the boundary map, {{math|∂}}, define a [[chain complex]]. The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) group is isomorphic to the usual [[singular homology]] group {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}} (resp. the [[singular cohomology]] group {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}}), defined using continuous rather than smooth simplices in {{mvar|M}}.

On the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative, {{mvar|d}}, as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines the [[de Rham cohomology]] groups {{math|''H''{{su|p=''k''|b=''dR''}}(''M'', '''R''')}}.

Differential {{mvar|k}}-forms can be integrated over a {{mvar|k}}-simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of {{mvar|k}}-forms to the {{mvar|k}}th group of singular cochains, {{math|''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(''M'', '''Z''')}}, the linear functionals on {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''M'', '''Z''')}}. In other words, a {{mvar|k}}-form {{mvar|ω}} defines a functional

:&lt;math&gt;I(\omega)(c) = \oint_c \omega&lt;/math&gt;

on the {{mvar|k}}-chains. Stokes' theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology with real coefficients; the exterior derivative, {{mvar|d}}, behaves like the ''dual'' of {{math|∂}} on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means:

#closed forms, i.e., {{math|''dω'' {{=}} 0}}, have zero integral over ''boundaries'', i.e. over manifolds that can be written as {{math|∂∑&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and
#exact forms, i.e., {{math|''ω'' {{=}} ''dσ''}}, have zero integral over ''cycles'', i.e. if the boundaries sum up to the empty set: {{math|∑&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ∅}}.

[[De Rham's theorem]] shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism. So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if {{math|{''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} are cycles generating the {{mvar|k}}th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers, {{math|{''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}}, there exist a closed form, {{mvar|ω}}, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{c_i} \omega = a_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and this form is unique up to exact forms.

Stokes' theorem on smooth manifolds can be derived from Stokes' theorem for chains in smooth manifolds, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manifolds, Tensors, and Forms|last=Renteln|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781107324893|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=158–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formally stated, the latter reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Smooth Manifolds|last=Lee|first=John M.|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781441999818|location=New York|pages=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stokes patch.svg|200px|left]]
To simplify these topological arguments, it is worthwhile to examine the underlying principle by considering an example for {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} dimensions. The essential idea can be understood by the diagram on the left, which shows that, in an oriented tiling of a manifold, the interior paths are traversed in opposite directions; their contributions to the path integral thus cancel each other pairwise. As a consequence, only the contribution from the boundary remains. It thus suffices to prove Stokes' theorem for sufficiently fine tilings (or, equivalently, [[simplex|simplices]]), which usually is not difficult.

==Generalization to rough sets==
[[Image:Green's-theorem-simple-region.svg|thumb|upright|180px|A region (here called {{mvar|D}} instead of {{math|Ω}}) with piecewise smooth boundary.  This is a [[manifold with corners]], so its boundary is not a smooth manifold.]]

The formulation above, in which {{math|Ω}} is a smooth manifold with boundary, does not suffice in many applications.  For example, if the domain of integration is defined as the plane region between two {{mvar|x}}-coordinates and the graphs of two functions, it will often happen that the domain has corners.  In such a case, the corner points mean that {{math|Ω}} is not a smooth manifold with boundary, and so the statement of Stokes' theorem given above does not apply.  Nevertheless, it is possible to check that the conclusion of Stokes' theorem is still true.  This is because {{math|Ω}} and its boundary are well-behaved away from a small set of points (a [[measure zero]] set).

A version of Stokes' theorem that extends to rough domains was proved by Whitney.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Geometric Integration Theory,'' III.14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Assume that {{mvar|D}} is a connected bounded open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Call {{mvar|D}} a ''standard domain'' if it satisfies the following property: There exists a subset {{mvar|P}} of {{math|∂''D''}}, open in {{math|∂''D''}}, whose complement in {{math|∂''D''}} has [[Hausdorff measure|Hausdorff {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-measure]] zero; and such that every point of {{mvar|P}} has a ''generalized normal vector''.  This is a vector {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} such that, if a coordinate system is chosen so that {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} is the first basis vector, then, in an open neighborhood around {{mvar|x}}, there exists a smooth function {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} such that {{mvar|P}} is the graph {{math|{ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) }|}} and {{mvar|D}} is the region {{math|{ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) }|}}.  Whitney remarks that the boundary of a standard domain is the union of a set of zero Hausdorff {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-measure and a finite or countable union of smooth {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-manifolds, each of which has the domain on only one side.  He then proves that if {{mvar|D}} is a standard domain in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{mvar|ω}} is an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form which is defined, continuous, and bounded on {{math|''D'' ∪ ''P''}}, smooth on {{mvar|D}}, integrable on {{mvar|P}}, and such that {{mvar|dω}} is integrable on {{mvar|D}}, then Stokes' theorem holds, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_P \omega = \int_D d\omega\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The study of measure-theoretic properties of rough sets leads to [[geometric measure theory]].  Even more general versions of Stokes' theorem have been proved by Federer and by Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=J.|title=Stokes' theorem for nonsmooth chains|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |series=New Series|volume=29|issue=2|date=October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special cases==
The general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. The traditional versions can be formulated using [[Cartesian coordinates]] without the machinery of differential geometry, and thus are more accessible. Further, they are older and their names are more familiar as a result. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations.

===Kelvin–Stokes theorem===
[[Image:Stokes' Theorem.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, with surface {{math|Σ}}, its boundary {{math|∂Σ}} and the "normal" vector {{mvar|n}}.]]

This is a (dualized) (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about [[vector field]]s). This special case is often just referred to as ''Stokes' theorem'' in many introductory university vector calculus courses and is used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the '''[[Curl (mathematics)|curl]]''' theorem.

The classical [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]] relates the [[surface integral]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] over a surface {{math|Σ}} in Euclidean three-space to the [[line integral]] of the vector field over its boundary. It is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) once we identify a vector field with a 1-form using the metric on Euclidean 3-space. The curve of the line integral, {{math|∂Σ}}, must have positive [[curve orientation|orientation]], meaning that {{math|∂Σ}} points counterclockwise when the [[normal (geometry)|surface normal]], {{math|'''n'''}}, points toward the viewer.

One consequence of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem is that the [[field line]]s of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours. The formula can be rewritten as:

&lt;div align=left&gt;
&lt;div class="messagebox standard-talk NavFrame"&gt;
&lt;div align=left&gt;
Suppose {{math|'''F'''(''P''(''x'',''y'',''z''),''Q''(''x'',''y'',''z''),''R''(''x'',''y'',''z''))}} is defined in region with smooth surface {{math|Σ}} and has first-order continuous [[partial derivatives]]. Then
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \iint_\Sigma \Bigg(\left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z} \right)\,dy\,dz +\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial R}{\partial x} \right) \,dz\,dx  +\left (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\,dy\Bigg) \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \Big(P\,dx+Q\,dy+R\,dz\Big)\,,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;where {{mvar|P}}, {{mvar|Q}} and {{mvar|R}} are the components of {{math|'''F'''}}, and {{math|∂Σ}} is boundary of region with smooth surface {{math|Σ}}.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Green's theorem===
[[Green's theorem]] is immediately recognizable as the third integrand of both sides in the integral in terms of {{mvar|P}}, {{mvar|Q}}, and {{mvar|R}} cited above.

====In electromagnetism====
Two of the four [[Maxwell equations]] involve curls of 3-D vector fields and their differential and integral forms are related by the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]]. Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below (see [[Differentiation under the integral sign]]):

|}
The above listed subset of Maxwell's equations are valid for electromagnetic fields expressed in [[SI units]]. In other systems of units, such as [[Maxwell's equations#CGS units|CGS]] or [[Gaussian units]], the scaling factors for the terms differ. For example, in Gaussian units, Faraday's law of induction and Ampère's law take the forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.&amp;nbsp;D.|last=Jackson|title=Classical Electrodynamics|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M.|last=Born|first2=E.|last2=Wolf|title=Principles of Optics|edition=6th|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &amp;= -\frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}\,, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} &amp;= \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t} + \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}\,, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

respectively, where {{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

===Divergence theorem===
Likewise, the [[Divergence theorem|Ostrogradsky–Gauss theorem]] (also known as the divergence theorem or Gauss's theorem)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

is a special case if we identify a vector field with the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form. An application of this is the case {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''f'''''c'''}} where {{math|'''c'''}} is an arbitrary constant vector. Working out the divergence of the product gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf c \cdot \int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla f \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \mathbf c \cdot \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} f\, d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since this holds for all {{math|'''c'''}} we find
:&lt;math&gt;\int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla f \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} f\, d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31182">The term “sustainable communities” has various definitions, but in essence refers to communities planned, built, or modified to promote [[sustainable living]]. Sustainable communities tend to focus on environmental and economic [[sustainability]], urban infrastructure, social equity, and municipal government. The term is sometimes used synonymously with “green cities,” “eco-communities,” “livable cities” and “[[sustainable cities]].”
 
Different organizations have various understandings of sustainable communities; the term’s definition is contested and still under construction. For example, [[Burlington, Vermont]]’s Principles of Sustainable Community Development &lt;ref name="clinton2.nara.gov"&gt;"Appendix A: Definitions and Principles of Sustainable Communities" Sustainable Communities Task Force Report. Fall 1997. http://clinton2.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/suscomm/suscoa.html&lt;/ref&gt;
stress the importance of local control of natural resources and a thriving non-profit sector to a sustainable community. The [[Institute for Sustainable Communities]] outlines how political empowerment and social well-being are also part of the definition&lt;ref name="clinton2.nara.gov"/&gt; Additionally, referring to communities in Shanghai and Singapore, geographer Lily Kong has paired concepts of [[cultural sustainability]] and [[social sustainability]] alongside environmental sustainability as aspects of sustainable communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Kong  | first = Lily | title =  Making Sustainable Creative/Cultural Space in Shanghai and Singapore| journal =  Geographical Review | volume =  99| issue = 1 | pages = 1–22  | date =  21 April 2010 | doi =10.1111/j.1931-0846.2009.tb00415.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the UK’s 2003 [[Sustainable Communities Plan]] often abbreviates its definition of sustainable communities as “places where people want to live and work, now and in the future” &lt;ref name="webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk"&gt;"What is a Sustainable Community?" The National Archives. http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1139866&lt;/ref&gt;
. Addressing the scale of sustainable communities, political scientist Kent Portney points out that the term sustainable communities has been used to refer to a broad variety of places, ranging from neighborhoods to watersheds to cities to multi-state regions.&lt;ref name=P1&gt;{{cite book|last=Portney|first=Kent E.|title=Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously:  A Comparative Analysis of Twenty-Three U.S. Cities|url=http://seg.fsu.edu/Library/portney-taking-sustainability-seriously-in-cities.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Etymologically, the term “sustainable community” grew out of the related discourses of “sustainability” and “[[sustainable development]]” that gained widespread use among local, national, and international politicians and policymakers in NGOs starting in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Agyeman"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Agyeman | first = Julian | title = Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice| place =  New York| publisher = NYU Press| year =  2005| isbn = 9780814707111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originally referred to environmental concerns and was later applied to cities.&lt;ref name=Maliene &gt;{{cite journal  | last1 =Maliene  | first1 = V | last2 = Howe  | first2 = J | last3 =Malys | first3 = N |title =  Sustainable Communities: Affordable Housing and Socio-Economic Relations. | journal =  Local Economy | volume =  23| issue = 4 | pages = 267–276  | date =  21 April 2010 | doi = 10.1080/02690940802407989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Sustainable Community initiatives==

The best example of a real Sustainable Community is Saint Michael's Sustainable Community in Costa Rica. The community produces far more food and water then it needs.  It uses regenerative agriculture as a base to live in harmony with nature. 

Sustainable community initiatives have emerged in neighborhoods, cities, counties, [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] planning districts, and watershed districts at different scales pertaining to community needs. These initiatives are driven by various actor groups that have different methods of effectively planning out ways to create sustainable communities. Most often they are implemented by [[governments]] and [[non-profit organizations]], but they also involve community members, academics, and create partnerships and [[coalitions]].
 
Nonprofit organizations help to cultivate local talents and skills, [[Empowerment|empowering]] people to become more powerful and more involved in their own communities. Many also offer plans and guidance on improving the [[sustainability]] of various practices, such as land use and community design, [[transportation]], energy efficiency, [[waste reduction]], and climate friendly purchasing.
 
Some government groups will create partnerships where departments will work together using [[grants]] to provide resources to communities like clean air and water, [[community planning]], [[economic development]], equity and [[environmental justice]], as well as [[housing]] and transportation choices.
 
[[Social movements]] have gathered momentum, spreading sustainable community ideas around the world, not only through example, but also by offering classes and training on [[sustainable living]], [[permaculture]], and [[local economics]].

== International initiatives==

===United Kingdom===

The [[Sustainable Communities Plan]] was launched in 2003 through the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]]. Lacking an official national spatial development plan, the UK employed the Sustainable Communities Plan as a regional development plan targeted at the South East of England.&lt;ref name="Raco"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = A growth agenda without growth: English spatial policy, sustainable communities, and the death of the neo-liberal project | journal =  Geojournal | volume =  77| issue = 2 | pages = 153–165 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1007/s10708-009-9327-0 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the plan created the [[Academy for Sustainable Communities]]. The £38 billion plan identifies four key growth areas for development and regeneration: the [[Thames Gateway]], [[Ashford, Kent]], [[London]]-Stansted-[[Cambridge]]-[[Peterborough]] (LSCP) and [[Milton Keynes]]/[[South Midlands]] (MKSM) &lt;ref name="webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk"/&gt;
.  Designed during a period that projected sustained economic growth into the future, the plan’s implementation has been slowed and disjointed, particularly since the [[2008 economic recession]] &lt;ref name="Raco"/&gt;
An [[affordable housing]] shortage in the UK has also challenged the Plan’s implementation.&lt;ref name= Maliene /&gt;

== National initiatives ==
The '''Partnership for Sustainable Communities''' is an interagency partnership between the [[Department of Transportation]], [[Environmental Protection Agency]], and the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. These departments work together with a mission to “improve access to affordable housing, increase transportation options, and lower transportation costs while protecting the environment”.&lt;ref name="sustainablecommunities.gov"&gt;"About Us" Partnership for Sustainable Communities.  Retrieved 10 March 2014 http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/aboutUs.html&lt;/ref&gt; All three bureaus offer funding opportunities to support communities in areas of clean air and water, community planning, economic development, energy efficiency, equity and environmental justice, as well as housing and transportation choices. The partnership incorporates six principles of livability into its grant-making and program development.:&lt;ref name="sustainablecommunities.gov"/&gt;
*Provide more transportation choices
*Promote equitable, affordable housing
*Enhance economic competitiveness
*Support existing communities
*Coordinate policies and leverage investment
*Value communities and neighborhoods

Along with working collaboratively, these government agencies also have their own initiatives. 
The Department of Housing and Development has an ''Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities'' which features a Sustainable Housing Initiative, aiming at “supporting the construction and rehabilitation of [[green affordable housing]]”&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Housing Initiative" U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/sustainable_housing_communities/sustainable_housing_initiative&lt;/ref&gt;  and does this through programs that retrofit or construct energy efficient homes. They also work to standardize energy efficiency standards across federal agencies, as well as expand the availability of financing for home energy improvements and multifamily housing.

The Environmental Protection Agency has a ''Smart Growth Program'' which conducts research, publishes reports, showcases outstanding communities, and works with communities through grants and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;"Smart Growth" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  They also have a Green Communities Program which provides communities with a tool kit of information to help them reach sustainable goals. The tool kit is arranged in a five-step program which allows communities to:&lt;ref&gt;"Basic Information" Green Communities, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.epa.gov/greenkit/basicinformation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Develop '''community assessments''' of their current conditions
*Formulate '''trend analyses''' that answers the question “Where are we going?” in the face of no intervention 
*Create '''vision statements''' of where the community sees itself in the future
*Establish '''action plans''' about what programs and initiatives will help the community reach its goals
*Access tools to '''implement''' action plans

The Department of Transportation has a ''Livability Initiative'' which issues “grants to eligible recipients for planning, vehicle purchases, facility construction, operations, and other purposes”,&lt;ref&gt;"Grants and Programs" U.S. Department of Transportation. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://www.dot.gov/livability/grants-programs&lt;/ref&gt; with numerous goals, including the improvement of surface transportation, providing public transit on Indian reservations, providing access to disadvantaged communities, etc.

===Case Studies from the Partnership for Sustainable Communities===

'''The Euclid Corridor in Cleveland'''

Once a thriving place of business and home to the wealthy and elite, Euclid Avenue in [[Cleveland]] had seen a decline in commerce following the [[Great Depression]]. During this economic downturn, Cleveland became a [[shrinking city]] as many of its residents moved and homes were turned into boarding houses or abandoned altogether.. After decades of work by city leaders and residents to revitalize this part of the city, the bus line [[HealthLine]] debuted in 2008. This bus line increased ridership and helped The Euclid Corridor begin to see the redevelopment of abandoned properties as well as investment in development of commerce, to the tune of $4.3 billion. This created thousands of square feet of retail space and thousands of jobs. The success of the revitalization of the Euclid Corridor is due in large part to engaged community leaders, community members, and NGO's like MidTown Cleveland who worked on ensuring that there was a variety of housing investments. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through their brownfield assessment grants and HUD provided mortgage insurance on properties to aid in the development of Euclid Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;"Transit as Transformation - The Euclid Corridor in Cleveland" Partnership for Sustainable Communities. June 2012. Retrieved 10 March 2014" http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/pdf/studies/cleveland-euclid-corridor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greenville, South Carolina’s Westside'''

Following a shift from the cotton production that once thrived in the west end of [[Greenville, South Carolina]], this part of the city began to see a flight of its residents and with it the abandonment and decay of its buildings and facilities, higher crime rates, and more low-income households. In 2010, HUD and DOT awarded the city $1.8 million to support a three-year planning initiative which sought to improve affordable housing, transportation, and increase economic development. The HUD provided a loan to encourage economic growth, specifically through the conversion of an old cotton warehouse into an area of retail shops, offices, and restaurants known as West End Market. The success of West End Market led to 230 building permits being issued around the area in a three-year period, resulting in a successful arts district that created jobs as well as drew tourists and locals. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through $200,000 in brownfield assessment grants which allowed for the city to facilitate clean up, or initiate redevelopment. The city also worked with the [[Federal Highway Administration]] in demolishing an unnecessary bridge which allowed for the development of a recreational area with a cross bridge, waterfalls, and walking paths, known as [[Falls Park on the Reedy]]. In 2005, a mixed-use development was constructed across from Falls Park with a hotel, apartments, restaurants, and retail and office spaces to help further spark economic growth in the area.&lt;ref&gt;"Revitalizing Greenville's Westside" Partnership for Sustainable Communities. December 2012. Retrieved 10 March 2014 http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/pdf/studies/greenville_sc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seattle’s South Lake Union Neighborhood'''

With investments in transportation, affordable housing, and green space, Seattle’s South Lake Union has transformed from a place of freeway traffic, abandoned warehouses, and parking lots to an economically flourishing neighborhood. An integral part to this transformation was the creation of a street car service, partially funded by the [[Federal Transit Administration]]. The streetcar encouraged both Amazon.com and Microsoft to locate campuses in the South Lake Union neighborhood, bringing with it jobs and investment in residential space. The City of Seattle is proposing a zoning change to promote affordable housing and attract market rate development. HUD provided grants to fund building and support services for the chronically homeless, adults and veterans recovering from addiction, and homeless with mental health issues and substance abuse problems. HUD also supplied $5.7 million towards the construction of a senior housing facility. To address the problems with the neighborhoods freeways and lack of sidewalks and crosswalks, a $30 million grant was issued by the DOT to help build crosswalks over 12 intersections, widen sidewalks, add bicycle lanes, as well as beautify the space through the addition of landscaping and trees.&lt;ref&gt;"Seattle's South Lake Union Neighborhood" Partnership for Sustainable Communities.

== State initiatives ==

===Maryland===

The state of Maryland passed a Sustainable Communities Act in 2010 with the goal of revitalizing and promoting reinvestment in Maryland’s older communities as well working to promote “equitable, affordable housing by expanding energy-efficient housing choices for people of all ages, incomes, races, and ethnicity to increase mobility and lower the combined cost of housing and transportation”.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Communities" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 11 March 2014. [http://planning.maryland.gov/yourpart/sustainablecommunities.shtml ]&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program which promotes private investment in the restoration and development of historic sites.&lt;ref&gt;"Maryland Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program" Maryland Department of Planning, Maryland Historical Trust. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://mht.maryland.gov/taxCredits.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks in part to the Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program, the neighborhood of [[Remington, Baltimore]] was able to refurbish an old tin factory into a space for offices and residences, which led to the development of other properties as well as homes, which increased use and population for the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;"Remington Neighborhood Revitalization" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://planning.maryland.gov/OurWork/spotlightComm_Remington.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Maryland General Assembly passed the Sustainable Communities Tax Increment Financing Designation and Financing Law. This law allows for Maryland counties and municipalities to use funds generated from increased property tax values to fund improvement projects in sustainable communities. Sample projects include expanding sidewalks, the development of tree planting on streets and parks, as well as improvements to water and sewer infrastructure to help encourage economic growth and improve quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Communities" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://planning.maryland.gov/yourpart/sustainablecommunities.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

The state of California passed the [[Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008]], also known as SB 375. The law aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through transportation, housing, and land use planning. Under the SB 375, the state is broken up into Metropolitan Planning Organizations which are each responsible for developing Sustainable Community Strategies that will help the state reach its goal of reduced emissions. These strategies are then evaluated by the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Air Resources Board.&lt;ref name= "nrdc.org"&gt;"Sustainable Communities" California Environmental Protection Agency - Air Resources Board. Retrieved 8 March 2014. http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/sb375/sb375.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Sustainable Community Strategy, the city of [[Sacramento]] plans to double transit service and increase bike lanes, offering more transportation choices and reducing vehicle emissions.&lt;ref name="Eaken, Amanda 2012"&gt;Eaken, Amanda.

==City government initiatives==

Cities are defined as [[jurisdictional]] units that have small divisions of government within them. These divisions of government have the authority to affect environmental and [[ecological]] results.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt;  Cities are especially important in initiating sustainable communities because they have [[local authorities]] that “have political power and credibility to take initiatives to access and deploy [[resources]] in ways reflecting local conditions that allows them the capacity to manage and lead [[urban development]] for the good of the environment.” &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;  It is also necessary to implement sustainable communities in countries that are [[industrialized]] because cities are where most environmental and [[social problems]] dwell.
 
When looking at and comparing sustainable cities certain indicators may be used:
 
*Does the city have any [[smart growth]] programs that are designed to “help manage growth and avoid and eliminate [[urban sprawl]]” and minimize impacts on [[physical environment]]? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Does the city have [[zoning]] plans that demonstrate goals for the city in a way that create [[Environmentally Sensitive Area|environmentally-sensitive]] areas and maintain them? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Does the city follow any legal [[policies]] that allow [[advocates]] and [[activists]] to create programs that would help the city become [[sustainable]]? &lt;ref name=A1&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*How involved in the environmental and [[Social justice|social justice movement]] are programs within the city? &lt;ref name=A2&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is the [[transportation]] system of the city set up to encourage [[public transportation]] and not private to reduce [[pollution]]? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Are there pollution remediation programs in the city? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*How [[Politically|politically involved]] are citizens where their voices are equally heard in order to create social justice and a [[just community]]? &lt;ref name=A2 /&gt;
 
The 34 elements inside “Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously" can also be used to determine whether a city is considered sustainable or not.&lt;ref name=P34&gt;{{cite book|last=Portney|first=Kent E.|title=Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously:  A Comparative Analysis of Twenty-Three U.S. Cities|page=34|url=http://seg.fsu.edu/Library/portney-taking-sustainability-seriously-in-cities.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City examples===

The city of [[San Francisco]] uses the [[Precautionary principal|Precautionary Principal]] as a framework to develop laws for a healthier and more just city.&lt;ref name=A3&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precautionary principal gives more power to community members by allowing them to stand up against [[corporations]] in their neighborhoods and leaves the [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] to corporations instead of community members. Companies must prove that their endeavors are harmless to the community instead of the community having to prove they have been harmed by company endeavors.&lt;ref name=A2 /&gt; This allows for a sustainable community as [[environmental justice]] and social justice are created.
 
The city of [[Quebec]] to create a sustainable community through political involvement has dedicated studies to discovering why citizens are or are not politically active. Studies from Quebec have shown that citizens’ [[Political efficacy|internal and external efficacy]] is a large part in determining [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in politics. When citizens lack the internal belief that one can make change in government and the external belief that the government will make changes according to citizen concerns, political participation dwindles as citizens believe no change will occur. When becoming politically active, a citizen takes into account the history of the city government, the government’s actions, and government interactions with other citizens.&lt;ref name=KC1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornberg and Clarke|first=Allan and Harold|title=Citizens and Community: Political Support in a Representative Democracy|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After noting the city’s sustainability level it is important to note what kinds of communities are targeted and how they are affected through these programs and what kinds of strategies are being used to try to create and transform sustainable communities.

==Non-Profit and NGO sector==

The [[Institute for Sustainable Communities]] created by former Vermont Governor, Madeleine M. Kunin, leads community based projects around the globe that address environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"What is a Sustainable Community?" Institute for Sustainable Communities. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://www.iscvt.org/what_we_do/sustainable_community/&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these groups help to cultivate local talents and skills, empowering people to become more powerful and involved in their own communities. Many also offer plans and guidance on improving the sustainability of various practices, such as land use and community design, green transportation, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and climate friendly purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;"About Sustainable Communities" Sustainable Communities Online. Retrieved 11 March 2014. http://www.sustainable.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Integrity]] Project is focused on bringing together top scientists and thinkers from around the world in order to analyze the problems of inequality among humankind. These thinkers examine economic and ethical issues faced in protecting and enhancing our environments and make recommendations on restoration techniques that aid in promoting social justice. They also call for a major and imperative paradigm shift in order to ensure good quality of life for many future generations.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite book|last=Pimentel|first=David|title=Ecological Integrity: Integrating Environment, Conservation, and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable Seattle]]  is a non-profit organization which has created regional indicators for sustainability through grassroots activism and has become a world leader in these sustainability indicators. Sustainable Seattle has printed newsletters on a wide range of sustainale community topics, from building to recycling and more, and they are believed to be the first “sustainable community” organization, founded in 1991. There are now hundreds of “sustainable community” organizations across the USA &lt;ref&gt;"Who we are" Sustainable Seattle. Retrieved 5 May 2014. http://www.sustainableseattle.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movement initiatives==

The Take Back Your Time Movement, led by John de Graaf, focuses on the concept of working fewer hours and devoting more time to living a healthy lifestyle. The movement suggests that allowing shorter work days and longer vacations would in turn help better distribute work, while also reducing stress and making for healthier living. Additionally, people would have more free time to make more rewarding and sustainable choices for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Assadourian, Erik. "The Power of Social Movements" Worldwatch Institute. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://blogs.worldwatch.org/transformingcultures/contents/social-movements&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voluntary Simplicity Movement or [[Simple Living]] movement emphasizes reducing one’s material possessions and desires and increasing self-sufficiency through skills such as gardening and [[DIY]]. The Voluntary Simplicity Movement suggests that one should focus on cultivating their own best inner being rather than focus on making material gains and wealth. It also promotes activism within the community to create engaged, educated citizens.

The [[Degrowth]] movement is based on [[anti-consumerist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] ideas, focusing on reducing consumption and promoting happy, healthy lifestyles in non-consumptive fashions. Main aspects of Degrowth include more equal distribution of workload and sharing work, consuming less, and setting aside time for personal and cultural growth through the arts and creativity &lt;ref&gt;"About Us: Description" Degrowth.org Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.degrowth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements such as [[ecovillage]]s are gathering momentum, spreading sustainable community ideas around the world, teaching through example and also offering classes and training on sustainable living, [[permaculture]], and local economics. Ecovillages seek to integrate themselves harmlessly into the ecosystem surrounding them, so as to live and interact in a way that is sustainable and supportive of the natural world &lt;ref&gt;"About Us" Ecovillage Farm Learning Center. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://ecovillagefarm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges and critiques==

Sustainable communities, both as individual projects and as a whole, have faced challenges impeding their development and have been met with criticism.
 
Sustainable communities projects have struggled to take hold for:
 
* poor economic conditions and inaccessible housing markets: in the UK’s Sustainable Communities Plan, the economic downturn of 2008 has led to a general shortage of housing and affordable housing in particular, which run contrary to the plan’s premises of  livable communities.&lt;ref name= Maliene/&gt;
 
Projects have been critiqued for:
* lacking a well-developed [[environmental justice]] framework: urban and environmental policy planner [[Julian Agyeman]] has written about the "narrow focus" of civic environmentalism that does not take "social justice" into account, and the need for sustainable communities to be democratic and collaborate with the environmental justice movement.&lt;ref name=Agyeman /&gt;
* promoting a securitization agenda: British geographer Mike Raco argues that the UK's Sustainable Communities Plan employs the discourse of sustainability as "a series of potentially repressive and counter-productive policy measures.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = Securing Sustainable Communities: Citizenship, Safety, and Sustainability in the New Urban Planning | journal =  European Urban and Regional Studies | volume =  14| issue = 4 | pages = 305–320 | year = 2014| doi = 10.1177/0969776407081164 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* accommodating to [[neoliberal]] economic systems instead of confronting them: while some rationales for sustainable communities conflict with market-driven agendas, economic growth characterizes the means and ends of some initiatives. Additionally, sustainable communities reject the notion that development itself is fundamentally socially divisive or environmentally destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = Sustainable Development, Rolled-Out Neoliberalism and Sustainable Communities | journal =  Antipode | volume =  37| issue = 2 | pages = 324–347 | year = 2005| doi = 10.1111/j.0066-4812.2005.00495.x }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
While there are a variety of graduate degrees at universities that touch on sustainability as it related to urban planning and environmental resources, only a few degree program programs exist that train students in the theory and practice of sustainable communities. The most notable examples are:

* [[Binghamton University]] offers a [https://www.binghamton.edu/sustainable-communities/ Masters of Arts (MA) and Masters of Science (MS) in Sustainable Communities]. 
* [[Green Mountain College]] has a graduate program leading to a [http://www.greenmtn.edu/academics/graduate/mrsc/ Masters of Science (MS) in Resilient and Sustainable Communities].
* [[Northern Arizona University]] offers a [https://in.nau.edu/sustainable-communities/program/ Masters of Arts (MA) in Sustainable Communities].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15501">{{for|the ancient Greek epic poem about Telegonus|Telegony}}
'''Telegony''' is a theory in [[heredity]], holding that offspring can inherit the characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent; thus the child of a widowed or remarried woman might partake of traits of a previous husband. 

Whereas experiments in the late 19th century on several species failed to provide evidence that offspring would inherit any character from their mother's previous mates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burkhardt|first=RW|title=Closing the door on Lord Morton's mare: the rise and fall of telegony|journal=Studies in History of Biology|year=1979|volume=3|pages=1–21|pmid=11610983}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2016}} a similar phenomenon whereby environmental (non-genetic) traits were passed has been recently discovered in a species of fly.

== Etymology ==
The term was coined by [[August Weismann]] from the Greek words [[wikt:τῆλε|τῆλε]] (tèle) meaning 'far' and [[wikt:γονος|γονος]] (gonos) meaning 'offspring'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bynum|first=Bill|title=Telegony|journal=The Lancet|date=April 2002|volume=359|issue=9313|page=1256|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08200-4|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08200-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name may also refer to [[Odysseus]]' son [[Telegonus]]; the [[lost work|lost poem]] named after him is ''[[Telegony]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Early perceptions ==
{{further|Partible paternity}}

The idea of telegony goes back to [[Aristotle]]. It states that individuals can inherit traits not only from their fathers, but also from other males previously known to their mothers. in other words, it was thought that [[partible paternity|paternity could be shared]].&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Lydia |title=Aristotle's Telegony Has Merit: Previous Male Partners Can Influence Other Men's Offspring |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/aristotle-right-about-telegony-previous-partner-can-influence-another-males-offspring-1468015 |publisher=International Business Times |date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory, expounded as part of [[Aristotle's biology]], was accepted throughout Antiquity. The concept of telegonic impregnation was expressed in [[Greek mythology]] in the origins of [[Greek hero|their heroes]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Such double fatherhood, one immortal, one mortal, was a familiar feature of heroes such as [[Theseus]], who was doubly conceived in the same night. By the understanding of [[History of human sexuality#Greece|sex in Antiquity]], the mix of semen gave Theseus a combination of divine as well as mortal characteristics. Of a supposed [[Parnassos]], founder of Delphi, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' x.6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; observes, "Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two fathers; one they say was the god [[Poseidon]], the human father being Cleopompus." Sometimes the result could be twins such as [[Castor and Pollux]], one born divine and one mortal.

The more general doctrine of "maternal impressions" was also known in Ancient Israel. The book of Genesis describes [[Jacob]] inducing goats and sheep in [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s herds to bear striped and spotted young by placing dark wooden rods with white stripes in their watering troughs.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1911|volume=26|chapter=Telegony|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Telegony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telegony influenced early Christianity as well. The [[Valentinianism|Gnostic followers]] of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinius]] (circa 100–160 CE) characteristically took the concept from the physiological world into the realm of psychology and spirituality by extending the supposed influence even to the thoughts of the woman. In the [[Gospel of Philip]], a text among those found at [[Nag Hammadi]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whomever the woman loves, to him those who are born are like; if her husband, they are like her husband; if an [[adultery|adulterer]], they are like the adulterer. Often when a woman sleeps with her husband, but while her heart is with the adulterer with whom she is accustomed to unite, she bears the one whom she bears so that he is like the adulterer.&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of Philip, p. 112. Noted in Robert M. Grant, "The Mystery of Marriage in the Gospel of Philip" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''15'''.3 (September 1961:129–140) p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of telegony was revived with the rediscovery of Aristotle in the Middle Ages.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This was part of the resistance to the marriage in 1361 of [[Edward, the Black Prince]], heir to the throne of [[Edward III of England]], with [[Joan of Kent|Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent]], who had been previously married: their progeny, it was thought, might not be completely of his [[Plantagenet|Plantagenet blood]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Understandings in the 19th century and the collapse of the theory in the 20th ==
In the 19th century, the most widely credited example was that of [[Lord Morton’s mare]], reported by the distinguished surgeon Sir [[Everard Home]], and cited by [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, ''Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication'' (1868).&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Morton bred a white [[Mare (horse)|mare]] with a wild [[quagga]] [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[quagga]] was a relative of the [[zebra]], now extinct.&lt;/ref&gt; and when he later bred the same mare with a white stallion, the offspring strangely had stripes in the legs, like the quagga.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gPbYbFt7sYYC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=lord+morton%27s+mare&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9qHq0CehKy&amp;sig=db0jgAoZRi8DomYs4wf9sT_zp40&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NwDOSfviJpCgtgOm6ZWgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result "Lord Morton's Mare"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Surgeon-General]] of New York, the physiologist [[Austin Flint (1836–1915)|Austin Flint]], in his ''Text-Book of Human Physiology'' (fourth edition, 1888) described the phenomenon as follows:&lt;ref name=Flint&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Austin|title=Text-Book of Human Physiology|year=1888|edition=fourth|publisher=Appleton, New York|location=USA|pages=797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A peculiar and, it seems to me, an inexplicable fact is, that previous pregnancies have an influence upon offspring. This is well known to breeders of animals. If pure-blooded mares or bitches have been once covered by an inferior male, in subsequent fecondations the young are likely to partake of the character of the first male, even if they be afterwards bred with males of unimpeachable pedigree. What the mechanism of the influence of the first conception is, it is impossible to say; but the fact is incontestable. The same influence is observed in the human subject. A woman may have, by a second husband, children who resemble a former husband, and this is particularly well marked in certain instances by the colour of the hair and eyes. A white woman who has had children by a negro may subsequently bear children to a white man, these children presenting some of the unmistakable peculiarities of the negro race.&lt;ref name=Flint/&gt;}}

Both [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] found telegony to be a credible theory;&lt;ref name=bondeson&gt;Jan Bondeson, ''A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities'', 1999:159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Weismann]], on the other hand, had expressed doubts about the theory earlier and it fell out of scientific favor in the 1890s. A series of experiments by [[James Cossar Ewart]] in Scotland and other researchers in Germany and Brazil failed to find any evidence of the phenomenon. Also, the statistician [[Karl Pearson]] pointed out that, if telegony was true, later children of the same couple should increasingly resemble their father, which is not the case.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=K.|title=Statistics of telegony|journal=Science|date=1 October 1909|volume=30|issue=770|pages=443–444|doi=10.1126/science.30.770.443-a|pmid=17777275|bibcode=1909Sci....30..443P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists now explain the phenomenon of Lord Morton's mare with reference to the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant and recessive]] variants of a gene: both the mare and the stallion had a recessive gene; the foal inherited these alleles and thus displayed the characteristic invisible in its parents.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In mammals, each [[spermatozoon|sperm]] has the [[haploid]] set of [[chromosome]]s and each [[ovum|egg]] has another haploid set. During the process of [[fertilization]] a [[zygote]] with the [[diploid]] set is produced. This set will be inherited by every [[somatic cell]] of a mammal, with exactly half the [[genetic material]] coming from the producer of the sperm (the father) and another half from the producer of the egg (the mother). Thus, the myth of telegony is fundamentally incompatible with our knowledge of [[genetics]] and the [[reproduction|reproductive process]]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] stated "All these beliefs, from inheritance of acquired traits to telegony, must now be classed as superstitions."&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/262934/heredity&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==

Telegony, once a popular theory among nineteenth century biologists, was largely dismissed with the arrival of [[Mendelian genetics]]. However, in 2014 the evolutionary ecologists A. J. Crean and colleagues reported a seemingly telegonic phenomenon in a fly, [[Neriidae|''Telostylinus angusticollis'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1= A. J. | last1= Crean | first2= A.

{{Quote|title = "Like father like son? Nongenetic paternal effects reinvigorate the possibility of telegony"|author=Crean, Kopps, and Bonduriansky
|quote = As a first step towards disentangling whether the effect is borne by the sperm itself or by accessory-gland products (ACPs) in the seminal fluid, we mated females initially to a male in high or low condition and then remated the female to a new male in high or low condition two weeks later. Interestingly, offspring size and viability were determined by the condition of the first male, with no effect of the condition of the second mate. Genetic tests confirm this result holds even when the second male is the biological father of the offspring. These findings suggest the paternal effect is mediated by ACPs, and provide a compelling case for reassessing the possibility of telegony as a valid phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ajcrean/&gt;}}

Y. S. Liu has proposed possible molecular mechanisms that may account for telegony; however, his work is predicated on the beliefs of pre-[[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] breeders to reinforce the idea that traits are passed from earlier matings. The proposed mechanisms include the penetration of spermatozoa into the somatic tissues of the female genital tract, the incorporation of the DNA released by spermatozoa into maternal [[somatic cell]]s, the presence of fetal DNA in maternal blood, incorporation of exogenous DNA into somatic cells, presence of fetal cells and fetal DNA in maternal blood and sperm RNA-mediated non-Mendelian inheritance of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Y.

Telegony influenced late [[Racism#19th century|19th-century racialist beliefs]]. A woman who had a child with a non-[[Aryan]] man, it was argued, could never have a "pure" Aryan child again. This idea was adopted by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]].&lt;ref name=bondeson/&gt;

Telegony re-emerged within [[Russian Orthodox Church#Post-Soviet recovery and problems|post-Soviet Russian Orthodoxy]]. ''Virginity and Telegony: The Orthodox church and modern science of genetic inversions'' was published in 2004. [[Pravda.ru]] gave an overview of the concept and a brief review of the book, saying that the authors invented "scary and incredible stories" to "make women be very careful about their sexual contacts" and that the idea was being used by the Church to scare the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman's first partner may become genetic father of all her kids, telegony says|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/health/27-06-2007/94136-telegony-0/|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher=Pravda Report|date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Kuznetsova]], who was appointed [[Children's Ombudsman#Russia|Children's Rights Commissioner for the Russian Federation]] in 2016, had said several years earlier that she believes in the concept, amongst other fringe views.

'''The Big Mo''' ("Big Momentum") is [[behavioral momentum]] that operates on a large scale.  The concept originally applied to sporting events in the 1960s in the United States, as momentum appeared to have an effect on a team's performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science20.com/sports_are_80_percent_mental/the_big_mo_psychological_momentum_in_sports Psychological momentum in sports]. See also Michael Kent, ''Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science and Medicine'', Oxford University Press, 3rd edn, 2006; [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/crystal-palace-burnley-0-warnock-takes-big-mo-to-playoffs-821173.html Big Mo in Sports], ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; Successful teams were said to have "The Big Mo" on their side.  This has since extended situations in which momentum is a driving factor, such as during political campaigns, social upheavals, economic cycles, and financial bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-big-mo-how-senator-obama-gained-the-momentum-769179.html The Big Mo: How senator Obama gained the momentum]; See also Paul Kedrosky, The First Disaster of the Internet Age, ''Newsweek'', 27 October 2008. A dictionary definition is available at: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Big+Mo&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern history==
The term was used by [[George H. W. Bush]] during his quest for the Republican nomination to run for President in 1980. After he won the Iowa [[caucus]]es, and was facing further contests, Bush Senior said, "Now they will be after me, howling and yowling at my heels. What we will have is momentum. We will look forward to Big Mo being on our side, as they say in athletics."&lt;ref&gt;Beschloss, Michael R. PBS. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/bush.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Bush lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] who went on to become the 40th President of the United States.

==Impact==
Research conducted in 2005, by Christopher Hull at [[Georgetown University]], US, suggested that from 1980 to 2000, "Big Mo" (large scale momentum) had amplified key events in US presidential races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/4/5/p85453_index.html?hpsessid=92842ec13668dd0db90c44e5c128aa9d The Big Mo from 1980 to 2004: Is Technological 'e-mentum' Amplifying Key Events in Presidential Races?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newtons cradle animation book 2.gif|right|200px|thumb|A [[Newton's cradle]] demonstrates momentum effect.]]
In 2007, three researchers from the London Business School, Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, observed in their paper "108 Years of Momentum Profits" that "momentum appears to have an inordinate and unexplained impact on the behaviour of investment markets that contradicts the efficient market theory". One of the researchers, Dr Paul Marsh said, "We remain puzzled (by these findings) and we are not the only ones; most academics are vaguely embarrassed by this."&lt;ref&gt;Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh &amp; Mike Staunton.

Research conducted on behalf of ABN Amro by the London Business School, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-up to the British election in May 2010, James Forsyth, the political editor of ''The Spectator'' magazine, wrote, "The Big Mo is with the [[Tories]]. In a campaign, momentum matters. It is, for good or ill, the [[Prism (optics)|prism]] through which the media report things."&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, James. [http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/5887083/the-big-mo-is-with-the-tories.thtml The Big Mo is with the Tories] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507090657/http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/5887083/the-big-mo-is-with-the-tories.thtml |date=2010-05-07 }}. ''The Spectator'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, an analysis conducted by [[Mark Roeder]], a former executive at the Swiss-based [[UBS Bank]], suggested that Big Mo "played a pivotal role" in the 2008–09 [[global financial crisis]]. Roeder suggested that,
{{quote|recent technological advances, such as computer-driven trading programs, together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets, has magnified the momentum effect. This effect is not limited to the financial markets. It can be felt across other aspects of society, particularly in politics, business, technology and the media where Big Mo now operates on a massive scale.&lt;ref&gt;The Big Mo: Why Momentum Now Rules Our World, by Mark Roeder.

In January 2011, a report in ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, titled "The Big Mo", said,
{{quote|The momentum effect drives a juggernaut through one of the tenets of finance theory, the efficient-market hypothesis... Even the high priests of efficient-market theory have acknowledged [its impact].   Well-paid fund managers have spent decades trying to find ways to beat the market. But you have to wonder why they bother devoting so much money and effort to researching the fortunes of individual companies when the momentum approach appears to be easy to exploit and has been around for a long time... The momentum effect raises a further important issue. If markets are rational, as the efficient-market hypothesis assumed, then they will allocate capital to its most productive uses. But the momentum effect suggests that an irrationality might be at work; investors could be buying shares (and commodities) just because they have risen in price. That would help explain why bubbles are created and why professional investors ended up allocating capital to dotcom companies with no earnings and business plans written on the back of a cigarette packet. Momentum can carry whole economies off track.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'' magazine, special report. 6 January 2011. [http://www.economist.com/node/17851295?story_id=17851295 "The Big Mo. Why Newton Was Wrong"]. See also http://www.economist.com/node/17848665&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theoretical analysis==
The mechanism by which momentum influences human behaviour on a large scale is not known, but a number of theories exist. In 1982, a research team led by John Nevin, [[Professor Emeritus]] of Psychology at the [[University of New Hampshire]], US, together with Charlotte Mandel and Jean Atak, wrote a paper called "The Analysis of Behavioural Momentum", in which they explored why certain behaviours can become persistent over time. The team proposed that people's tendency to continue to behave in a certain way, and resist change, is dependent on the type of reinforcement they receive. The team developed a method for calculating the impact of behavioural momentum, based on the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] formula: Δ''V'' = ''f'' / ''m'', in which Δ''V'' is the change in velocity or, in behavioural terms, response rate; Velocity (''V'') refers to the response rate; mass (''m'') refers to the response strength, and force (''f'') refers to the change in the contingencies for the behaviour (i.e., environment change). The work of Nevin, Mandel and Atak has been influential in the development of social and health-care policies, such as drug rehabilitation programs, where behavioural persistence (momentum) and relapse are critical issues. &lt;ref&gt;Grace, R.C. (1994). Independence of reinforcement delay and magnitude in concurrent chains. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 63, 255–276; Grace, R.C.; Bedell, M.A. &amp; Nevin, J.A. (2002). Preference and resistance to change with constant- and variable-duration terminal links: Independence of reinforcement rate and magnitude. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 77, 233–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversial theories about behavioural momentum derive from [[quantum physics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. In her book ''The Field'', author Lyn McTaggart cites experiments that show that in certain group environments that, "each member of the group becomes less highly-tuned to their own separate information and more receptive to that of other group members. In effect, they pick up someone else's information from the 'field' as if it were their own". She says this phenomenon is akin to what sports teams experience when they "enter the zone" and are influenced by momentum.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn McTaggart, ''The Field'', HarperCollins, 2001, p. 180. {{ISBN|978-0-06-143518-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In World War II==
The "Big Mo" was also the nickname for the battleship ''[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS Missouri]]''. This was the ship where [[Japan]] signed their surrender to the United States.

[[File:ToK Simple.jpg|thumb|379px|Gregg Henriques' Tree of Knowledge System]]

The '''tree of knowledge''' ('''ToK''') '''system''' is a theoretical approach to the unification of [[psychology]] developed by [[Gregg Henriques]], associate professor and director of the Combined-Integrated Doctoral Program in Clinical and School Psychology at [[James Madison University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/about%20me.htm "About Me" section of the ToK System website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the system was published in 2003 in ''[[Review of General Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Two special issues of the ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'' in December 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109747885 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (December 2004). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 1) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 60 Issue 12, Pages 1203 – 1315]&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109856879 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (January 2005). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 2) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 61 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 139 ]&lt;/ref&gt; were devoted to the elaboration and evaluation of the model. The latest evaluation of this model appeared in a December 2008 special issue of ''[[Theory &amp; Psychology']]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol18/issue6/ ''Theory &amp; Psychology''. (December 2008). Volume 18, No. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website on the tree of knowledge system claims that the ToK is

:''a new unified theory of knowledge that maps the pieces of the scientific puzzle in a novel way that connects Quantum Mechanics to Sociological processes and everything in between into a coherent whole. The most novel aspect of the ToK is its visuo-spatial depiction of knowledge as consisting of four dimensions of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture) that correspond to the behavior of four classes of objects (material objects, organisms, animals, and humans), and four classes of science (physical, biological, psychological, and social).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/other%20research.htm ToK FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "problem of psychology"==
Henriques argues that the most difficult problem in psychology as a discipline is that while there is incredible diversity offered by different approaches to psychology, there is no consensus model of what ''psychology'' actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the ToK system, the "problem of psychology", (as Henriques puts it), is that a clear definition, an agreed upon subject matter, and a coherent conceptual framework have eluded its students for its entire [[history of psychology|history]]. He further argues that the patent tendency of psychology has been toward theoretical and substantial fragmentation and increasing insularity among the "specialties." In other words, the discipline has fragmented into [[psychological schools|different schools of thought]] and methodology, with no overall framework to interpret and integrate the research of different areas. At its best, the different approaches are a strength of psychology; different approaches lead to novel ideas, and prevent psychologists from clinging to a paradigm that fails to explain a phenomenon. At its worst, adherents of one particular school cling to their beliefs concerning the relative importance of their research and disregard or are ignorant of different approaches. In most cases, individual psychologists have to determine for themselves which elements of which perspective to apply, and how to integrate them into their overall understanding.
 
The reason for psychology's fragmentation, according to the ToK, is that there has been no [[metatheory|meta-theoretical]] frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 ''Review of General Psychology'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.

Cultural and personality psychologist, Michael Katzko,&lt;ref&gt;[http://baserv.uci.kun.nl/~mwsk49/ Homepage of Michael Katzko]&lt;/ref&gt; however critiques Henriques' position on "the problem of psychology":

:''There is a very good reason for skepticism regarding the repeated claims that the one unique problem of psychology, applicable across the entire discipline, has been identified and that the ToK System solves it. The reason is given by the detail with which alternatives have been worked out, be they historical studies of institutional development or critical commentaries on the rhetorical structure of psychology's literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Katzko, M.W. (2008). Pruning the Tree of Knowledge. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 817–828. [http://tap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/6/817 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree of knowledge==
In one way, the tree of knowledge system reflects a fairly common hierarchy of nature and of the sciences that has been represented in one way or another since the time of [[Auguste Comte]], who in the 19th century used a hierarchical conception of nature to argue for the existence of sociology. Despite its surface agreement with a standard conception, the ToK System offers a set of ideas that have added implications for both [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The ontological claim made by the ToK, (and [[#top|depicted pictorially above]]), is that [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]] consists of four separable dimensions of complexity, namely [[matter]], life, [[mind]], and culture. The dimension of complexity argument is arguably one of the most complicated aspects of the system. Many have argued nature is hierarchically leveled; for example, a list of such levels might be [[subatomic particles]], [[atoms]], [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, organ structures, multi-celled organisms, [[consciousness]], and society is common. The ToK System embraces a view of nature as levels, but adds the notion that there are also ''dimensions of complexity''. The difference can be seen pictorially. A view of nature as solely consisting of levels would have a single "cone" of complexity, whereas the ToK depicts four "cones". The ToK posits that a separate dimension of complexity emerges when a process of selection operates on a unit of information. Thus, according to the ToK, [[natural selection]] operating on genetic combinations gives rise to the dimension of Life; [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral selection]] operating on [[neuron]]al combinations gives rise to the dimension of Mind; and [[theory of justification|justification]] operating on [[symbol]]ic combinations gives rise to Culture.

The ToK system also offers a new epistemology that Henriques believes will move toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed ''[[consilience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1999). ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]''. Vintage:USA&lt;/ref&gt; Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. The ToK offers alternative perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts science itself as both emerging out of culture and as a unique type of "justification system" that is based on the values of [[accuracy]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the ToK system. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; A "justification system", according to Henriques, refers to any belief system that emerges that coordinates the behaviors of individual humans to human populations. The four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the [[physical science|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[social science]]s.

===Matter===

The dimension of [[matter]] refers to the set of material objects and their behaviors through time. In accordance with modern [[cosmology]], matter is theorized to have emerged from a pure energy [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the [[Big Bang]]. [[Space-time|Space and time]] were also born at such a point. Nonliving material objects range in complexity from [[subatomic particle]]s to large organic molecules. The physical sciences (i.e., [[physics]], [[chemistry]], geology, [[astronomy]]) describe the behavior of material objects.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life===

The dimension of life refers to [[organism]]s and their behaviors through time. Living objects are considered a unique subset of material objects. Just as [[quantum particle]]s form the fundamental units of material complexity, [[gene]]s are the fundamental units of living information. Although many questions about the emergence of life remain unanswered, in accordance with modern biology, the ToK posits that natural selection operating on genetic combinations through time is the unified theory of biology and forms the foundational understanding for the emergence of organic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind===

Mind/cognition in the ToK system refers to the set of mental behaviors. ''Mental behaviors'' are behaviors of animals mediated by the [[nervous system]] that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind/cognition is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting a drink of water are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with [[sentience]] or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental/cognitive dimension. [[Cognition]], in the broad sense of the term is meaning bodily-neuro-social information processing, as in EEEE Cognition: Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, Extended. While cognitive science stands for naturalist study of mind, psychology is an approach grounded in the tradition of humanities, especially philosophy. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[behaviorism|behavioral science]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===

Culture in the ToK system refers to the set of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] behaviors, which range from large scale nation states to individual human justifications for particular actions. Just as genetic information processing is associated with the Life dimension and neuronal information processing associated with the Mind dimension, symbolic information processing emerges with the Cultural dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical joint points==

===Quantum gravity===
{{main|Quantum gravity}}

'''Quantum gravity''' refers to the imagined merger between the twin pillars of physical science which are [[quantum mechanics]], the study of the microscopic (e.g., electrons), and [[general relativity]], the science of the macroscopic (e.g., [[galaxy|galaxies]]). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical [[Theory of Everything]]. Yet progress is being made, most notably through [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], [[black hole thermodynamics]] and the study of the early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and it is possible that the macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge in relationship to the physical universe.

===The modern synthesis===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)|l1=The Modern Synthesis}}

The '''modern synthesis''' refers to the merger of genetics with [[natural selection]] which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s and offers a reasonably complete framework for understanding the emergence of biological complexity. Although there remain significant gaps in biological knowledge surrounding questions such as the origin of life and the emergence of sexual reproduction, the modern synthesis represents the most complete and well-substantiated joint point.

===Behavioral investment theory===

'''Behavioral investment theory''' ('''BIT''') is proposed as a merger of the selection science of [[behaviorism]] with the information science of [[cognitive neuroscience]] (notice the parallel with the modern synthesis). BIT posits that the nervous system evolved as an increasingly flexible computational control system that coordinates the behavioral expenditure of energy of the animal as a whole. Expenditure of behavioral energy is theorized to be computed on an investment value system built evolutionarily through natural selection operating on genetic combinations and [[ontogeny|ontogenetically]] through behavioral selection operating on neural combinations. As such, the current behavioral investments of the animal are conceptualized as the joint product of the two vectors of [[phylogeny]] and [[ontogeny]]. A unique element of BIT is that it finds a core of agreement and builds bridges between five brain-behavior paradigms: (1) [[cognitive science]]; (2) [[behavioral science]]; (3) evolutionary theory and genetics; (4) neuroscience; and (5) [[cybernetics]]/[[systems theory]].

[[David C. Geary]] noted the similarities between his "motive-to-control" hypothesis and Henriques' Behavioral Investment Theory, which were developed independently of each other. Furthermore, Geary suggested that his model "seem[ed] to fill in many of the [[proximate causation|proximate mechanisms]] and evolutionary pressures that define the life-mind joint point, and provided a framework for further development of the mind-culture joint point."&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2005). [http://web.missouri.edu/~psycorie/JCP05%5Bfinal%5D05.pdf The motivation to control and the origin of mind: Exploring the life-mind joint point in the tree of knowledge.] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 61,'' 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justification hypothesis===

The '''justification hypothesis''' ('''JH''') is a novel proposal that allows for both the understanding of the evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.

The JH can be stated succinctly as follows: The evolution of language gave rise to the problem of justification, and this evolutionary pressure ultimately resulted in the human self-consciousness system and human culture. The JH carries with it three fundamental postulates. 
*The first is that the evolution of language must have created the problem of justification, which is the problem of explaining one’s self to others in a justifiable manner.
*The second postulate is that the human self-consciousness system can be understood as a “justification filter”. This second claim links the evolutionary analysis with key insights from [[psychodynamic theory]]. Specifically, psychodynamic theory posits that socially unjustifiable impulses are inhibited and socially justifiable reasons are given for actions taken.
*The third postulate is that culture can be understood as large scale justification systems that coordinate the behavior of human populations. Cultural systems are seen to evolve much in the same way as organisms do in biological evolution: there is a process of variation, selection and retention of belief systems.

==How the ToK solves the problem of psychology==

The problem of psychology, according to the ToK, is its conceptual incoherence, which Henriques identifies by the following: 
:(1) There is no agreed upon definition.
:(2) There is no agreed upon subject matter.
:(3) There is a proliferation of overlapping and redundant concepts.
:(4) There are a large number of paradigms with fundamentally different epistemological assumptions.
:(5) Specialization continues to be increasingly emphasized at the expense of generalization and thus the problem of fragmentation only grows.

When the various conceptions of psychology (e.g., behavioral, humanistic, cognitive) are viewed through the lens of the ToK System, psychology spans two different dimensions of complexity: the mental and the cultural. In other words, the discipline has historically spanned two fundamentally separate problems: 
:(1) the problem of animal behavior in general, and
:(2) the problem of human behavior at the individual level.
 
If, as previously thought, nature simply consisted of levels of complexity, psychology would not be crisply defined in relationship to biology or the social sciences. And, indeed, it is frequently suggested that psychology exists in an amorphous space between biology and the social sciences. However, with its dimension of complexity depiction, the ToK System suggests that psychology can be crisply defined as the science of mind, which is the third dimension of complexity. Furthermore, because human behavior exists in the fourth dimension, psychology must be divided into two broad scientific domains of 
:(1) psychological formalism and
:(2) human psychology.

''Psychological formalism'' is defined as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. ''Human psychology'' is considered to be a unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though David A. F. Haaga "congratulate[d] Dr. Henriques' ambitious, scholarly, provocative paper", and "found the Tree of Knowledge taxonomy, the theoretical joint points, the evolutionary history, and the levels of emergent properties highly illuminating", he asks the rhetorical questions, 
:''If it is so difficult to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take the rest of the afternoon off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.''&lt;ref&gt;Haaga, D.A.F. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Defining%20Psychology.pdf Defining psychology: What can it do for us?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1227–1230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, Scott O. Lilienfeld, who described Henriques' effort as "thoughtful", contended that psychology is "an inherently fuzzy concept that resists precise definition" and that "attempts to define psychology [would be] likely to hamper rather than foster consilience across disciplines". Lilienfield went on further to suggest that the scientist-practitioner gap in psychology lies not in definitional issues, but in different "epistemic attitudes" between these two groups. He stated that scientists have an epistemic attitude of [[empiricism]], (where questions regarding human nature are settled by scientific evidence), and that practitioners have an epistemic attitude of [[romanticism]], (where questions of human nature are settled by intuition). Lilienfeld suggested that the solution to the scientist-practitioner gulf isn't definitional, but in "train[ing] future clinical scientists to appreciate the proper places of romanticism and empiricism within science".&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Is%20it%20worth%20the%20trouble.pdf Defining psychology: Is it worth the trouble?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1249–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and human behavior==

A frequent question and point of confusion in the ToK System is the definition and meaning of [[consciousness]]. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, it is crucial to recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are [[sentience]], which is the capacity for mental experience and [[self-awareness]], which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a "level 3" phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a "perceived" electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the "hard" problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of the other issue of consciousness, that of [[self-awareness]]. 
 
Another frequent question that is raised is "Where does individual human behavior fall on the ToK?" To analyze human behavior from the context of the ToK, one uses the ToK like a prism to separate the dimensions of behavior into physiochemical, biogenetic, neuropsychological and sociolinguistic. Thus if we imagine a conversation between a husband and wife as follows:

:Wife: “You are late again.”
:Husband: “Please not now. It was a stressful day and traffic was bad and you know if work needs to be done, I can’t just leave it.”

The words represent the sociolinguistic dimension and are understood as a function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of [[facial expression]], body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood as a function of behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.

==Toward the integration of human knowledge==

As stated above, the ToK System proposes a new [[epistemology]] with the goal of moving academic knowledge toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed [[consilience]]. Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. Henriques argues that the ToK affords new perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts how science emerges from culture and that the four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

Henriques further argues that developing such a system for integrating knowledge is not just an academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen as one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.
  
In a 2008 article on the ToK,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the Tree of Knowledge System. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques cites [[Oliver Reiser]]'s 1958 call for unifying scientific knowledge that Henriques implies is similar in theme to the ToK:

::''In this time of divisive tendencies within and between the nations, races, religions, sciences and humanities, synthesis must become the great magnet which orients us all…[Yet] scientists have not done what is possible toward integrating bodies of knowledge created by science into a unified interpretation of man, his place in nature, and his potentialities for creating the good society. Instead, they are entombing us in dark and meaningless catacombs of learning.''&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, O.L. (1958). The integration of human knowledge. Boston: Porter Sargent.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its depiction of the dimensions of complexity and interlocking theoretical joint points, Henriques' believes that his  ToK System offers new avenues that might allow scholars to meet Reiser’s call for academic synthesis. Henriques, like Reiser, believes that with a shared sense of purpose and a common background of explanation, people might yet be able to integrate bodies of knowledge into a unified interpretation of humanity, with humanity's place in nature and its potentialities for creating the good society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">In [[type theory]] and [[programming language]]s, a '''type variable''' is a [[Variable_(mathematics)|mathematical variable]] ranging over [[data types|types]]. Even in programming languages that allow [[variable (programming)|mutable variable]]s, a type variable remains an abstraction, in the sense that it does not correspond to some memory locations.

[[Programming language]]s that support [[parametric polymorphism]] make use of [[universally quantified]] type variables. Languages that support [[existential type]]s make use of [[existentially quantified]] type variables. For example, the following [[OCaml]] code defines a polymorphic [[identity function]] that has a universally quantified type, which is printed by the interpreter on the second line:

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
# let id x = x;;
val id : 'a -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In mathematical notation, the type of the function &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\forall a.a \to a&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a type variable.

'''Vipassanā''' ([[Pāli]]) or '''vipaśyanā''' ({{lang-sa|विपश्यन}}), "insight," in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition is [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|insight]] into the true nature of reality, defined as ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering or unsatisfactoriness), ''[[anatta]]'' (non-self), and ''[[anicca]]'' (impermanence), the [[three marks of existence]] in the Theravada tradition,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=889}}{{sfn|Gunaratana|2011|p=21}} and as ''[[sunyata]]'' and ''[[Buddha-nature]]'' in the Mahayana traditions. 

Meditation practice was ended in the Theravada tradition the 10th century, but was re-introduced in Myanmar (Burma) the 18th century,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=889-890}} based on contemporary readings of the ''Satipatthana-sutta'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and other texts. A new tradition developed in the 19th and 20th century, centering on bare insight in conjunction with ''[[samatha]]''.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=890}}&lt;ref&gt;David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; It became of central importance in the 20th century [[Vipassana movement]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} as developed by [[Ledi Sayadaw]] and [[Mogok Sayadaw]] and popularised by [[Mahasi Sayadaw]], V. R. Dhiravamsa, and [[S. N. Goenka]].{{sfn|King|1992|p=132–137}}{{sfn|Nyanaponika|1998|p=107–109}}{{sfn|Koster|2009|p=9–10}}

In modern [[Theravada]], the combination or disjunction of ''vipassana'' and ''samatha'' is a matter of dispute. While the Pali sutras hardly mention ''vipassana'', describing it as a mental quality alongside with ''samatha'' which develop in tandem and lead to liberation, the Abhidhamma and the commentaries describe ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' as two separate meditation techniques. The Vipassana-movement favoures ''vipassana'' over ''samatha'', but critics point out that both are necessary elements of the Buddhist training.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Enlightenment in Buddhism|Sotāpanna|Jnana|Wisdom in Buddhism{{!}}Prajna|Bodhi|Vidhya|Kensho}}
''Vipassanā'' is a [[Pāli|Pali]] word from the Sanskrit prefix "vi-" and verbal root paś. It is often translated as ''"insight"'' or ''"clear-seeing"'', though the "in-" prefix in "insight" may be misleading; "vi" in [[Indo-Aryan languages]] is equivalent to the Latin "dis." The "vi" in vipassanā may then mean to see into, see through or to see 'in a special way.'{{sfn|Gunaratana|2011|p=21}} Alternatively, the "vi" can function as an intensive, and thus vipassanā may mean "seeing deeply."{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A synonym for "Vipassanā" is ''paccakkha'' (Pāli; Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|pratyakṣa}}''), "before the eyes," which refers to direct experiential perception. Thus, the type of seeing denoted by "vipassanā" is that of direct perception, as opposed to knowledge derived from reasoning or argument.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In Tibetan, ''vipaśyanā'' is ''lhagthong'' (wylie: ''lhag mthong''). The term "''lhag''" means "higher", "superior", "greater"; the term "''thong''" is "view" or "to see". So together, ''lhagthong'' may be rendered into English as "superior seeing", "great vision" or "supreme wisdom." This may be interpreted as a "superior manner of seeing", and also as "seeing that which is the essential nature." Its nature is a lucidity&amp;mdash;a clarity of mind.&lt;ref name="ray74"&gt;Ray (2004) p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henepola Gunaratana]] defined Vipassanā as:
{{quote|Looking into something with clarity and precision, seeing each component as distinct and separate, and piercing all the way through so as to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing"{{sfn|Gunaratana|2011|p=21}}}}

==Origins==
According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], in the sutta pitaka the term "vipassanā" is hardly mentioned, while they frequently mention [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]] as the meditative practice to be undertaken.{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|n.d.}}{{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: "If you look directly at the Pali discourses &amp;mdash; the earliest extant sources for our knowledge of the Buddha's teachings &amp;mdash; you'll find that although they do use the word samatha to mean tranquillity, and vipassanā to mean clear-seeing, they otherwise confirm none of the received wisdom about these terms. Only rarely do they make use of the word vipassanā &amp;mdash; a sharp contrast to their frequent use of the word [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]. When they depict the Buddha telling his disciples to go meditate, they never quote him as saying "go do vipassanā," but always "go do jhana." And they never equate the word vipassanā with any mindfulness techniques."{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|n.d.}}}} When ''vipassanā'' is mentioned, it is always in tandem with ''[[samatha]]'', as a pair of qualities of mind which are developed.{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|n.d.}} According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, "''samatha'', ''jhana'', and ''vipassana'' were all part of a single path."{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|n.d.}} {{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: "This description of the unified role of samatha and vipassana is based upon the Buddha's meditation teachings as presented in the suttas (see "One Tool Among Many" by Thanissaro Bhikkhu). The Abhidhamma and the Commentaries, by contrast, state that samatha and vipassana are two distinct meditation paths (see, for example, The Jhanas in Theravada Buddhist Meditation by H. Gunaratana, ch. 5)."&lt;ref name="What_is"/&gt;}} Norman notes that "the Buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices."{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' constituted the original "liberating practice".{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Cousins|1996|p=58}} Vetter further argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}} Vetter and Bronkhorst further note that ''dhyana'' is not limited to single-pointed concentration, which seems to be described in the first ''jhana'', but develops into equanimity and mindfulness,{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=13}}{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=140, note 58}}{{refn|group=note|Original publication: {{Citation | last =Gombrich | first =Richard | year =2007 | title =Religious Experience in Early Buddhism | publisher =OCHS Library | url =http://www.ochs.org.uk/lectures/religious-experience-early-buddhism}}}} "born from samadhi"{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXVI, note 9}} but no longer absorbed in concentration, being mindfully awareness of objects while being indifferent to it,{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107; 140, note 58}} "directing states of meditative absorption towards the mindful awareness of objects."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=106-107}}

Out of these debates developed the idea that bare insight suffices to reach [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]], by discerning the [[Three marks of existence|Three marks]] (qualities) of (human) existence (''tilakkhana''), namely [[dukkha]] (suffering), [[anatta]] (non-self) and [[anicca]] (impermanence).{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=96-144}}

According to Buswell, by the 10th century ''vipassana'' was  no longer practiced in the Theravada tradition, due to the believe that Buddhism had degenerated, and that liberation was no longer attainable until the coming of ''Maitreya''.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=889}} It was re-introdcued in Myanmar (Burma) in the 18th century by [[Medawi]] (1728–1816), leading to the rise of the [[Vipassana movement]] in the 20th century, re-inventing ''vipassana''-meditation and developing simplified meditation techniques, based on the ''[[Satipatthana sutta]]'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and other texts, emphasizing ''[[satipatthana]]'' and bare insight.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=890}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=189}}&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Buddhadasa]] rejected the reliance on the ''Satipatthana sutta'' as being "vague and muddled," instead relying on the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]''.&lt;ref name="Chapman"/&gt; According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.{{sfn|Buddhadasa Bhikkhu|2014|p=79, 101, 117 note 42}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Grzegorz Polak, the four ''upassanā'' (foundations of mindfulness) have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four ''upassanā'' do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness:{{sfn|Polak|2011}}
* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').}} Ultimately, these techniques aim at stream entry, with the idea that this first stage of the path to awakening safeguards future development of the person towards full awakening, despite the degenerated age we live in.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=2}}{{refn|group=note|* Fronsdal: "The primary purpose for which Mahasi offered his form of vipassana practice is the attainment of the first of the four traditional Theravada levels of sainthood (that is, stream entry; sotapatti)
through the realization of nibbana, or enlightenment."{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=2}}&lt;br&gt;* Robert Sharf: "In fact, contrary to the image propagated by twentieth-century apologists, the actual practice of what we would call meditation rarely played a major role in Buddhist monastic life. The ubiquitous notion of mappo or the "final degenerate age of the dharma" served to reinforce the notion that "enlightenment" was not in fact a viable goal for monks living in inauspicious times."{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=241}}&lt;br&gt;* Robert Sharf: "The initial "taste" of nibbana signals the attainment of sotapatti-the first of four levels of enlightenment-which renders the meditator a "noble person" (ariya-puggala)destined for release from the wheel of existence (samsara)in relatively short order."{{sfn|Sharf|1995|p=256}}}}

===Relation with samatha===
{{See also|Samatha|Samadhi (Buddhism)|Dhyāna in Buddhism|Mahamudra|Raja yoga}}

While the [[Abhidhamma]] and the commentaries present ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' as separate paths,{{refn|group=note|Various traditions disagree which techniques belong to which pole.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}}} in the sutras ''vipassana'' and ''samatha'', combined with ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'' (mindfulness), are used together to explore "the fundamental nature of mind and body.&lt;ref name="What_is"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theravada Buddhism?|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html|work=Access to Insight|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later Theravada tradition, samatha is regarded as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening concentration in order for insight to arise, which leads to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]].

===Vipassanā movement===
{{See also|Vipassana movement|Buddhist modernism}}

The term ''vipassana'' is often conflated with the [[Vipassana movement]], a movement which popularised the new ''vipassana'' teachings and practice. It started in the 1950s in Burma, but has gained wide renown mainly through American Buddhist teachers such as [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], [[Tara Brach]], [[Gil Fronsdal]], [[Sharon Salzberg]], and [[Jack Kornfield]]. The movement has had a wide appeal due to being open and inclusive to different Buddhist and non-buddhist wisdom, poetry as well as science. It has together with the modern American Zen tradition served as one of the main inspirations for the 'mindfulness movement' as developed by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] and others. The Vipassanā Movement, also known as the Insight Meditation Movement, is rooted in [[Theravada|Theravāda]] Buddhism and the revival of meditation techniques, especially the [[Vipassana movement#The Mahasi ("New Burmese") Method|"New Burmese Method"]] and the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], as well as the modern influences{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} on the traditions of [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]].

In the Vipassanā Movement, the emphasis is on the [[Satipatthana Sutta]] and the use of [[Sati (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] to gain insight into the impermanence of the self. It argues that the development of strong samatha can be disadvantageous,{{sfn|Bond|1992|p=167}} a stance for which the Vipassana Movement has been criticised, especially in Sri Lanka.{{sfn|Bond|1992|p=162-171}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/tag/geoffrey-samuel/ Robert H. Sharf, Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University]&lt;/ref&gt; The "New Burmese Method" was developed by [[U Nārada]] (1868–1955), and popularised by [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] (1904-1982) and [[Nyanaponika Thera]] (1901–1994). Other influential Burmese proponents are Ledi Sayadaw and Mogok Sayadaw (who was less known to the West due to lack of International Mogok Centres); [[S. N. Goenka]] was a student of Ledi Sayadaw. Influential Tai teachers are [[Ajahn Chah]] and [[Buddhadasa]]. A well-known Asian female teacher is [[Dipa Ma]].

===Vipassana-meditation===
{{See also|Four stages of enlightenment}}

====Morality, mindfulness of breathing, and reflection====
Vipassanā-meditation uses ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'' (mindfulness) and ''[[samatha]]'' (calm), developed through the practice of ''[[anapanasati]]'' (mindfulness of breathing), combined with the contemplation of [[Anicca|impermanence]] as observed in the bodily and mental changes, to gain [[Sampajañña|insight]] into the true nature of this reality.{{sfn|Nyanaponika|1998}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=133}}

Practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of ''[[Śīla|sila]]'', morality, giving up wordly thoughts and desires.{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=54-55}}&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, ''Manual of Insight, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Wilson notes that morality is a quintessential element of Buddhist practice, and is also emphasized by the first generation of post-war western teachers. Yet, in the contemporary mindfulness movement, morality as an element of practice has been mostly discarded, 'mystifying' the origins of mindfulness.{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=54-55}}

The practitioner then engages in ''[[anapanasati]]'', mindfulness of breathing, which is described in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]] as going into the forest and sitting beneath a tree and then to simply watch the breath. If the breath is long, to notice that the breath is long, if the breath is short, to notice that the breath is short.&lt;ref&gt;Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No. 118, Section No. 2, translated from the Pali&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Satipatthana Sutta]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the "New Burmese Method," the practitioner [[Sati (Buddhism)|pays attention]] to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in [[vitaka]], noting or naming physical and mental phenomena ("breathing, breathing"), without engaging the phenomenon with further conceptual thinking.&lt;ref name="Practical"&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, ''Practical Vipassana Instructions''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhante Bodhidhamma, [https://buddhismnow.com/2013/09/12/vipassana-as-taught-by-the-mahasi-sayadaw-of-burma/ ''Vipassana as taught by The Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma'']&lt;/ref&gt; By noticing the arising of physical and mental phenomena, the meditator becomes aware how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena,&lt;ref name="Practical"/&gt; as described in the five ''[[skandhas]]'' and ''[[paṭiccasamuppāda]]''. According to Sayadaw U Pandita, awareness and observation of these sensations is de-coupled from any kind of physical response, which is intended to recondition one's impulsive responses to stimuli, becoming less likely to physically or emotionally overreact to the happenings of the world&lt;ref&gt;Sayadaw U Pandita, [http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1465 ''How to Practice Vipassana Insight Meditation''], Lion's Roar&lt;/ref&gt;

The practitioner also becomes aware of the perpetual changes involved in breathing, and the arising and passing away of mindfulness.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt; This noticing is accompanied by reflections on [[paṭiccasamuppāda|causation]] and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into [[dukkha]], [[anatta]], and [[anicca]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, ''Practical Vipassana Instructions'', p.22-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhamma.org/en/art.shtml |title=The Art of Living: Vipassana Meditation |publisher=Dhamma.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues, and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general, without necessarily naming them.&lt;ref&gt;PVI, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nyanaponika|1998}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=133}}

====Stages of Jhana in the Vipassana movement====
Vipassanā jhanas are stages that describe the development of samatha in ''vipassanā'' meditation practice as described in modern Burmese Vipassana meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Daniel (2008), ''Mastering the core teachings of the Buddha'', Karnac Books, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Mahasi Sayadaw]]'s student [[Sayadaw U Pandita]] described the four ''vipassanā jhanas'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Sayadaw U Pandita, ''In this very life''&lt;/ref&gt;
# The meditator first explores the body/mind connection as one, nonduality; discovering three characteristics. The first jhana consists in seeing these points and in the presence of ''[[vitakka]]'' and ''[[vicara]]''. Phenomena reveal themselves as appearing and ceasing.
# In the second ''jhana'', the practice seems effortless. ''Vitaka'' and ''vicara'' both disappear.
# In the third ''jhana'', ''[[Pīti|piti]]'', the joy, disappears too: there is only happiness (''[[sukha]]'') and concentration.
# The fourth ''jhana'' arises, characterised by purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. The practice leads to direct knowledge. The comfort disappears because the dissolution of all phenomena is clearly visible. The practice will show every phenomenon as unstable, transient, disenchanting. The desire of freedom will take place.

==Northern tradition and Mahāyāna==

===Texts===
The north Indian Buddhist traditions like the [[Sarvastivada]] and the [[Sautrantika]] practiced ''vipaśyanā'' meditation as outlined in texts like the [[Abhidharmakosha]] of [[Vasubandhu]] and the [[Yogacarabhumi]]. The Abhidharmakosha states that ''vipaśyanā'' is practiced once one has reached [[samadhi]] (absorption) by cultivating the [[four foundations of mindfulness]] (''smrtyupasthanas'').&lt;ref name="Vallee Poussin page 925"&gt;De La Vallee Poussin (trans.); Pruden, Leo M. (trans.) ''Abhidharmakosabhasyam of Vasubandhu'' Vol. III page 925&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved according to [[Vasubandhu]]:
{{quote|By considering the unique characteristics (''svalaksana'') and the general characteristics (''samanyalaksana'') of the body, sensation, the mind, and the dharmas."&lt;br&gt;'The unique characteristics' means its self nature (''svabhava'').&lt;br&gt;The general characteristics" signifies the fact that "All conditioned things are impermanent; all impure dharmas are suffering; and that all the dharmas are empty (''sunya'') and not-self (''anatmaka'').&lt;ref name="Vallee Poussin page 925"/&gt;}}

Asanga's [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states that the practice of ''śamatha''-''vipaśyanā'' is a part of a Bodhisattva's path at the beginning, in the first "path of preparation" (''Sambharamarga'').&lt;ref&gt;Rahula; Boin-Webb. Abhidharmasamuccaya The Compendium of the Higher Teaching by Asanga, 1971 page xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

The later Indian Mahayana scholastic tradition, as exemplified by [[Shantideva]]'s [[Bodhicaryavatara]], saw ''śamatha'' as a necessary prerequisite to ''vipaśyanā'' and thus one needed to first begin with calm abiding meditation and then proceed to insight. In the Panjika commentary of Prajnakaramati on the [[Bodhicaryavatara]], ''vipaśyanā'' is defined simply as "wisdom (''[[prajña]]'') that has the nature of thorough knowledge of reality as it is."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan; Wallace, Vesa A. A guide to the bodhisattva way of life (Bodhicaryavatara) by Santideva, Snow Lion Publications Ithaca, New York US, page 90, http://www.drepunggomangusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shantideva-bodhicaryavatara-wallace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sunyata''===
[[Mahāyāna]] ''vipaśyanā'' differs from the Theravada tradition in its strong emphasis on the meditation on emptiness ([[shunyata]]) of all phenomena. The Mahayana ''Akṣayamati-nirdeśa'' refers to vipaśyanā as seeing phenomena as they really are, that is, empty, without self, nonarisen, and without grasping. The [[Prajnaparamita]] sutra in 8,000 lines states that the practice of insight is the non-appropriation of any dharmas, including the [[five aggregates]]:
{{quote|So too, a Bodhisattva coursing in perfect wisdom and developing as such, neither does nor even can stand in form, feeling, perception, impulse and consciousness...This concentrated insight of a Bodhisattva is called 'the non-appropriation of all dharmas'.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock (Copper), Richard (trans.) '''The Prajna Paramita Sutra on the Buddha-Mother's Producing the Three Dharma Treasures, Spoken by the Buddha''' (Also known as:) The Perfection of Wisdom in 8000 Lines, '''The Smaller Prajna Paramita Sutra (Tripitaka: 0227)'''(Taisho Tripitaka: 0228) , '''Translated into Chinese during Song Dynasty by Tripitaka Master Danapala, chapter 1. http://www.fodian.net/world/0228_01.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Likewise the Prajnaparamita in 25,000 lines states that a Bodhisattva should know the nature of the five aggregates as well as all dharmas thus:
{{quote|That form, etc. [feeling, perception, impulse and consciousness], which is like a dream, like an echo, a mock show, a mirage, a reflection of the moon in water, an apparition, that is neither bound nor freed. Even so form, etc., which is past, future, or present, is neither bound nor freed. And why? Because of the nonbeing-ness of form, etc. Even so form, etc., whether it be wholesome or unwholesome, defiled or undefiled, tainted or untainted, with or without outflows, worldly or supramundane, defiled or purified, is neither bound nor freed, on account of its non-beingness, its isolatedness, its quiet calm, its emptiness, signless-ness, wishless-ness, because it has not been brought together or produced. And that is true of all dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom: With the Divisions of the Abhisamayalankara (Center for South and Southeast Asia Studies, UC Berkeley) page 141&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sudden insight===
The [[Sthaviravāda]], one of the [[early Buddhist schools]] from which the Theravada-tradition originates, emphasized sudden insight:
{{quote|In the Sthaviravada [...] progress in understanding comes all at once, 'insight' (''abhisamaya'') does not come 'gradually' (successively - ''anapurva'').{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}}}}

The [[Mahasanghika]], another one of the early Buddhist schools, had the doctrine of ''ekaksana-citt'', "according to which a Buddha knows everything in a single thought-instant".{{sfn|Gomez|1991|p=69}}{{citation not found}} This process however, meant to apply only to the Buddha and Peccaka buddhas. Lay people may have to experience various levels of insights to become fully enlightened.

The [[Mahayana]] tradition emphasizes [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], insight into [[sunyata]], [[dharmata]], the [[two truths doctrine]], clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Defined by Reginald A. Ray |url=http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2004/summer/dharma_dictionary.htm |title="Vipashyana," by Reginald A. Ray. '&amp;#39;Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly'&amp;#39;, Summer 2004 |publisher=Archive.thebuddhadharma.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200123/http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2004/summer/dharma_dictionary.htm |archive-date=2014-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[T]he very title of a large corpus of early Mahayana literature, the ''[[Prajnaparamita]]'', shows that to some extent the historian may extrapolate the trend to extol insight, ''prajna'', at the expense of dispassion, ''viraga'', the control of the emotions.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=133}}}}

Although Theravada and Mahayana are commonly understood as different streams of Buddhism, their practice however, may reflect emphasis on insight as a common denominator:
{{quote|In practice and understanding Zen is actually very close to the Theravada Forest Tradition even though its language and teachings are heavily influenced by Taoism and Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhikkhucintita.wordpress.com/category/buddhism/page/3/ |title=Through the Looking Glass, '&amp;#39;Essential Buddhism'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bhikkhucintita.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Khantipalo recommends the use of the koan-like question [[Hua Tou|"Who?"]] to penetrate "this not-self-nature of the five aggregates": "In Zen Buddhism this technique has been formulated in several [[koan]]s, such as 'Who drags this corpse around?'"{{sfn|Khantipalo|1984|p=71}}}}}}

The emphasis on insight is discernible in the emphasis in [[Chinese Chán#Sudden and gradual enlightenment|Chán]] on [[subitism|sudden insight]],{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}} though in the Chán-tradition this insight is to be followed by gradual cultivation.{{refn|group=note|This "gradual training" is expressed in teachings as [[Five Ranks|the Five ranks of enlightenment]], [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]] which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]].}}

===East Asian Mahāyāna===
In [[Chinese Buddhism]], the works of Tiantai master [[Zhiyi]] (such as the [[Mohe Zhiguan]], "Great [[śamatha]]-vipaśyanā") are some of the most influential texts which discuss ''vipaśyanā'' meditation from a [[Mahāyāna]] perspective. In this text [[Zhiyi]] teaches the contemplation of the [[skandhas]], [[ayatanas]], [[Skandha#Eighteen Dh.C4.81tus|dhātus]], the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|Kleshas]], false views and several other elements.&lt;ref&gt;Fa Qing,[https://web.archive.org/web/20150524090134/http://elibrary.ibc.ac.th/files/public/2013seminabook.pdf The Śamatha and Vipaśyanā in Tian Tai], Poh Ming Tse Symposium 2013: One Master Three Meditative Traditions. Singapore, August 30, 2013; pp.30-47&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the influential text called the [[Awakening of Faith]] scripture has a section on calm and insight meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt; It states:
{{quote|He who practices 'clear observation' should observe that all conditioned phenomena in the world are unstationary and are subject to instantaneous transformation and destruction; that all activities of the mind arise and are extinguished from moment or moment; and that, therefore, all of these induce suffering. He should observe that all that had been conceived in the past was as hazy as a dream, that all that is being conceived in the future will be like clouds that rise up suddenly. He should also observe that the physical existences of all living beings in the world are impure and that among these various filthy things there is not a single one that can be sought after with joy.&lt;ref&gt;Hakedas, Yoshito, S. The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana, Attributed to Asvaghosha, 1967, page 33, http://www.acharia.org/downloads/the_awakening_of_faith_in_mahayana_english.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Chan ([[Zen]]) Buddhist tradition advocates the simultaneous practice of ''śamatha'' and ''vipaśyanā'', and this is called the practice of [[Shikantaza#Silent illumination|Silent Illumination]].&lt;ref name="Guo Gu"&gt;Guo Gu, Silent Illumination [https://www.bcbsdharma.org/author/guogu/ Guo Gu], Insight Journal 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The classic Chan text known as the [[Platform Sutra]] states:
{{quote|Calming is the essence of wisdom. And wisdom is the natural function of calming [i.e., prajñā and samādhi]. At the time of prajñā, samādhi exists in that. At the time of samādhi, prajñā exists in that. How is it that samādhi and prajñā are equivalent? It is like the light of the lamp. When the lamp exists, there is light. When there is no lamp, there is darkness. The lamp is the essence of light. The light is the natural function of the lamp. Although their names are different, in essence, they are fundamentally identical. The teaching of samādhi and prajñā is just like this.&lt;ref name="Guo Gu"/&gt;}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{Main|Vajrayana|Tibetan Buddhism}}

''Samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are explicitly referred to in Tibetan Buddhism. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, when ''shamatha'' and ''vipashyana'' are combined, as in the mainstream tradion Madhyamaka approach of ancestors like [[Shantideva]] and [[Kamalashila]], through ''samatha'' disturbing emotions are abandoned, which thus facilitates ''vipashyana'', "clear seeing." ''Vipashyana'' is cultivated through reasoning, logic and analysis in conjunction with Shamatha. In contrast, in the siddha tradition of the direct approach of [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]], ''vipashyana'' is ascertained directly through looking into one's own mind. After this initial recognition of ''vipashyana'', the steadiness of ''shamatha'' is developed within that recognition. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, it is however also common in the direct approach to first develop enough ''shamatha'' to serve as a basis for ''vipashyana''.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu Rinpoche, Essentials of Mahamudra&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the classical practice of ''śamatha'' and ''vipaśyanā'' is strongly influenced by the Mahāyāna text called the [[Bhavanakrama]] of Indian master [[Kamalaśīla]]. Kamalaśīla defines ''vipaśyanā'' as "the discernment of reality" (''bhūta-pratyavekṣā'') and "accurately realizing the true nature of dharmas".&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Martin T. Two Concepts of Meditation and Three Kinds of Wisdom in Kamalaśīla’s Bhāvanākramas: A Problem of Translation. University of Victoria, page 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism employed both [[deductive reasoning|deductive investigation]] (applying ideas ''to'' experience) and [[inductive reasoning|inductive investigation]] (drawing conclusions ''from'' direct experience) in the practice of vipaśyanā.{{refn|group=note|Corresponding respectively to the "contemplative forms" and "experiential forms" in the Theravāda school described above}}{{refn|group=note|Leah Zahler: "The practice tradition suggested by the Treasury &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[Abhidharma-kośa]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; .. . &amp;mdash; and also by Asaṅga's Grounds of Hearers &amp;mdash; is one in which mindfulness of breathing becomes a basis for inductive reasoning on such topics as the five aggregates; as a result of such inductive reasoning, the meditator progresses through the Hearer paths of preparation, seeing, and meditation. It seems at least possible that both Vasubandhu and Asaṅga presented their respective versions of such a method, analogous to but different from modern Theravāda insight meditation, and that Gelukpa scholars were unable to reconstruct it in the absence of a practice tradition because of the great difference between this type of inductive meditative reasoning based on observation and the types of meditative reasoning using consequences (''thal 'gyur, prasaanga'') or syllogisms (''sbyor ba, prayoga'') with which Gelukpas were familiar. Thus, although Gelukpa scholars give detailed interpretations of the systems of breath meditation set forth in Vasubandu's and Asaṅga's texts, they may not fully account for the higher stages of breath meditation set forth in those texts [...] it appears that neither the Gelukpa textbook writers nor modern scholars such as Lati Rinpoche and Gendun Lodro were in a position to conclude that the first moment of the fifth stage of Vasubandhu's system of breath meditation coincides with the attainment of special insight and that, therefore, the first four stages must be a method for cultivating special insight [although this is clearly the case].&lt;ref&gt;Zahler 108, 113&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Leah Zahler, only the tradition of deductive analysis in vipaśyanā was transmitted to Tibet in the sūtrayāna context.{{refn|group=note|This tradition is outlined by Kamalaśīla in his three ''[[Bhāvanākrama]]'' texts (particularly the second one), following in turn an approach described in the ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.&lt;ref name="Kamalasila 2008, p 3"&gt;"Some Notes on Kamalasila's Understanding of Insight Considered as the Discernment of Reality (bhūta-pratyavekṣā)", by Martin Adam, ''Buddhist Studies Review'', Vol. 25, No.2, 2008, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar describes his approach thus: "the overall picture painted by Kamalaśīla is that of a kind of serial alternation between observation and analysis that takes place entirely within the sphere of meditative concentration" in which the analysis portion consists of [[Madhyamaka]] reasonings.&lt;ref name="Kamalasila 2008, p 3"/&gt;}}

In Tibet direct examination of moment-to-moment experience as a means of generating insight became exclusively associated with vajrayāna.&lt;ref name="TR" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to contemporary Tibetan scholar Thrangu Rinpoche the Vajrayana cultivates direct experience. Thrangu Rinpoche: "The approach in the sutras [...] is to develop a conceptual understanding of emptiness and gradually refine that understanding through meditation, which eventually produces a direct experience of emptiness [...] we are proceeding from a conceptual understanding produced by analysis and logical inference into a direct experience [...] this takes a great deal of time [...] we are essentially taking inferential reasoning as our method or as the path. There is an alternative [...] which the Buddha taught in the tantras [...] the primary difference between the sutra approach and the approach of Vajrayana (secret mantra or tantra) is that in the sutra approach, we take inferential reasoning as our path and in the Vajrayana approach, we take direct experience as our path. In the Vajrayana we are cultivating simple, direct experience or "looking." We do this primarily by simply looking directly at our own mind."&lt;ref name="TR"&gt;''Pointing out the Dharmakaya'' by Thrangu Rinpoche. Snow Lion: 2003. {{ISBN|1-55939-203-7}}, pg 56&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche also explains: "In general there are two kinds of meditation: the meditation of the ''paṇḍita'' who is a scholar and the nonanalytical meditation or direct meditation of the ''kusulu'', or simple yogi. . . the analytical meditation of the paṇḍita occurs when somebody examines and analyzes something thoroughly until a very clear understanding of it is developed. . . The direct, nonanalytical meditation is called ''kusulu'' meditation in Sanskrit. This was translated as ''trömeh'' in Tibetan, which means "without complication" or being very simple without the analysis and learning of a great scholar. Instead, the mind is relaxed and without applying analysis so it just rests in its nature. In the sūtra tradition, there are some nonanalytic meditations, but mostly this tradition uses analytic meditation."&lt;ref&gt;''The Practice of Tranquillity &amp; Insight: A Guide to Tibetan Buddhist Meditation'' by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. Shambhala Publications: 1994. {{ISBN|0-87773-943-9}} pg 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Mahamudra|Mahāmudrā]] and [[Dzogchen]] use vipaśyanā extensively. This includes some methods of the other traditions, but also their own specific approaches. They place a greater emphasis on meditation on symbolic images. Additionally in the Vajrayāna ([[Tantra|tantric]]) path, the true nature of mind is [[pointing-out instruction|pointed out by the guru]], and this serves as a direct form of insight.{{refn|group=note|[[Thrangu Rinpoche]] describes the approach using a guru: "In the Sūtra path one proceeds by examining and analyzing phenomena, using reasoning. One recognizes that all phenomena lack any true existence and that all appearances are merely interdependently related and are without any inherent nature. They are empty yet apparent, apparent yet empty. The path of Mahāmudrā is different in that one proceeds using the instructions concerning the nature of mind that are given by one's guru. This is called taking direct perception or direct experiences as the path. The fruition of śamatha is purity of mind, a mind undisturbed by false conception or emotional afflictions. The fruition of vipaśyanā is knowledge (''prajnā'') and pure wisdom (''jñāna''). Jñāna is called the wisdom of nature of phenomena and it comes about through the realization of the true nature of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu Rinpoche, Looking Directly at Mind : [[The Moonlight of Mahāmudrā]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Yishai Schlissel''' (also spelled '''Shlisel'''; {{lang-he-n|ישי שליסל}}; born 10 December 1975) is an [[Israel]]i convicted criminal.

==Early life==
Schlissel was born on 10 December 1975 in [[Yad Binyamin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-visits-pride-attack-victim-defends-right-to-live-in-peace/ PM visits pride attack victim, defends ‘right to live in peace’], ''The Times of Israel'', July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhol"&gt;[http://www.bhol.co.il/Article.aspx?id=87722מוזר ומופנם, או איש עקרונות  קנאי - מי אתה ישי שליסל?], July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of ten children.

==Criminal acts and convictions==
In 2005, Schlissel stabbed three marchers during the gay pride parade in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; As a result, he was convicted of [[attempted murder]] and [[aggravated assault]],&lt;ref name="haaretzchaim"/&gt; and sentenced to twelve years in prison.&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; In 2007, his sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal. Schlissel served his sentence at [[Maasiyahu Prison]]. In 2008, he was hospitalized for a month and a half over mental health issues and diagnosed with a paranoid psychiatric condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://10tv.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1141498&lt;/ref&gt; Schlissel was released in June 2015.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"&gt;{{cite news|title=6 stabbed at Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade by ultra-Orthodox Jewish assailant|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.668796|publisher=Haaretz|date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.668832&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his release, he distributed a homophobic letter in his hometown which read, "It is the obligation of every Jew to keep his soul from punishment and stop this giant desecration of God's name next Thursday."&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"&gt;Joe Williams, [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/08/02/victim-of-jerusalem-pride-attack-dies-of-injuries/ Victim of Jerusalem Pride attack dies of injuries], ''[[PinkNews]]'', August 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was not tracked by the Judea and Samaria Police District because his previous crime had occurred in Jerusalem, outside of their jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"/&gt; Moreover, [[Moshe Edry]], the chief of the Jerusalem District Police, was not warned that Schlissel would be coming to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"/&gt;

On 30 July 2015, only three weeks after being released, he stabbed six marchers during the [[Jerusalem gay pride parade]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; The act was widely condemned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yishai Schlissel: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|url=http://heavy.com/news/2015/07/yishai-schlissel-jerusalem-gay-pride-stabbing-2005-attack-release/|publisher=Heavy.com|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelstuart"&gt;Stuart Winer, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-slams-gay-pride-attack-we-will-bring-those-responsible-to-justice/ After attack on pride parade, PM condemns ‘despicable hate crime’], ''The Times of Israel'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] three days later, on 2 August 2015.&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.669161|date=August 2, 2015|accessdate=August 2, 2015|first=Yaniv|last=Kubovich|newspaper=Haaretz|title=16-year-old stabbed in Jerusalem pride parade succumbs to wounds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding "We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law."&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"/&gt;

A psychiatric evaluation by the [[Israel Prison Service]], with which Schlissel refused to cooperate, found him fit to stand trial. However, after state psychiatrists argued that his refusal to cooperate rendered the evaluation inconclusive, the court ordered that he be hospitalized for a 48-hour observation period for reevaluation. He was again found fit to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/gay-parade-stabber-deemed-fit-to-stand-trial/&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2015, Shlissel was charged with one count of murder and six counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault at the Jerusalem District Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4693866,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to recognize the authority of the court to try him due to it not abiding by Jewish religious law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/pride-parade-stabber-to-undergo-further-psychiatric-evaluation/&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that he would refuse to be represented by an attorney, and did not cooperate with the public defender assigned to represent him. On April 19, 2016, he was convicted.&lt;ref name="jtajerusalemgayprideparade"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jerusalem gay pride parade stabber convicted of murder|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/04/19/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/jerusalem-gay-pride-parade-stabber-convicted-of-murder|accessdate=April 20, 2016|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2016, he was sentenced to life plus 31 years in prison, and was ordered to pay [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] 2,064,000 in compensation to the families of his victims. 

Schlissel is serving his sentence in [[Ayalon Prison]]. In August 2016, Schlissel tore up pictures of another inmate's daughters due to them being "immodestly dressed", and was subsequently beaten by the inmate until guards separated them. Schlissel was hospitalized as a result of the beating he sustained, and was temporarily placed in solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure. After prison authorities carried out an evaluation, it was decided to separate him from other inmates due to his volatile behavior, and he was given his own cell in a protected area of the prison. One month later,  Schlissel was again attacked and had to be hospitalized after an argument between him and two convicted mobsters in the prison yard escalated to the mobsters beating him until guards intervened.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/gay-pride-killer-beaten-up-in-prison-in-argument-over-his-crime/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4842863,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Before his prison sentence, Schlissel resided in [[Modi'in Illit]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Israeli settlement]] and city in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="haaretzchaim"&gt;Chaim Levinson, Yaniv Kubovich, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.668832 Israel Police to probe failure to monitor Jerusalem gay pride parade assailant], ''Haaretz'', July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He is an Israeli [[ultra-Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox Jew]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/six-stabbed-at-jerusalem-pride-parade-by-same-assailant-who-attacked-parade-in-2005/ Six stabbed at Jerusalem pride parade by same assailant who attacked parade in 2005], ''The Times of Israel'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33726634 Jerusalem Gay Pride: Six stabbed 'by ultra-Orthodox Jew'], ''BBC News'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his crime, he was married, with four children.&lt;ref name="bhol"/&gt; He divorced his wife at the beginning of his imprisonment in 2005.&lt;ref name="bhol"/&gt;

'''Éraic''' (or ''eric'') was the [[Ireland|Irish]] equivalent of the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[galanas]] and the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Scandinavia]]n [[weregild]], a form of tribute paid in reparation for murder or other major crimes. The term survived into the sixteenth century as ''{{lang|ga|eiric}}'', by then relating only to compensation for the killing of an Irishman. In the case of homicide, if the attacker fled, the fine had to be paid by the tribe to which he belonged.&lt;ref name="Wake1878"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Staniland Wake|title=The Evolution of Morality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hdWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA363|year=1878|publisher=Trübner &amp; Company|pages=363–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Irish mythology the eraic takes an important place. In the [[Cian|''Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann'']], the children of Tuirreann owe an eraic to Lugh. Lug set them a series of seemingly impossible quests as recompense. They achieved them all, but were fatally wounded in completing the last one.
