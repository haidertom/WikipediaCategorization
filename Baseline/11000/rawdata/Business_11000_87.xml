'''Aberdeen International Business Park''' (AIBP) is a major commercial building project located on the south eastern edge of [[Aberdeen International Airport]], at [[Dyce]], with direct road links to the Scottish motorway network, and close to [[Dyce railway station]]. The park's 40 acres will eventually provide up to 92,000 sq m of development, including offices, shops, leisure facilities and at least one 4-star hotel.

AIBP's first phase set records in 2014 as Scotland's biggest single office-letting deal, after Norwegian oilfield services giant [[Aker Solutions]] leased 31,100 sq m of space, including its own purpose-built leisure facilities.

== Amenities ==
The current Phase 1 building includes:
* Coffee Shop
* Restaurant
* Juice Bar
* Nursery
* Gym
* Sports Hall
* Outdoor Sports Pitch
* Squash Courts

== History of the site ==
Plans for the [[Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route]] (AWPR) outlined in early 2013's [http://\www.aberdeenairport.com/about-us/master-plan/ Aberdeen Airport Master Plan], opened up access to 93 acres of farmland to the south east of the airport.

Also contained in the plan was the construction of a link road between Dyce Drive and the existing A96 as part of the expansion of [[Aberdeen Airport]] at Dyce, making this parcel more accessible both to the airport and the wider road network to the city of [[Aberdeen]] and beyond.

The [[Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route]] is now expected to be completed in Winter 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/project/aberdeen-western-peripheral-route-balmedie-tipperty |title=Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route / Balmedie to Tipperty |publisher=Transport Scotland |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117123025/http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/project/aberdeen-western-peripheral-route-balmedie-tipperty |archive-date=17 January 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Craibstone and Dyce Junctions scheduled to open by Autumn 2016. The Balmedie to Tipperty section will follow by Spring 2017.

This dual carriageway should significantly reduce congestion and improve accessibility to the wider Dyce area. The City Council is also constructing a new six-lane Airport Link Road (ALR) connecting Aberdeen Airport and AIBP with the A96 and AWPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planning.aberdeencity.gov.uk/PlanningDetail.asp?ref=150563 |title=Planning and Sustainable Development |publisher=Planning.aberdeencity.gov.uk |date=2013-01-21 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeen City Council's planning committee approved Aberdeen International Business Park’s first phase in June 2013, to include 27,400 sq m of office space and 3,700 sq m of leisure space, containing dining facilities, a day nursery, fitness amenities and a small shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/CouncilNews/ci_cns/pr_InternationallBusinessPark_130613.asp |title=Plans for first phase of Aberdeen International Business Park approved |publisher=Aberdeencity.gov.uk |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire 31,100 sq m was leased to Norwegian oilfield services giant [[Aker Solutions]] in August 2014 in what was Scotland's single largest office leasing deal. The initial rent, under the 20-year lease, was struck at almost £8 million per annum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCulloch |first=Scott |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/business/business-property/20-year-lease-agreement-take-three-4038759 |title=The 20-year lease agreement to take all three buildings in phase one believed to be the largest ever office lease deal concluded in Scotland |publisher=Daily Record |date=2014-08-12 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developer of AIBP is Abstract Group. The architect for Phase 1 was Keppie Design and the site contractors were Bowmer &amp; Kirkland.

In May 2015, plans to relocate the [[Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre]] from its current Bridge of Don site to a nearby plot at the junction of Dyce Drive and the main A96 trunk road, next to the [[Rowett Institute]], were presented to the city council. AECC is Aberdeen's largest Conference Centre and home to the biennial [[Offshore Europe]] exhibition, a major conference in the global oil and gas calendar.

The £333 million project is a joint venture between Aberdeen City Council and developer [[Henry Boot PLC|Henry Boot]]. Work is expected to start by mid-2016, with completion in late 2018.

== Phase 2 ==
A planning application for the second phase of building was submitted in March 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planning.aberdeencity.gov.uk/PlanningDetail.asp?js=y&amp;ref=141675 |title=Planning and Sustainable Development |publisher=Planning.aberdeencity.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the developers say they are looking to bring forward the next phases of the business park "at an early stage". When completed, AIBP 2 will comprise about 66,500 sq m in total with seven office buildings including at least one 6,600 sq m 4-star hotel, opposite Aberdeen Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-28755287 |title=Aker Solutions signs major office leasing deal in Aberdeen - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aibp.co.uk/further-phases-1/ |title=Further Phases — Aberdeen International Business Park |publisher=Aibp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208092303/http://www.aibp.co.uk/further-phases-1/ |archivedate=2015-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outline planning permission for two hotels on the site is currently before the City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planning.aberdeencity.gov.uk/docs/planningdocuments.asp?appnumber=151175 |title=Planning and Sustainable Development |publisher=Planning.aberdeencity.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also plans for more than 2,000 car-parking spaces linked to office premises.

A nearby Park-and-Ride facility with 1,000 car parking spaces is also scheduled to open in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen/620571/work-starts-15million-aberdeen-airport-park-ride/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Sōma}}
{{nihongo|'''Aizō Sōma'''|相馬愛蔵|Sōma Aizō|extra=November 8, 1870 – February 14, 1954}} was an entrepreneur, philanthropist, patron of artists and patron of [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian politics]] during the pre-war [[Empire of Japan]]. He is known as the founder of Nakamura-ya, a noted bakery in Tokyo.

==Biography==
Sōma was born in a wealthy farming family in what is now [[Azumino, Nagano]]. He came to Tokyo at the age of 17 in order to enter [[Waseda University]] in 1886, entering the Tokyo Professional College which had just been founded. His professors included [[Tsubouchi Shōyō]] and [[Tameyuki Amano]]. Later, he studied with Sokichi Tsuda, a Japanese historian who became a professor at Waseda University. During this time, he was also converted to Christianity by [[Uchimura Kanzō]], and became friends with [[Taguchi Ukichi]].&lt;ref name = Okuda&gt;{{cite book | last = Okuda | first = Akiko | year = 1998 | title = Women and Religion in Japan | publisher =Routledge | location =  | isbn = 3447040149}} page 115-117&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated in 1890, and travelled to [[Hokkaido]], where he studied [[sericulture]] at the [[Sapporo Agricultural College]], and returned to Nagano to conduct experiments in the improvement of [[silkworm]]s. He also founded a [[temperance movement]] in Azumino, which drew the wrath of locals for its aggressive approach again drinking and brothels.&lt;ref name = Okuda/&gt;  He also met with foreign missionaries, and established a local orphanage.

In 1898, married [[Kokkō Sōma|Kokkō]], the daughter of an ex-samurai from [[Sendai]], which he had visited in order to raise funds for the orphanage, but she had frequent problems with her health and with adjusting to rural life, and the couple relocated to Tokyo in 1901. In Tokyo, Sōma purchased the Nakamura-ya bakery near the main gate to [[Tokyo Imperial University]].&lt;ref name = Okuda/&gt;   He is credited with inventing the ''kurimu-pan'', a bun with custard inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Usui | first = Kazuo | year = 2014 | title = Marketing and Consumption in Japan | publisher =Routledge | location =  | isbn = 9780415323130}} page 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, he moved the shop to [[Shinjuku]]. He often hired foreigners or consulted with foreign residents in Japan for ideas on new products or new condiments to use in his bakery items. He also established a school to teach commercial morality and to improve on the service standards of his employees. The shop flourished, and he added a café and restaurant as well.

Sōma became a patron of the arts and literature by organizing a [[Salon (gathering)|literary salon]], and by providing financial support to struggling artists and writers. Members of the salon included [[Naoe Kinoshita]], a socialist activist from Sōma’s home town, [[Vasili Eroshenko]], a blind Russian poet, as well as actress [[Sumako Matsui]], painter [[Tsune Nakamura]], and sculptor [[Rokuzan Ogiwara]].&lt;ref name = Okuda/&gt;  
 
Sōma also provided support to the pan-Asian movement, and his salon provided a convenient and confidential meeting place for politicians, including [[Toyama Mitsuru]], [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]] and others. Sōma provided shelter for [[Rash Behari Bose]], the fugitive head of the [[Indian independence movement]]. Bose was the mastermind behind a number of bomb plots against the [[Viceroy of India]] and attempts to organize an uprising against the [[British Raj]]. Bose married Sōma’s daughter Toshiko in 1918.

Sōma died in 1954.

==Alleged money laundering==

In November, 1995, Antonio Castañon and [[Paulina Castañon]], Raúl Salinas's wife, were arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] after attempting to withdraw $84 million USD from an account owned by Raúl Salinas de Gortari, brother of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historia de México, Volume 2 |last=Delgado de Cantú |first=Gloria M. |author2=Rosa Guadalupe Pérez Rangel |page=562 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Pearson Educación]] |isbn=978-970-26-0356-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast family fortune spread around the world amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.   A report by the U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] indicated that over $90 million were transferred out of Mexico and into private bank accounts in Switzerland and London, through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994, using a private investment company named [[Trocca]], all with the help of [[Citibank]] and its affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/os99001.pdf |title=GAO Report |date= October 1998|website=www.gao.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million, out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by [[Trocca]] to the government of Mexico.  The Swiss Justice Ministry indicated that the Mexican government had demonstrated that $66 million of the funds had been misappropriated, and the funds, with interest, were returned to Mexico.  The bank accounts were held at [[Pictet &amp; Cie]], Citibank Zurich, [[Julius Baer]] Bank, and [[Banque privée Edmond de Rothschild]] in Geneva and Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amleurope.org/materials/reference_Materials/Switzerlands%2012-Year%20Probe%20of%20Salinas%20Wnds%20with%20$74%20Million%20Payment%20to.pdf]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other funds were returned to third parties, including Mexican billionaire Carlos Peralta Quintero, who had given the funds to set up the investment company. Antonio and Paulina Castañon were released a couple weeks after the arrest.

The '''Association of Business Historians''' is a British [[learned society]] focused on [[business history]] and the [[history of companies]] concerned with "The study of all aspects of the historical development of enterprise, businesses and business activity generally and their inter-relationship with the social, cultural, economic and political environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abh-net.org/objectives.html|title=Aims and objectives|publisher=Association of British Historians|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 it was one of [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]' partners in the production of a ''National Strategy for Business Archives (England and Wales) (2009)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives-sector/business-archives-strategy.htm|title=Business archives strategy|year=2009|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

The association organises an annual conference and an annual Tony Slaven Doctoral Workshop, named for [[Tony Slaven]], one of the association's founders. It awards the annual Coleman Prize, named for business historian [[D. C. Coleman]], for a recent Ph.D. thesis in the area of business history, and the Tony Slaven Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abh-net.org/slaven.html|title=What is the Tony Slaven Grant?|publisher=ABH|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abh-net.org/coleman.html|title=What is Coleman Prize|publisher=ABH|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Association of Business Historians was founded in 1990 to promote the study of business history following on from the establishment of the Business Archives Council in 1934.

T S Ashton regarded business history as “ simply a branch of [[economic history]] focusing on industry and the firm”. Even in the 1960s Peter Payne argued that business history was “that branch of economic history that finds its source material primarily in company records and takes its starting point the entrepreneur and the firm...it is the grass roots approach to economic history”.

At [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]] in 1958, Francis Hyde launched the journal ''[[Business History (journal)|Business History]]'' [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/fbsh20/current#.UZ49hGTwKG8], and a year later, in 1959, Peter Payne was appointed as Colquhoun Lecturer in Business History at the [[University of Glasgow]], under Sydney Checkland. This was the first named lectureship in business history in Britain. This led in 1960 to the establishment of the [http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/archives/bacs/ Business Archives Council (Scotland)], to begin surveying and saving from destruction the records of Scottish Business. In the 1960s the post Robbens expansion of the universities, especially of the social sciences, greatly increased academic posts in [[economic history]] and [[economics]], and triggered much new research and writing in the history of business, but not then any demand for a separate identity for the subject.

A number of important initiatives followed in the 1970s, especially the founding of the annual Business History Seminar, funded by the [[ESRC|Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)]], and hosted by Derek Oddy. This was first held at Ealing Technical College, and from 1978 at the Polytechnic of Central London (now [[University of Westminster]]). The 1978 move to the Polytechnic of Central London coincided with the establishment of the Wadsworth Prize by the Business Archives Council, an annual award for a distinguished publication in business history.

From 1980 the Business History Unit launched its Newsletter to reach out to the growing community of researchers and teachers of business history, and to provide a forum for posting news of seminars, conferences, publications, and research initiatives. London was not the sole locus of growing activity in business history. In Scotland, at Glasgow, thirty years of investment in business history culminated in 1987 in the founding and funding of [http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/research/economicsocialhistory/businesshistory/ The Centre for Business History in Scotland]. Tony Slaven was appointed as Director of the Centre, the post also holding the Chair in Business History. This was a permanently funded research centre, the resources provided by the Aggregate Foundation. It was consequently independent of the need to secure funds by accepting commissioned business histories. Another significant innovation developed from 1988. Geoff Jones, now [[Isidor Straus]] Professor of Business History at [[Harvard Business School]],&lt;ref name="Harvard Business History Faculty"&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/faculty/pages/faculty-profile-details.aspx?facId=gjones&amp;recordId=1]&lt;/ref&gt; had moved from the Business History Unit to the Department of Economics at Reading. From there he initiated a highly fruitful and intensive series of business history workshop collaborations with the business historians at [[Lancaster University]], who were also within the Department of Economics. These meetings, which resulted in multiple edited books, reflected the institutional locations of the groups with their emphasis on bringing together “history and theory”, and involving economists in their deliberations.

While these initiatives were proliferating, the main forum for business historians still focused on the small annual seminar at the Polytechnic of London. Attendance was limited and by invitation only, but it did allow for informal exchanges on how to promote the discipline.Particularly involved in such discussions were Geoff Jones, Mary Rose and Tony Slaven, each representing a well established base in business history. The private funding available to Tony Slaven also made it possible for the CBH to lubricate exchanges. All three were in agreement that the key to taking Business History forward was institutionalisation through a new and separate professional organisation with regular conferences, these steps establishing for it an identity that was distinct from the [[Economic History Society]].

There was a feeling at the time that the [[Economic History Society]] Conference had little to offer those with an interest in [[Business History]], and that if a new association was established it would build beyond the London-based seminars, and pull in a wider audience. The first meeting to establish a British organisation for business history took place on 27 September 1989, in the new premises of the Centre for Business History in Glasgow . The room was packed with business historians from across Britain, and was quite tense. This was partly because the meeting coincided with the editorial shift of Business History away from the BHU to Royal Holloway, Reading and Lancaster which heightened suspicions of empire building by some of the parties involved. By the end of the afternoon it had been agreed to form a pre Committee consisting of Tony Slaven, Geoff Jones, Terry Gourvish, Derek Oddy and Oliver Westall to develop a constitution, plan elections and launch a new Association.

The founders were also keen to build an association that would be less formal and more open than the Economic History Society. The drafting of the constitution stressed the need for a small set of active officers with a regular turnover, with all members entitled to vote. The objective of the Association of Business Historians is ‘to promote the study, teaching and publication of all aspects of the history of business and industry, and of the environment in which they operate’. The first elections were held in September 1990 and the first Council was formed of Derek Oddy (President), Geoff Jones (Vice President), Tony Slaven (Secretary Treasurer), Terry Gourvish (Newsletter Editor), Mary Rose (Membership Secretary) and David Jeremy as Council Member.

The two challenges of that first year involved building the membership and launching the first conference. It took place exactly two years after that first meeting on 27–28 September 1991, at the Centre for Business History in Scotland, in what would become a biennial series of meetings until 2000.

The association's Ph.D. prize was introduced in 1997 at the joint British/American conference held in Glasgow and the first winner was Steve Toms. In 2000 the prize became annual and was named the Coleman Prize. Each year the prize winner joins the council to ensure that new researchers become embedded in the networks and practices of the association.

The Association of British Historians also had an early influence on the formation of the [[European Business History Association]]. Discussions began in 1993 between Geoff Jones, Tony Slaven and Hans Pohl and were soon extended to include Mary Rose, Keetie Sluytermann, Rolv Petter Amdam and Per Boje at a meeting in Glasgow in the autumn of 1993. A series of meetings followed in Bonn, Rotterdam and Reading. The EBHA was formally launched at the business history conference held in Rotterdam in October 1994 with its inaugural conference following in Gothenburg in August 1996.

'''Bjarne Gotfred Eriksen''' (31 July 1886 &amp;ndash; 13 November 1976) was a Norwegian businessperson and [[fencing|fencer]].

He was born in [[Trondheim]]. He competed in the individual [[foil (fencing)|foil]] and [[épée]] events at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{Cite sports-reference | Bjarne Eriksen | https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/er/bjarne-eriksen-1.html | 25 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother [[Einar Eriksen (rowing)|Einar]] competed at the same Olympics in rowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Sports-Reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/er/einar-eriksen-1.html |title=Einar Eriksen |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was hired as a [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]] barrister in 1917, but started a career in [[Norsk Hydro]] in 1926. He was originally head of the judicial and financial department, but was then promoted to Director-General (CEO) in 1941. 

After the German occupation of Norway, the Germans wanted to further increase output of [[heavy water]]; the situation escalated, until Hydro's top management protested, and in early 1943, Bjarne Eriksen, the company's managing director, was arrested and sent to a concentration camp in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydro.com/en/about-hydro/Our-history/1929---1945/1943-The-Heroes-of-Telemark/&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, Erikson returned to his position, where he remained until 1956; after this he was chairman of the board from 1957 to 1960.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Bjarne Eriksen – norsk industrimann|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Bjarne_Eriksen/norsk_industrimann|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3639">A '''blocker corporation''' is a type of [[C Corporation]] in the [[United States]] that has been used by tax exempt individuals to protect their investments from taxation when they participate in [[private equity]] or with [[hedge funds]].  In addition to tax exempt individuals, foreign investors have also used blocker corporations.

==Application==
Most private equity funds and hedge funds are composed as [[limited partnership]]s, or as LLCs ([[Limited Liability Company]]) which for tax purposes is considered a Limited Partnership, unless the fund formally elects to be taxed as a corporation.  This allows the fund itself to avoid taxation, as each of the individual investors is taxed as a partner with respect to the share of profits attributable to the partner's personal equity interest.  By comparison, a fund set up as a C Corporation would be subject to tax for its earnings, and then the limited partners would be subject to tax when they received their profit in the form of dividends distributed by the corporation.  Thus, the LLC or LP format allows a fund to avoid double taxation.

When there are tax exempt investors in a fund, they are not subject to U.S. income tax, but are still required to declare and pay taxes on "[[Unrelated Business Taxable Income]]" or "[[UBTI]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/513- 26 USCA 513]&lt;/ref&gt;  For tax exempt investors, [[dividend]]s, [[royalties]], [[Renting|rents]], [[capital gain]]s and [[interest income]] are not considered UBTI, but any money earned from conduct unrelated to the entity's tax exempt purpose is considered UBTI.

Foreign investors, similarly, are not generally subject to U.S. income tax.  However, if a foreign investor conducts a trade or business within the United States, it is required to file a U.S. tax return and pay taxes on the same terms as a U.S. individual or corporation.  In both cases, because partners are treated as earning their share of the partnership's income on a flow-through basis, they are treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or an unrelated business to the extent that the partnership is so engaged.

To address these issues, a [[private equity]] fund can set up a U.S. feeder corporation known as a blocker corporation.  The foreign and tax exempt investors can invest through the blocker corporation, and then they are no longer personally considered to be partners, as it is the foreign corporation that is the owner of equity in the fund.  For tax exempt investors, their share of the blocker corporation is considered dividend income, and thus they are not subject to tax.&lt;ref name="waysandmeans.house.gov"&gt;[http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&amp;id=6425 US House Ways and Means Committee Testimony] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129054907/http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&amp;id=6425 |date=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foreign investors similarly avoid U.S. trade or business income tax (although they will be subject to tax in their home country on any dividends received).&lt;ref name="waysandmeans.house.gov"/&gt;  The blocker corporation itself is subject, however, to tax on its share of the partnership's income.

'''The Brazilian packaging market''' is the fifth-largest in the world, having realized US$35 billion (1.5% of GDP) in sales in 2014, with Brazil being the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|seventh largest economy]] in the world by nominal GDP.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|first = Claire I.

The packaging sector has strong ties to environmental organizations and tries to adapt to the demands of environmentally friendly production. As a result of this development, [[Sustainable packaging]] emerged as a promising future market for innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.packagingdigest.com/sustainable-packaging/why-the-2030-sustainable-development-goals-matter-to-packaging-professionals1512|title = Why the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals matter to packaging professionals|last = Han|first = Rosemary|date = 2015-12-01|journal = Packaging Digest|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/business/energy-environment/packaging-environment.html|title = The Side Effects of Consumerism.

== Market development ==
For the period between 2011 and 2016, Brazil shows an estimated median growth of 6.2%, realizing a sales value of US$34 billion in 2016, leaving behind Canada and being on a level with France.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The constant growth of the Brazilian packaging market is not a unique phenomenon. The global packaging market is on the rise, which is due to a combination of various factors like the growing urbanization, investments in the construction sector and the expansion of the health sector.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = ITAL|year = 2012|pages = 9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for environmentally friendly packaging types has also been increasing steadily since the 2000s and the resulting growth from innovation contributes to this trend. Additionally, the rapid growth of the so-called [[BRIC|BRIC states]] over the course of the 2000s as well as the early post-[[Financial crisis of 2007–08|crisis]] period plays a major role in the growth trend of the global packaging market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite the 2015 economic slowdowns - especially in China and Brazil&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/27/us-brazil-economy-gdp-idUSKBN0TG1HK20151127|title = Brazil's economy tailspin seen at record speed in third quarter|last = Cascione|first = Silvio|date = 2015-11-27|work = Reuters|access-date = 2015-12-02|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2015/november/global-fallout-from-china-industrial-slowdown/|title = Global Fallout from China's Industrial Slowdown|date = 2015-11-23|accessdate = 2015-12-02|website = |publisher = Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|last = Spiegel|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the highest growth rates for the 2011-2016 period can be observed in these states, with China, India, '''Brazil''' and Russia showing growth rates of 7.9%, 7.7%, '''6.2%''' and 4.9%, respectively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The high growth rates in these countries can be explained by rising personal incomes, resulting in higher demand for a broad product range, which in turn creates growth for the packaging producers of these respective products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite its good CAGR, it was projected that due to the [[Economic history of Brazil#2010s economic contraction|Brazilian recession]] the 2014 sales equaling US$35 billion would have decreased by 2.9% in 2016, to reach US$34 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,13-sintomas-de-que-a-economia-brasileira-esta-em-recessao,1551533|title = 13 sintomas de que a economia brasileira está em recessão|last = Scholz|first = Cley|date = 2014-08-29|work = O Estado de S.

Compared to 2005, in 2013 Brazil shows a total growth of 42% with regard to exports of packaging. Especially aluminum and steel exhibit a very high overall increase in that nine-year period. In 2013 packaging made of plastics and steel were the most exported types with sales of US$268 million and US$183 million, respectively, while both combined accounted for 70% of total exports. The only packaging that was exported less in 2013 than in 2005 is wood, showing a 32% decrease from US$21 million to US$15 million. In total, US$645 million worth of packaging were exported in 2013.

== Raw materials ==
Raw materials that are used in order to fabricate packaging vary a lot. Yet, the most common materials are corrugated board and plastics, which represent more than 50% market share in volume and more than 40% market share in value when added up. Despite representing 15% in volume, glass only contributes 4% to the total production value. On the other side, flexibles are a material that is extremely valuable, representing 22% of total value while only embodying 3% of the production size.

In 2014, two thirds of Brazilian raw material consumption took place in the alimentary sector and one third in the non-alimentary sector. Steel, [[Kraft paper|Kraft]] and [[Polychlorotrifluoroethylene|duplex/triplex]] are the only materials that are used to a larger degree for non-food packaging than vice versa. Lightweight materials like flexibles and aluminum are especially popular packaging materials for food products. 90% of glass packaging is designed for the food products, more precisely, for beer and other beverages. Flexibles and aluminum are the most valuable materials, having the highest value/volume ratios among the materials of the list. Moreover, the total value/volume ratio is higher for food than for non-food packaging, which indicates an overall higher turnover of non-food packaging.

The largest end use market for packaging raw materials is the beverage industry. While plastics and flexibles represent the largest share of used material for non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages heavily rely on metals (foremost aluminum) and glass. Meat and vegetables also heavily favor packaging made of plastics or flexibles. The chemical and agricultural sectors predominantly use plastics and metals due to their products requiring packaging with high durability. Low production costs are another important factor in explaining the popularity of plastics and flexibles in the Brazilian packaging sector.

== Packaging trends ==
An analysis of the Brazilian packaging market unveils a set of products, the popularity of which has steadily been increasing since the late 2000s. Additionally to that, there are some general tendencies that are steering the market.

=== General trends ===
[[File:The five main trends in the packaging industry.png|alt=The image provides a visual representation the five main trends in the packaging industry as well as the characteristics of packaging according to these trends, as is being mentioned in the article.|thumb|The five main trends in the packaging industry. Image in modified form according to Brasil PackTrends 2020 (2012).|390x390px]]
In its study "Brasil PackTrends 2020" (2012), the [[:pt:Instituto de Tecnologia de Alimentos|Brazilian Institute for Food Technology (ITAL)]] identified five general trends in the packaging industry: 1) convenience and simplicity, 2) esthetics and identity, 3) quality and new technologies, 4) sustainability and ethics, and 5) safety and regulatory issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = ITAL|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 72–73|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite delivering examples from the Brazilian market, these five tendencies are not taylor-made for Brazil, as they - to large parts - also apply to the [[packaging industry]] as a whole.

==== Convenience and simplicity ====
Consumers nowadays value products that facilitate their lives, that are easy to use and time-efficient. In terms of packaging, this means that a successful packaging has to be easy to open, easy to use, resealable and easily disposable. With regard to food, the popularity of packaging that enables a quick and simple preparation (e.g. in the microwave) also keeps rising. Packaging has to refrain from posing any unnecessary obstacle whatsoever, this also includes language design, that is, packaging ought to use an easy languages and simple graphics while not overloading the consumer with information. Additionally to that, packaging has to adapt to socio-economic changes. As urbanization is increasing and single-person household become more and more common, producers have to provide food packaging with individual portions or packaging that, for instance, allows a quick and easy preparation of meals in the microwave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = ITAL|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 70–71, 74|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aesthetics and identity ====
When heading for a product, consumers (in)directly seek objective as well as subjective satisfaction. Adequate packaging can increase the consumer's feeling of identification with a product by, e.g., promoting a certain life-style or by conveying high quality, enhancing the product's ability of serving as a status symbol. Another important consumer type is the one that values health and a high quality of life above everything else. The proportion of packaging that promotes health benefits of the product and that conveys to the customer a certain feeling of doing something good for their health is steadily increasing. Another trend involves packaging that turns products into collectibles and make the packaging more valuable to the customer than the actual product itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = ITAL|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 75|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this trend is the [[Share a Coke]] marketing campaign by [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], that was launched in Brazil in 2015, four years after the first campaign was launched in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1372962/share-coke-mad-men-campaigns-defined-coke-wendy-clark|title = From Share a Coke to Mad Men: the campaigns that defined Coke under Wendy Clark|last = Spary|first = Sara|date = 2015-11-17|journal = Marketing Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colors transmit esthetics, yet post 2010 developments in the Brazilian packaging market show a rising preference of simple styles by customers.

==== Quality and new technologies ====
The packaging sector provides opportunities for new technologies as well as new types of materials that improve a product's lifespan and [[Food microbiology|microbiological safety]]. Active and intelligent packaging can, for instance, absorb [[oxygen]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]], or even heat itself. Others provide the consumer with indicators on temperature, freshness or the degree of ripeness. Advancements have also been made on the nano level. Packaging that avails itself of nanotechnology can create barriers to gases, humidity or UV radiation. New technology also helps at making the product weigh less. Increasingly, [[biopolymer]]s are used as the material basis for packaging, replacing fossil-based polymers. Yet, new packaging types tend to face issues like a higher price and hence, difficulties in competition with the cheaper fossil-based materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = ITAL|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 76–78|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sustainability and ethics ====
With environmental issues like [[climate change]] becoming more and more of a priority challenge, the packaging market has adapted to new consumer demands like applying sustainable packaging and keeping the [[carbon footprint]] low. [[Life-cycle assessment|Life cycle assessments]] and [[Life Cycle Thinking|Life-cycle thinking]] in general are regarded as the best instruments to calculate the environmental costs of a product or service. Sustainability is not only achieved by using 100% renewable materials, but also by, for instance, making packaging smaller so that more units of the product can be shipped at a time, which in turn reduces the collective carbon footprint. Making the transition to sustainable packaging also creates an incentive for the customer to identify with the product, as the product will convey environmental consciousness. With regard to that, it's important to mention the rising use of recycled material for packaging. Given an increased amount of recycled material, functioning [[waste management]] and [[reverse logistics]] are indispensable and promise to be an auspicious market for innovative products and services. In order to avoid obvious [[Greenwashing]], producers have been anxious to achieve quality certification from renowned environmental certification institutes like the [[Carbon Trust]] and the [[Forest Stewardship Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = ITAL|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 79–80|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safety and regulatory issues ====
Packaging is crucial to ensure a product's safety, quality and reliability. Packaging carries all the information the consumer may consider to be important, e.g., preparation instructions, nutritional value, date of manufacture and expiration date and producer information. The transfer of chemical contaminants from [[food contact materials]] to food is regarded as being a major issue in health studies. Hence, mathematical modelling and in-depth analyses are used in order to make estimations about the degree of this so-called [http://www.foodpackagingforum.org/food-packaging-health/migration migration] of contaminants. Packaging materials have to comply with the vast regulatory framework that has been created by lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = ITAL|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 80–82|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, four years after having had adopted the [[Mercosur|Mercosur's]] regulations managing the use of food contact materials, Brazil exempted all FCM from Mercosur's registration requirements except for FCM made from recycled materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Keller Heckman Packaging Site -Food Packaging Regulations in Latin America: Moving Towards Harmonization|url = http://www.packaginglaw.com/3692_.shtml|website = www.packaginglaw.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30|last = Clark|first = Mitzi Ng|date = April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being exempted from Mercosur's registration policy, FCM that is imported into the Brazilian market still needs to comply with all technical resolutions and Brazilian legislation incorporating the Mercsosur resolutions. Additionally to that, the Brazilian [[National Health Surveillance Agency]] (ANVISA) must be informed about any imports of FCM whatsoever.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Laws are constantly being revised in order to match newly acquired scientific and technological insights and steadily evolving products. Along with Mercosur, the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as well as the [[European Union]] - which passed [[Harmonization of law|harmonized legislation]] on FCM in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004|url = http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/chemical_safety/food_contact_materials/legislation/index_en.htm|website = ec.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; - ANVISA promotes globally harmonized policies and [[International regime|regimes]] for the governing of FCM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Legislation - European Commission|url = http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/chemical_safety/food_contact_materials/legislation/index_en.htm|website = ec.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = International harmonization of food quality &amp; safety standards|last = Mermelstein|first = Neil H.|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = 72–75|work = Food Technology|volume = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Products ===

==== Stand Up Pouches ====
[[File:Stand Up Pouches IMPAK.png|thumb|Various products that use Stand Up Pouch packaging (Source: IMPAK Corporation)]]
Probably the most successful innovation of the 2010s thus far has been the Stand Up Pouch, which is a special kind of [[retort pouch]] that features a bottom gusset, making it able to stand upright. Stand Up Pouches are mostly used for human alimentation products, but also for pet food as well as beauty care products. In the Brazilian market, Stand Up Pouches constantly have been managing to fit into new market niches. While showing immense growth ([[CAGR]] of 6,1% in volume and 5,8% in value between 2011 and 2014), the distribution of Stand Up Pouches in Brazil yet lags behind the Chilean and the U.S. market, which is due to a lack of supply of scale of important components like resealable zippers and nylon, causing the price for the production of Stand Up Pouches to be higher than in comparable markets. Among the ten fastest growing flexibles, Stand Up Pouches rank third with regard to CAGR in volume and fourth as regards CAGR in value.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inovação {{!}} Datamark|url = http://www.datamark.com.br/inovacao/|website = www.datamark.com.br|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two common types of processes of filling Stand Up Pouches, namely [[Vertical form fill sealing machine|vertical form fill seal]] (VFFS) and fill-seal (FS). Whereas the former uses rolls of film of the packaging material and complex machines that shape the pouch in its typical form before filling and eventually sealing it, the latter process uses pre-formed pouches as well as two separate machines for filling and sealing the pouch, respectively. Because of the trade-off of having a high initial investment but low operational costs, VFFS is more of a long-run rather than short-run option and useful for the production of large quantities. However, as the FS process is more decentralized than the VFFS process and does not rely on one extensive machine, the chance of suffering from long downtimes for maintenance is significantly lower with FS, since failures in single production processes can be fixed more easily.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Typical products that come in Stand Up Pouch packaging are nuts, cereals, dog and cat food, liquid soap and smaller quantities of laundry detergents.

==== Bio-based packaging ====
The development of bio-based packaging has been an important goal for packaging producers. On June 3, 2015, Coca-Cola presented their version of a 100% recyclable [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottle, called PlantBottle™ which in fact was the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coca-Cola Introduced World’s First 100% Biobased PET Bottle|url = http://www.bioplasticsmagazine.com/en/news/meldungen/20150604_Coca-Cola.php|website = www.bioplasticsmagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to usual PET, PlantBottle™ does not rely on fossil-based material. For the production of its bottle, Coca-Cola is supplied by the Brazilian petrochemical and biopolymers company [[Braskem]], who produce [[polyethylene]] that is based in its entirety on sugarcane ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coca-Cola expands PlantBottle reach, launches 100% plant-based HDPE {{!}} Packaging World|url = http://www.packworld.com/sustainability/strategy/coca-cola-expands-plantbottle-reach-launches-100-plant-based-hdpe|website = www.packworld.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = I'm green™  Polyethylene - Braskem|url = http://www.braskem.com/site.aspx/Im-greenTM-Polyethylene|website = www.braskem.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Tetra Pak]] announced the launch of a 100% renewable package for their dairy products.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tetra Pak Launches 100% Renewable Package Globally · Environmental Leader · Environmental Management News|url = http://www.environmentalleader.com/2015/11/16/tetra-pak-launches-100-renewable-package-globally/|website = www.environmentalleader.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovative packaging concept won Tetra Pak the "Best carton or pouch" and "Best manufacturing or processing innovation" prizes at the World Beverage Innovation Awards 2015 as well as a Gold Award at the Pro2Pac Excellence Awards in the UK for "being the world’s first carton made entirely from plant-based, renewable packaging materials".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tetra Pak Launches 100% Renewable Package Globally · Environmental Leader · Environmental Management News|url = http://www.environmentalleader.com/2015/11/16/tetra-pak-launches-100-renewable-package-globally/|website = www.environmentalleader.com|accessdate = 2015-12-01|date = 2015-11-16|first = Karen|last = Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Tetra Pak state award win is a ‘recognition of efforts’|url = http://www.foodbev.com/news/interview-tetra-pak-state-award-win-is-a-recognition-of-efforts/|website = FoodBev|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Winners and finalists of the World Beverage Innovation Awards 2015 announced|url = http://www.foodbev.com/news/winners-and-finalists-of-the-world-beverage-innovation-awards-2015-announced/|website = FoodBev|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the production of its sustainable packaging solution Tetra Pak also uses sugar cane [[bioplastic]]s provided by Braskem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Brazilian sugarcane industry is a promising market as well as a future indispensable part of the country's packaging market. Sugarcane ethanol is produced in areas that are located in at least 2000&amp;nbsp;km distance from the Amazon rainforest, that is, in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] coastal regions as well as in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]], with 60% of the production taking place in the [[São Paulo (state)|State of São Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brazilian Sugarcane Industry|url = http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/brazilian-sugarcane-industry|website = The Brazil Business|accessdate = 2015-11-30|date = 2015-01-22|last = Verotti Farah|first = Ana Gabriela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recycling in Brazil ===

Data according to ''ABAL'', ''ABIPET'', ''ABRAVIDRO'', ''ABPO'', ''ABTCP'', ''ABRE'', and ''ABIPLAST''.&lt;ref&gt;The Braziian Associations of the aluminum, PET, glass, cardboard, paper, packaging and plastics industry, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Compared to developed OECD states, Brazil has a fairly low total recycling rate, being at 2% of created waste.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recycling of Waste in Brazil|url = http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/recycling-of-waste-in-brazil|website = The Brazil Business|accessdate = 2015-12-02|last = Nóvais|first = Andrea|date = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in 2012 merely 14% of municipalities provided selective waste collection - with 86% of these municipalities located in either the [[South Region, Brazil|South]] or Southeastern region - the country relies heavily on [[:pt:Catador de material reciclável|waste pickers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = CEMPRE Review 2013|publisher = Compromisso Empresarial de Recliclagem (CEMPRE)|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 21|language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally to that, only 64% of the population has access to regular garbage collection.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Yet, the situation is improving since the absolute number of municipalities offering selective collection rose from 443 in 2010 to 766 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = CEMPRE Review 2013|publisher = CEMPRE|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RecyclingPET.png|390x390px|Destinations of recycled PET in Brazil in 2012. Data according to ''ABIPET'' and ''CEMPRE''.&lt;ref&gt;CEMPRE is a non-profit organization that promotes recycling to the Brazilian industry.&lt;/ref&gt; |thumb]]
Despite its low overall recycling rate, Brazil is the world leader in recycling aluminum. Having set a record recycling rate of 98,4% of aluminum, the country was able to top its record 97,1% from 2013 by another 1,3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/11/10/brazil-breaks-aluminum-recycling-record/|title = Brazil breaks aluminum recycling record|last = Cleyton|first = Vilarino|date = 2015-11-10|work = Fox News Latino|access-date = 2015-12-02|via = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211035948/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/11/10/brazil-breaks-aluminum-recycling-record/#|archive-date = 2015-12-11|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for the extreme aluminum recycling rate are the rising energy costs - which will continue to rise given the increasing hydropower prices caused by the [[2015 Brazilian drought|2015 drought]] - and consequently, the high expenses that are associated with the production of new aluminum. As between March 2014 and March 2015 the cost of energy rose by 60% and since recycling aluminum requires 95% less energy than producing new material, the recycling rates have kept rising while smelter plants have been shutting down production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = UPDATE 1-Alcoa's Brazil aluminum smelter latest victim of high costs|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/30/alcoa-capacity-idUSL3N0WW4XZ20150330|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-03-30|access-date = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RECICLAR Materiais Recicláveis|url = http://www.reciclarbrasil.com.br/meioambiente.asp|website = www.reciclarbrasil.com.br|accessdate = 2015-12-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151224192503/http://www.reciclarbrasil.com.br/meioambiente.asp#|archive-date = 2015-12-24|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; PET is the second most recycled packaging material in Brazil with 54% of PET having been recycled in 2014. However, due to lower production costs this rate is yet much smaller than the percentage of recycled aluminum. Given its very low production costs as well as the more expensive processes needed to recycle the material, plastics exhibit the lowest recycling rate among the most common packaging materials. The Brazilian beauty care and cosmetics brand Sejaa serves as an example for products that use recycled packaging. Sejaa, which was launched by Brazilian fashion model [[Gisele Bündchen]] uses fibers consisting to 100% of recycled post-consumer waste paper and is Forest Stewardship certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brasil PackTrends 2020|last = Sarantópoulos|publisher = ITAL|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 136|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://shopsejaa.com/standard.php|title = Seeja standard|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-03|website = |publisher = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210214907/http://shopsejaa.com/standard.php#|archive-date = 2015-12-10|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is Brazilian pulp and paper manufacturer [[Suzano Papel e Celulose|Suzano]], which since 2012 produces paperboard made from Post consumer resin (PCR) by extracting fibers from long life packaging&lt;ref&gt;Long life packaging is packaging consisting of multiple layers that make the packaging more durable. A typical example of long life packaging is a milk carton.&lt;/ref&gt; such as milk cartons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = CEMPRE Review 2013|publisher = CEMPRE|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Suzano lança papel cartão feito com aparas recicladas {{!}} VEJA.com|url = http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/economia/suzano-lanca-papel-cartao-feito-com-aparas-recicladas/|website = VEJA.com|publisher = VEJA|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, more than one third of recycled PET was used as polyesters for the textile industry. Roughly one quarter of recycled PET was processed to alkyds, that is, synthetic resins which are mostly used as varnish, while packaging accounted for 18% of recycled PET.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4861">'''Business interruption insurance''' (also known as '''business income insurance''') is a type of [[insurance]] that covers the loss of income that a business suffers after a [[disaster]]. The income loss covered may be due to disaster-related closing of the business facility or due to the rebuilding process after a [[disaster]]. 

It differs from [[property insurance]] in that a property insurance policy only covers the physical damage to the business, while the additional coverage allotted by the business interruption policy covers the profits that would have been earned. This extra policy provision is applicable to all types of businesses, as it is designed to put a business in the same financial position it would have been in if no loss had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adjustersinternational.com/adjustingtoday/?start=1&amp;page_no=1&amp;pdfID=8 |title=Business Income Insurance: Having and Understanding This Coverage Can Be Essential to a Company's Survival |first= |last= |work=adjustersinternational.com |year=2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of coverage is not sold as a stand-alone policy, but can be added onto the business' [[property insurance]] policy or comprehensive package policy such as a [[business owner's policy]] (BOP).  Since business interruption is included as part of the business' primary policy, it only pays out if the cause of the loss is covered by the overarching policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iii.org/individuals/business/basics/interruption/ |title=Do I need business interruption insurance? |first= |last= |work=iii.org |year=2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage==
The following are typically covered under a business interruption insurance policy:
*'''Profits'''. Profits that would have been earned (based on prior months' [[financial statement]]s).
*'''Fixed Costs'''. [[Operating expense]]s and other costs still being incurred by the property (based on historical costs).
*'''Temporary Location'''. Some policies cover the extra expenses for moving to, and operating from, a temporary location.
*'''Commission &amp; Training Cost'''. Business Interruption (BI) policy essentially covers the cost of providing training to the operators of the machinery replaced by the insurer following the insured events.
*'''Extra Expenses'''. Reimbursement for reasonable expenses (beyond the fixed costs) that allow the business to continue operation while the property is being repaired.
*'''[[Civil Authority]] Ingress / Egress'''. Government-mandated closure of business premises that directly causes loss of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.irmi.com/expert/articles/2001/berry10.aspx |title=Business Interruption for Denial of Access to Insured Property |first=Doug|last=Berry|work=irmi.com |year=2001 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include forced business closures because of government-issued [[curfew]]s or street closures related to a covered event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessincomeworksheets.com/_pdf/_newsletters/9_09_articles/article_1.pdf |title=Understanding Civil Authority and Ingress/Egress Insurance Coverages |work=businessincomeworksheets.com |year=2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coverage extends until the end of the business interruption period determined by the insurance policy. Most insurance policies define this period as starting on the date of the covered peril and the damaged property is physically repaired and returned to operations under the same condition that existed prior to the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adjustersinternational.com/adjustingtoday/?start=1&amp;page_no=1&amp;pdfID=40 |title=Four Rules for Measuring the Business Interruption Period |first=Gary |last=Thompson |work=adjustersinternational.com |year=2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, businesses can purchase [[Contingent coverage|contingent]] business interruption coverage, which pays out when a business is unable to operate because of an event (such as a [[natural disaster]]) that damages the business premises of one of its suppliers or customers, thus preventing it from engaging in normal trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.irmi.com/expert/articles/2003/torpey05.aspx |title=Contingent Business Interruption: Getting All the Facts |first=Daniel |last=Torpey |work=irmi.com |year=2003 |accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CODE n Logo.jpg|thumb|The logo of the innovation platform CODE_n]]
'''CODE_n''' is a global innovation platform initiated in 2011 by [[GFT Technologies AG]] under the direction of its CEO, [[Ulrich Dietz]]. As part of the platform, an annual contest is held for [[startup company|startups]] with business models based on digital technologies. CODE_n runs for five days at the [[CeBIT]] exhibition, offering a full trade show of its own and a conference program culminating in the naming of a contest winner. Additional CODE_n elements like CONNECT, SPACES and EVENTS were developed to bring together startups and established businesses.

== History ==

CODE_n was official founded by GFT Technologies AG and publicly announced on September 14, 2011 at a press conference in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gft.com/index/company/press/press_releases/2011/nnovation_initiative_code_n_founded_international_competition_for_new_it-based_business_models.html ''Innovation initiative CODE_n founded: international competition for new IT-based business models'']. GFT Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, the program partners included [[Deutsche Messe AG]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Fujitsu Technology Solutions]], [[BITKOM]] and the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe (ZKM)]].

=== 2012: Shaping Mobile Life ===

The motto for CODE_n in 2012 was "Shaping Mobile Life" part of a quest for young companies with business models that revolve around mobile technologies.

Founded in 1908, the '''Certified General Accountants Association of Canada''' ('''CGA-Canada''') serves [[Certified General Accountant]]s and students in Canada and nearly 100 countries. CGA-Canada established the designation's certification requirements and professional standards, offers professional development, conducts research and advocacy, and represents CGAs nationally and internationally. CGA-Canada is working with the [[Chartered Professional Accountant]]s of Canada (CPA Canada) to integrate operations under the CPA banner in 2014. CPA Canada is the new national accounting body formed by the merger of the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] (CICA) and the Society of [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMA) in 2013.

In October 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 CGA-Canada was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., CGA-Canada has also been named one of "BC's Top Employers" and one of "Canada's Greenest Employers".

==History==

The national association, first known as the Canadian Accountants' Association, was founded in 1908 by a trio of Canadian Pacific Railway accountants in Montreal, Quebec. Five years later, in 1913, the General Accountants' Association, as it was then known, was granted a charter from the government of Canada. By the mid-1940s, association chapters were established from coast-to-coast. Provincial, territorial and regional (offshore) chapters were later established under their own charters.

Auditing rights are regulated by provincial governments.   In [[Prince Edward Island]], only qualified CAs and CGAs can perform public accounting and auditing in accordance with the Public Accounting and Auditing Act.  In all other provinces, except Quebec and Ontario (detailed below), only qualified CAs, CGAs, and CMAs (Certified Management Accountants) may audit public companies.

*'''1948''' Bilingual origins: Examinations are offered in English and French in Quebec. The move to a bilingual organization is underway.
*'''1950s''' CGA-British Columbia and the University of British Columbia's School of Commerce develop an innovative five-year extension program, available on campus or by correspondence. The program is later adopted in other jurisdictions and becomes a national curriculum standard.
*'''1964''' Education program goes international: The education program is extended to the  Caribbean and Bermuda.
*'''1974''' Code of Ethics enshrined: CGA-Canada approves what would become the Code of Ethical Principles and Rules of Conduct.
*'''1977''' Founding member of IFAC: CGA-Canada becomes a founding member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).
*'''1982''' Name change to  the '''Certified General Accountants Association of Canada'''.
*'''1988''' John Leslie's award: The John Leslie Award is established in honour of the association's founding president and Chair, and recognizes exceptional service.
*'''1987-1991''' Competency-based accounting education: A major revision of the CGA education program is completed. Competency-based objectives, management emphasis and integration of ethics and information technology become hallmarks of the revised program.
*'''1998''' Degree required: CGAs are now required to obtain a bachelor's degree prior to certification. Partnerships are developed with universities to provide distance-learning options.
*'''2003''' Asian links secured: CGA-Hong Kong is granted affiliate status. CGA education materials are offered at more than a dozen Chinese universities.
*'''2013''' Unifying the accounting profession: CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation [[Chartered Professional Accountant]].
*'''2014''' Unification completes in October 2014.

Historically [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] only allowed CAs to audit public companies. In 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that would enable CAs, CGAs and CMAs to practice public accounting under a reconstituted Public Accountants Council, and as of June 2010 Ontario CGAs were allowed to issue audit opinions.

In August 2005, a panel was constituted under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) to rule on a challenge filed by CGA New Brunswick and CGA-Canada. It found Quebec's measures denying CGAs the right to practice public accounting in Quebec to impair trade and recommended legislative changes. The Quebec government committed to address the problem. By November 2009, the 'Regulation respecting the public accountancy permit of the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités du Québec' enabled qualified CGAs to offer the full range of public accounting services to for-profit and publicly listed companies.

On November 6, 2009, Ontario issued a Notice of Measure claiming that material differences exist in respect of the practice of public accounting in Canada and to protect consumers out of province public accountants would be assessed against Ontario's requirements. Manitoba supported by Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan objected on the grounds that the Ontario regime causes injury to CGAs and impairs internal trade. A Panel convened under the Agreement on Internal Trade reviewed submissions and held a public hearing in Toronto on November 29, 2011. The Panel found that Ontario's notice of measure has impaired or would impair internal trade and has caused or would cause injury. The Panel recommended that Ontario comply with its AIT obligations by April 15, 2012. The outcome is important for CGAs because it removes the last barrier to mobility, allowing CGAs to practice anywhere in Canada.

In November 2008, Dr. Catherine Boivie was appointed to the Board of Directors as the Public Representative. Based in British Columbia, Dr. Boivie is the chief executive officer of Inventure Solutions and senior vice-president of information technology (IT) and facilities at Vancity, Canada's largest credit union.

In October 2013, CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation [[Chartered Professional Accountant]].  This followed most provincial CGA bodies ratifying the unification of the accounting profession in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpacanada.ca/blog/2013/10/09/cpa-canada-welcomes-positive-cga-member-vote-result/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129220319/http://cpacanada.ca/blog/2013/10/09/cpa-canada-welcomes-positive-cga-member-vote-result/ |archivedate=2013-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

CGA-Canada's professional education program is competency-based. Competency-based education requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga.org/canada/competency{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are reflected in a list of competencies. These competencies extend over three areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. They are validated periodically through extensive survey analysis. The CGA Competency Framework details the 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA.

The complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams, spread over several levels: Levels 1 to 3 (Foundation Studies), Level 4 (Advanced Studies), and final level, the PACE qualification or certification level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga.org/canada{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CGA must have an undergraduate degree. Students normally require 36 months of supervised work experiences, but in all cases they require a minimum of 24 months. They may meet the experience requirements in any business sector and in a variety of fields.

Before issuing audit opinions a CGA must first be licensed as a public accountant. The requirements for licensing include at least 500 public accounting hours per year.

CGA is recognized in 170+ countries through their partnership with ACCA.

==Online learning==

CGA-Canada has been providing online professional accounting education. Via the Internet, students can complete their studies using a system that integrates text material, study guides, video and audio tools, discussion forums, group case study and project work, web research and email.

Introduced in 2011, Professional Experience Required for Certification (PERC) is the national reporting process for students in the CGA program. With PERC, students can document their experiences online and submit it annually.

In addition to its own online program of studies, CGA-Canada has also developed online degree partnerships with several Canadian universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/Programs/Education/Pages/ca_edu_online_learning.aspx CGA-Canada's website Online learning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502001327/http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/Programs/Education/Pages/ca_edu_online_learning.aspx |date=May 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual recognition agreements==

In December 2006, CGA-Canada and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) announced a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) to take effect on 1 January 2007. This agreement was renewed in 2011.

In April 2008, CGA-Canada and [[CPA Australia]] entered into a MRA to extend the global reach of both organizations into new continents. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/OtherDocuments/ca_mra_ad.pdf]

In June 2009, CGA-Canada and CPA Ireland [http://www.cpaireland.ie/] entered into a mutual recognition agreement. The MRA establishes a strategic partnership between the two leading accounting organizations and gives members the opportunity to qualify for another designation. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/MediaCentre/CurrentMediaReleases/Pages/ca_mdr_2009-06-03.aspx]

In June 2010, CGA-Canada and the [[Ordre des Experts-Comptables]], France's foremost accounting organization, have entered into a MRA. Under this accord, CGAs and members of the CSOEC can be considered for membership by the other body. [http://www.cga-canada.org/en-ca/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/CurrentMediaReleases/Pages/ca_mdr_2010-06-28.aspx]

The association is a member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The CSSF supervision of the financial sector aims at the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/fr/la-cssf/mission-et-competences/|title=Mission et compétences: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promotion of a considered and prudent business policy in accordance with regulatory requirements
* Protect the financial stability of the regulated entities and the financial sector as a whole
* Monitoring the quality of the organization and internal control systems
* Strengthening the quality of risk management
The CSSF monitors all financial activities in Luxembourg, which require the approval of the Minister responsible for the CSSF. It is only in the public interest, ensure that the laws and ordinances are enforced on the financial sector and respected and that international conventions and EU directives in the areas under their responsibility to be implemented. The CSSF is authorized to require all necessary information to perform their duties of companies under its supervision. The CSSFübernimmt at Community and international level negotiations on the financial sector and coordinate the implementation of government initiatives and measures about an orderly expansion of the activities of the financial sector.

=== Public auditor oversight ===
The CSSF is the public auditor oversight. In this regard, the CSSF is thus responsible for the granting of the professional qualifications of the "Independent Auditor" (auditors) and "cabinet de Revision" (audit) for the approval and registration of statutory auditors and audit firms. The CSSF is also responsible for the implementation of auditing standards and professional ethics standards and internal quality control of audit firms and approved for continuing education.

=== Investor protection ===
The CSSF is directly responsible for investor protection related queries.  As part of the FIN-NET programme, the CSSF is the sole recourse for investors who seek compensation or complaints handling.  Unlike some jurisdictions, there is no separate or independent ombudsman.  There have been a number of high-profile cases, including Madoff, where the CSSF's ability to enforce customer complaints has come into question.  To date, the general response has been unsatisfactory and there are increasing concerns over the capabilities of the CSSF to carry out their duties effectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2011/cr11148.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">'''Customer service [[wikt:representative|representative]]s''' ('''CSRs'''), '''customer service advisors''', or '''customer service associates''' ('''CSAs''') interact with customers to handle complaints, process orders, and provide information about an organization’s products and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dl&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/ooh/office-and-administrative-support/customer-service-representatives.htm US Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; Qualifications include good communication, problem-solving, and computer skills.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.customerservicemanager.com/customer-service-advisor.htm |title=What is a Customer Service Advisor?|work=customerservicemanager.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Required skills ==
Customer service representative positions often require at least a high school diploma. Representatives often have some experience with [[office software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Customer_Service_Representative_(CSR)/Hourly_Rate |title=Average Customer Service Representative (CSR) Hourly Pay |date=November 5, 2018 |website=[[PayScale]] |accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First impressions are very important in this job. The moment one begins to communicate with a customer, one is being judged. The way one communicates with a customer will not only influence how the conversation develops, but the overall impression of the CSR and the organization they represent. There are five key customer service skills that define the best CSRs:      
* Ability to establish rapport with customers. 
* [[Problem solving]]     
* Strong [[Understanding|listening skills]]    
* Strong commercial awareness     
* [[Team work]]ing

== Salary ==

Although earnings may vary, the median hourly average for CSRs in 2017 was $15.81, in the US.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt; People in this job typically have less than 20 years' experience. Skills that are associated with high pay for this job are those in customer service metrics, [[Microsoft Office]], [[customer relationship management]], and oral and verbal communication.

'''Debt settlement''', also known as '''debt arbitration''', '''debt negotiation''' or '''credit settlement''', is an approach to debt reduction in which the [[debtor]] and [[creditor]] agree on a reduced balance that will be regarded as payment in full.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jane |last=Birmbaum |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/business/yourmoney/09credit.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin |title=De bt Relief Can Cause Headaches of Its Own |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a negotiation period, all payments by the debtor are made to the debt settlement company, which typically withholds payments to the creditors, even if the debtor has paid a lump sum or made payments.  Once all the debtor's accounts are in default due to this non-payment, the debt settlement company has leverage to force the debtor to accept a reduced lump sum payment as settlement. The debtor's credit rating goes down significantly due to the default, especially if the debtor was not behind on payments before the negotiation period commenced. Even though the accounts are "settled," the default appears on the debtor's credit record for seven years. Nevertheless, some debtors prefer this method of debt reduction over bankruptcy.

Debt settlement is often confused with [[debt consolidation]] or [[debt management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khalfani-Cox|first1=Lynnette|title=Debt Management vs. Debt Settlement: Which Is Best?|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/credit-loans-debt/info-08-2011/debt-management-debt-settlement.html|website=AARP|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=11 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In debt consolidation and debt management, the consumer makes monthly payments to the debt consolidator, who takes a fee and passes the rest on to the creditors; this way, creditors continue to receive payments each month.  In debt settlement, the consumer makes monthly payments, out of which the debt settlement company takes its fees for the legal work or negotiation and payments are paid to the creditor. The debt settlement company may persuade the creditor to accept a settlement less than the amount the debtor pays, with the debt settlement company keeping the difference.

Debtors may use debt settlement instead of conventional debt management because they are not aware of debt management.

== History ==

As a concept, lenders have been practicing debt settlement for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/soconne1/documents/forgive.pdf Debt Forgiveness: Plainer Speaking, Please.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the business of debt settlement became prominent in America during the late 1980s and early 1990s when bank [[deregulation]], which loosened [[consumer lending]] practices, followed by an economic [[recession]] placed consumers in financial hardships.

With charge-offs (debts [[Write-off|written-off]] by banks) increasing, banks established debt settlement departments staffed with personnel who were authorized to negotiate with defaulted cardholders to reduce the [[Balance (accounting)|outstanding balances]] in hopes to recover funds that would otherwise be lost if the cardholder filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy]]. Typical settlements ranged between 25% and 65% of the outstanding balance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creditcardnation.com/testimony-20070416.pdf Testimony of Dr. Robert Manning before the FTC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the unprecedented spike in [[personal debt]] loads, there has been another rather significant (even if criminally under reported) change – the 2005 passage of legislation that dramatically worsened the chances for average Americans to claim Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. As things stand, should anyone filing for bankruptcy fail to meet the Internal Revenue Service regulated ‘means test’, they would instead be shelved into the Chapter 13 debt restructuring plan. Essentially, [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13 bankruptcies]] simply tell borrowers that they must pay back some or all of their debts to all unsecured lenders. Repayments under Chapter 13 can range from 1% to 100% of the amounts owed to unsecured creditors, based on the ability of the debtor to pay. Repayment periods are 3 years (for those who earn below the median income) or 5 years (for those above), under court mandated budgets that follow IRS guidelines, and the penalties for failure are  more severe.

== Process ==

Debt settlement is the process of negotiating with creditors to reduce overall debts in exchange for a lump sum payment.  A successful settlement occurs when the creditor agrees to forgive a percentage of total account balance.  Normally, only unsecured debts not secured by real assets like homes or autos can be settled. [[Unsecured debt]]s include medical bills and [[Credit card debt]] - not student loans, auto financing or mortgages. For the debtor, this makes obvious sense, they avoid the stigma and intrusive court-mandated controls of bankruptcy while still lowering, sometimes by more than 50%, their debt balances.  Whereas, for the creditor, they regain trust that the borrower intends to pay back what he can of the loans and not file bankruptcy (in which case, the creditor risks losing all moneys owed).

Negotiating with a collection agency or junk debt buyer is somewhat similar to negotiating with a credit card company or other original creditor.  However, many collection agencies (or junk debt buyers) will agree to take less of the owed amount than the original creditor, because the junk debt buyer has purchased the debt for a fraction of the original balance.&lt;ref name="ZombieDebt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/ManageDebt/ZombieDebtCollectorsDigUpYourOldMistakes.aspx|title=Stock quotes, financial tools, news and analysis - MSN Money|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a part of the settlement, the consumer can request that collection is removed from the [[credit report]], which is generally not the case with the original creditor.  Even if the removal of the collection account from the consumer credit report has been successfully achieved as a condition of settlement during negotiations, the negative marks from the original credit card company will still remain, according to Maxine Sweet, a spokeswoman for credit reporting agency Experian.&lt;ref name="MakeADeal"/&gt;

Potential candidates for debt settlement will typically have an overwhelming debt that they can’t afford to pay, have poor credit or don’t care about negatively impacting their bad credit, and/or don’t qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Debt Settlement: A Complete Guide |url=https://www.supermoney.com/debt-help/debt-settlement/ |publisher=SuperMoney |accessdate=June 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the U.K. you can appoint an Arbiter or legal entity to negotiate with the creditors. Creditors often accept reduced balances in a final payment and this is called '''full and final settlement''' but with debt settlement the reduced amount can be spread over an agreed term.

In the U.K. creditors such as banks, credit card, loan companies and other creditors are already writing off huge amounts of debt. Most creditors are open to negotiations and are willing to accept reductions of 50% or more. Debt settlement allows the public to spread payments out over a set term - instead of having to pay a lump sum in one go which is the case with Full and Final Settlement.

U.K. debt settlement is not to be confused with full and final settlement where debt management companies have been known to hold on to client funds in which case the creditors get nothing until they decide to settle.  Furthermore, the debt management company usually instructs the consumer not to make any payments to creditors.  The intended effect is to scare creditors into settling the debt for less than the full amount.  Typically, however, creditors simply begin collection procedures, which can include filing suit against the consumer in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Federal Trade Commission, Facts for Consumers, "Knee Deep in Debt"|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre19.shtm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As long as [[consumer]]s continue to make minimum monthly payments, creditors will not negotiate a reduced balance.  However, when payments stop, balances continue to grow because of late fees and ongoing interest.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; This practice of holding client funds is regarded as unethical in the U.S. and U.K.

===United States===
U.S. debt settlement differs slightly. There are several indicators that few consumers actually have their debt eliminated by full and final settlement. A survey of U.S. debt settlement companies found that 34.4% of enrollees had 75 percent or more of their debt settled within three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TASC |title=Letter from the Association of Settlement Companies (TASC) to the Federal Trade Commission, commenting on the FTC's proposed amendments to the Telemarketing Sales Rule on the marketing of debt relief services at 9-11 |url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/tsrdebtrelief/543670-00202.pdf |publisher=FTC |accessdate=Oct 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602151345/http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/tsrdebtrelief/543670-00202.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data released by the Colorado Attorney General showed that only 11.35 percent of consumers who had enrolled more than three years earlier had all of their debt settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Press Release |title=Attorney General Unveils First Annual Report On Debt Settlement, Credit Counseling Business Practices |url=http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/press/news/2009/10/15/attorney_general_unveils_first_annual_report_debt_settlement_credit_counseling |publisher=Colorado Attorney General |accessdate=Oct 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204190809/http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/press/news/2009/10/15/attorney_general_unveils_first_annual_report_debt_settlement_credit_counseling |archivedate=2010-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And when asked to show that most of their customers are better off after debt settlement, industry leaders said that would be an "unrealistic measure." &lt;ref name="GAO Report"&gt;{{cite web|last=GAO Report|title=Debt Settlement: Fraudulent, Abusive and Deceptive Practices Pose Risk to Consumers|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10593t.pdf|publisher=GAO|accessdate=Apr 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers can arrange their own settlements by using advice found on web sites, hire a [[lawyer]] to act for them, or use debt settlement companies.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;  In a New York Times article Cyndi Geerdes, an associate professor at the University of Illinois law school, states "Done correctly, (debt settlement) can absolutely help people". However, stopping payments to creditors as part of a debt settlement plan can reduce a consumer's [[credit score]] from 65 to 125 points, with higher impacts on those who were current on their payments prior to enrolling in the program.&lt;ref name="GAO Report"/&gt; And missed payments can remain on a consumer's credit report for seven years even after a debt is settled.&lt;ref name="GAO Report"/&gt;

Some settlement companies may charge a large fee up front, which ignores a rule from the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Consumer Advocates |title=Debt Settlement Company Evasion of Amendments to TSR |url=http://www.cambridge-credit.org/pdf/ftcopenletter12132010.pdf |publisher=Cambridge-Credit.org |accessdate=Dec 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313165334/http://www.cambridge-credit.org/pdf/ftcopenletter12132010.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Or they take a monthly fee from customer bank accounts for their service, possibly reducing the incentive to settle with creditors quickly. One expert advises consumers to look for companies that charge only after a settlement is made, and charge about 20 percent of the amount by which the outstanding balance is reduced.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;  Other experts say debt settlement is a flawed model altogether and should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Center for Responsible Lending |title=The Debt Settlement Industry |url=http://www.responsiblelending.org/other-consumer-loans/debt-settlement/research-analysis/the-debt-settlement-industry.html |publisher=Center for Responsible Lending |accessdate=Jan 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229181853/http://www.responsiblelending.org/other-consumer-loans/debt-settlement/research-analysis/the-debt-settlement-industry.html |archivedate=2011-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional debt settlement==

Depending on the country, different laws regulate professional debt settlement companies. In the United States, debt relief companies are required to provide information in advance of a consumer signing up for the services, including the cost and the terms. A legitimate company will use a [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]-insured trust account.  Once enough funds are built up the negotiation  process can begin with each creditor individually.  Trust accounts, also known as "special purpose accounts," are often held by a bank, and managed by a bank agent (who charges a monthly maintenance fee).  Accounts can also be held by creditors, or may be sold to collections agency for an average of $0.15 on the dollar, in which case debt can still be negotiated.

A consumer makes monthly payments to the debt settlement company, or to the bank (or bank agent) who holds the "trust" account.  A portion of each payment is taken as fees for the debt settlement company, and the rest is put into the trust account.  The consumer is told not to pay anything to the creditors.  The debt settlement company's fees are usually specified in the enrollment contract, and may range from 10% to 75% of the total amount of debt to be settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Money, "Debt settlement: A costly escape"|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/ManageDebt/DebtSettlementACostlyEscape.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FTC regulations effective October 27, 2010 restrict debt settlement companies from collecting any fees from a debtor client for services until settlement with the creditor has been reached and at least one payment made.

===Advantages===
Settlement companies generally package their settlements into a larger bulk settlement with the creditor for 35% - 50% of the existing balances.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  The debt settlement companies typically have built up a relationship during their normal business practices with the credit card companies and can come to a settlement agreement quicker and at a more favorable rate than a debtor acting on their own. With [[Global financial crisis of 2008|the current economic crisis]], more and more credit card companies may be willing to settle existing credit card debts rather than add to their already large written off bad debt.

===Disadvantages===
Debt settlement companies generally take a percentage of the savings of the forgiven debt as the fee for their services. The drop out rate of debt settlement programs is high if a monthly plan is greater than 36 months at 50% and consumers who find themselves in these sorts of debt situations tend to have trouble sticking to a structured payment program for an extended period of time. Plans 36 months or less have a completion rate of over 85%  Good settlement companies will arrange monthly update calls, establish a plan where you could miss a payment or two (life happens) or finish the plan six months earlier if you are consistent with all monthly payments. Credit card accounts typically go into collection after they are charged off, typically 180 days after the last payment on the account.  The debt settlement companies may not handle calls from the credit card companies, nor the collection agencies.Calls will slow down as the settlement company makes contact with the creditors.  Legal action can be taken against the creditor if they violate the FDCP act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf|title=Consumer Information - Federal Trade Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good settlement company works with their clients to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/how-does-debt-settlement-work/[NerdWallet] February 26, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;  Debtors can be sued by creditors seeking to recover debts and interest. This can be avoided by using companies with good standings and practices that protect consumers from these procedures.{16}

==Do-it-yourself debt settlement==

It is possible for a consumer to imitate the methods of professional debt settlement companies and many people report success in negotiating a debt settlement for themselves.&lt;ref name="MakeADeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/ManageDebt/MakeADealWithDebtCollectors.aspx|title=Stock quotes, financial tools, news and analysis - MSN Money|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiation of negotiations can begin by calling the customer service department of the credit card company. In general, the credit card company will only deal with a consumer when the consumer is behind on payments but capable of making a lump sum payment.  A payment plan is not an option; the credit card company will demand that the consumer make a lump sum payment of the settlement amount.

===Advantages===
By negotiating debts on their own, debtors are able to save in fees that would otherwise be paid to a debt settlement company or an attorney.  This option also gives the debtor more control over the process which may, or may not, be a motivational factor to continue successfully completing the process.

===Disadvantages===
While the do-it-yourself option offers the debtor more control and reduced fees, there are negatives generally associated with this option. Creditors have their own policies regarding debt settlement and certain creditors will not settle directly with consumers. Additionally, consumers may face less advantageous settlement rates on their own, as opposed to debt settlement companies that have relationships with creditors and can often package bulk settlements. Consumers may face difficulty getting through to decision makers or long delays in any negotiations or paperwork processing with the creditors. Furthermore, every creditor has different processes and procedures in how they determine settlement offers and terms. Not knowing those can leave a consumer in the dark. Settlement Companies have a Customer service department to assist consumers with any questions or difficulties that arise during their program. This support can be particularly valuable, especially in cases where creditors become aggressive. If an account were to escalate to legal status, a consumer settling on their own would need to seek out a third party for help. Unfamiliarity of the settlement process can be intimidating and mistakes can be made. You will need to beware of fine print and carefully review any correspondence, proposed settlement or agreement with a creditor. Settlement Agreements should be reviewed very carefully, perhaps by a third party, to make sure that all the terms are those that are agreed upon. Settling one’s debt can be an emotionally draining and difficult process.

== Creditor’s incentives ==

The creditor’s primary incentive is to recover funds that would otherwise be lost if the debtor filed for bankruptcy. The other key incentive is that the creditor can often recover more funds than through other collection methods. Collection agencies and [[Collection agency|collection attorneys]] charge commissions as high as 40% on recovered funds. Bad debt purchasers buy portfolios of delinquent debts from creditors who give up on internal collection efforts and these [[bad debt]] purchasers pay between 1 and 12 cents on the dollar, depending on the age of the debt, with the oldest debts the cheapest.&lt;ref name="ZombieDebt"/&gt; Collection calls and lawsuits sometimes push debtors into bankruptcy, in which case the creditor often recovers no funds.

== Common objections  ==

'''Damages credit''' - Credit reports will show evidence of debt settlements and the associated [[FICO]] scores will be lowered temporarily as a result.  However, if a "paid in full" letter is obtained from the creditor, the debtor's credit report should show no sign of a debt settlement.  Additionally, as debtors settle their accounts the score starts to go back up again. Some Debt Settlement companies offer Credit Repair in their programs in order to erase some of the negative remarks on credit reports.

'''Potential for lawsuits''' - Though few creditors wish to push borrowers toward bankruptcy, (and the potential of governmental protection against all debts),there’s always the possibility of a [[lawsuit]] whenever debts lay unpaid.  In the debt settlement process the debtor's accounts remain in default.  While the debts are still in default the creditor or its assignee can still file a lawsuit against a debtor.  Most creditors and debt collectors want a lump sum payment to settle for less than the full debt.  Although a debtor may make monthly payments to the debt settlement company, the amount is too small to successfully negotiate a settlement until after the debtor has made several months' worth of payments.

'''Eligibility of debts''' - In addition, the specific debts of the borrowers themselves affect the success of negotiations.  [[Tax liens]] and domestic judgments, for reasons that should be clear, remain unaffected by attempts at settlement.  Student loans, even those not federally subsidized, have been granted special powers by recent legislation to attach bank accounts without possibility of Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.  Also, some individual creditors, including Discover Card, for example, tend to have an aggressive resistance against negotiations.

'''Tax consequences''' - Another common objection to debt settlement is that debtors whose debts are partially canceled outside the bankruptcy system will need to report the canceled portion of the debt as [[taxable income]]. (IRS Publication Form 982) The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers any amount of forgiven debt as taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The forgiving creditor must provide the taxpayer with a 1099-C tax form for amounts $600 or greater. This form will list the amount of forgiven debt and interest in Box 2. Taxpayers with portions of personal loans forgiven may not subtract the interest reported in Box 3 from the amount of reportable income on this form.

However, the IRS does not require taxpayers to report forgiven debt if the tax payer was [[insolvent]] at the time the creditor forgave the debt. Being insolvent means that the amount of a debtor’s debts are greater than his/her assets (how much money and property the debtor owns). However, the IRS adds that “you cannot exclude any amount of canceled debt that is more than the amount by which you are insolvent.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p525/ar02.html#d0e4707|title=Publication 525 (2015), Taxable and Nontaxable  Income|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a taxpayer is $10,000 in debt and owns $3,000 in assets, he/she cannot exclude more than $7,000 of forgiven debt from his/her [[income tax]]. Any forgiven debt over $7,000 that year must be reported as taxable income.

==  Criticism ==

In May 2009, the [[New York Attorney General]] issued [[subpoena]]s to fourteen "debt settlement" companies, looking for violations of New York law.&lt;ref&gt;New York Attorney General Press Release May 7, 2009 http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/may/may7a_09.html&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 19, 2009, the [[New York Attorney General]] filed suit against two "debt settlement" firms and their affiliates, alleging violations related to fraudulent business practices and false advertising.&lt;ref&gt;New York Attorney General Press Release May 19, 2009 http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/may/may19b_09.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2010 [[CBS]] ''[[Early Show]]'' story on the debt settlement industry cast a harsh light on major debt settlement firm [[Credit Solutions of America]]'s business practices, and provided consumer advice for debt settlement counseling.&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, Early Show, Beware Debt Settlement Companies, March 29, 2010, http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/29/earlyshow/contributors/susankoeppen/main6343617.shtml?tag=cbsnewsTwoColUpperPromoArea&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Better Business Bureau rating ===

The [[Better Business Bureau]] has adopted an automatic downgrading policy for all debt settlement companies.  In a written statement, the Council of Better Business Bureaus stated, "Debt negotiation/settlement businesses are downgraded in the BBB rating system based on BBB concerns with the debt negotiation/settlement industry. The FTC held a workshop on debt negotiation/settlement last fall, and similar concerns were expressed as to how the industry operates and the likelihood that debt negotiation/settlement benefits a significant number of consumers."

The Association of Settlement Companies (TASC), the professional association for the debt settlement industry, warned in a written statement that "under the BBB’s new rating system, it is virtually impossible for a debt settlement company to be rated anything other than a ‘D’ or ‘F’,". In a February letter TASC sent to the National Council of Better Business Bureaus, the organization alleged that “there are critical flaws in the BBB’s consumer grading system as it applies to settlement firms.” The letter expressed concern that all settlement companies will be given poor ratings, regardless of the number of consumer complaints, how those complaints have been resolved, or the business practices of the settlement firm under review. TASC says the dispute stems from the fact that the BBB does not consider debt settlement a viable option for consumers who cannot afford to pay back their debts and want professional help to negotiate lower payments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">'''Elemental cost planning''' is a system of [[Cost planning]] and [[Cost control]], typically for buildings, which enables the cost of a scheme to be monitored during design development.

1951 saw the publication of the Ministry of Education Building Bulletin No 4 which essentially introduced the concept of elemental cost planning to the UK construction industry. Its Author was James Nisbet. The concept has been refined and developed over more than 50 years in the UK by [[BCIS]] (the Building Cost Information Service of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors).

Elemental Cost Planning relies upon the adoption of a Standard Form of Cost Analysis for buildings which allows costs to be compared on a common format and forms the basis of the benchmarking analysis central to the concept of Elemental Cost Plans.

It should :-
*Ensure that the tender amount is close to the first estimate, or that any likely difference between the two is anticipated and is acceptable. 
*Ensure that the money available for the projects is allocated consciously and economically to the various components and finishes.
*Always involves the measurement and pricing of approximate quantities at some stage of the process.
*Aim to achieve good value at the desired level of expenditure. 

Elemental cost planning is often referred to as 'designing to a cost' or 'target cost planning' since a cost limit is fixed for the scheme and the architect must then prepare a design not to exceed this cost.

'''Fire polishing''', also known as '''flame polishing''', is a method of [[polishing]] a material, usually [[glass]] or [[thermoplastic]]s, by exposing it to a [[flame]] or heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oe5YJmRmxQMC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Flame+polishing+used+on+glass|title=Plastics Materials and Processes: A Concise Encyclopedia|last=Harper|first=Charles A.|last2=Petrie|first2=Edward M.|date=2003-10-10|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471459200|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the surface of the material briefly melts, [[surface tension]] smooths the surface. Operator skill is critical with this method. When done properly, flame plastic polishing produces the clearest finish, especially when polishing [[acrylic resin|acrylic]]. This method is most applicable to flat external surfaces. Flame polishing is frequently used in acrylic plastic fabrication because of its high speed compared to abrasive methods. In this application, an [[oxyhydrogen torch]] is typically used, one reason being that the flame chemistry is unlikely to contaminate the plastic.

Flame polishing is essential to creation of the [[Pasteur pipette|glass pipettes]] used for the [[patch clamp]] technique of [[voltage clamp]]ing.

'''Sir Herbert Samuel Holt''' (February 12, 1856 &amp;ndash; September 29, 1941) was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[civil engineer]] who became a businessman,  [[banker]], and [[corporate director]] with a ruthless business reputation. He was President of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]], [[Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power]], and a director of some 250 companies worldwide, with assets valued at around $200 million. On his death, the [[Montreal Gazette]] described him as "the richest man in [[Canada]]", but he was also one of the most reviled. Among his peers in the [[Golden Square Mile]], "everyone respected his business ability, but nobody liked him personally".&lt;ref&gt;Remembrance of Grandeur - The Anglo-Protestant Elite of Montreal, by Margaret Westley (1990), page 202&lt;/ref&gt; Holt was one of the founders of the Town of [[Hampstead, Quebec]]&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the Town of Hampstead]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Holt was born at Ballycrystal, near [[Geashill]], [[County Offaly|Co. Offaly]]. He was the second son of William Robert Grattan Holt, of Carberry House, [[Co. Kildare]], inherited in 1742 from his ancestor, Hannah Colley (afterwards Grattan) of Castle Carberry. Holt grew up with his family at another family property, Ballycrystal, a [[Grazing land|grazing farm]] of 291 [[acres]]. In reference to Holt's own ruthless business reputation, it is of interest to note that in a dispute between his father and his uncle, it was said that, "the business affairs of William Holt's family would not stand up to close scrutiny".&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of Migration - Patrick O'Sullivan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Holt's elder brother, Thomas Grattan Holt, succeeded to Ballycrystal and Carberry, while Holt studied civil engineering in [[Dublin]]. In 1873, he emigrated to [[Canada]], beginning work as an assistant engineer with the [[Toronto]] Water Works. In the early 1880s, he was employed to survey and construct portions of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] across the prairies and through the [[Rocky Mountains]], under [[James Ross (Canadian businessman)|James Ross]].

==Career==
Herbert Holt became a pioneer developer of the [[energy]] business in the [[Province of Quebec]] and owned the Montreal Gas Company. In 1901 he merged Montreal Gas with [[Rodolphe Forget|Rodolphe Forget's]] Royal Electric Company to create the [[Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power|Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power Company]]. In 1944, their successful conglomerate was [[Nationalization|nationalized]] by legislation passed by the [[National Assembly of Quebec|Legislative Assembly of Quebec]]. It came under the newly created Quebec Hydroelectric Commission, also known as [[Hydro-Québec]]. Holt served as president of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] from 1908 to 1934, and the bank's chairman from 1934 until his death. He was a co-founder of the [[Ritz-Carlton Montreal]], a director of [[Montreal Trust Company]], [[Canada Car and Foundry]] and many other Canadian companies. He was appointed chairman of the [[Federal Plan Commission]] in 1913. In 1915, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George V|King George V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29094 |supp=y |pages=2363–2364  |date=9 March 1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Samuel Holt died in 1941 and was interred in the [[Mount Royal Cemetery]] in Montreal. His comparatively modest home on [[Stanley Street (Montreal)|Stanley Street]] in Montreal's [[Golden Square Mile]] was demolished after his death. Following its formation in 1979, Herbert Holt's significant contribution to the Canadian economy was recognized through his election to the [[Canadian Business Hall of Fame]].

==Reputation==
However, Holt was also one of the richest and most reviled Montrealers of his time. When his death was announced at a [[baseball]] game in 1941, the crowd cheered. To many [[French Canadian]]s, Holt was the epitome of 'les maudits anglais' ('the damned English'). {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Herbert is remembered for being a harsh banker who enjoyed large profits while the common man suffered during the [[great depression]]. In his own words, "If I am rich and powerful, while you are suffering the stranglehold of poverty and the humiliation of social assistance; if I was able, at the peak of the Depression, to make 150% profits each year, it is foolishness on your part, and as for me, it is the fruit of a wise administration."

==Family==
[[File:Send Grove Surrey.JPG|thumb|Send Grove, Holt's home in [[Surrey]]]]
In 1890, Holt married Jessie, the eldest daughter of Andrew Paton (1833-1892) of [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]]. The Holts kept three houses: One at 297 Stanley Street in Montreal's [[Golden Square Mile]]; another called Ballycrystal House, near [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the [[Bahamas]]; and a third called [[Send, Surrey|Send Grove]], near [[Woking]] in [[England]]. The Holts were the parents of three sons:

He kept a house in [[Mayfair, London]] and in 1927 he purchased Lackham Manor, [[Wiltshire]], for £78,000. He was [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire]] and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Upton (UK Parliament constituency)|Upton]], [[Essex]].  He married Elizabeth, daughter of George Lighthall Cains of Montreal and his wife Amy, sister of Percy Cowans of Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;J. W.

{{Nihongo|'''Munehisa Homma'''|本間 宗久|''Honma Munehisa''}} (also known as Sokyu Homma, Sokyu Honma) (1724-1803) was a rice merchant from [[Sakata, Yamagata|Sakata]], [[Japan]] who traded in the Dojima Rice market in [[Osaka]] during the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]. He is sometimes considered to be the father of the [[candlestick chart]].

Around 1710, a [[Futures contract|futures]] market emerged for rice, which had previously been traded exclusively on the spot. This system used ''coupons'', promising delivery of rice at a future time. From this, a [[secondary market]] of coupon trading emerged in which Munehisa flourished. Stories claim that he established a personal network of men about every 6&amp;nbsp;km between Sakata and Osaka (a distance of some 600&amp;nbsp;km) to communicate market prices.&lt;ref&gt;''Candlestick Charting Explained: Timeless Techniques for Trading Stocks and Futures'', Gregory L. Morris, McGraw-Hill, 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-146154-X}} / 9780071461542&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, he wrote (三猿金泉秘録, ''San-en Kinsen Hiroku'', The Fountain of Gold - The Three Monkey Record of Money), the first book on [[Behavioral finance|market psychology]]. In this, he claims that the psychological aspect of the market is critical to trading success and that traders' emotions have a significant influence on rice prices. He notes that recognizing this can enable one to take a position against the market: "''when all are bearish, there is cause for prices to rise"''&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Candlesticks: New Japanese Charting Techniques Revealed'', Steve Nison , Wiley Finance, 1994, {{ISBN|0-471-00720-X}}, p14.&lt;/ref&gt;  (and vice versa).

He describes the rotation of Yang (a [[bull market]]), and Yin (a bear market) and claims that within each type of market is an instance of the other type. He appears to have used weather and market volume as well as price in adopting trading positions.

Some sources claim he wrote two other books (酒田戦術詳解, ''Sakata Senjyutsu Syokai'', A Full Commentary on the Sakata Strategy) and (本間宗久相場三昧伝, ''Homma Sokyu Soba Zanmai Den'', Honma Sokyu --- Tales of a Life Immersed in the Market)

'''Ignatius Leong''' (born 1956) is a professional [[chess]] organizer in [[Singapore]] and has been one of [[Asia]]'s leading organizers for more than 20 years. He is FIDE Secretary-General and President of the ASEAN Chess Confederation, a 14-country zone, geographically the largest in the world. He is also Chairman of the FIDE Development Commission. 

He was Asia’s first International Organiser and among the first to receive the title of FIDE Senior Trainer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/info/arbiters-trainers?task=arbiter&amp;aid=1799 Arbiters / Trainers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606155452/http://www.fide.com/info/arbiters-trainers?task=arbiter&amp;aid=1799 |date=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 23, he became one of the world’s youngest International Arbiters. Leong is also Director of the ASEAN Chess Academy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intchessasia.com/site/index.htm Intchess Asia Pte Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; which has produced many promising local talents and now attracts talent from around the region. He had played in three [[Chess Olympiad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olimpbase.org/players/9z3n1dzf.html OlimpBase  Men's Chess Olympiads  Ignatius Leong]&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, he has swung wildly from one extreme to the other. He once formed a "World Chess Organization", which promised to overthrow [[FIDE]]. However, he abandoned that effort when not enough people joined. He has also swung wildly between being a supporter and an opponent of FIDE President [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]]. 

In 2002, Leong announced that he was running for FIDE President against Ilyumzhinov. Later, he changed his mind, saying that he was not running. Then, changing it again, saying that he had never withdrawn his candidacy. It was eventually ruled that once he had withdrawn, it was too late to become a candidate again, so no election was held because Ilyumzhinov was the only candidate. However, Leong became FIDE Secretary-General.

'''Inn signs''' have a history that extends beyond the [[Middle Ages]], when many houses were identified by a sign, often a [[Heraldry|heraldic charge]], which signified that the premises were under the special care of a [[nobleman]], or a vivid image that impressed itself on the memory. The ruins of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] reveal that most of their street-front shops displayed an identifying sign outside.&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Delderfield. ''Introduction to Inn Signs'', 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] especially, the tradition, by which [[publican]]s were obliged to identify their premises by a sign, dating from the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]],&lt;ref&gt;Delderfield 1969:12.&lt;/ref&gt;is carried on today. A selection of inn signs carved on slabs and rescued after the [[Great Fire of London]] is preserved in the [[Guildhall]].

'''Jakov Bienenfeld''' (28 July 1948 – 8 February 2016) was a [[Croatian people|Croatian]] entrepreneur and developer.&lt;ref name=ncl&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/20379/udario-bih-goldsteina-da-nas-nisu-razdvojili |title=Udario bih Goldsteina da nas nisu razdvojili |trans-title=I would have hit Goldstein were we not pulled apart |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |language=Croatian |author=Plamenko Cvitić |date=12 September 2005 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |archivedate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ysKsTw8?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/20379/udario-bih-goldsteina-da-nas-nisu-razdvojili |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aktual&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aktual.hr/intervju/jakov-bienenfeld/u-posao-je-vazno-prvi-uci-ali-jos-vaznije-prvi-izaci|title=Jakov Bienenfeld: U posao je važno prvi ući, ali još važnije prvi izaći|publisher=Aktual|work=aktual.hr|language=Croatian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521215107/http://www.aktual.hr/intervju/jakov-bienenfeld/u-posao-je-vazno-prvi-uci-ali-jos-vaznije-prvi-izaci|archivedate=2012-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Bienenfeld was born in [[Zagreb]] on 28 July 1948 to a [[Jew]]ish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his family perished during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=hkv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hkv.hr/hrvatski-tjednik/10849-jakov-bienenfeld-hrvati-se-trebaju-prestati-ispriavati.html|title=Jakov Bienenfeld: O Židovima i hrvatskom 'istočnom grijehu'|publisher=Hrvatski list|work=hkv.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His father, Zlatko Bienenfeld, was [[Major general]] of the [[Croatian Army]] and personal adviser to late Croatian [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|defence minister]] [[Gojko Šušak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sesvete.hr/novosti/duboki-jarak,-17-godina-kasnije/1157|title=Duboki Jarak, 17 godina kasnije|work=sesvete.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was a prominent entrepreneur who owned several successful businesses, including a travel agency and a developing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://limun.hr/main.aspx?id=391436|title=Nakon stanova Jakov Bienenfeld u Šibeniku gradi poslovnu zgradu|publisher=Limun|work=limun.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/bienenfeld-nisam-mogao-spasiti-generalturist-bit-cu-sretan-naplatim-li-potrazivanja-200936.aspx|title=Bienenfeld: Nisam mogao spasiti Generalturist, bit ću sretan naplatim li potraživanja|publisher=[[Poslovni dnevnik]]|work=poslovni.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s Bienenfeld brought an exclusive German fashion brand [[Escada]] to Croatia.&lt;ref name=aktual/&gt; Bienenfeld was also a council member of the Zagreb Jewish community.&lt;ref name=ncl/&gt;

During the [[Croatian War of Independence]], in 1991, he co-organized aid convoy on ferryboat "Ilirija" to bring the humanitarian aid to bounded [[Dubrovnik]].&lt;ref name=ncl/&gt; With the help and cooperation from [[Slobodan Praljak]], Bienenfeld also co-organized rescue of more than 1,200 Jews from [[Sarajevo]] during [[Bosnian War]]. He testified in Praljak's favor during his trial at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=hkv/&gt; 

During the last visit of [[President of Croatia]] [[Ivo Josipović]] to [[Israel]], when on February 2012 he addressed the [[Knesset]] apologising for the crimes committed against the Jews on Croatia's soil during [[World War II]], Bienenfeld stated; "''I think it is harmful to think that Croats need to redeem themselves for anything.  Let's simplify the story, in the history one part of the Croats harmed my people and that is it. Done. Amen. Croats have nothing to redeem themselves for.''"&lt;ref name=hkv/&gt; Bienenfeld believed that Croats, as a nation, are not [[Antisemitism|Antisemits]]. He stated that he does not have antisemitic experiences in Croatia and that he is proud of the treatment Jews have in Croatia.&lt;ref name="jl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/izgradnja-sinagoge-u-zagrebu-je-promasaj/1116155/|title='GRADNJA SINAGOGE U ZAGREBU JE PROMAŠAJ!' Najuspješniji židovski poduzetnik u Hrvatskoj Jakov Bienenfeld|publisher=[[Jutarnji list]]|work=jutarnji.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bienenfeld was an acquaintance of [[Ante Gotovina]] and has publicly supported him, stating that Gotovina is not guilty for the crimes he had been sentenced for.&lt;ref name=hkv/&gt; He resented former President of Croatia [[Stjepan Mesić]] interference with the split of the Zagreb Jewish Community, when Mesić supported [[Ivo Goldstein]], [[Slavko Goldstein]] and rabbi [[Kotel Da-Don]] in establishing the new Jewish community, Bet Israel. Bienenfeld stated that Mesić accused him of behaving like a [[Nazi]], although Bienenfeld is a Jew whose many family members have been killed during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=hkv/&gt;

In 2013, during an interview for [[Jutarnji list]], Bienenfeld said that he is against the reconstruction of the [[Zagreb Synagogue]], primarily because of the future maintenance costs which Zagreb's Jewish community could not finance. In the interview he also noted that in 1994, when the first President of Croatia [[Franjo Tuđman]] told him that they should build the new synagogue which would be funded by the state government, Bienenfeld declined the offer, believing it to be inappropriate when 1800 Catholic churches were left destroyed at the time, during the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="jl"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kurosagi'''''|クロサギ|lit.|''The Black Swindler''}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] written by Takeshi Natsuhara and illustrated by Kuromaru. The series is about a boy named Kurosaki who swindles only other professional swindlers known as {{nihongo|''shirosagi''|シロサギ}}. It won the 2008 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[seinen]]/general manga along with Tetsuji Sekiya's ''[[Bambino!]]''.&lt;ref name="ShogakukanAward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |script-title=ja:小学館漫画賞：歴代受賞者 |publisher=Shogakukan |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094941/http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was adapted as an 11-episode TV drama that was aired on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] from  14 April 2006 to 23 June 2006. On March 8, 2008, ''[[Kurosagi (film)|Kurosagi]]'' with [[Tomohisa Yamashita]] starring as the Black Swindler once again, was released.

==Plot==
Six years ago, Kurosaki's family was destroyed when a "shirosagi" (a "white swindler", who focuses on defrauding others) swindled Kurosaki's father of their family's life savings.  As a result, his father killed Kurosaki's mother and sister before committing suicide.  Since then, Kurosaki has devoted himself to becoming a "kurosagi" ("black swindler"), who swindles other swindlers, as a means of revenge.

As a "kurosagi," Kurosaki's acts have helped innocent victims of swindling schemes get their money back.  However, he is frequently met with opposition by a stubborn grad student, who seeks to become a prosecutor.

==Characters==
* {{nihongo|'''Kurosaki'''|黒崎}}
: A 21-year-old famed swindler known as the Kurosagi (or Black Swindler) because he only targets professional swindlers, conning them out of their own money, leaving them in ruins, and then using that money to pay back their victims.

* {{nihongo|'''Tsurara Yoshikawa'''|吉川氷柱|''Yoshikawa Tsurara''}}
: Tsurara Yoshikawa is a law student who disapproves of Kurosagi's swindling ways but falls in love with him.  She lives in Kurosaki's apartment as a tenant. Her dream is to be a prosecutor.  When she accidentally discovers Kurosaki's job as a "kurosagi", he kicks her out of the apartment in order to protect her from the repercussions of his actions rather than facing the other option of silencing her.

* {{nihongo|'''Toshio Katsuragi'''|桂木敏夫|''Katsuragi Toshio''}}
: Known as the "Fixer", Katsuragi is an information broker who supplies Kurosaki with information for a cut of the profit Kurosaki makes and supports Kurosaki with acts such as buying defunct companies and being the mastermind behind many of Kurosaki's schemes.  Though he is somewhat of a father-figure to Kurosaki, he is a nefarious character as he employs other swindlers aside from Kurosaki.  He uses his snack bar as his formal base.

* {{nihongo|'''Masaru Kashina'''|神志名将|''Kashina Masaru''}}
: Appearing in the film adaptation of the series, Masaru Kashina is the newly appointed assistant inspector of the East Tokyo Department, in charge of intellectual crimes. Self-righteous and dedicated to returning law and order to Tokyo, he becomes obsessed with apprehending Kurosaki after learning of the Black Swindler and his methods of operation.  Because his paternal uncle was a swindler, Kashina was adopted by his mother's relatives and had faked his death when he was two years old in order to create a new identity in order to pursue the swindlers he despises.

== Cast ==
* [[Tomohisa Yamashita]] as Kurosaki (Kurosagi)
* [[Maki Horikita]] as Tsurara Yoshikawa 
* [[Yui Ichikawa]] as Yukari Mishima
* Koji Kato as Yoichi Shiraishi

"Malaysia to strengthen position as Islamic financial hub". The Star. Retrieved 4 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was launched in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.com.my/wp-content/uploads/eng/html/resources/annual/ar2006_eng/pdf/part3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Part Three : Strengthen market competitiveness|website=Sc.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.

==Internationalising Sukuk Market==
Malaysia remained the key issuer accounting for 69.3% or USD19.73bln of the total quarterly issuance. Cumulatively in 3Q14 YTD, Malaysia represents 64.9% of total issuances this year to date with more than USD61.4bln in new issuances volume, an increase of 6% in absolute volume compared to the USD58.2bln issued in the same period last year.

The Malaysian sukuk market has been tapped by a wide variety of issuers including benchmark sukuk of various maturities issued by the Malaysian central bank; capital raising and liquidity management sukuk issued by various Malaysian corporate institutions; infrastructure and fund-raising sukuk by the Malaysian government-related entities such as Pengurusan Air SPV Berhad; retail sukuk issued by Dana Infra giving Shariah-compliant capital market fixedincome investment opportunities to individuals;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2014/08/19/Danainfra-third-issuance-of-retail-Sukuk-oversubscribed/?style=biz|title=Danainfra third issuance of retail Sukuk oversubscribed - Business News - The Star Online|author=|date=|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by foreign issuers such as Bumitama Agri from Singapore that have issued sukuk in the Malaysian capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maybank-ib.com/pdf/Press_Release_-_MKE_successfully_brings_Bumitama_to_the_Msian_Sukuk_market_with_its_maiden_MYR2b_Sukuk_programme.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521000524/http://www.maybank-ib.com/pdf/Press_Release_-_MKE_successfully_brings_Bumitama_to_the_Msian_Sukuk_market_with_its_maiden_MYR2b_Sukuk_programme.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sukuk were also issued denominated in foreign currencies including the world’s first Japanese Yen sukuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/05/bankoftokyomitsubishi-sukuk-idUKL3N0OM20120140605|title=UPDATE 1-Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ sets up $500 mln sukuk...|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2014/09/25/BTMU-issues-worlds-first-yen-dominated-emas-sukuk/?style=biz|title=BTMU issues world's first Yen-dominated "Emas" sukuk - Business News - The Star Online|author=|date=|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, a total of 114 sukuk tranches were domiciled in the Malaysian sukuk market in 3Q14.

The "Emas" designation is given to foreign-currency denominated sukuk issues. "[[Emas bond|Emas]]", which means gold in Bahasa Malaysia symbolized universal value and security.

==Growing Islamic Banking and Takaful Sectors==
The Malaysian Islamic financial sector continues its growth trajectory, with robust growth in Islamic banking assets and takaful assets. The Islamic Banking sector in Malaysia has witnessed an increased market share on the back of growing demand for Islamic financial services.

Islamic banking has grown twice as fast in Malaysia as its conventional counterpart at a compounded annual growth rate of 22%, representing 24% to 25%% of total banking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2014/03/12/Robust-Islamic-banking-Its-on-track-to-make-up-40-of-countrys-banking-sector-assets-by-2020/?style=biz|title=Islamic banking  on track to make up 40% of Malaysia's banking sector assets - Business News - The Star Online|author=|date=|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is domicile to 11 takaful operators, two of which are foreign owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=li&amp;cat=insurance&amp;type=TKF&amp;fund=0&amp;cu=0|title=List of Licensed Financial Institutions in Malaysia - Bank Negara Malaysia - Central Bank of Malaysia|author=|date=|website=Bnm.gov.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of growth in the takaful industry has been gaining traction to become one of the main segments of the country's insurance sector.

Retakaful operators in Malaysia add an extra layer of depth to the takaful industry through the spreading of risk and added capacity so that more risk can be underwritten.

==Vibrant and Innovative Islamic Equity Market==
Malaysia’s Islamic finance marketplace has an efficient and transparent price discovery infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscircle.com.my/islamic-finance-malaysia-can-stay-ahead/|title=businesscircle.com.my|author=|date=|website=Businesscircle.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fund raising and investment activities in the Islamic capital market adhere to Islamic principles. Islamic equity market products in Malaysia include Shariah-compliant equities, Shariah-compliant collective investment schemes (unit trust funds, wholesale funds, I-REITs, I-ETFs), structured products, alternative funds(real estate, leasing, commodities) private equity funds and mixed asset (equity + fixed income + cash).

73% of total listed securities on Bursa Malaysia are Shariah-compliant.&lt;ref name="sc.com.my"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.com.my/post_archive/updated-list-of-shariah-compliant-securities-by-scs-shariah-advisory-council-12/|title=Updated List of Shariah-compliant Securities by SC's Shariah Advisory CouncilSecurities Commission Malaysia - Securities Commission Malaysia|author=|date=|website=Sc.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated list of Shariah-compliant securities approved by its [[Shariah Advisory Council]] (SAC), which takes effect on 30 May 2014, features a total of 665 Shariah-compliant securities.&lt;ref name="sc.com.my"/&gt;

Malaysia had different asset classed to suit various investor needs. The industry in Malaysia grew from two Shariah-compliant unit trust funds in 1993 to more than 220 approved funds. Malaysia’s Islamic fund management industry with RM97.5bil in assets under management,&lt;ref name="thestar.com.my"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2014/05/01/Msian-Islamic-capital-market-now-worth-RM15-trillion/?style=biz|title=Malaysian Islamic capital market now worth RM1.5 trillion - Business News - The Star Online|author=|date=|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is managed by 20 asset management companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.com.my/wp-content/uploads/eng/html/licensing/LoLI/LIFM.pdf|format=PDF|title=List of Capital Markets Services Licence holders for Islamic Fund Management as at 30 November 2014|website=Sc.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; licensed to exclusively manage shariah-compliant funds. Of the total assets under management, RM42bil is in the form of syariah-compliant unit trust funds which grew by 21% in 2013.&lt;ref name="thestar.com.my"/&gt;

==Talent Development - Sustaining the growth of Islamic Finance==
The growth of Islamic finance in the past decade has been extraordinary. As the industry expands into untapped markets, there is a need to develop new talent that understands the industry and its underlying Shariah principles to support this growth. In response, Malaysia has undertaken initiatives to support the development of a highly skilled Islamic finance human capital workforce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Market access'''  for goods means the conditions, [[tariff]] and [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|Non-tariff measures (NTMs)]], set by countries for the entry of specific goods into their markets. In the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], tariff commitments for goods are agreed upon and set out in each member's [[schedules of concessions]] on goods. The schedules represent commitments not to apply tariffs above the listed rates — these rates are “bound”. Under WTO rules, bound rates may not be raised without compensating the affected members.

Non-tariff measures (NTMs) are non-tariff policy measures that affect international trade. NTMs cover a broad range of measures both directly and indirectly related to trade, and their use has risen as tariff rates have fallen under subsequent WTO negotiation rounds. In many cases, NTMs can be classified as [[non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs)]]. Some areas of NTMs are dealt with under specific WTO agreements, notably the [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]], the [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade]], the Anti-dumping agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the Agreement on Safeguards. WTO Members seek to continually improve market access through the regular WTO work programme and through negotiations such as those launched at the [[Doha Ministerial Conference]] in November 2001.

==Market access and import regulations==
Countries have various different systems controlling the import of products. Often authorization from certification bodies and/or international [[product certification]] is required. An overview of market access regulations can be given for example by http://fita.org/countries/ or http://www.macmap.org/.

==Pharmacoeconomics==
Market Access is also used in [[Pharmacoeconomics]] and refers to the process by which a company gets a drug to market so that it becomes available for patients.  Access is defined as a patient's ability to obtain medical care. Ease of access is determined by such factors as the availability of medical services and their acceptability to the patient, location of health care facilities, the transportation, the hours of operation and cost of care.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Evidence-Based Market Access (see [[Evidence-based medicine]]) refers to a process for producing Market Access reports based on scientific, preferably [[peer-reviewed]] and referenced material.

'''Nexcelle''' is a [[joint venture]] between [[GE Aviation]]’s [http://www.mras-usa.com ''Middle River Aircraft Systems''] and [[Safran]] Nacelles – both of which are suppliers of engine [[nacelle]]s, [[thrust reverser]]s and [[aerostructures]].

Headquartered in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], Nexcelle has teamed with its parent companies to develop, produce and support integrated propulsion systems for jet engine applications on single-aisle jetliners and business aircraft.&lt;ref name="ref 8"/&gt;

With its initial program win, Nexcelle is positioned as a key partner on the world’s first truly integrated propulsion system, the [[CFM International]] LEAP-1C engine on China’s COMAC C919 jetliner. The joint venture subsequently was selected to provide the nacelle and thrust reverser for GE’s Passport integrated propulsion system, which powers the [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Bombardier Global Express|Global 7000]] and [[Bombardier Global Express|Global 8000]] business jets.&lt;ref name="ref 15"/&gt;

==History==
[[GE Aviation]] and [[Safran]] announced an agreement on a new nacelle joint venture on July 15, 2008 at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] in [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], England.&lt;ref name="ref 3"/&gt; Nexcelle was announced as the name of the new company on September 21, 2009.&lt;ref name="ref 4"/&gt;

On June 14, 2009, the appointment of Steve Walters as Nexcelle president was announced at the [[Paris Air Show]]. Walters had worked in various engineering and leadership roles, with the majority of his career at GE – including two of his most recent roles as director of Business Operations for the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] engine program and the airfoils business Quality and Compliance leader for [[GE Aviation]].&lt;ref name="ref 6"/&gt;

Also at the 2009 [[Paris Air Show]], Nexcelle’s cooperative nacelle systems agreement with [[CFM International]] was detailed. This accord covers the development and production of integrated propulsion systems for potential new applications for CFM engines.&lt;ref name="ref 7"/&gt;

Michel J. Abella was announced as the Director of Programs at Nexcelle on December 18, 2009.&lt;ref name="ref 1"/&gt;

In December, 2009, Nexcelle became a partner on the world's first truly integrated propulsion system. The company was selected to provide a combined nacelle, thrust reverser and exhaust system for the new [[CFM International]] [[CFM International LEAP-X|LEAP-1C]] engine selected as the sole western powerplant to launch [[China]]’s [[COMAC C919]] jetliner. Nexcelle’s contribution to [[CFM International LEAP-X|LEAP-1C]] on the [[COMAC C919|C919]] includes an innovative nacelle design that is produced with a significant percentage of composites, and which incorporates advanced acoustic treatment. It also is to be equipped with an Electrical Thrust Reverser Actuation System (ETRAS).&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt;

[[File:Nexcelle PANACHE.jpg|thumb|The Nexcelle PANACHE thrust reverser demonstrator is deployed during testing at GE Aviation’s Peebles, Ohio facility. An anti-ingestion tunnel protects the CFM56-5C testbed engine against FOD ([[foreign object damage]]) during thrust reverse. (May 16, 2012)]]

In October 2010, GE selected Nexcelle to provide the nacelle and thrust reverser for the GE Passport 20 engine to be used on [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]]’s new [[Bombardier Global Express|Global 7000]] and [[Bombardier Global Express|Global 8000]] business jets. The announcement was made at the [[National Business Aviation Association|NBAA]] Annual Meeting and Convention.&lt;ref name="ref 9"/&gt; At the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 2011, Nexcelle signed the purchase agreement for its supply of the [[General Electric Passport|GE Passport]] 20’s nacelle system to [[GE Aviation]].&lt;ref name="ref 10"/&gt;

Nexcelle’s presence at the 2011 [[Paris Air Show]] also included a functional half-scale model demonstrating key elements of the company’s integrated propulsion system concepts for jet engines on airliners.&lt;ref name="ref 11"/&gt;

In January 2012, Nexcelle announced the appointment of Huntley Myrie as its new president – succeeding the company’s first president, Steve Walters, who moved on to become the product leader for [[GE Aviation]]’s nacelle and aerostructures activities.&lt;ref name="ref 12"/&gt;

Nexcelle began full-scale testing of its nacelle demonstrator – called PANACHE (Pylon And Nacelle Advanced Configuration for High Efficiency) – in May 2012, marking a first validation of the thrust reverser element for the company’s Integrated Propulsion System technology. This activity occurred at GE Aviation’s Peebles Test Operation in Ohio, and it involved 200 cycles representing normal deployments, rejected take-off deployments and aborted landings.&lt;ref name="ref 13"/&gt;

Michel Abella was appointed president of Nexcelle in August 2013. Ken Onderko took over the role in December 2016.&lt;ref name="ref 15"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7162">'''Pultrusion''' is a continuous process for manufacture of [[composite material]]s with constant cross-section.  The term is a [[portmanteau]] word, combining "pull" and "[[extrusion]]".  As opposed to extrusion, which pushes the material, pultrusion works by pulling the material.

== History ==
A very early pultrusions type patent was filed by J.H. Watson in 1944. This was followed by M.J. Meek’s filing of 1950. The first commercial pultrusions were provided by Glastic Company of Cleveland, Ohio under the patent filed in 1952 by Rodger B. White. The patent issued to W. B. Goldsworthy in 1959 helped initiate the promotion and knowledge spread within the industry.  [[W. Brandt Goldsworthy]] is widely regarded as the inventor of pultrusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/brandt-goldsworthy-composites-visionary "Brandt Goldsworthy: Composites Visionary"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to the work of Goldsworthy, who concentrated his work on unsaturated polyester resins, Ernst Kühne in Germany developed a quite similar process in 1954 based on epoxy resin.

Invention, development and the issuance of patents continue in the pultrusion field through today. A later innovation in this field has been developed and patented by Thomas GmbH + Co. Technik + Innovation KG in Germany 2008 and is described below.

== Process ==
[[Image:Pultrusion process 01.png|thumb|600px|center|Diagram of the pultrusion process.]]

1 - Continuous roll of reinforced fibers/woven fiber mat&lt;br /&gt;
2 - Tension roller&lt;br /&gt;
3 - Resin Impregnator&lt;br /&gt;
4 - Resin soaked fiber&lt;br /&gt;
5 - Die and heat source&lt;br /&gt;
6 - Pull mechanism&lt;br /&gt;
7 - Finished hardened fiber reinforced polymer

In the standard pultrusion process the reinforcement materials like [[fiber]]s or  woven or braided strands are impregnated with [[resin]], possibly followed by a separate preforming system, and pulled through a heated stationary [[die (manufacturing)|die]] where the resin undergoes [[polymerization]]. The impregnation is either done by pulling the reinforcement through a bath or by injecting the resin into an injection chamber which typically is connected to the die. Many resin types may be used in pultrusion including [[polyester]], [[polyurethane]], [[vinylester]] and [[epoxy]]. Resin provides the resistance to the environment, (i.e., the corrosion resistance, the UV resistance, the impact resistance, etc.) and the glass provides strength, in addition to safety from fire.

A surface veil can also be added to protect against erosion or “fiber bloom” and provide corrosion resistance and ultraviolet resistance. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.libertypultrusions.com/pultrusion-process/&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is not limited to [[thermosetting polymer]]s. More recently, pultrusion has been successfully used with [[Thermoplastics|thermoplastic]] matrices such as [[polybutylene terephthalate]] (PBT), [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) either by powder impregnation of the glass fiber or by surrounding it with sheet material of the thermoplastic matrix, which is then heated.

Ecological cleanness of manufactured products, in contrast to composites on thermosetting resins base, as well as practically unlimited possibilities of recycling (processing) after the resource depletion appear to be forcible arguments in favor of reinforced thermoplastics. For these reasons the industrial output and use of the given materials in highly industrialized countries have increased by 8-10% per year in recent decades. New developments (see process modifications) which enable the manufacturing not only of straight but also curved profiles are actually pushing the demand for this technology, especially in the automotive sector.

Pultrusion technology of manufacturing of fiber composites with polymer matrix appears to be energy-efficient and resource-saving.

Economic and environmental factors favor use of a thermoplastic matrix but due to the high viscosity of melts it is difficult to achieve high productivity and high quality of fiberfills impregnation with this type of matrix.

Products manufactured under this technology are widely used in the following industries:

- In the agriculture and chemical industries for manufacturing of chemically resistant to aggressive media slatted floors with enhanced strength characteristics used in the construction of livestock facilities, chemical plants, etc.;

- in the construction industry for the production of glass-fiber reinforcement, profiles, carcasses, stiffening bars for PVC-windows, etc.;

- in the aerospace industry for manufacturing of structure components of aircraft;

- in the sports and tourism industries for manufacturing of equipment exhibiting enhanced strength properties: skis, ski poles, golf course flagsticks, tent and hovel constructions, etc.;

- in electrical power engineering for manufacturing of dielectric structures, fiberglass rods used in composite insulators and as supporting structures for elements of signaling blocks, and fiberglass profiles used in manufacturing of transformers and electric motors;

- in commercial production, using grains of long-fiber molding material (LLM) as a raw material for subsequent manufacturing of structures and products with enhanced strength and chemical properties;

- in the automotive industry for the production of structural and complex parts of the vehicles with enhanced stiffness, rigidity and lightness;

- and in many other industries and plants, using mechanisms, structures and materials, which meet high standards of chemical, dielectric and strength stability.

== Process modifications ==
As the materials are pulled through a die in the standard pultrusion process the process is only suited to manufacture straight profiles.

In a recently developed modification of the process, developed and patented by Thomas GmbH + Co. Technik + Innovation KG, the die is no longer stationary but moving back and forth along the profile to be manufactured. This modified process, known as "Radius-Pultrusion" allows also to manufacture two- and three-dimensional curved profiles. It also is beneficiary for a number of tasks in the linear process especially if quite complex textile reinforcements with a low rate of distortion are needed.

[[File:Flexible pultruded profile.png|thumb|Flexible pultruded 3D-profile]]
[[File:Process Steps Radius-Pultrusion.png|Process Steps Radius-Pultrusion]]

== Equipment ==
The design of pultrusion machines varies.  Two often used types are reciprocating (hand-over-hand) and continuous (cat-track).

For the radius pultrusion process the layout of the machines has two moving stages similar to the hand over hand pulling unit, but as the process is intermittent with only one puller and the mould mounted on the stage of other one. Whether the stages are moving linear or circular depends on the type of profiles to be manufactured. The minimum radius for a linear machine with rotating stages is approx. 2 m. For smaller radii a circular movement of the mould and gripper stage is necessary.

'''Rafael Carrión Sr.''' (January 3, 1891 – March 26, 1964), the patriarch of one of Puerto Rico's financial dynasties, was one of the founding fathers&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PCH/is_3_6/ai_n15378647/  A dynasty of leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Puerto Rico Off the Beaten Path, 5th"; By Tina Cohen; pg.5; Publisher: GPP Travel; 5th edition (October 1, 2006); {{ISBN|0-7627-4211-9}}; {{ISBN|978-0-7627-4211-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]], the largest bank in [[Puerto Rico]] and the largest Hispanic bank in the United States.&lt;ref name="LHB"&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/97/sp019-97.html Mayor Announces Agreement by Largest Hispanic Bank in United States to Remain in New York City]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Carrión (birth name: Rafael Carrión  Pacheco) came from a humble family, His father was José Dolores Carrión from the town of [[Manati]] and his mother was Francisca Pacheco from the town of [[Naguabo, Puerto Rico|Naguabo]]. His family lived in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] where Carrión, who was one of five siblings, was born. The family sustained themselves economically by selling water in containers. In 1896, Carrión's mother died of typhoid fever and the family moved to the City of [[Caguas]].&lt;ref name="TF"&gt;"Tradition into the Future: The First Century of the Banco Popular De Puerto Rico 1893-1993"; By: Guillermo A. Baralt; Publisher Banco Popular de Puerto Rico; 1993; pages 66-68; ASIN: B002O9DJBW&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P"&gt;"Potpourri"; By: Gloria Nadal; Publisher: Bibliograficas; ASIN: B00236H7IC&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, his father died and Carrión went to live with his older half-brother José B. Carrión Santiago in the City of [[Arecibo]]. His brother was a businessman who kept the accounting records of many of the local businesses. Carrión was then able to attend the Americanized public school system which taught in [[English language|English]] and where he would learn the language. In 1902, Carrión moved to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and lived with his sister. He quit school in the eighth grade and worked for various firms until he finally found a job at Lomba &amp; Cia, an importer of goods from the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. When the owners of the firm became aware of Carrión's English-language proficiency, they put him charge of transactions made in that language.&lt;ref name="TF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P"/&gt;

Carrión quit his job and went to New York City where he found a job with E.G. Perez &amp; Cia. In 1909, his former employer from Lomba &amp; Cia wrote to him and recommended that he study finances because they were planning in opening a branch in that city.&lt;ref name="TF"/&gt; After a short stay in New York, Carrión returned to Puerto Rico and went to work for his brother once more, this time as a salesperson. His brother's business, located in San Juan, represented the [[Baldwin Locomotive Company]] and was successful. Unfortunately his brother fell ill, died within one year, and Carrión took charge of the business. The Baldwin Company helped Carrión by enrolling him in commercial courses, and by making him their representative in the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="P"/&gt;

In 1911, he married Ernestina Ruiz with whom he fathered eight children.

Over the years Carrión invested in sugar, real estate and other industries. As a result, he had dealings with the American Colonial Bank in Puerto Rico, who invited Carrión to purchase some of its stock. Carrión became interested in banking and soon thought about purchasing a local bank.&lt;ref name="P"/&gt;

==Beginning of the Carrión dynasty==
''Banco Popular de Puerto Rico'' can trace its roots to 1893, when Puerto Rico was still a [[Spanish colony]]. That year, fifty-two stockholders provided the initial capital to establish the ''Sociedad Anonima de Economias y Prestamos'' ( The Anonymous Savings &amp; Loan Society), a savings bank for the poor.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Popular-Inc-Company-History.html Company History]&lt;/ref&gt; However the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, and the island was annexed by the U.S. under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] which was ratified on December 10, 1898. Almost immediately, the United States began the "[[Americanization]]" process of Puerto Rico. The U.S. occupation brought about a total change in Puerto Rico's economic and political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1913, the United States Congress passed the [[Federal Reserve Act]] which created The Federal Reserve System. All national banks were required to join the system and Congress created Federal Reserve notes to provide the nation with an elastic supply of [[currency]]. The notes were to be issued to Federal Reserve Banks for subsequent transmittal to banking institutions in accordance with the needs of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Grant-Eisenhower/Woodrow-Wilson-The-new-freedom-at-home.html Woodrow Wolson]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the new rules and regulations, the ''Sociedad Anonima de Economias y Prestamos'' ceased operations. In 1923 Carrión and his older brother, together with some of the former members of the ''Sociedad Anonima,'' organized and founded the ''Banco Popular de Puerto Rico,'' a commercial bank (rather than a savings bank, in which Carrión served as Executive Vice President.

Four years later in 1927, Carrión became the majority stockholder of the bank, its president, and CEO.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

==Banco Popular de Puerto Rico==
[[File:Art Deco Banco Popular.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Art Deco "BPPR" Headquarters Building]]
Carrión presided and led the bank until 1956. Under his leadership the bank established its first physical branch in 1934. In its first year the bank provided personal loans ''without'' requiring collateral. This made the bank enormously popular (in accordance with its name) and, by 1954, the bank had 20 branches in different parts of the island. This represented a growth rate of one new ''Banco Popular'' branch for every year of its existence, between 1934 and 1954. Given the challenges of the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], and the [[Korean War]], this success and growth rate was astounding.

During the Great Depression, the bank survived while others failed. In 1930, ''Banco Popular'' purchased the oldest and most respected banking institution on the island,  the ''Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico''. With a total of $8.82 million in deposits in 1937, ''Banco Popular'' became the largest bank in Puerto Rico. In 1938, it became the first bank in Puerto Rico to offer FHA mortgage loans. In 1939, Carrión completed the construction of an Art Deco headquarters for the bank, on Tetuán Street in [[Old San Juan]].&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

Carrión was a stock holder in the [[Continental Bank of New York]] and when that institution merged with [[Chemical Bank|Chemical Bank &amp; Trust Co.]] in 1948, he became a member of Chemical's Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="TF"/&gt; He retired in 1956 and the leadership positions were occupied by his sons Rafael Jr. and Joe Carrión. In 1990, his grandson (son of Rafael Jr.) [[Richard Carrión]] was named Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Bank, Popular North America, Inc. and Subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n34/ProfileCarrion-en.html Puerto Rico Herald] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605173632/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol4n34/ProfileCarrion-en.html |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Bancopopularheadquarters.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Popular, Inc. headquarters]]
During his lifetime, Carrión was able to witness the growth of the bank which he co-founded from a small local bank with one branch in 1934, to the largest bank in Puerto Rico with two additional branches in New York City - one in the [[Bronx]] and another in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt;

Rafael Carrión Pacheco, died on March 26, 1964, in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Since his death, ''Banco Popular de Puerto Rico'' has grown into a multinational banking and financial institution with 302 bank branches and 382 non-bank offices. It is the 35th largest bank holding company in the United States, and the largest Hispanic-owned bank in the United States.&lt;ref name="LHB"/&gt; Of the company's 302 banking branches, 199 are in Puerto Rico, 95 in the continental United States, and 8 in the [[Virgin Islands]].

In honor of Carrión, the plaza surrounding the restored 1936 ''Banco Popular''  building in Old San Juan was named the ''Plazoleta Rafael Carrión Pacheco.'' On the third floor of the building, the "Rafael Carrión Pacheco Exhibition Hall" is maintained, with myriad exhibits of great and enduring interest throughout Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bancopopular.com/vi/about/community/vi-abu-com-exh-en.jsp Rafael Carrión Pacheco]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronald Dare Gillespie''' (14 April 1890 – 8 April 1981) was a [[Scottish Canadian]] businessman, [[British Army]] officer and politician in Hong Kong. He was member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] from 1946 to 1948.

==Biography==
Ronald Dare Gillespie was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada in April 1890 and was educated at [[Loretto School]], [[Edinburgh]] He received his training in Edinburgh but returned to British Columbia to practise engineering and surveying. He served as Captain in the [[Gordon Highlanders]] during the [[First World War]] and was taken [[prisoner of war]] at [[La Bassee]] in January 1915 and was later exchanged.

After the war, he joined the [[Imperial Chemical Industries]], a British chemicals company which he later became the Chairman, and served in several cities in China. He was interned in Hong Kong by the Japanese during the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] and was released in exchange for Japanese held by Canada in 1943. Gillespie then served in the [[Combined Raw Materials Board#Mission|British Raw Materials Mission]] in Washington until the war ended.&lt;ref name="Ure"&gt;{{cite book|title=Governors, Politics and the Colonial Office: Public Policy in Hong Kong, 1918-58|first=Gavin|last=Ure|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2012|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gillespie returned to Hong Kong in October 1945 and became the Chairman of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]]. In April 1946, he was nominated as the Chamber of Commerce's representative in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and served until 1948.&lt;ref name="Ure"/&gt;

During his service in the Legislative Council, he was appointed member of the eleven-member Taxation Committee in 1946 which chaired by the [[Financial Secretary (Hong Kong)|Financial Secretary]] [[Charles Geoffrey Shield Follows|C. G. S. Follows]] to discuss the controversial issue of introducing new tax. Members included [[Arthur Morse]], chief manager and chairman of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] and unofficial member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] and another unofficial member of the Legislative Council, [[Man-kam Lo]]. Gillespie believed that an income tax was the best form of taxation "provided it was equitably collected." The government eventually introduced the Inland Revenue as a result. Although Gillespie supported the bill, he was concerned the government might have no qualified staff to collect tax.

Ronald Dare Gillespie was son of George Gillespie and Florence Adelaide Hebden. He married Kathleen Little. He died at the Old House, [[Milford-on-Sea]], near [[Lymington]], [[Hampshire]] on 8 April 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=48615 |page=6999| date=19 May 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A row of heated drums dry out the paper, which enters the machine as wet pulp.&lt;br&gt;Large rolls are usually sliced into a number of thin rolls, which can feed continuous presses (e.g. newspapers) or be cut into separate sheets.]]
'''Sealy Fourdrinier''' (9 October 1773–1847) was an English paper-making entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Sealy_Fourdrinier|title=Sealy Fourdrinier|publisher= Grace's Guide|accessdate= 9 November 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

He was born the son of paper maker and stationer Henry Fourdrinier and grandson of the engraver [[Paul Fourdrinier]] (1698-1758), who were of Huguenot descent. His brother was [[Henry Fourdrinier]], his later partner in business.

Around the end of the 18th century Sealy and his brother were approached by John Gamble and Leger Didot, who were seeking financial support to develop an automatic paper making machine developed in Paris by [[Louis-Nicolas Robert]], an employee of Didot. In 1801–02 the Fourdriniers entrusted engineer [[Bryan Donkin]] (then working with [[John Hall (engineer)|John Hall]])&lt;ref name="JHOD"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Hall (of Dartford)|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/John_Hall_(of_Dartford)|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the development of Robert’s model into a prototype continuous paper-making machine. The world's first production machine was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]] in [[Apsley, Hertfordshire]] in 1803 and a second, much improved and larger machine installed the following year. By 1810 eighteen machines had been installed at various mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frogmoremill.com/explore-2/history/the-fourdriniers/|title=The Fourdriniers and the world’s first paper-making machine|publisher=Frogmore Paper Mill|accessdate= 9 November 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of developing and improving the machines was of the order of £60,000 and although the inventions were covered by various patents taken out by the Fourdrinier brothers, the costs of manufacture, installation and maintenance and the difficulty of collecting royalties forced the Sealy brothers to declare themselves bankrupt in 1810.

The machines themselves, known as [[Fourdrinier machine]]s, were very successful and continued to be made in considerable numbers by Donkins. In 1837 a Parliamentary Select Committee acknowledged the importance of the Fourdriniers’ contribution to the paper industry and voted them £7000 compensation.

Sealy Fourdrinier died at Southwark in 1847. He had married Harriet Pownall at St Mary Wolnoth, London and had children James Sealy (1805-1870), Harriet (1806-1863), and Louisa Elizabeth (1813-1892). Louisa Elizabeth married the clergyman [[John Bathurst Deane]] &lt;ref&gt;"Marriages" in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' dated July 1834, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; and became the mother of thirteen children, including [[Mary Bathurst Deane]]. Another of her daughters, Eleanor Deane (1861–1941), married Henry Ernest Wodehouse and was the mother of the writer [[P. G. Wodehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burke's Peerage]]'', volume 2 (2003), page 2,164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Baťa was born in the Czech city of [[Prague]], in what is now the [[Czech Republic]], the son of Czech industrialist [[Tomáš Baťa]]. As a boy he apprenticed under his father, Tomáš Sr., who began the T. &amp; A. Bata Shoe company in 1894 in [[Zlín]], Czechoslovakia. His father, however, was killed in a plane crash when Tomáš was only 17, in 1932. Baťa's original surname is Batia.
One of the least known reasons for his success was his vision to introduce new technologies to his company, taking the production to massive levels worldwide. Another factor was [[World War I]], which ended the market that the company had under the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. So between the 1920s and 1940s Bata installed factories in Asia, South America and Africa (which he foresaw as virgin market), thus becoming the largest shoemaker in the world. 
In the 1960s and 1970s the Bata white canvas (sneaker/running shoe) was iconic in the third world, representing between 60% and 80% of the shoe production in the countries where it operated. In Asia and South America the company focused on everyday affordable shoe production, leaving for Europe the high-quality, high-price shoes.

In the mid 1930s, in the throes of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], the Bata Shoe company was faced with a serious dilemma: [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] needed boots for his army. Czechoslovakians were faced with ubiquitous layoffs and catastrophic unemployment. Baťa decided to be pragmatic to protect his livelihood and that of his employees. He rationalized that if he did not provide the army boots, some other company would, and his employees would suffer. He successfully pursued the contract, which directly assisted [[Italian Fascism|fascism]] but also saved the company.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel John, A Life of Learning and Other Pleasures, Wintergreen Studio Press, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomáš Baťa was the equivalent of [[Henry Ford|Ford]] in breakthrough technology for his time. The company's warehouse in the then Czechoslovakia was the first automated installation in Europe (designed by Peter Behrens&amp;nbsp;– Architect) and in his company headquarters in Zlín, the central shaft of the building was an elevator with its personal office that could move from one floor to another. Like Ford, he established a repetitive mechanical system of production, which he called "work factor". But unlike Ford, Tomáš Baťa had a social concern for his employees, paying fair wages and contributing to their welfare with social programs and sports facilities sponsored and financially supported by the company.

Baťa attended school in Czechoslovakia, England and Switzerland. Anticipating the [[Second World War]], he, together with over 100 families from Czechoslovakia, moved to Canada in 1939 to develop the Bata Shoe Company of Canada, including a shoe factory and engineering plant, centred in a town that still bears his name, [[Batawa|Batawa, Ontario]]. Another legacy is [[Batanagar]] in [[Kolkata]] (Calcutta) India, which originally housed the shoe factory and the clerical employees, and today is a booming [[condominium]] development maintaining the name.

Baťa successfully established and ran the new Canadian operations and during the war years, he sought to maintain the necessary coordination with as many of the overseas Bata operations as was possible. During this period the Canadian engineering plant manufactured strategic components for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and Baťa worked together with the government in exile of President [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] and other democratic powers. With the end of the war the Bata company in Czechoslovak territory was nationalized and the communists began to take control and to eliminate anything even remotely reminding people of Baťa's system.

In 1945 it was clear that Zlín was lost and could no longer act as headquarters. Baťa held a meeting in [[East Tilbury]] near [[London]], and the decision was taken that Bata Development Limited in England would become the service headquarters of the Bata Shoe Organization. In 1946 Bata operated 38 factories and 2,168 company shops; they produced 34 million pairs of shoes and employed 34,000 people. In 1948, however, Czechoslovakia was fully seized by communist powers, and Bata enterprises in Poland, East Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria were lost.

The Bata Shoe Organization then expanded around the world. Between 1946 and 1960, 25 new factories were built and 1,700 company shops opened. In 1962, the Organization had production and sales activities in 79 countries&amp;nbsp;– there were 66 factories and 4,100 company shops. Yearly output was 175 million pairs of shoes and the organization employed 80,000 people. Bata moved the headquarters of the organization to [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada in 1964, and in 1965 an ultramodern building, the [[Bata International Centre]] was opened. By 1975 the organization included 98 operating companies in 89 countries, employing 90,000 people; in the 90 factories, 250 million pairs of shoes were produced annually and the company operated over 5,000 shops. The Bata Shoe Organization, whose guiding principle was "Our customer&amp;nbsp;– Our Master" was the largest of its kind in the world. Baťa led the Organization until 1984 when his son Thomas George Bata became the CEO.

In December 1989, after the Communist government fell in Czechoslovakia, Baťa made a triumphant return to his hometown. [[Václav Havel]], the Czech dissident leader and playwright turned president, asked Baťa to return. Baťa and his wife [[Sonja Baťa|Sonja]] were greeted warmly in the main square in Zlín by thousands of cheering people. Baťa immediately initiated plans for the return of the organization to the place where it all started. By 2008, Bata's Czech subsidiary operated 93 shops in the Czech Republic, 25 in Slovakia and 43 in Poland.

By 2000, the Bata company was struggling in Canada. In 2000, the original Batawa factory was closed. In 2001, the Bata stores in Canada were closed and the Bata Organization relocated its headquarters to Switzerland. Baťa remained in Toronto with his wife Sonja. Despite his age, Baťa continued to take an active role in the business. He continued to travel extensively and to visit many of the Bata operations around the world. He also maintained his extensive contacts with world political and business leaders.

Baťa died on September 1, 2008 at [[Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre]] in Toronto. A cause of death was not announced. He was survived by his wife Sonja (''née'' Wettstein) whom he had married in 1946, their son and three daughters.&lt;ref name="ctv-bio"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Baťa was invested as a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Canadian honour|Type=orc|ID=85|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's highest civilian award and received the [[Order of T.G. Masaryk]] in the Czech Republic. He was particularly proud of his association with the [[Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]]. He joined the regiment during the Second World War and served as a captain in the [[Canadian Reserve Army]] and as honorary colonel from 1999 to 2007. He was frequently seen in the field visiting with its troops. In 2007 he received the [[First Magazine Limited|FIRST]] Award for Responsible Capitalism, the lifetime Achievement Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =The FIRST International Award for Responsible Capitalism - Lifetime Achievement Medal|url=http://www.firstmagazine.com/Awards/Year.aspx?Year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baťa worked with numerous charitable organizations. He was chairman of the Bata Shoe Foundation. His dedication to [[Junior Achievement International]], [[Trent University]] and [[York University]] in Canada and the [[Tomáš Baťa University]] in the Czech Republic reflected his interest in the education of young people.

Baťa participated in several leading business organizations. In Canada, he was a former director of [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] and [[IBM]] Canada. He was a founding member of the [[Young Presidents Organization]], chairman of the Commission on Multinational Enterprises of the [[International Chamber of Commerce]], chairman of the [[Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD]] and founding member of the Canada India Business Council.

'''William James Chrystal''' (20 May 1854 – 21 April 1921) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] chemist and partner in his family’s chemicals business [[Shawfield#J &amp; J White Chemicals|J &amp; J White Chemicals]] based in [[Rutherglen]].

==Ancestors==
Chrystal was born in [[Glasgow]], son of insurance broker Robert Chrystal and grandson of Dr. William Chrystal (1776–1830), rector of [[Glasgow Grammar School]] who died in a boating accident and is remembered with a bust in [[Glasgow Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mackintosh-architecture.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/browse/display/?sysnum=s024 | title = Mackintosh Architecture – Memorial to Dr Chrystal in Glasgow Cathedral}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Jean was the daughter of the founder of  ''J &amp; J White Chemicals'', John White, and her brothers John and [[James White (1812-1884)|James]] were also partners from 1840 and 1851 respectively until their deaths in the 1880s.

==Education and career==
[[File: Loch Lomond Youth Hostel - geograph.org.uk - 422934.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Auchendennan House in 2007]]
Chrystal was educated at [[The Glasgow Academy]] and the [[University of Glasgow]].  He was a fellow of the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]] and the [[Chemical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.glasgowwestaddress.co.uk/1909_Glasgow_Men/Chrystal_William_James.htm | title = Index Of Glasgow Men 1909 – William Chrystal}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working in a laboratory in the 1870s he joined ''J &amp; J White Chemicals'' as an expert chemist, and after his uncle John died in 1881 he became the technical partner in the business. By this time Chrystal’s cousin [[John White, 1st Baron Overtoun|John Campbell White]], the son of his other uncle James, was also a partner. After the death of James White in 1884 another cousin, Hill Hamilton Barrett, became the commercial partner. At this time the Shawfield works, mainly producing [[bichromate of potash]], were the largest of their kind in the world and employed over 500 men. Chrystal was credited with improving the manufacturing processes for the products.

==Personal interests==
[[File:Plaque on King Street (geograph 3407940).jpg|thumb|200px|Plaque in Rutherglen commending Chrystal's contributions relating to the town's church]]
In 1898 he bought and reconstructed '''Auchendennan House''' ([[Arden, Argyll]])
on [[Loch Lomond]]. The building was later owned for some years by the [[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]]. In 1899 he purchased buildings in central Rutherglen to allow them to be demolished to aid the building of a new church – this is commemorated on a plaque outside the present Rutherglen Old Parish Church on Main Street.

Chrystal was a member of [[Glasgow Philosophical Society]], and was a keen yachter and a member of the [[Royal Clyde Yacht Club]].

He died at Auchendennan was buried at the family tomb in [[Glasgow Necropolis]].

A '''workflow''' consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the [[System|systematic]] organization of [[resource]]s into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information.&lt;ref name="ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftb.ca.gov/aboutFTB/Projects/ITSP/BPM_Glossary.pdf|date=27 October 2009|title=Business Process Management Center of Excellence Glossary|author=webmaster@ftb.ca.gov|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., ISO 12052:2006, [http://www.iso.org ISO.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.

Workflows may be viewed as one fundamental building block to be combined with other parts of an organization's structure such as information technology, [[team]]s, [[project]]s and [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="nocsmart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nocsmart.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=135 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907014418/http://nocsmart.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=135 |archivedate=2013-09-07 |dead-url=yes |title=Work Flow Automation |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=31 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
The development of the concept of workflow occurred above a series of loosely defined, overlapping eras.

=== Beginnings in manufacturing ===
The modern history of workflows can be traced to [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]]&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Gantt]], although the term "workflow" was not in usage as such during their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workflow%2Cwork+flow%2C+work-flow&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cworkflow%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwork%20flow%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwork%20-%20flow%3B%2Cc0 Ngram Viewer ]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest usages of the term "work flow" was in a railway engineering journal from 1921.&lt;ref name="SaundersBlundstone1921"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence Saunders|author2=S. R. Blundstone|title=The Railway Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nBbnAAAAMAAJ|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1948 book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' introduced the emerging concepts to the context of family life.

=== Maturation and growth ===
The invention of the [[typewriter]] and the [[copier]] helped spread the study of the rational organization of labor from the manufacturing shop floor to the office. Filing systems and other sophisticated systems for managing physical [[information]] flows evolved. Several events likely contributed to the development of formalized information workflows. First, the field of optimization theory matured and developed [[mathematical optimization]] techniques. For example, Soviet mathematician and economist [[Leonid Kantorovich]] developed the seeds of [[linear programming]] in 1939 through efforts to solve a plywood manufacturer's production optimization issues.&lt;ref name="KatseneliboigenTheSoviet90"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3bYoKUYXaYC&amp;pg=PA410 |chapter=Chapter 17: Nobel and Lenin Prize Laureate L.V.

=== Quality era ===
In the post-war era, the work of [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Joseph M. Juran]] led to a focus on quality, initially in Japanese companies, and from the 1980s on a more global level, giving rise to a variety of movements ranging from [[total quality management]] to [[Six Sigma]], then to more qualitative notions of [[business process re-engineering]].&lt;ref name="HammerChampy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Hammer|author2=James Champy|title=Reengineering the Corporation: Manifesto for Business Revolution, A|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjvGTXgFl6cC|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-180864-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of the quality movement, workflows, in [[knowledge economy]] sectors&lt;ref&gt;Pharma/biotech workflows [http://www.integrify.com/workflow-pharmaceuticals-biotech "Pharma-specific workflows"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Media workflows [http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/casestudies.html#Media-Specific "Media-specific workflows"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in manufacturing, became the subject of further scrutiny and optimization efforts. Acknowledgement of the dynamic and changing nature of the demands on workflows came in the form of recognition of the phenomena associated with critical paths and moving bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;Goldratt, Eliyahu M.[https://www.toc-goldratt.com/content/My-Saga-to-Improve-Production "My saga to improve production."

== Workflow management system ==
{{main|Workflow management system}}

A [[workflow management system]] (WfMS) is a software system for setting up, performing, and monitoring of a defined sequence of processes and tasks, with the broad goals of increasing productivity, reducing costs, becoming more agile, and improving information exchange within an organization.&lt;ref name="ElmagarmidWorkflow12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgSrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Chapter 1: Workflow Management: State of the Art Versus State of the Products |title=Workflow Management Systems and Interoperability |author=Elmagarmid, A.; Di, W. |editor=Dogac, A.; Kalinichenko, L.; Özsu, T.; Sheth, A. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |pages=1–17 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems may be process-centric or data-centric, and they may represent the workflow as graphical maps. The workflow management system may also include an extensible interface so that external software applications can be integrated and provide support for wide area workflows that provide faster response times and improved productivity.&lt;ref name="ElmagarmidWorkflow12" /&gt;

== Related concepts ==
The concept of workflow is closely related to several fields in [[operations research]] and other areas that study the nature of work, either quantitatively or qualitatively, such as [[artificial intelligence]] (in particular, the sub-discipline of AI planning) and [[ethnography]]. The term "workflow" is more commonly used in particular industries, such as in printing or professional domains such as [[Clinical laboratory|clinical laboratories]], where it may have particular specialized meanings.

# '''Processes''': A process is a more general notion than workflow and can apply to, for example, physical or biological processes, whereas a workflow is typically a process or collection of processes described in the context of work, such as all processes occurring in a machine shop.
# '''Planning and [[Schedule (project management)|scheduling]]''': A plan is a description of the logically necessary, partially ordered set of activities required to accomplish a specific goal given certain starting conditions. A plan, when augmented with a schedule and [[resource allocation]] calculations, completely defines a particular ''instance'' of systematic processing in pursuit of a goal. A workflow may be viewed as an often optimal or near-optimal realization of the mechanisms required to execute the same plan repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Artem M. Chirkin, Sergey V. Kovalchuk | title = Towards Better Workflow Execution Time Estimation | journal = IERI Procedia | volume = 10 | pages = 216–223 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ieri.2014.09.080 | doi = 10.1016/j.ieri.2014.09.080}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Flow control (data)|Flow control]]''': This is a control concept applied to workflows, to distinguish from static control of buffers of material or orders, to mean a more dynamic control of flow speed and flow volumes in motion and in process. Such orientation to dynamic aspects is the basic foundation to prepare for more advanced job shop controls, such as [[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] or just-in-sequence.
# '''In-transit visibility''': This monitoring concept applies to transported material as well as to work in process or work in progress, i.e., workflows.

== Examples ==
[[File:Business Process Modelling Workflow Schematic.svg|thumb|Business Process Modelling]]
The following examples illustrate the variety of workflows seen in various contexts:

# In machine shops, particularly [[job shop]]s and flow shops, the flow of a part through the various processing stations is a workflow.
# Insurance claims processing is an example of an information-intensive, document-driven workflow.&lt;ref name="HaveyEssential05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtabAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255 |chapter=Chapter 10: Example: Human Workflow in Insurance Claims Processing |title=Essential Business Process Modeling |author=Havey, M. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |year=2005 |page=255–284 |isbn=9780596008437 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Wikipedia editing can be modeled as a stochastic workflow.
# The [[Getting Things Done]] system is a model of personal workflow management for information workers.
# In software development, support and other industries, the concept of ''[[follow-the-sun]]'' describes a process of passing unfinished work across time zones.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/services/hardware/info/hw_globalsupportctr_59829873EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# In traditional offset and digital printing, the concept of workflow represents the process, people, and usually software technology (RIPs raster image processors or DFE digital front end) controllers that play a part in pre/post processing of print-related files, e.g., PDF pre-flight checking to make certain that fonts are embedded or that the imaging output to plate or digital press will be able to render the document intent properly for the image-output capabilities of the press that will print the final image.
# In scientific experiments, the overall process (tasks and data flow) can be described as a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). This DAG is referred to as a workflow, e.g., Brain Imaging workflows.&lt;ref&gt;Brain Image Registration Analysis Workflow for fMRI Studies on Global Grids, [http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/AINA.2009.13 Computer.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A grid workflow environment for brain imaging analysis on distributed systems, [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpe.1461 Wiley.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
# In healthcare data analysis, a workflow can be used to represent a sequence of steps which compose a complex data analysis (data-search and data-manipulation steps).&lt;ref name=hf2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Rasmussen | first2 = L.

== Features and phenomenology ==
# Modeling:  Workflow problems can be modeled and analyzed using [[graph theory|graph]]-based formalisms like [[Petri net]]s.
# Measurement: Many of the concepts used to measure scheduling systems in [[operations research]] are useful for measuring general workflows. These include throughput, processing time, and other regular metrics.
# Specialized connotations: The term "workflow" has specialized connotations in information technology, [[document management]], and [[Document imaging|imaging]]. Since 1993, one trade consortium specifically focused on workflow management and the interoperability of workflow management systems, the [[Workflow Management Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wfmc.org/index.php/about-us |title=Introduction to the Workflow Management Coalition |publisher=Workflow Management Coalition |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Scientific workflow system]]s: Have found wide acceptance in the fields of [[bioinformatics]] and [[cheminformatics]] in the early 2000s, where they successfully meet the need for multiple interconnected tools that handle multiple data formats and large data quantities. Also, the paradigm of scientific workflows resembles the well-established tradition of [[Perl]] programming in life science research organizations, making this adoption a natural step towards more structured infrastructure setup.
# Human-machine interaction: Several conceptualizations of mixed-initiative workflows have been studied, particularly in the military, where automated agents play roles just as humans do. For innovative, adaptive, and collaborative human work, the techniques of [[human interaction management]] are required.
# Workflow analysis: Workflow systems allow users to develop executable processes with no familiarity with formal programming concepts. Automated workflow analysis techniques can help users analyze the properties of user workflows to conduct verification of certain properties before executing them, e.g., analyzing flow control or data flow. Examples of tools based on formal analysis frameworks have been developed and used for the analysis of scientific workflows and can be extended to the analysis of other types of workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curcin | first1 = V. | last2 = Ghanem | first2 = M. | last3 = Guo | first3 = Y. | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2010.0157 | title = The design and implementation of a workflow analysis tool | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 368 | issue = 1926 | pages = 4193 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2010RSPTA.368.4193C | url = https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/60972131/4193.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workflow improvement theories ==
Several workflow improvement theories have been proposed and implemented in the modern workplace. These include:

# [[Six Sigma]]
# [[Total Quality Management]]
# [[Business Process Reengineering]]
# [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] systems
# [[Theory of Constraints]]

Evaluation of resources, both physical and human, is essential to evaluate hand-off points and potential to create smoother transitions between tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating A Performance Based Culture In Your Workplace|last=Alvord|first=Brice|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=1105576078|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
A workflow can usually be described using formal or informal flow diagramming techniques, showing directed flows between processing steps. Single processing steps or components of a workflow can basically be defined by three parameters:
#input description: the information, material and energy required to complete the step
#transformation rules: [[algorithm]]s which may be carried out by people or machines, or both
#output description: the information, material, and energy produced by the step and provided as input to downstream steps

Components can only be plugged together if the output of one previous (set of) component(s) is equal to the mandatory input requirements of the following component(s). Thus, the essential description of a component actually comprises only input and output that are described fully in terms of [[data type]]s and their meaning ([[semantics]]). The algorithms' or rules' descriptions need only be included when there are several alternative ways to transform one type of input into one type of output – possibly with different accuracy, speed, etc.

When the components are non-local services that are invoked remotely via a computer network, such as [[Web service]]s, additional descriptors (such as [[Quality of service|QoS]] and [[availability]]) also must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. Kyriazis| title = An innovative workflow mapping mechanism for Grids in the frame of Quality of Service | journal = Future Generation Computer Systems | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 498–511 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = June 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009 | doi = 10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Many software systems exist to support workflows in particular domains. Such systems manage tasks such as automatic routing, partially automated processing, and integration between different functional software applications and hardware systems that contribute to the value-addition process underlying the workflow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5310">'''Wrecking''' ({{lang-ru|вредительство}} or ''vreditel'stvo'', lit. "inflicting damage", "harming"), was a crime specified in the criminal code of the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] era. It is often translated as "[[sabotage]]"; however, "wrecking", "diversionist acts", and "counter-revolutionary sabotage" were distinct sub-articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]] (58-7, 58-9, and 58-14 respectively), and the meaning of "wrecking" is closer to "undermining".

These three categories were distinguished in the following way:

*''Diversions'' were acts of immediate infliction of physical damage on state and cooperative property.
*''Wrecking'' was deliberate acts aimed against normal functioning of state and cooperative organisations, such as giving deliberately wrong commands.
*''Sabotage'' was non-execution, or careless execution, of one's duties.

As applied in practice, "wrecking" and "sabotage" referred to any action which negatively affected the economy, including failing to meet unrealistic economic targets, allegedly causing poor morale among subordinates (e.g. by complaining about conditions of work), lack of effort, or other incompetence. Thus, it referred to economic or industrial sabotage in the very broadest sense. The definition of sabotage was interpreted [[Dialectics|dialectically]] and indirectly, so any form of non-compliance with Party directives could have been considered a 'sabotage'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cogs in the Wheel: The Formation of Soviet Man|last = Heller|first = Mikhail|publisher = Alfred A.

=="Wrecking" in the Soviet Census of 1937==
One of the [[show trial]]s involving charges of "wrecking" was that of official coordinators of the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 Soviet Census]]. The census was organised with great expectations from the government that it would confirm the superiority of the Soviet economic and social model, with Stalin publicly declaring in 1934 that the Soviet Union was gaining at least 3 million citizens per year. The census questions and procedure were prepared for several years by a commission of professional statisticians and demographers, but then significantly changed by Stalin and other members of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] to better match their political goals &amp;ndash; the collection phase of the census was shortened and the procedures simplified. The results obtained from the census were at least 8 million people short of the expected outcome and immediately classified. The formal organizers were accused of "wrecking" and sent to camps, and the shortage was officially presented as caused by their negligence and intentional sabotage. The actual measurement error, as estimated by statisticians in the 1990s, did not exceed 1.5% and such a disappointing result was caused by the huge loss of life that occurred during [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]], the [[Soviet famine of 1932-1933|Famine of 1932&amp;ndash;1933]], including in the Ukraine ([[Holodomor]]), and the mortality rates in the [[Gulag]].&lt;ref name=Volkov&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/knigi/polka/gold_fund08.html A.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Volkov ''Census of 1937 Facts and Fictions''] originally published in Перепись населения СССР 1937 года.
