Used in [[perfumery]] and [[aromatherapy]], '''absolutes''' are similar to [[essential oil]]s. They are concentrated, highly [[aroma compound|aromatic]], oily mixtures extracted from plants. Whereas essential oils are produced by [[distillation]], [[boiling]] or [[Expeller pressing|pressing]], absolutes are produced through [[solvent extraction]], or more traditionally, through [[enfleurage]].

== Production ==
First, plant material is extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent, such as [[hexane]], to yield a [[Concrete (perfumery)|concrete]]. The concrete is then extracted with [[ethanol]]. The ethanol extract is cooled (e.g., to -15 °C) to solidify waxes, and [[cold filtration|cold filtered]] to yield a liquid extract. When the ethanol evaporates, an oil &amp;mdash; the absolute &amp;mdash; is left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=Arza Seidel et al. | author=K. Hüsnü Can Başer et al. | chapter=Essential Oils | title=Kirk-Othmer Chemical Technology of Cosmetics | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-118-40692-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the absolute was obtained by [[enfleurage]], where the resulting [[pommade]] was extracted with ethanol to yield the absolute.

==Character and use==
Some raw materials are either too delicate or too inert to be steam-distilled and can only yield their aroma through solvent extraction. Examples of these are [[jasmine]] and [[beeswax]]. Absolutes in demand include [[rose]], [[jasmine]], [[tuberose]], [[Narcissus jonquilla|jonquil]], [[ylang-ylang]], [[mimosa]], [[boronia]], [[lavender]], [[lavandin]], [[geranium]], [[clary sage]], [[Violet (flower)|violet]], [[oak moss]], [[tonka bean]].

[[Rose oil]], [[jasmine]] absolute, [[tuberose]] absolute, [[orris root]] oil, [[ambrette seeds]] oil, [[angelica root]] oil, and [[orange flower oil]] are valuable and expensive fragrance and flavor ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Karl-Georg Fahlbusch | contribution=Flavors and Fragrances | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | page=83|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual solvents may remain in the absolutes. Therefore, some absolutes are considered undesirable for [[aromatherapy]].{{Fact|date=May 2010}}

The '''Alte Nahebrücke''' (English: ''Old Nahe Bridge'') is a medieval stone [[arch bridge]] in [[Bad Kreuznach]], in western [[Germany]], dating from around 1300, that originally spanned the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe river]] and a neighbouring canal called the ''Mühlenteich'' (English: ''mill pond''). Only the section spanning the canal remains intact. With four houses on its piers, it is one of the few remaining bridges in the world that has buildings on it.&lt;ref name=romger&gt;[https://www.romantic-germany.info/infrastructure/infrastruktur/Brueckenhaeuser-Alte-Nahebruecke-Neustadt_Bad/deskline-details.html Brückenhäuser, Alte Nahebrücke, Neustadt | Bad Kreuznach] on [https://www.romantic-germany.info www.romantic-germany.info] (in English). Retrieved 14 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Kreuznach Brueckenhaeuser 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Alte Nahebrücke, c. 1900]]
The stone Alte Nahebrücke was built around 1300 by [[Simon II, Count of Sponheim-Kreuznach]], who ruled the town, to replace a wooden bridge which connected settlements on either side of the Nahe river. It provided an important connection on the road from to [[Mainz]] to [[Trier]], and it formed part of the town fortifications. Towers on the bridge, one of which was for a period used as a prison, were destroyed by French troops in the late 17th century.&lt;ref name=zaschel&gt;Zaschel, Anne (Universität Koblenz-Landau) (2014) [https://www.kuladig.de/Objektansicht/O-102628-20140906-7 Brückenhäuser auf der Alten Nahebrücke in Bad Kreuznach] on [https://www.kuladig.de/ www.kuladig.de]. Retrieved 17 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  The first recorded mention of the stone bridge was in 1332, when the Pauluskirche (English: ''St Paul's Church''), which stands on Wörthinsel, the island between the canal and the river, was consecrated.&lt;ref name=vogt&gt;Vogt, Werner (1988) ''Nahebrücke Bad Kreuznach''. In: ''Steinbrücken in Deutschland''. Düsseldorf: Beton-Verlag, pp. 394–398&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] was married in the church on 19 June 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, Francis (1999) ''Karl Marx: A Life''. London: Fourth Estate&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bridge has two arms; one spanning the Nahe river and another, which supports the old buildings, spanning the Mühlenteich (English: ''mill pond'') canal, which is parallel to the river. 
On Friday, 16 March 1945 the arm of the bridge spanning the river was blown up by German troops to hinder the approach of American forces. This destroyed a [[Baroque]] style Christian stone cross (a 1934 reproduction of the original) which was on the sixth pier of the bridge, and a statue of [[Saint John of Nepomuk]], the bridge's patron saint, which was on the seventh pier.&lt;ref name=schaller&gt;Schaller, Rolf (31.05.2010) [https://www.regionalgeschichte.net/bibliothek/texte/aufsaetze/schaller-nahebruecke.html Der Neubau der Alten Nahebrücke - Die Zerstörung eines historischen Stadtbildes] on [https://www.regionalgeschichte.net/ www.regionalgeschichte.net]. Retrieved 15 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

American tanks arrived in Bad Kreuznach at midday 18 March 1945, unimpeded by the damage to the bridge.&lt;ref name=schaller /&gt;

In 1955, the town council had the remaining original span of the bridge over the Mühlenteich widened by two metres. In 1956, a concrete single-span bridge was built to replace the destroyed section which crossed the Nahe river. There was controversy about this work as some people felt that the 700 year-old historic bridge should have been returned to its original form.&lt;ref name=schaller /&gt;

From 2015 to 2017 both the old span and the 1956 concrete span of the bridge underwent a major restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Neuber, Robert (06.03.2015) [http://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/lokales/bad-kreuznach/stadt-bad-kreuznach/streit-um-alte-nahebruecke-in-bad-kreuznach-verwaltungsgericht-soll-genehmigung-fuer-sanierung-pruefen_15076143.htm Streit um alte Nahebrücke in Bad Kreuznach: Verwaltungsgericht soll Genehmigung für Sanierung prüfen ] in ''Allgemeine Zeitung''.

However, due to financial constraints the local authority decided to restored it and to put a new support pier under it. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kreuznachernachrichten.de/2015/04/29/29-04-15-geschichtshappchen-um-die-alte-nahebrucke/ Historie – Die Alte Nahebrücke], 29 April 2015, in [http://www.Kreuznachernachrichten.de Kreuznachernachrichten.de].

===Houses===

Houses were first built on the bridge around 1480 and first mentioned in 1495.&lt;ref name=vogt /&gt; The [[half-timbered]] buildings that remain on the span crossing the Mühlenteich were built between 1582 and 1612.&lt;ref name=zaschel /&gt; The four buildings, on the street now called ''Mannheimer Straße'', are on four bridge piers on the upstream side of the bridge.  There is also a house on the downstream side of the fourth pier, but its foundations are on an island which lies between the canal and the river, so it is not actually a bridge-supported building.&lt;ref name=vogt /&gt;

* 96 Mannheimer Straße - Built in 1612, restored 1985.
* 94 Mannheimer Straße - Built in 1609. The house has a cannonball embedded in its front facade between the upper floor windows. It was shot by Swedish troops in a military engagement in 1632, during the [[Thirty Years War]].  
* 92 Mannheimer Straße - Built 1595. The building is notable for its protruding back facade, and protruding upper floors.
* 90 Mannheimer Straße - Built 1582. A basement was later built underneath its original groundfloor.&lt;ref name=zaschel /&gt;

Craftsmen and merchants originally lived in the buildings, which are now used as shops and business premises.&lt;ref name=vogt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Franz (25.11.2007) [http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/lebendige-stadtgeschichte.1242.de.html?dram:article_id=189080 Lebendige Stadtgeschichte Bad Kreuznach im Nahetal] on [http://www.deutschlandfunk.de Deutschlandfunk]. Retrieved 17 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bridge structure ==

Originally the bridge had eight arches in total and it was built of [[sandstone]] and [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry rock]]. Since being widened in 1955, the road carriageway has had a width of 6 m and the footpaths on each side have widths of between 2 m and 3 m. The narrowest point between the two houses on the fourth pier is 4 m wide.&lt;ref name=vogt /&gt;

The bridge is 135 m long in total, with the 1956 concrete span being 49.4 m long. The three arched vaults supporting the old span of the bridge are 10.5 m to 12.55 m wide.&lt;ref name=vogt /&gt;

'''Anne Pratt'''  (5 December 1806 – 1893) was a botanical and ornithological illustrator and author from [[Strood]], Kent. The second of three daughters of Robert Pratt (1777–1819), a grocer, and Sara Bundock (1780–1845), Pratt was one of the best known English botanical illustrators of the Victorian age.&lt;ref name=kramer/&gt; Owing to poor health and a 'stiff knee' in childhood, she missed out on 'outdoor activities' and was encouraged to occupy herself by drawing. Anne Pratt was educated at Eastgate House, [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], and introduced to botany by Dr. Dods, a family friend.&lt;ref name=kramer/&gt; She moved to Brixton, London, in 1826, where she developed her career as an illustrator. She settled in [[Dover]] in 1849, then in [[East Grinstead]] in 1866, where she married John Pearless; they then moved to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]]. Anne Pratt died in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London.

Anne Pratt wrote more than 20 books, which she illustrated with [[chromolithograph]]s on which she collaborated with [[William Dickes]], an engraver skilled in the chromolithograph process. Her works were written in popular style but were said to be accurate, and are partly responsible for the popularising of botany in her day. From her first book, ''Flowers and Their Associations'', her work sold well, but she never achieved critical acclaim, owing to prejudice against her on the grounds that she was self-taught.&lt;ref name=acclaim/&gt; Her masterpiece is probably ''The Flowering Plants, Grasses, Sedges, and Ferns of Great Britain and Their Allies the Club Mosses, Pepperworts, and Horsetails'', a six-volume project covering more than 1500 species, with 300 illustrations, that took over a decade to publish in full (1855–1873). This work had a remarkably long life as a standard reference work: the illustrations of ferns in the final volume continued to be used into the second half of the twentieth century, appearing, unattributed and in very much reduced in size and in half tone, in the ''Observer's Book of [British] Ferns'' &lt;ref&gt; ''The Observer's Book of Ferns''
compiled by W.J. Stockoe, published by Frederick Warne, no date; ''The Observer's Book of British Ferns'' compiled by W.J. Stockoe, published by Frederick Warne, 1950. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16872">The '''architecture of Taiwan''' can be traced back to [[stilt house|stilt housing]] of the aborigines in [[prehistory|prehistoric times]]; to the building of fortresses and churches in the north and south used to colonize and convert the inhabitants during the [[Dutch Taiwan|Dutch]] and [[Spanish Taiwan|Spanish]] period; the [[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungning]] period when Taiwan was a base of [[anti-Qing sentiment]] and Minnan-style architecture was introduced; in [[Qing dynasty]] period, a mix of Chinese and Western architecture appeared and [[artillery battery]] flourished during Qing's [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]; During the [[Japanese rule of Taiwan]], the Minnan, [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] and [[Western culture|Western]] culture were main influencers in architectural designs and saw the introduction and use of [[reinforced concrete]]. Due to excessive Westernization as a colony, after the [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] in 1945 from Japan at the end of World War II, Chinese classical style became popular and entered into international mainstream as a postmodern design style. Today, Taiwanese architecture has undergone much diversification, every style of architecture can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dm.ncyu.edu.tw/history/history.htm {{zh icon}} History of Taiwanese architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory (-1621) ==
{{Main|Prehistory of Taiwan}}
The architecture of prehistoric Taiwan saw structures ranging from [[cave|cave dwellings]], [[stilt house|stilt housing]], to [[stone masonry]]. Primarily of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.wunan.com.tw/download/preview/1wb5.pdf {{zh icon}} Pre-historic Taiwanese architecture, National Chiayi University - Dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cave Dwelling===
Prehistoric man made use of caves for their dwellings and Taiwan's oldest known civilization is the [[Changbin culture]] (長濱文化) dating back to over 50,000 years. An example of an [[archaeological site]] of a cave dwelling is the [[Bashian Caves]] in [[Changbin, Taitung|Changbin Township]], [[Taitung County]] which is dated from between 5,500 and 30,000 years. The actual cave itself has a height of around ten [[metre|meters]] and can accommodate some ten persons.

===Stilt Housing===
{{Main|Stilt house}}
Spread over the vast prehistoric [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Indian Ocean]] areas, stilt houses vary greatly. In more recent times, Taiwanese aborigines make use of them for holding church meetings, as places to cool down and to hold ancestral activities. Apart from their cooling effect, stilt houses also have various functions such as avoiding [[miasma theory|miasma]], dampness, flood, and insects and snakes from entering, it is also easier to construct.

===Stone Slab Housing===
[[File:Paiwan.jpg|right|thumb|Stone slab house of the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan tribe]] taken by Japanese anthropologist [[Ushinosuke Mori]] prior to 1945.]]

The [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] and [[Bunun people|Bunun]] tribes made houses using thatched roofing and made walls from stones, homes of nobles were decorated with elaborate wood carvings. The special characteristics of such houses is that dark colored building materials help conceal the buildings in its environment and the layered use of rocks mimic the scales of the [[Deinagkistrodon|hundred pacer snake]] that they worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-tribe.org.tw/kungdavane/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabId=100 {{zh icon}} Kungdavane - Dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aboriginal Architecture===
{{Main|Taiwanese aborigines}}
Chinese and aborigines made use of natural materials for basic construction materials such as straw, wood, bamboo, grass, stone, soil, etc. The types and styles vary depending on the environment, climate, and cultural influences of each tribe. For example, the [[Amis people|Amis]] tribe tend to live in larger communities and planned the layout of their community such as placement of communal homes and a plaza for matters of governance inside, planting a bamboo forest around the outside with camps and guard stations to defend against foreign aggressors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtip.gov.tw/Aborigines/Article.aspx?CategoryID=3&amp;ClassID=10&amp;TypeID=24&amp;SubTypeID=0&amp;RaceID=1 {{zh icon}} Building structures of the Amis tribe, Digital Museum of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atayal people|Atayal]] and [[Saisiyat people|Saisiyat]] tribes made their homes out of wood and bamboo while the [[Tao people|Tao]] tribe who live further away on [[Orchid Island]] and faced strong changes in seasonal weather such as typhoons, developed houses that made use of digging vertically into the ground to strengthen their foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtip.gov.tw/Aborigines/Article.aspx?CategoryID=3&amp;ClassID=10&amp;TypeID=24&amp;SubTypeID=2&amp;RaceID=12 {{zh icon}} Housing layout of the Yami (Tao) tribe, Digital Museum of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the architecture in Taiwan from this period were dominated by fortresses, primarily the Dutch Fengguiwei Fort (風櫃尾城), [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]], [[Fort Provintia]] in the south and the Spanish [[Fort San Domingo]] to the north. The Dutch used red bricks in construction while the Spanish used stone. Both sides made use of ports and constructed fortresses to consolidate their power on the island. The fortresses were square shaped with an additional side for the installment of [[artillery]]. This period saw Taiwan architecture enter the peak of [[western culture|Western colonization]]. Such structures from this period represent the first generation of architectural works and is now listed as a world heritage by the Republic of China government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dm.ncyu.edu.tw/vr/vr02_map/001/001-02.htm {{zh icon}} Origins of Tamsui's Fort Zeelandia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Church was born in [[Plymouth]], [[England]], the son of a saddler, and went to school locally. In 1887 his mother died and, with his inheritance of £100, he went to [[University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]]. With a first ([[University of London|London]] external) degree in Botany he won in 1891 a scholarship to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], obtaining a first-class [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] degree in botany in 1894.

He was a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Research Fellow]] of Jesus College from 1908 to 1912 and University [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Botany from 1910 to 1930.  He was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; His particular fields of interest were [[phyllotaxy]], the development and arrangement of parts of the flower and one-celled sea plants.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. A. H. Church An Oxford Botanist|work=[[The Times]] |date=April 29, 1937|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a fine illustrator and photographer, sometimes illustrating his own publications.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38462| title=Church, Arthur Harry (1865–1937)|last=Mabberley |first=D. J. |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Emma Palmer Pratt of [[Aberystwith]]. They had three daughters. Each daughter was given as her middle name the name of a plant in flower at the time of her birth: Audrey Althea ([[hollyhock]]), Rosemary Doronica (''[[Doronicum orientale]]'') and Grace Coryla ([[hazel]]).

The '''Banc Ty'nddôl sun-disc''' is a small, decorated, [[gold]] ornament discovered at [[Cwmystwyth]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Wales]]. It most likely was part of a funerary garment and is more than 4,000 years old, which makes it the earliest gold artifact found in Wales.  
It was discovered  on October 16, 2002 by a team of [[archaeologist]]s who were investigating the site of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Medieval]] [[lead]] [[smelting]] [[hearth]]s below the [[Bronze Age]] [[copper]] mine on Copa Hill.&lt;ref name=GeraldMorgan&gt;Ceredigion, A Wealth of History&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area around Cwmystwyth, has been mined for lead and copper for more than 4,000 years, almost since the beginning of metalworking in [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref name=SimonTimberlake&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091106231812/http://www.celticdesignstudio.co.uk/the-banc-tynddol-sun-disc.html sun-disc – one of Wales"s earliest gold objects]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site excavation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Banc Ty'nddôl (Penguelan) smelting site.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of Banc Ty'nddôl(Penguelan) smelting site.]]  --&gt;
Excavation now has shown that these [[mining]] sites date to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] (first century AD) and [[Early Medieval]] (ninth to twelfth century AD) periods, but one of the most important finds of the excavation was the gold disc about the size of a milk-bottle top, which pre-dated these discoveries by more than 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=SimonTimberlake/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the time of its discovery, it seemed uncertain as to whether the gold object had ever been intentionally deposited; no earlier archaeological features were at that time identified, whilst its shallow find-spot suggested that it had been disturbed and re-deposited some distance downslope from its original burial context. However, the object was at that time identified and reported to HM Coroner for Ceredigion as a Treasure find on 30 October 2002, whilst further study of the find continued, and a follow-up investigation of the find spot was planned. Given concerns over the possibility of further artefacts remaining within the ground by virtue of association with the disc, also potential treasure, re-excavation of the site took place in March 2003, with funding from the National Museums and Galleries of Wales.

Samples of soil containing degraded bone fragments were collected for dating along with charcoal from in and around the grave. Insufficient [[collagen]] survived to provide any sort of reliable date from the bone, whilst the three samples of charcoal recovered from the grave fill proved to be intrusive; one suggesting Mesolithic activity associated with the pre-burial land surface (OxA-12983: 8850&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;40 [8210&amp;ndash;7760 CalBC]), another a Late Roman date for the ground surface covering the edge of the grave (OxA-12955: 1675&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;28 [320&amp;ndash;430 Cal AD]), whilst the third consisted of a single piece of oak charcoal derived from the Early Medieval smelting horizon above (OxA-12956: 1264&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;27 [670&amp;ndash;840 Cal AD]). Whilst not providing us with any clear answer, these results do at least support the possibility of a prehistoric burial.
&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon further investigation it was determined that the absence of identifiable skeletal remains and of only a thin film with insufficient collagen, precluded accurate [[Carbon-14]] (C14) dating.&lt;ref name=C14&gt;Archaeology in Wales&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detailed description==
The disc is 38.9mm in diameter, with a weight of 2.51g, made of a very pure gold that is composed of between 93% and 94% gold, 6% and 7% [[silver]] and a negligible amount of copper. It is decorated with concentric line and dot circles and pierced by two central holes, apparently for attachment.  The design was determined to belong to the Primary [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker]] Goldwork Tradition.&lt;ref name=Antiquity&gt;[http://www.antiquity.cc/ProjGall/timberlake/index.html Antiquity Vol 78 No 302 December] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520131721/http://www.antiquity.cc/ProjGall/timberlake/index.html |date=2006-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the exact source for the metal cannot be established, the composition appears consistent with that for Irish, Scottish, and Welsh [[alluvial]] gold.&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;  The disc most likely was made for a funerary garment and possibly, to symbolize the life-giving power of the sun.  Further investigation of the discovery site revealed skeletal remains that once were covered over by a mound of stones, known as a [[cairn]]. The grave was located within a crescent of boulders and was oriented to look down the valley to the west&amp;mdash;a poignant resting place for the person wearing one of Wales's first metal discs derived from native gold.

Similar artifacts have been found in [[Ireland]], [[Isle of Man|The Isle of Man]], and [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name=GeraldMorgan/&gt;
Most known examples of this class of 'sun-disc' have been found in Ireland (21), with smaller numbers from Scotland (6), England (5), and similar examples from France. This is the first example to be found in Wales and thought to be the earliest gold artifact from Wales, probably belonging to the slightly later established [[Beaker culture#Britain|Beaker]] phase (c. 2000 BC).&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;  The Banc Ty'nddôl disc most closely resembles an example from Ireland that remains without provenance, having two-four linear circles in repoussé and two central perforations. A similar style with repoussé dots is to be found in an example from [[Andreas (parish)|Kirk Andreas]] in The Isle of Man.

In Brittany, gold discs with similar dot and linear decoration have been discovered in [[Neolithic]] tombs and they also appear to be associated with early Beaker ([[Chalcolithic]]) abandonment deposits. In Britain, three examples have been found associated with two Beaker burials (one as a pair, and one as a single find) at [[Mere, Wiltshire|Mere]] and [[Monkton Farleigh|Farleigh Wick]] in [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;

The similarities in style and decorative technique between the Banc Ty'nddôl disc and 'basket earrings' or gold hair tress ornaments associated with rich Beaker burials is striking. Examples from Kirkhaugh, [[Northumberland]] had been tooled similarly on the surface as a means of enhancing the repoussé lines applied to the back, a detail precisely matched on the Banc Ty'nddôl disc. The Kirkhaugh basket earring and other items from similar burial sites can all be dated to the period between 2500&amp;ndash;1900 BC.&lt;ref name=Antiquity/&gt;

==Current status==
The disc was declared a treasure in December 2003 and has since been acquired by the [[National Museum Wales|Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''Bec mac Dé'''&lt;ref&gt;Name variants: Becc, Beg; mac Deiche&lt;/ref&gt; was a legendary [[Irish people|Irish]] prophet, known from saga literature surrounding the historical [[High King of Ireland|High King]] [[Diarmait mac Cerbaill]] and from the [[Irish Annals]], where he is said to have died c. 553-7.

In the saga ''Aided Diarmata'' ("the death of Diarmait") he is said to have been the best seer of his day, who could speak with nine men at once and answer all their questions in a single reply, and made an accurate prediction of the circumstances of Diarmait's death. Two saints, [[St. Ronan|Ronan]] and [[Ciarán of Clonmacnoise|Ciarán]], had prophesied he would be killed by a roofbeam falling on his head. Bec gave a more elaborate prophecy of a [[threefold death]]: he would be drowned, burned, and have his head crushed by a roofbeam, by [[Áed Dub mac Suibni]], in the house of Banbán the hospitaller, on a night that he wore a shirt grown from a single flax seed, drank ale brewed from a single grain of corn, and ate pork from a sow that had never farrowed. Diarmait dismissed these prophecies, even when invited to a feast by Banbán. His wife, who had been listening, refused to go, so Banbán offered the king his own daughter for that night, and gave him a nightshirt, pork and ale. When the girl told him the nightshirt had been woven from flax grown from a single seed, the ale had been brewed from a single grain of corn, and the pork had come from a sow that had never farrowed, Diarmait realised the prophecy had been fulfilled, and tried to escape, but Áed Dubh was standing at the door with his spear. As Diarmait fled back into the house, Áed's men set it on fire. Diarmait tried to escape the conflagration by leaping into a vat of ale, but a flaming roofbeam fell on his head, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;Standish Hayes O'Grady, ''Silva Gadelica'' Vol II, pp. 70-88&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of early Irish poems are attributed to him,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanhamel.nl/wiki/Becc_mac_D%C3%A9#tab=Works Works ascribed to Becc mac Dé at Sichting Van Hamel]&lt;/ref&gt; including a prophecy "detailing the moral breakdown presaging the end of the world".&lt;ref&gt;F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11984">'''Black Theatre Workshop''' is a professional not-for-profit theatre company based in [[Montreal]], and is Canada's oldest Black theatre company in [[Quebec]].

==History==

Black Theatre Workshop was incorporated in 1972 but has roots going back to the [[Trinidad and Tobago]] Drama Committee. [[The Drama Committee was created by Clarence Bayne and Arther Goddard, both of whom were the founders of the Trinidad and Tobago Association and wrote its first Constitution and bylaws]]. [[Dr Bayne invited a number of professional Black Trinidadian artists resident in Montreal in the late sixties (1968) to conduct Black Workshops as part of the activities of the Drama Committee]]. [[It was the Black Workshops under the auspices of the Trinidad and Tobago Association that produced the first professional play of the BTW, written by Professor Lorris Elliott, and named "How Now Black Man". Dr. Bayne was appointed by the Trinidad and Tobago Association to be the Executive Producer of that production and to represent the Association's interest. Except for a brief absence from the company 1970-1972, Dr, Bayne continued to hold  the position of Executive producer and president of the company  for early the formative years of the company between 1973-4 to 1990]]. He negotiated the first professional grant from Canada Council with matching funds from the Multicultural Directorate (Ottawa) that launched the company as a professional theatre company in 1984, making it eligible for funding from all three level of the cultural funding agencies]] &lt;ref&gt;Le Black Theatre Workshop de MOntreal: un nouveau bilan by Clarence Bayne, L'Annuaire theatral 29, Methods en question,  Printemps 2001,  pp 141-155.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Black Theatre Workshop company is committed to reflecting Black culture and community by developing and providing visibility for Black Canadian artists; and the creation of a Black Canadian theatre and literature. Black Theatre Workshop is an award-winning English-speaking theatre company. [[ Its first play "How Now Black Man" was produced  in 1970 under the name '''Black Workshop''']] at the [[Centaur Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0012088 Canadian Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt; But Black [Theatre] [[ Workshop defacto existed from July 17 1968]]. 

Over the years the [[theatre]] has had many artistic directors including[[ Dr.]] Clarence Bayne, [[Errol Sitahal]], Terry Donald, Dwight Bacquie, [[Lorena Gale]], Don Jordan, Winston Sutton, Fleurette Fernando, Nancy Delva, Kate Bligh and Rachael Van Fossen, and [[Tyrone Benskin]]. Since August 2011, the Artistic Director has been Quincy Armorer. He is a graduate of the Theatre Department at Concordia University and also studied at the Birmingham Conservatory for Classical Theatre at the Stratford Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/quincy-armorer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

Black Theatre Workshop's mission is to encourage and promote the development of a Black and Canadian Theatre, rooted in a [[literature]] that reflects the creative will of Black Canadian writers and artists, and the creative collaborations between Black and other artists. Black Theatre Workshop aims to promote and produce Black theatre that educates, entertains and delights its audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacktheatreworkshop.ca/about/who-we-are/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and merits==

Among its early ambitious productions was Derek Walcott's Dream on Monkey Mountain (1973-74 season). Then Executive Director Dr. Clarence Bayne secured a [[Canada Council]] grant in 1976 and contributed new plays for the theater, including The Black Experience, Bonanza 70 and Martin Luther King Who?.

In 2005 BTW was recognized by the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Legacy Committee of Montreal for its Historic Contribution to the Development of Black [[Performing Arts]] in Canada. It has also received a Trail Blazer Award (Black History Month Round Table Award) in recognition of its exceptional dedication to the development of the community by promoting cultural diversity, educational awareness and social consciousness.


 
== Dr. Clarence Bayne Community Service Award ==

This award has been created by the Black Theatre Workshop in recognition of and to   honour of the exceptional   dedication and contributions of  Dr Clarence  Bayne to Black arts and culture in Canada; and his tireless  work in the development  of the Black community in Quebec and Canada.  He is an exemplary model of selfless devotion to community and commitment to the creation of a truly  just, equitable and sustainable multicultural  society in Canada.  His contributions span some sixty years and addresses  a wide range of issues and problems  affecting the full participation,  growth and development of  Blacks in Canadian societies.  The Workshop truly believes that his life achievements serve as a guide and motivator to successor generations of Black community leaders. 

Dr. Clarence Bayne is a founding past President of the National Black Coalition of Canada; a founder of the Black Community Council of Quebec; a founder and  member of the Board of Directors of the Queen Elizabeth Health Complex; a collaborator in the creation of the Monkland Community Center (NDG); a founder of the Montreal CEDEC.  He is the Founding Director of the Institute for Community Entrepreneurship  and Development (ICED) , Concordia University, Montreal.  He is a founding member of the Quebec Board of Black Educators and Founding President of the Black Studies Center, Montreal. He is   a founder and Senior Editor in Chief of the International Journal for Community Development and Management Sciences; a Full   professor Emeritus  in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management. JMSB, Concordia University.  He is widely published in the field of social economy and community development.
   
A crowning achievement is that he is the founder and sitting member and past president of the Black Theatre Workshop of Montreal.  For his selfless volunteer work Dr. Bayne has received  a vast number of awards from numerous community organizations and public institutions; national and international governments: several Governor General Awards including the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Award; The Trinidad and Tobago Commemorative Award on the 50th Anniversary of  the Independence of Trinidad and Tobago; The Black History Month Laureate Award and a special mention  as a member of the community group that spear-headed the naming of February Black History Month in Montreal; a Seniors Montreal Award; The Community Contact Award  as one of  19 Top Contributors to the Black Community of Montreal;  and the prestigious Martin Luther King life time Achievement Award (Black Theatre Workshop).  Dr Bayne is also a published Black poet,essayist, and social critic whose writings appear in several academic journals and publications.
  
Thus,  against this background  and the critical importance of Dr Bayne’s contributions to the creation and development of  Black theatre and culture in Montreal and Canada, making the srts a critical factor in community development  and the building of a better society, the Black Theatre Workshop at each Vision Celebration shines the spot light on volunteerism and community building, by presenting the Dr. Clarence Bayne Community Service Award to someone who demonstrates exemplary selflessness, persistence,  and creative drive in working for the betterment of our community and the creation of a better Canada.

The '''Boboli Gardens''' ({{lang-it|Giardino di Boboli}}) is a park in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], that is home to a collection of sculptures dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries, with some Roman antiquities.

==History and layout==
[[File:Boboli-gardens-from-palazzo.jpg|thumb|Boboli Gardens Amphitheatre, viewed from the Palazzo Pitti]]
The Gardens, directly behind the [[Pitti Palace]], the main seat of the [[Medici]] grand dukes of [[Tuscany]] at [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], are some of the first and most familiar formal 16th-century Italian gardens. The mid-16th-century garden style, as it was developed here, incorporated longer axial developments, wide gravel avenues, a considerable "built" element of stone, the lavish employment of statuary and fountains, and a proliferation of detail, coordinated in semi-private and public spaces that were informed by classical accents: [[grotto]]s, [[nympheum]]s, garden temples and the like. The openness of the garden, with an expansive view of the city, was unconventional for its time. The gardens were very lavish, considering no access was allowed to anyone outside the immediate Medici family, and no entertainment or parties ever took place in the gardens.

The Boboli Gardens were laid out for [[Eleonora di Toledo]], the wife of [[Cosimo I de' Medici]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | title=Boboli Gardens | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a corruption of "Bogoli", a family from whom land had been bought to construct the garden.&lt;ref name="Hibbert2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Christopher|title=The Rise and Fall of the House of Medici|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzV9uDSjjEcC|accessdate=28 December 2015|date=1979|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780141927145|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage was scarcely begun by [[Niccolò Tribolo]]&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; before he died in 1550, then was continued by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]], with contributions in planning from [[Giorgio Vasari]], who laid out the grottos, and in sculpture by [[Bernardo Buontalenti]].&lt;ref name=zucconi&gt;{{cite book | first=Guido | last=Zucconi | year=1995 | title=Florence: An Architectural Guide | edition=2001 Reprint | publisher=Arsenale Editrice | location=San Giovanni Lupatoto (Vr) | ISBN=| pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elaborate architecture of the grotto in the courtyard that separates the palace from its garden is by Buontalenti.

The garden lacks a natural water source.  To water the plants in the garden, a conduit was built from the nearby [[Arno River]] to feed water into an elaborate irrigation system.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

The primary axis, centered on the rear façade of the palace, rises on Boboli Hill from a deep [[amphitheater]]&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt; that is reminiscent in its shape of one half of a classical [[hippodrome]] or racecourse. At the center of the amphitheater and rather dwarfed by its position is the [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[Boboli obelisk]]&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; brought from the [[Villa Medici]] at Rome. This primary axis terminates in a fountain of [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] (known to the irreverent Florentines as the "Fountain of the Fork" for Neptune's trident), with the sculpture of Neptune by [[Stoldo Lorenzi]] visible against the skyline as a visitor climbs the slope.

[[Giulio Parigi]] laid out the long secondary axis, the ''Viottolone'' or ''Cyprus Road'' at a right angle to the primary axis. This road led up through a series of terraces and water features, the main one being the Isolotto complex, with the [[bosquet]]s on either side, and then allowed for exit from the gardens almost at Porta Romana, which was one of the main gates of the walled city. In 1617, Parigi constructed the ''Grotto of Vulcan'' (''Grotticina di Vulcano'') along this axis.

The gardens have passed through several stages of enlargement and restructuring work. They were enlarged in the 17th century to their present extent of 45,000&amp;nbsp;meters² (111&amp;nbsp;acres).&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt; The Boboli Gardens have come to form an outdoor museum of garden sculpture that includes Roman antiquities as well as 16th and 17th century works.

In the first phase of building, the amphitheatre was excavated in the hillside behind the palace. Initially formed by clipped edges and greens, it was later formalized by rebuilding in stone decorated with statues based on Roman myths such as the Fountain of the Ocean sculpted by [[Giambologna]], then transferred to another location within the same garden. The small Grotto of Madama, and the Large Grotto, were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammannati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593.&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt;

Even while undergoing restoration work in 2015, the Large Grotto's statues are still on display and represent defining examples of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] sculpture and architecture. Decorated internally and externally with stalactites and originally equipped with waterworks and luxuriant vegetation, the fountain is divided into three main sections. The first one was frescoed to create the illusion of a natural grotto, that is a natural refuge to allow shepherds to protect themselves from wild animals; it originally housed ''The Prisoners'' of [[Michelangelo]] (now replaced by copies), statues that were first intended for the tomb of the [[Pope Julius II]]. Other rooms in the Grotto contain [[Giambologna|Giambologna's]] famous ''Bathing Venus'' and an 18th-century group of ''Paris and Helen'' by [[Vincenzo de' Rossi]].

==The Fountain of Neptune==
In the hillside above the amphitheatre is a double ramp, leading to the ''Fountain of Neptune''. The main feature is a large basin with a central bronze statue of ''Neptune'' (1565-1568) by [[Stoldo Lorenzi]]. This fountain was being constructed contemporaneously with it more famous counterpart, [[Bartolomeo Ammannati|Ammannati's]] ''[[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]]'' at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio at the Piazza della Signoria in the center of Florence. The conceit here recalls the story of the competition of Athena and Neptune to be patrons of Athens. In that legend, Neptune struck the ground with his trident to spring forth water from the land. Higher up on the hillside is a statue of ''Abundance'' (''Dovizia'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LYoXoEQyOF0C The Italian Garden: Art, Design and Culture], article : Hard times in Baroque Florence: The Boboli Garden and the grand ducal public works administration, by Malcolm Campbell, editor: John Dixon Hunt, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Isolotto==
[[File:Boboli, isolotto, andromeda 02.JPG|thumb|Andromeda rises above the ''Isolotto'' centered in its pool: the luxuriant and naturalistic plant growth is a 19th-century development.]]
The Isolotto is an oval-shaped island in a tree enclosed pond nearly at the end of the alternative Viottolone axis. In the centre of the island is the Fountain of the Ocean, while in the surrounding moat, there are statues of Perseus and Andromedae (school of [[Giambologna]]). The Isolotto was laid out (circa 1618) by Giulio and Alfonso Parigi.

'''Cabaret Mechanical Theatre''' is an English organisation that mounts exhibitions around the world of contemporary [[automata]] by a collective of artists. Founded by Sue Jackson, the group played a central role in the revival of automata from the 1970s onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midweekherald.co.uk/what-s-on/thg-to-take-a-curious-turn-with-mechanical-sculptures-in-honiton-1-5385780|title=THG to take a curious turn with mechanical sculptures in Honiton|first=Andrew|last=Coley|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jackson championed the idea of automata as a form of [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/25/sue-jackson-obituary|title=Sue Jackson obituary|first=Martin|last=Plimmer|date=25 April 2016|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabaret Mechanical Theatre was started in 1979 in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], where Jackson encouraged local artists Peter Markey, Paul Spooner and [[Ron Fuller (artist)|Ron Fuller]] to manufacture automata for her craft shop, "Cabaret". The shop became an exhibition space&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; and the collection moved to [[Covent Garden]], central London, in 1984,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; remaining there until 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=BBC – Radio 4 Woman's Hour – Cabaret Mechanical Theatre | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/04/2007_16_fri.shtml | publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when rising rates forced it to close.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

'''Carol Es''' (born {{Birth date|1968|7|20|mf=yes}}) is a self-taught visual artist, writer, musician (drummer), and [[book artist]] who lives and works in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She has written articles for [[Coagula Art Journal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esart.com/news/press/coagula-botello.pdf|title=Rochelle Botello, Down by the River on Tenterhooks|publisher=Coagula Art Journal, Issue #91, March 2008|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Huffington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carol-es/a-snow-white-story-on-its-head_b_3263641.html|title=A Snow White Story Turned on Its Head|publisher=Huffington Post Arts Section|accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a musician, she has played for 20 years as an R&amp;B drummer touring and recording drums with various artists. She played drums on Rickie Lee Jones' [[Ghostyhead]] album in 1997.

Her Artists' books are featured in the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] Research Institute Library in Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esart.com/news/press/dailybreeze-caroles.pdf|title=A Pattern of Creativity by Josh Grossberg|publisher=Daily Breeze, 5 March 2006|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, and also in prominent university collections such as the Arthur and Mata Jaffe Collection at [[Florida Atlantic University Library]], UC Irvine, [[Otis College of Art &amp; Design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otis.edu/press-release/binding-desire-unfolding-artists-books|title=Binding Desire: UNFOLDING ARTISTS BOOKS|publisher=AN EXHIBITION AT BEN MALTZ GALLERY from the Millard Sheets Library Special Collections, 2014.|accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UCLA Library]] Special Collections.

As a visual artist, Es is known for creating personal narratives. She has used past experience as the fuel for her subject matter, transforming a broken history into a positive and spiritual resolve. Candid experiences are laid bare and forged directly into her paintings, drawings, soft sculptures, mixed media installations, and handmade books.[http://esart.com/] In 2015, Los Angeles Art Critic, [[Peter Frank (art critic)|Peter Frank]] wrote: "An autodidact, Es has long embodied her interests and her struggles - in painted and drawn and even sculpted and sewn imagery - darkly whimsical forms and figures whose deft fluidity have the eye "going for a walk with a line" (in the words of [[Paul Klee]], who strongly influenced Es) but aggressively trouble the mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artillerymag.com/carol-es/|title=Carol Es - Shulamit Gallery / Los Angeles|work=Artillery|date=July 2015|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Los Angeles art critic, A. Moret wrote: "The viewer activates the past as Es rewrites the story by mending a broken history and constructing a new narrative. Carol Es has transformed the past that once plagued her existence into her raison d’ être.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moret|first=A|url=http://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/carol-es-george-billis-gallery/2151|title=Carol Es @ George Billis Gallery|work=Whittehot magazine|date=November 2010|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Castello di Vicarello''' is a medieval [[castle]] in [[Cinigiano]], [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The complex was built in the thirteenth century as part of the [[Republic of Siena]], and became an important defensive structure. It was sold in the middle of the fifteenth century to the lords of [[Castello di Cotone]], who also owned part of nearby [[Castello della Sabatina]]. During the [[Renaissance]] period, redevelopment work was carried out that led to the overlapping of newer stylistic elements with the existing medieval ones. In the mid-sixteenth century, the castle became part of the territory administered by the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], and remained in private ownership. Restorations were completed at the end of the twentieth century.

==Current==
The castle is currently operated as a hotel and farm. One of the two original stone square towers is well-preserved. The buildings that make up the complex are organized around an inner courtyard, which is accessed through an archway; the walls are completely covered in stone. Not far from the castle was an old church, now deconsecrated and used as a private residence, which is recognizable by its bell tower.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">'''Charles Taylor''' (died 1816) was a Manchester [[calico printer]] and dyer, who later became Secretary of the [[Society of Arts]].

==Biography==

Little is known about his origins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson,|first=W. O.|title=Industrial Britain under the Regency|year=1968|pages=169, n43}}&lt;/ref&gt; but  he was an M. D. He was a partner in the Manchester firm of Taylor and Maxwell, [[fustian]] manufacturers, dyers and printer, and was involved with the development of printing machinery for calico in about 1770.  About 1785 Taylor set up a dye-house in Manchester for [[Turkey Red]] dyeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Musson, A. E.|first=Robinson, Eric |title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution|year=1969|pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor and Maxwell were early experimenters in the use of 'dephlogisticated marine acid' (chlorine) following the work of [[Berthollet]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Scheele|Scheele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Musson, A. E.|first=Robinson, Eric|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution|year=1969|pages=251–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was suggested to Taylor by Dr [[Richard Kirwan]] F.R.S. and according to the article on 'Bleaching' in ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'', which Taylor wrote:
:''... a whole piece of calico, in the state received from the loom, was in the spring of 1788 actually bleached white, printed in permanent colours and produced in the Manchester market ready for sale, having undergone all these operations in less than 48 hours by the joint efforts of Mr. Cooper, Mr. Baker and Mr Taylor, which is perhaps the first time an entire piece, either in France or England, that fully ascertained the real merits of a new mode of bleaching, and certainty that it might be generally useful in commerce.''

In 1788 they took as an apprentice [[James Watt, Jr.]] (1769-1848)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hills|first=Revd Dr Richard L.|title=James Watt :adversity through trial|year=2006|publisher=Landmark Publishing|isbn=1-84306-193-7|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor retired from his Manchester business in 1800 and in February of that year was appointed Secretary to the [[Society of Arts]], a post he held until his death in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Society of Arts|year=1818|volume=35|pages=viii–ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Henry Trueman|title=A History of the Royal Society of Arts|year=1913|pages=344–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
For ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' he contributed articles on:
*Bleaching, vol 4, 1805
*Crimson, vol 10, 1808
*Dying, history of, vol 12, 1808
*Fustian. vol 15, 1810

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3978">[[File:Clasm Chludov.jpg|thumb|225px|The worn state of many pages is evidence of continuous use throughout centuries.]]
'''Chludov Psalter''' ({{lang-ru|Хлудовская псалтырь}}; Moscow, Hist. Mus. MS. D.129) is an [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Margin (typography)|marginal]] [[Psalter]] made in the middle of the 9th Century. It is a unique monument of [[Byzantine art]] at the time of the [[Iconoclasm]], one of only three illuminated Byzantine Psalters to survive from the 9th century. 

According to one tradition, the miniatures are supposed to have been created clandestinely, and many of them are directed against Iconoclasts.  Many contain explanations of the drawings written next to them, and little arrows point out from the main text to the illustration, to show which line the picture refers to.  The polemical style of the whole ensemble is highly unusual, and a demonstration of the furious passions the Iconoclast dispute generated.   

The psalter measures 195&amp;nbsp;mm by 150&amp;nbsp;mm and contains only 169 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s. The outer edges of the pages are normally left blank in order to be covered with illustrations. The text and captions were written in a diminutive [[uncial]] [[Handwriting|script]], but many of these were rewritten in crude [[Lower case|minuscule]] about three centuries later.  The book contains the [[Psalm]]s in the arrangement of the [[Septuagint]], and the responses to be chanted during their recitation, which follow the Liturgy of [[Hagia Sophia]], the Imperial church in [[Constantinople]].
[[File:Chludov david.jpg|left|thumb|]]
In the illustration to the right, the miniaturist illustrated the line "They gave me gall to eat; and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink" with a picture of a soldier offering Christ vinegar on a sponge attached to a pole. Below is a picture of the last Iconoclast [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Patriarch John VII of Constantinople|John the Grammarian]] rubbing out a painting of Christ with a similar sponge attached to a pole. John is caricatured, here as on other pages, with untidy straight hair sticking out in all directions, which was considered ridiculous by the [[Byzantine dress|elegant]] Byzantines.  

[[Nikodim Kondakov]] hypothesized that the psalter was created in the famous [[monastery of St John the Studite]] in [[Constantinople]]. Other scholars believe that the liturgical responses it contains were only used in Hagia Sophia, and that it was therefore a product of the Imperial workshops in Constantinople, soon after the return of the Iconophiles to power in 843. 

It was kept at [[Mount Athos]] until 1847, when a Russian scholar brought it to [[Moscow]]. The psalter was then acquired by [[Aleksey Khludov]], whose name it bears today. It passed as part of the Khludov bequest to the [[Nikolsky Old Believer Monastery]] and then to the [[State Historical Museum]].

==Description and history==
[[File:Ohio Statehouse (9843762483).jpg|thumb|The statue of Columbus in 2013]]
The sheet copper statue was cast by W. H. Mullins Company and depicts Columbus holding a globe. Next to Columbus is a granite pedestal with a dove on top of a globe.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The statue is approximately {{Convert|9|ft|m }} tall and weighs 150 lbs. The memorial was commissioned by Pontifical College Josephinum to commemorate the 400th anniversary of his voyage, and was purchased by Mssgr. Jessing in 1892 for $400–500.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; From 1892 to 1932, the work was installed at the college, along 18th Street between Main and Mound. It was gifted to Ohio in 1932.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

There are several inscriptions on the base. One on the south side reads, "The Pontifical College Josephinum commissioned this statue from the W. H. Mullins studio". Another on the east side reads, "Donated by the Josephinum to the State of Ohio / The statue was relocated to Capitol Square."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; An inscription on the north side reads, "The fountain honors Ohio's sister state bond with Liguria, Italy, the navigator's home." The west side has: "Christopher Columbus, an Italian navigator, launched four voyages of discovery to the new world."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

Similarly, the fountain has multiple inscriptions. One on the south side reads, "1892 A dream shared / by later generations / who explored a vast continent / where freedom and opportunity / beckoned to those with / the courage and imagination to venture westward". Another on the east side reads, "1932 Westward into Ohio / came the successors / to the spirit of Columbus, / naming the capital city / of the new state / after the man who symbolized / the spirit of the frontier".&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The inscription on the north side reads, "1992 Frontiers explored / by later generations of Ohioans / extend beyond land and water / to a new world / whose potential / remains to be unlocked / by the spirit of discovery". The west side has: "1492 The spirit of discovery has the power to change / the course of human history, / as demonstrated by / the voyages of / Christopher Columbus / whose imagination shattered the boundaries / of the western world. / Modern history has been shaped by / one man's courage to pursue a dream."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

The monument has been vandalized multiple times. The dove, which had been removed and found, was rededicated on October 12, 1953.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The memorial was relocated while the Statehouse underwent restoration in 1991. During 1991–1992, a new granite base and fountain was designed by E. G. &amp; G., Inc. The artwork was surveyed by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in 1993.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

'''Cín Lae Uí Mhealláin''' is an account of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] written by [[Tarlach Ó Mealláin]], [[Ordo Fratrum Minorum|OFM]].

Described as "an account of the progress of the Confederate war from the outbreak of rebellion in 1641 until February 1647" its text "reflected the [[Ulster]] Catholic point of view."

==Description==

The text was first described as ''Cín Lae Uí Mhealláin'' by Professor Tadhg Ó Donnchadha in 1931, Cín Lae being the Irish term for 'diary.' It is written on both sides of twenty-two small sheets of paper (approximately 18.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 14&amp;nbsp;cm). The narrative comes to an abrupt end on the 28th line of page forty-four; "Tanic trí mile saigdeor ón Pharlemeint i nÁth C. i n-aghaidh Laighneach agus each...."

It is housed at the Boole Library at [[University College, Cork]], as MS 3.

==Facets ==

In his introduction to the text, Charles Dillon points out that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Tarlach had a detailed knowledge of the Ulster leaders. As he was familiar too with many of the places in which they fought, he is an invaluable source for the general historian, toponomyst and genealogist and, because of his language, he is an invaluable source for the linguist and the historian of Irish as well."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reasons for composition==

Ó Doibhlin opines that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[It] might have been more accurately named a Commonplace Book kept by Ó Mealláin, possibly at the instigation of the leader of the rebellion, Sir Pheilim O'Neill of Caledon. It looks very much like a notebook the writer had with him in the field and he may have hoped that the notes taken down would at some stage in the future act as an aide memoire for a fuller, more extensive account."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Charles Dillon concurs, stating that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Cín Lae was written in abbreviated form, apparently as a memory aid to the author who may have intended to produce a fuller history of the period at a later date. Sadly, no such history appears to have been written ... [although] ... he ... had the opportunity of revising at least part of the script."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Extracts==

The text begins thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"One the eve of the Feast of Saint John Capistranus the lords of Ulster planned to seize in one night, unknown to the English and the Scots, all their walled towns, castles and bawns. The date chosen was 22nd&amp;nbsp;October, Friday to be precise, and the last day of the moon." (Saturday 23 October 1641, Old Style)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On one occasion Ó Mealláin describes O'Neill rousing the troops:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Do bhí an General ag teagasc imeasc an tsloigh. Iseadh adubhairt 'Ag sud chuagaibh escairde Dé agus naimhde bhur n-anma; agus denaidh calmacht 'na n-aghadh aniu; oir is iad do ben dibh ar (leg. bhur) dtigheranaidh, bhur gclann agus bhur mbeatha spiordalta agus temporalta, do bhen bhur nduthaigh dibh, is do chuir ar deoruigheach sibh etc."/"The General  was in the midst of his men exorting them. 'Here before you are the enemies of God, and your souls enemies; and be courageous against them today for it is they who took away your lordships, your families, your spiritual and temporal lives, and sent you into exile."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, he describes the terrible effect of the war on the general population (daoine san tír):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Atá, daoine san tír, Cathanaigh, Duibhlinigh, muinter Ara, Ibh Eathach agus clann Aodh Bui uile an Ruta ag ithe capall, each: deireadh earraigh; a ghoid; fuadach cat, madraidh; ag ithe daoine, leathar carbaidhi, agus leathar fo na aol." "There are people in the country, O'Kanes, O'Devlins, the people of Ara and [[Iveagh]], inhabitants of [[Clandeboy]] and the Route eating horsemeat; the end of spring; thieving and the stealing of dogs and cats; [[cannibalism]], eating the leather of carriages and leather treated with lime."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other occasions described include a number of combats and battles, such as [[Benburb]].

To her right, [[Adam]] lies on the ground.&lt;ref name=Milburn&gt;{{cite book |last=Milburn |first=Robert |title=Early Christian Art and Architecture |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1991 |isbn=0-520-07412-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcRTwsDq_Z4C&amp;pg=PA68 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''Dogmatic Sarcophagus''', also known as the "Trinity Sarcophagus"  is an [[early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] dating to 320–350,&lt;ref&gt;Various scholars give narrower ranges, but the great majority of dates given fall within this range&lt;/ref&gt; now in the [[Vatican Museums]] (Vatican 104).&lt;ref&gt;There is another "Trinity Sarcophagus" at [[Arles]], alsao with a three-figure Trinity.&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in the 19th century during rebuilding works at the [[basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura]], in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

Together with the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], it one of the most important examples of Christian-Roman sculpture of the [[Constantine I|Constantinian]] era. It draws its name from its clear references to the [[dogma]]s of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] (325), in particular to Christ being consubstantial with God the Father, as shown (for example) by the scene of a figure with the appearance of Jesus between [[Adam and Eve]], though whether the figure is to be understood as Christ or God the Father is less clear – the dogmatic point works either way.&lt;ref name=Milburn/&gt;

==Description==
The front face is split into two registers, typical of the style of the time, with [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] subjects and a central shell-shaped ''[[clipeus]]'' containing the portraits of the dead couple, embraced and wearing marital clothes typical of the 4th century (''tunica manicata'', ''dalmatina'' and ''[[toga|toga contabulata]]'' by the man, who holds a ''rotulus'' in his hand, and tunic and [[palla]] by the woman). The heads are basic types, showing there was either no desire or not enough time to personalize the sarcophagus.

In the upper register are five episodes, two from the [[book of Genesis]] and two miracles of Christ:
*Three similar bearded figures representing the [[Trinity]], the middle enthroned representing [[God the Father]], creating [[Eve]] from the rib of [[Adam]], who lies on the ground.&lt;ref name=Milburn/&gt; 
*A younger, beardless, figure with the [[depiction of Jesus|conventional appearance of Christ]] between Adam and Eve, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
*[[Marriage at Cana]]
* [[Feeding the Five Thousand|Multiplication of the loaves]] 
*[[Resurrection of Lazarus]]

In the lower register are six scenes, one linked to Christ's birth, two to the Bible and three to St Peter:
*[[Adoration of the Magi]], with an enthroned Virgin and Child, and with Magi in oriental dress and [[Phrygian cap]]s, and with [[Balaam]] behind the throne
*Healing the blind
*[[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lions' den
*[[Habbakuk]] with the basket of loaves and the angel
*[[Saint Peter|Peter]] denying Christ, with the crowing cockerel from the Gospel account
*Peter's arrest, by two soldiers wearing [[Pannonia]]n caps
*[[Moses]] or Peter creating a spring of water in the presence of a [[centurion]] (with the latter wearing typical 4th century military dress)

The sarcophagus can be dated to between 330 and 340 due to the male hairstyles (apart from those of Christ and Peter), the squat square figures and the lack of calligraphic detail. There are echoes of the previous "plebeian" official art, which has led some to suggest that the sarcophagus is from the same workshop that produced and amended the reliefs for the [[Arch of Constantine]] (dedicated in 315).

==Iconography==
The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father.  However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or pre-existing Christ.  
  
A number of other sarcophagi, most conveniently collected in the same Vatican collection as the Dogmatic Sarcophagus, also show groups of three figures usually interpreted as representing the Trinity in scenes from Genesis.  Sometimes one figure is beardless, while the other two are bearded.{{sfn|Jensen|2003|loc=Figs 5–11}} Given the funerary context, and that adjacent scenes often show [[New Testament]] miracles, including the [[Raising of Lazarus]], the emphasis of these scenes may relate as much to the overcoming of sin and hope of new life as the [[Fall of Man]].{{sfn|Jensen|2003|p=37–38}}

Christ was compared to Adam in [[Book of Romans|Romans]] 5:14–21, and was sometimes called the "new Adam", especially in connection with [[baptism]] (at this period catechumens were apparently naked when this was administered).  This may also be referred to in the second scene, or the central figure may represent the [[Logos (Christianity)|Divine Logos]], who is also shown with the appearance of Jesus.{{sfn|Jensen|2003|p=27-29}} The scene represents the "division of labours" between Adam and Eve; the central figure holds a sheaf of corn in one hand and a dead [[hare]] (in another Vatican example a lamb) in the other,{{sfn|Jensen|2003|p=33}} although one might expect hunting hares to be Adam's task and agriculture Eve's, rather than the opposite as the sarcophagus seems to suggest.

Adam and Eve also functioned as [[typology (theology)|typological]] forerunners of Jesus and Mary, and the Tree of Knowledge of the Cross of the [[Crucifixion]].  In addition they represented faithfulness in marriage, and scenes of them between the Logos are interpreted by some as representing their marriage ceremony, suitable for the sarcophagus of a married couple.{{sfn|Jensen|2003|p=47-52}}

[[File:Starry Night Over the Rhone.jpg|thumb|''[[Starry Night Over the Rhône]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]], 1888]]

'''Dutch art''' describes the history of [[visual arts]] in the [[Netherlands]], after the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] separated from [[Flanders]]. Earlier painting in the area is covered in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting]].

The history of Dutch art is dominated by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], mostly of about 1620 to 1680, when a very distinct style and new types of painting were developed, though still keeping close links with [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  After the end of the Golden Age, production of paintings remained high, but ceased to influence the rest of Europe as strongly.

The [[Hague School]] of the 19th century re-interpreted the range of subjects of the Golden Age in contemporary terms, and made Dutch painting once again a European leader. In the successive movements of art since the 19th century, the Dutch contribution has been best known from the work of the individual figures of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Piet Mondrian]], though both did their best work outside the Netherlands, and took some time to be appreciated. [[Amsterdam Impressionism]] had a mainly local impact, but the ''[[De Stijl]]'' movement, of which Mondrian was a member, was influential abroad.

==Golden Age==
{{main article|Dutch Golden Age painting}}
[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]] is often considered to be the best known piece of Dutch art.]]
[[Dutch Golden Age painting]] was among the most acclaimed in the world at the time, during the seventeenth century. There was an enormous output of painting, so much so that prices declined seriously during the period. From the 1620s, Dutch painting broke decisively from the [[Baroque]] style typified by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in neighboring Flanders into a more realistic style of depiction, very much concerned with the real world. Types of paintings included historical paintings, portraiture, landscapes and cityscapes, [[still life]]s and [[Genre works|genre painting]]s. In the last four of these categories, Dutch painters established styles upon which art in Europe depended for the next two centuries. Paintings often had a moralistic subtext. The Golden Age never really recovered from the French invasion of 1671, although there was a twilight period lasting until about 1710.

[[Image:Heda hermitage.jpg|thumb|[[Willem Claeszoon Heda]] (17th century): ''Breakfast with a Lobster'']]
Dutch painters, especially in the northern provinces, tried to evoke emotions in the spectator by letting the person be a bystander to a scene of profound intimacy. Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century. many portraits were commissioned by wealthy individuals. Group portraits similarly were often ordered by prominent members of a city's civilian guard, by boards of trustees and regents, and the like. Often group portraits were paid for by each portrayed person individually. The amount paid determined each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. Allegories, in which painted objects conveyed symbolic meaning about the subject, were often applied. Many genre paintings, which seemingly only depicted everyday life, actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings, or conveyed a moralistic message, the meaning of which is not always easy to decipher nowadays. Favourite topics in Dutch landscapes were the dunes along the western sea coast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often a silhouette of a city in the distance.

[[Rembrandt]] had by 1631 established such a good reputation that he received several assignments for portraits from [[Amsterdam]]. In about 1640, his work became more sober, reflecting the family tragedies that he had suffered. Exuberance was replaced by more sincere emotions. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the New Testament instead of the Old Testament. One of his most famous paintings is ''[[Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]'', which was completed in 1642, at the peak of Holland's golden age. The painting was commissioned to be hung in the banquet hall of the newly-built [[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]] (Musketeers' Meeting Hall) in Amsterdam.

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - De Soldaat en het Lachende Meisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Vermeer's ''[[Officer and a Laughing Girl]]'' circa 1657]]
[[Johannes Vermeer]]'s works are admired for their transparent colors, careful composition, and brilliant use of light. Vermeer painted mostly domestic interior scenes, and even his two known landscapes are framed with a window. The interior scenes are usually genre pieces or portraits.

The [[Utrecht School]] refers to a group of painters active in the city of [[Utrecht]] in the Netherlands in the early part of the seventeenth century. It is part of what is called Baroque. They were all strongly influenced by the then recently deceased Caravaggio, who died in 1610. The [[Bamboccianti]] were a group of Dutch genre painters active in Rome from 1625 to 1700, during high and late Baroque. Their works were typically small parlor paintings or etchings of everyday life, including peasants in picturesque scenes.

==Nineteenth century==
===Hague School===
[[Image:George Hendrik Breitner - Gezicht op de Dam te Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|''The Dam, Amsterdam'' (circa 1895) by [[George Hendrik Breitner]]]]
By the 19th century the Netherlands were far behind the up-to-date art tendencies and schools. Possibly the best known Dutch painter in the first half of the 19th century, [[Johan Jongkind|Johan Barthold Jongkind]], after getting an art education in the country, moved over to France and spend most of his life in Paris.

At the same time, Dutch art responded to the realistic tendencies which were developing in France about the same time. The [[Hague School]] were around at the start of the nineteenth century. They included [[Jozef Israëls]]. [[Jacob Maris]] showed all that is gravest or brightest in the landscape of Holland, all that is heaviest or clearest in its atmosphere. "No painter," says M. Philippe Zilcken, "has so well expressed the ethereal effects, bathed in air and light through floating silvery mist, in which painters delight, and the characteristic remote horizons blurred by haze; or again, the grey yet luminous weather of Holland."

[[Amsterdam Impressionism]] was current during the middle of the nineteenth century at about the same time as [[French Impressionism]]. The painters put their impressions onto canvas with rapid, visible strokes of the brush. They focused on depicting the everyday life of the city. Late nineteenth-century Amsterdam was a bustling centre of art and literature. Famous painters among the Amsterdam Impressionists include [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Willem de Zwart]], [[Isaac Israëls]], [[Simon Duiker]] and [[Jan Toorop]]. George Hendrik Breitner introduced a realism to the Netherlands that created shock waves similar to that of [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]'s in France. He was the painter of city views par excellence: wooden foundation piles by the harbour, demolition work and construction sites in the old centre, horse trams on the Dam, or canals in the rain. By the turn of the century Breitner was a famous painter in the Netherlands, as demonstrated by a highly successful retrospective exhibition at Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam (1901). When the streets of Amsterdam are grey and rainy, people of Amsterdam whisper grimly "Echt Breitnerweer" (Typical Breitnerweather).

===Vincent van Gogh===
[[File:Van Gogh Self-Portrait with Straw Hat 1887-Detroit.jpg|thumb|left|''Self-Portrait with Straw Hat'' by Vincent van Gogh, summer 1887]]
[[Vincent van Gogh]] (30 March 1853{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1890) was a [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. After years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness,&lt;ref&gt;Tralbaut (1981), 286,287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1990), 390&lt;/ref&gt; he died aged 37 from a gunshot wound, generally accepted to be self-inflicted (although no gun was ever found). His work was then known to only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.

[[File:Vincent Van Gogh 0013.jpg|thumb|upright|''Painter on the Road to Tarascon'', August 1888, believed to have been destroyed by fire during the Second World War|alt=man wearing a straw hat, carrying a canvas and paintbox, walking to the left, down a tree lined, leaf strewn country road]]

Following his first exhibitions in the late 1880s, van Gogh's fame grew steadily among colleagues, art critics, dealers and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;John Rewald, ''Studies in Post-Impressionism'', ''The Posthumous Fate of Vincent van Gogh 1890–1970,'' pp. 244–254, published by [[Harry N. Abrams]] 1986, {{ISBN|0-8109-1632-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, memorial exhibitions were mounted in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. In the early 20th century, there were retrospectives in Paris (1901 and 1905) and Amsterdam ([[Stedelijk Museum]], 1905), and important group exhibitions in Cologne ([[Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und Künstler]], 1912), New York ([[Armory Show]], 1913) and Berlin (1914).&lt;ref&gt;See Dorn, Leeman &amp; alt.

==Twentieth century==
[[File:Composition, Piet Mondrian, 1916.jpg|thumb|''Composition'' by [[Piet Mondrian]], 1916]]
Around 1905 and 1910 pointillism as practiced by [[Jan Sluyters]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Leo Gestel]] was flourishing. Between 1911 and 1914 all the latest art movements arrived in the Netherlands one after another including [[cubism]], [[futurism]] and [[expressionism]]. After World War I, [[De Stijl]] (the style) was led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and Piet Mondrian and promoted a pure art, consisting only of vertical and horizontal lines, and the use of primary colours. The [[Design Academy]] was established in 1947.

'''Susannah Fowler''' (31 July 1847 – 1897), known by her stage name '''Emily Fowler''', was an English actress, singer and theatre manager. Beginning in [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]], she later played in contemporary drama and English classics. Although she was well-known on the London stage from 1869 to 1881, she is probably best remembered today for creating roles in three of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s early works.

==Early life and career==
Fowler was born in [[Rochdale]], the daughter of a cabinet-maker, Samuel Matthew Fowler, and his wife Sophia ''née'' Fox. She took her stage name, Emily, in honor of her grandmother. She had three siblings, Clarissa, Sophia and Samuel. Her family moved to London before 1860, when her father died. As a teen, Fowler appeared in [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog&gt;[[Kurt Gänzl|Gänzl, Kurt]]. [https://kurtofgerolstein.blogspot.com/2018/06/putting-emily-in-order-w-s-gilberts.html "'Putting Emily in order: W S Gilbert's forgotten lady producer"], Kurt of Gerolstein, 11 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, she joined the [[Royalty Theatre]] as a chorister and was soon made a replacement in the breeches role of Gnatbrain in [[F. C. Burnand]]'s long-running [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]] of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]''.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, William Davenport. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1UM5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA453 ''A Dictionary of the Drama''], London: Chatto &amp; Windus (1904) pp. 339, 453, 545 and 567&lt;/ref&gt; The same year she married John Frederick Fenner, a chorister at the Royalty. The union did not last long, and both parties later married bigamously; he died in 1877. She soon created another burlesque breeches role at the Royalty, Florestein, in [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[The Merry Zingara]]'' (1868).&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt;

==Peak career==
In 1869, at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], she created the role of Alice in Gilbert's ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1869) and also played Butts (a maid) in the companion piece, a play, ''On the Cards''. There she also originated the roles of Paraquita ("Queen of Kokatouka") in ''Columbus'' (1869).&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0GwMZT6Mp3gC&amp;pg=PA5 ''My Lifetime'',] (1895) S. Low, Marston&lt;/ref&gt; Now aged 22, Fowler took over the management of the [[Charing Cross Theatre]] for the 1869–1870 season. There she played [[Mephistopheles]] in a new burlesque, ''Very Little Faust and More Mephistopheles'' (1869) and starred as the hero, Hassan, in a burlesque by Arthur O'Neil of ''[[Arabian Knights]]''&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport. [https://books.google.com/books?id=o0MOWzsgw-gC&amp;pg=PA95 ''A Book of Burlesque, Sketches of English Stage Travestie and Parody''], p. 95, Read Books (2008) {{ISBN|1-4437-4063-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several more plays and burlesques, some by [[Wybert Reeve]]. The theatre historian [[Kurt Gänzl]] speculates that Reeve was Fowler's financial backer.&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt; She also originated the leading part of Hans in the last piece of the season, ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]'', a [[comic opera]] written in 1870, with a libretto by [[W. S. Gilbert]] and music by [[Frederic Clay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S.

Later in 1870 she played in ''Free Labour'' by [[Charles Reade]] at the [[Adelphi Theatre]]&lt;ref name=bio&gt;Blanchard, Edward L., et al.

(1891)&lt;/ref&gt; and at Christmas, she starred at the [[Olympic Theatre]] as Prince Lardi Dardi in a [[pantomime]] of ''[[The White Cat (fairy tale)|The White Cat]]''. She began to build a reputation in drama playing, for example, Kate Bertram in ''The Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherson&gt;Sherson, Erroll. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5AQ71r_JC6YC&amp;pg=PA106 ''London's lost theatres of the nineteenth century''], London: John Lane (1925), pp. 106–08&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, she toured with [[Henry Gartside Neville|Henry Neville]] in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''Elfie'', playing Rosie Aircastle and Sam Willoughby in ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (play)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]''.&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt; In 1872 she was Alfonzo in a burlesque of ''[[Zampa]]'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

With Neville's company in 1873 at the Olympic, she played Florence in ''Mystery'', Kate in ''Sour Grapes'', Martha Gibbs in ''All That Glitters'' and Suzanne in ''The School for Intrigue'', an adaptation of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; The next season at the Olympic, she was Lady Betty Noel in ''Lady Clancarty'' by [[Tom Taylor]]'' and Beatrice in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''.  [[Rutland Barrington]], who appeared with Fowler in ''Lady Clancarty'', called her "one of the most delightful [[soubrette]]s that ever graced the stage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrington|first=Rutland|year=1908|title=Rutland Barrington: A Record of 35 Years' Experience on the English Stage|location=London|publisher=G.

She had never divorced her husband, however, and the marriage ended in 1879 on the grounds of illegality.&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt;

At the [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre|Queen's Theatre]] in 1876, she was Princess Katherine in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. This was followed by a season at the [[St James's Theatre]]. In 1878, she played the title role in [[W. G. Wills]]'s ''Nell Gwynne'' under her own management at the Royalty, and the Viscountess Lidesdale in ''Scandal'' at the same theatre, followed by Perdita in ''[[A Winter's Tale]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]. At the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1879 she played in ''Ellen; or Love's Cunning''. That year she also appeared in ''The Gay Deceivers'' at the Royalty.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; She also toured during this period and played in ''[[As You Like It]]'' with Neville.&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt;

==Last years==
Fowler married a third time, in 1880, to a Captain (later Major) Walter Latham Cox, who appears to have been quartered in Oxfordshire for a time. In 1881 she joined [[Henry Irving]]'s company to play Emily de L'Esparre in a revival of ''[[The Corsican Brothers (play)|The Corsican Brothers]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. Then, for more than a decade Fowler disappeared from the London stage. She seems to have been in China, from where she returned to Britain in 1894 to play Lady Winifred Skipton in ''An Aristocratic Alliance'', an adaptation of ''Le Gendre de M. Poirier'', at the [[Criterion Theatre]] for [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]]. She is not known to have returned to the stage.&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt;

She died in [[Shoreditch]] in the June quarter, 1897, around her 50th birthday.&lt;ref name=Ganzlblog/&gt;

The '''F-rating''' is a rating to highlight women on screen and behind the camera.&lt;ref&gt;http://f-rated.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;
Developed at [[Bath Film Festival]] in 2014, the '''F-rating''' was inspired by the [[Bechdel test|Bechdel Test]] based on a 1985 cartoon strip&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/the-rule|title=dykestowatchoutfor.com  » Blog Archive   » The Rule|website=dykestowatchoutfor.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alison Bechdel]], and popularised in the 2010s by [[Anita Sarkeesian]]'s Feminist Frequency blog, and by Ellen Tejle's A-rating&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-listfilm.com/ A-rating]&lt;/ref&gt; in Swedish cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bechdeltestfest.com/2015/04/10/we-talk-to-ellen-tejil-founder-of-a-rate/ |title=We talk to: Ellen Tejle founder of A Rate! |work=The Bechdel Test Fest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521164412/http://bechdeltestfest.com/2015/04/10/we-talk-to-ellen-tejil-founder-of-a-rate/ |archivedate=2015-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms of the A-rating, Swedish film theorists Ingrid Ryberg, Anu Koivunen and Laura Horak wrote, "The A rating has proved to be an activist provocation that works, and it is important to ask why... The A rating is not about classifying films as feminist or not feminist. It aims to alert viewers who find female sociality compelling to films they might like, and so challenge the industry to make more such films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/swedish-cinema-bechdel-test-works|title=Swedish cinema's use of the Bechdel test is a provocation that works|author=Anu Koivunen|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival developed the F-rating in October 2014 "to take it a step further and highlight films which either had a senior figure in production who was female—a director or a screenwriter—or had very strong female leads or women's issues," according to festival director and F-rating founder Holly Tarquini.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bath-film-festival-2014-movies-with-strong-female-credentials-to-receive-special-frated-certificate-9849238.html|title=Bath Film Festival 2014: Movies with strong female credentials to receive special F-rated certificate|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarquini told the [[BBC]] that films had to meet at least one of three criteria to receive the rating: "If our films have a female director, a female lead who is not simply there to support the male lead, or are specifically about women then they will receive an F-rated stamp of approval." &lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-29739874|title='F-rated' films shown at Bath Film Festival|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the F-rated founder, Holly Tarquini was invited to deliver a TED talk at TEDxYouth@Bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Stories Shape Us {{!}} Holly Tarquini {{!}} TEDxYouth@Bath|date=2016-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMEajG_cvC0&amp;t=1s|accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

The F-rating is a reaction to a phenomenon known as the [[celluloid ceiling]], which has been documented internationally. "[[British Film Institute|BFI]] figures showed that in 2011, 15% of all UK films released were directed by women, but in 2012, this went down to 7.8%.",&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; while a study by "the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University found females made up 15 per cent of protagonists, 29 per cent of major characters and 30 per cent of all speaking characters in the 100 top-grossing films of 2013."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

==Bath Film Festival 2014: first implementation==

Seventeen of the forty-two films received the F-rating, included the First World War drama [[Testament of Youth]], based on [[Vera Brittain]]’s memoir, and director Jean-Marc Vallée’s true-life tale Wild, starring [[Reese Witherspoon]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/11/bath-film-festival-wild-f-rating-feminist-films|title=Bath film festival goes Wild with F rating for feminist films|author=Ben Child|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's magazines Marie Claire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/547748/bath-film-festival-f-rating-given-to-films-with-strong-female-leads.html|title=Bath Film Festival: 'F' Rating Given To Films With Strong Female Leads - Marie Claire|work=Marie Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a19084/bath-film-festival-feminist-rating/|title=Bath Film Festival Announces 'F' Rating For Feminist Films|author=Diana Bruk|work=ELLE}}&lt;/ref&gt; both gave positive coverage to the rating and programme, which were also mentioned in UK Culture Minister [[Ed Vaizey]]'s weekly bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathfilmfestival.org.uk/festival-news/f-rated-goes-viral/|title=Bath Film Festival's F-Rating Goes Viral - Bath Film Festival|work=Bath Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent implementation==

In February 2015, the Bath Comedy Festival announced that it would be the UK's first F-rated comedy festival, with performers including [[Viv Groskop]] and [[Helen Lederer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathcomedy.com/f-rating|title=Bath Comedy Festival - F-Rating|work=bathcomedy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Komedia Bath arranged a meeting to encourage all Bath festivals, including the [[Bath Festival of Children's Literature]] and [[Bath International Music Festival]], and arts organisations to make [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] the first F-rated city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komedia.co.uk/bath/komedia-bath-bids-to-make-bath-the-first-f-rated-city/ |title=Komedia  » Blog Archive   » Komedia Bath bids to make Bath the first F-Rated city |work=komedia.co.uk }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Bath Film Festival programme was 45% F-rated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathfilmfestival.org.uk/content/uploads/2014/07/Bath-Film-Festival-2015.pdf|title=Bath Film Festival 2015 programme|last=|first=|date=November 2015|website=bathfilmfestival.org.uk/|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted more attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34982615|title=Can F-rated films help overcome sexism in Hollywood?|last=Youngs|first=Ian|date=2015-12-04|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 all the independent cinemas and film festivals in the UK were invited to join the F-rating with dozens signing up to F-rated their programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://f-rated.org/we-f-rate/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 The Barbican became the 40th organisation to adopt the rating.

==F-rated keyword added to IMDb==

In January 2017, the F-rated keyword was added to [[IMDb]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-39132867&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2017, there were over 22,400 films on IMDb tagged with the F-rated keyword.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=f-rated&lt;/ref&gt;

The rating was defended by [[GQ|GQ Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gq.com/story/please-dont-use-imdbs-new-feature-to-be-a-dick&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Futurism''' ({{lang-it|Futurismo}}) was an [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[social movement]] that originated in [[Italy]] in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Giacomo Balla]], and [[Luigi Russolo]]. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=The 20th-Century art book|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=dsdLondon|isbn=978-0714835426|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cubism]] contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnason|last2=Harvard|first2=H.|last3=Mansfield|first3=Elizabeth|title=History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography|date=December 2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205259472|pages=189|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important Futurist works included Marinetti's ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]'', Boccioni's sculpture ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'', Balla's painting ''[[Abstract Speed + Sound]]'', and Russolo's ''[[The Art of Noises]]''. Although it was largely an [[Italians|Italian]] phenomenon, there were parallel movements in [[Russia]], [[England]], [[Belgium]] and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even [[Futurist meals]]. To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements [[Art Deco]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and to a greater degree [[Precisionism]], [[Rayonism]], and [[Vorticism]].

==Italian Futurism==
Futurism is an avant-garde movement founded in Milan in 1909 by the Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"/&gt;  Marinetti launched the movement in his ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut28144gut Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''I manifesti del futurismo'', February 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in ''La gazzetta dell'Emilia'', an article then reproduced in  the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on Saturday 20 February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2883730/f1.image Le Figaro, ''Le Futurisme'', 1909/02/20 (Numéro 51)]. Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaai190904-01.2.3&amp;srpos=8&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-futurism------ Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''Declaration of Futurism'', published in Poesia, Volume 5, Number 6, April 1909] (Futurist manifesto translated to English). Blue Mountain Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy"&gt;[http://monoskop.org/images/7/73/Futurist_Aristocracy_1_1923.pdf Futurist Manifesto, reproduced in ''Futurist Aristocracy'', New York, April 1923]&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon joined by the painters [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Gino Severini]] and the composer [[Luigi Russolo]]. Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. "We want no part of it, the past", he wrote, "we the young and strong ''Futurists!''"  The Futurists admired [[speed]], [[technology]], youth and [[violence]], the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over [[nature]], and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality, "however daring, however violent", bore proudly "the smear of madness", dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.

Publishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism, and the Futurists (usually led or prompted by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, religion, clothing and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut00mariuoft I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti, et al, 1914] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;  This committed them to a "universal dynamism", which was to be directly represented in painting.  Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings:  "The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places.  ...

The Futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911 they used the techniques of [[Divisionism]], breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes, which had been originally created by [[Giovanni Segantini]] and others.  Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art.&lt;ref&gt;Severini, G., ''The Life of a Painter'', Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-691-04419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severini was the first to come into contact with [[Cubism]] and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists.  Cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.

[[File:Umberto Boccioni 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Umberto Boccioni]], sketch of ''[[The City Rises]]'' (1910)]]
They often painted modern urban scenes.  Carrà's ''[[The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli|Funeral of the Anarchist Galli]]'' (1910–11) is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in, in 1904.  The action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes.  His ''Leaving the Theatre'' (1910–11) uses a Divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights.

Boccioni's [[The City Rises (Boccioni)|''The City Rises'']]  (1910) represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge, rearing red horse in the centre foreground, which workmen struggle to control.  His ''States of Mind'', in three large panels, ''The Farewell'', ''Those who Go'', and ''Those Who Stay'', "made his first great statement of Futurist painting, bringing his interests in [[Bergson]], Cubism and the individual's complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the 'minor masterpieces' of early twentieth century painting."&lt;ref name=Humphreys&gt;Humphreys, R. ''Futurism'', Tate Gallery, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  The work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time, using new means of expression, including "lines of force", which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space, "simultaneity", which combined memories, present impressions and anticipation of future events, and "emotional ambience" in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;

Boccioni's intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of Bergson, including the idea of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], which Bergson defined as a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it.  The Futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted.  Boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book, ''Pittura scultura Futuriste: Dinamismo plastico'' (''Futurist Painting Sculpture: Plastic Dynamism'') (1914).&lt;ref&gt;For detailed discussions of Boccioni's debt to Bergson, see Petrie, Brian, "Boccioni and Bergson", ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 116, No.852, March 1974, pp.140-147, and Antliff, Mark "The Fourth Dimension and Futurism: A Politicized Space", ''The Art Bulletin'', December 2000, pp.720-733.&lt;/ref&gt;

Balla's ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'' (1912) exemplifies the Futurists' insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement.  The painting depicts a dog whose legs, tail and leash&amp;nbsp;—and the feet of the woman walking it&amp;nbsp;—have been multiplied to a blur of movement.  It illustrates the precepts of the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' that, "On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career.  Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular."&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;  His ''Rhythm of the Bow'' (1912) similarly depicts the movements of a violinist's hand and instrument, rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame.

The adoption of Cubism determined the style of much subsequent Futurist painting, which Boccioni and Severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brush-strokes of divisionism.  But Futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static Cubism of [[Picasso]], [[Braque]] and [[Juan Gris|Gris]]. Although there were Futurist portraits (e.g. Carrà's  ''Woman with Absinthe'' (1911),  Severini's ''Self-Portrait'' (1912), and Boccioni's  ''Matter'' (1912)), it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified Futurist painting—e.g. Boccioni's ''[[The Street Enters the House]]'' (1911), Severini's ''Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin'' (1912), and Russolo's ''Automobile at Speed'' (1913)

In 1912 and 1913, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas.  In ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'' (1913) he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment, which was central to his theory of "dynamism".  The sculpture represents a striding figure, cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the [[Tate Modern]]. (It now appears on the national side of [[Italian euro coins|Italian 20 eurocent coins]]). He explored the theme further in ''Synthesis of Human Dynamism'' (1912), ''Speeding Muscles'' (1913) and ''Spiral Expansion of Speeding Muscles'' (1913).  His ideas on sculpture were published in the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techsculpt.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture |publisher=Unknown.nu |date=1910-04-11 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1915 Balla also turned to sculpture making abstract "reconstructions", which were created out of various materials, were apparently moveable and even made noises.  He said that, after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles, he understood that "the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth ... I felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires, cardboard planes, cloth and tissue paper, etc."&lt;ref name=MartinM&gt;Martin, Marianne W. ''Futurist Art and Theory'', Hacker Art Books, New York, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, personal quarrels and artistic differences between the Milan group, around Marinetti, Boccioni, and Balla, and the Florence group, around Carrà, [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1879–1964) and [[Giovanni Papini]] (1881–1956), created a rift in Italian Futurism.  The Florence group resented the dominance of Marinetti and Boccioni, whom they accused of trying to establish "an immobile church with an infallible creed", and each group dismissed the other as ''passéiste.''

Futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic.  The ''Futurist Manifesto'' had declared, "We will glorify war&amp;nbsp;—the world's only hygiene&amp;nbsp;—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman."&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/manifesto.html |title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements, it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of 1913.&lt;ref name=MartinM/&gt;  Then, fearing the re-election of [[Giovanni Giolitti|Giolitti]], Marinetti published a political manifesto.  In 1914 the Futurists began to campaign actively against the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], which still controlled some Italian territories, and Italian neutrality between the major powers. In September, Boccioni, seated in the balcony of the Teatro dal Verme in Milan, tore up an Austrian flag and threw it into the audience, while Marinetti waved an Italian flag.  When Italy entered the [[First World War]] in 1915, many Futurists enlisted.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Jerry, "Back to the Future", The New Yorker, September 6, 2004, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the war marked several Futurists, particularly Marinetti, who fought in the mountains of Trentino at the border of Italy and Austria-Hungary, actively engaging in propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'The Futurist mountains': Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's experiences of mountain combat in the First World War|journal = Modern Italy|date = 2013-11-01|issn = 1353-2944|pages = 323–338|volume = 18|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/13532944.2013.806289|first = Selena|last = Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combat experience also influenced Futurist music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Futurist War Noises: Confronting and Coping with the First World War|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8fx1p115#page-1|website = California Italian Studies|accessdate = 2015-09-13|last = Daly|first = Selena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of war disguised the fact that Italian Futurism had come to an end. The Florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of 1914.  Boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in 1916.  Severini painted some significant war pictures in 1915 (e.g. ''War'', ''Armored Train'', and ''Red Cross Train''), but in Paris turned towards Cubism and post-war was associated with the [[Return to Order]].

After the war, Marinetti revived the movement.  This revival was called ''il secondo Futurismo'' (Second Futurism) by writers in the 1960s.  The art historian [[Giovanni Lista]] has classified Futurism by decades: "Plastic Dynamism" for the first decade, "Mechanical Art" for the 1920s, "Aeroaesthetics" for the 1930s.

==Russian Futurism==
{{main|Russian Futurism|Cubo-Futurism}}
[[File:Cyclist (Goncharova, 1913).jpg|thumb|[[Natalia Goncharova]], ''Cyclist'', 1913]]
Russian Futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts. The poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] was a prominent member of the movement. Visual artists such as [[David Burlyuk]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Kazimir Malevich]] found inspiration in the imagery of Futurist writings and were poets themselves. It has also a larger impact on the all [[suprematism]] movement. Other poets adopting Futurism included [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and [[Aleksey Kruchenykh]]. Poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the Futurist opera ''[[Victory Over the Sun]]'', with texts by Kruchenykh and sets by Malevich.

The main style of painting was [[Cubo-Futurism]], adopted in 1913 when [[Aristarkh Lentulov]] returned from Paris and exhibited his paintings in Moscow.  Cubo-Futurism combines the forms of [[Cubism]] with the representation of movement.  Like their Italian predecessors the Russian Futurists were fascinated with dynamism, speed and the restlessness of modern urban life.

The Russian Futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past, saying that [[Pushkin]] and [[Dostoevsky]] should be "heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity". They acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to Marinetti, whose principles they had earlier adopted, obstructing him when he came to Russia to proselytize in 1914.

The movement began to decline after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution of 1917]]. Some Futurists died, others emigrated. Mayakovsky and Malevich became part of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] establishment and the [[Agitprop]] movement of the 1920s. Khlebnikov and others were persecuted. Mayakovsky committed suicide on April 14, 1930.

[[File:Casa Sant'Elia.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Futurist architecture]] by [[Antonio Sant'Elia]]]]

==Architecture==
{{further|Futurist architecture}}
The Futurist architect [[Antonio Sant'Elia]] expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for ''La Città Nuova'' (The New City) (1912–1914).  This project was never built and Sant'Elia was killed in the First World War, but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artists.  The city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of Futurist life is projected.  The city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life.  Sant'Elia aimed to create a city as an efficient, fast-paced machine.  He manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects. Baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity.  In the new city, every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy.  The city was not meant to last, and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past.

Futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the Fascist state's tendency towards [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]]-classical aesthetic patterns. Nevertheless, several Futurist buildings were built in the years 1920–1940, including public buildings such as railway stations, maritime resorts and [[post office]]s.  Examples of Futurist buildings still in use today are [[Trento]]'s railway station, built by [[Angiolo Mazzoni]], and the [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella station]] in [[Florence]].  The Florence station was designed in 1932 by the ''Gruppo Toscano'' (Tuscan Group) of architects, which included [[Giovanni Michelucci]] and [[Italo Gamberini]], with contributions by Mazzoni.

==Music==
{{main|Futurism (music)}}
Futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery, and would influence several 20th-century composers.

[[Francesco Balilla Pratella]] joined the Futurist movement in 1910 and wrote a ''Manifesto of Futurist Musicians'' in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand what he had to say. According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the "sublime genius" of [[Wagner]] and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers, for example [[Richard Strauss]], [[Elgar]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Sibelius]]. By contrast, the Italian [[symphony]] was dominated by [[opera]] in an "absurd and anti-musical form". The [[College or university school of music|conservatories]] was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the "rickety and vulgar" operas of [[Puccini]] and [[Umberto Giordano]]. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher [[Pietro Mascagni]], because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled "the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice."

[[Luigi Russolo]] (1885–1947) wrote ''[[The Art of Noises]]'' (1913),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Russolo |first=Luigi |url=http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |title=The Art of Noises on Theremin Vox |publisher=Thereminvox.com |date=2004-02-22 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607122724/http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html The Art of Noises] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094533/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential text in 20th-century musical aesthetics. Russolo used instruments he called ''[[intonarumori]]'', which were [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] [[noise]] generators that permitted the performer to create and control the [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of several different types of noises. Russolo and Marinetti gave the first concert of Futurist music, complete with ''intonarumori'', in 1914. However they were prevented from performing in many major European cities by the outbreak of war.

Futurism was one of several 20th-century movements in art music that paid homage to, included or imitated machines. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] has been seen as anticipating some Futurist ideas, though he remained wedded to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/papers/lombardi.html |title=Daniele Lombardi in ''Futurism and Musical Notes'' |publisher=Ubu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russolo's ''intonarumori'' influenced [[Stravinsky]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[George Antheil]], [[Edgar Varèse]],&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt; [[Stockhausen]] and [[John Cage]]. In [[Pacific 231]], Honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive. There are also Futurist elements in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''The Steel Step'' and in his Second Symphony.

Most notable in this respect, however, is the American [[George Antheil]]. His fascination with machinery is evident in his ''Airplane Sonata'', ''Death of the Machines'', and the 30-minute ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]''. The ''Ballet Mécanique'' was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by [[Fernand Léger]], but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone. The score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three [[xylophones]], four bass drums, a tam-tam, three airplane propellers, seven electric bells, a siren, two "live pianists", and sixteen synchronized player pianos. Antheil's piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play.

Other composers offered more melodic variants of Futurist music, notably [[Franco Casavola]], who was active with the movement at the invitation of Marinetti between 1924 and 1927, and [[Arthur-Vincent Lourié]], the first Russian Futurist musician, and a signatory of the St Petersburg Futurist Manifesto in 1914. His five ''Synthèses'' offer a form of dodecaphony, while ''Formes en l'air'' was dedicated to Picasso and is a Cubo-Futurist concept. Born in Ukraine and raised in New York, [[Leo Ornstein]] gave his first recital of 'Futurist Music' at the Steinway Hall in London on 27 March 1914. According to the [[Daily Sketch]] newspaper ''"one listened with considerable distress. Nothing so horrible as Mr Ornstein's music has been heard so far. Sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital."''

==Dance==
The Futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man's ultimate fusion with the machine.  The altitude of a flying plane, the power of a car's motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man's intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience.  The dancer no longer performs a story, a clear content, that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most famous futuristic dancers was the Italian {{Ill|Giannina Censi|it}}. Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her "Aerodanze" and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry. Through these words, she explains: " I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... I made myself a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled,... And the face had to express what the pilot felt."&lt;ref&gt;Klöck, A. (1999) ''Of Cyborg Technologies and Fascistized Mermaids: Giannina Censi’s ‘Aerodanze’ in 1930s Italy'', Theatre Journal 51(4): 395–415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/overview/futurism Juliet Bellow, ''Futurism and Dance'', Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism, 305], American University, 09/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{main|Futurism (literature)}}
Futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with F.T. Marinetti's ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909), as it delineated the various ideals Futurist poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominate medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem).  The Futurists called their style of poetry ''parole in libertà'' (word autonomy) in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.

Theater also has an important place within the Futurist universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.
There are a number of examples of Futurist novels from both the initial period of Futurism and the neo-Futurist period, from Marinetti himself to a number of lesser known Futurists, such as  Primo Conti, Ardengo Soffici and Giordano Bruno Sanzin (''Zig Zag, Il Romanzo Futurista'' edited by Alessandro Masi, 1995). They are very diverse in style, with very little recourse to the characteristics of Futurist Poetry, such as 'parole in libertà'. Arnaldo Ginna's 'Le ''locomotive con le calze'''(Trains with socks on)plunges into a world of absurd nonsense, childishly crude. His brother Bruno Corra wrote in ''Sam Dunn è morto'' (Sam Dunn is Dead) a masterpiece of Futurist fiction, in a genre he himself called 'Synthetic' characterized by compression, and precision; it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony.

[[File:Blast2.jpg|thumb|The cover of the last edition of ''[[BLAST (magazine)|BLAST]]'', the [[literary magazine]] of the British [[Vorticist]] movement, a movement heavily influenced by Futurism]]
Many Italian Futurists supported [[Fascism]] in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural, archaic South. Like the Fascists, the Futurists were Italian nationalists, radicals, admirers of violence, and were opposed to parliamentary democracy. Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party (''Partito Politico Futurista'') in early 1918, which was absorbed into [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Fasci di combattimento]]'' in 1919, making Marinetti one of the first members of the [[National Fascist Party]]. He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, calling them "reactionary", and walked out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrawing from politics for three years; but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944. The Futurists' association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work, especially in [[architecture]]. After the [[Second World War]], many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime.

Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Fascist Italy but failed to do so.  Mussolini chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the [[Novecento Italiano]] group in 1923, he said, "I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art.  Art belongs to the domain of the individual.  The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braun, Emily, ''Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism'', Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's mistress, [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as Marinetti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento group, and even persuaded Marinetti to sit on its board.  Although in the early years of Italian Fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced, towards the end of the 1930s, right-wing Fascists introduced the concept of "[[degenerate art]]" from Germany to Italy and condemned Futurism.

Marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant-garde with each.  He moved from Milan to Rome to be nearer the centre of things.  He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, married despite his condemnation of marriage, promoted religious art after the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 and even reconciled himself to the Catholic Church, declaring that Jesus was a Futurist.

[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943), lampada a grattacielo, 1929.jpg|thumb|An example of Futurist design: "Skyscraper Lamp", by the Italian architect [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], 1929]]
Although Futurism mostly became identified with Fascism, it had leftist and anti-Fascist supporters.  They tended to oppose Marinetti's artistic and political direction of the movement, and in 1924 the socialists, communists and anarchists walked out of the Milan Futurist Congress. The anti-Fascist voices in Futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and the Italo-German [[Pact of Steel]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus, Günther, "New Research on Futurism and its Relations with the Fascist Regime", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 2007, Vol. 42, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;  This association of Fascists, socialists and anarchists in the Futurist movement, which may seem odd today, can be understood in terms of the influence of [[Georges Sorel]], whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum.

Futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture.

===Aeropainting===
{{main|Aeropittura}}
Aeropainting (''aeropittura'') was a major expression of the second generation of Futurism beginning in 1926.  The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters,&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |title=Osborn, Bob, ''Tullio Crali: the Ultimate Futurist Aeropainter'' |publisher=Simultaneita.net |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090815/http://www.simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |archivedate=2010-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offered aeroplanes and [[aerial landscape art|aerial landscape]] as new subject matter.  Aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment, including realism (especially in works of propaganda), abstraction, dynamism, quiet Umbrian landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;" ... dal realismo esasperato e compiaciuto (in particolare delle opere propagandistiche) alle forme asatratte (come in Dottori: ''Trittico della velocità''), dal dinamismo alle quieti lontane dei paesaggi umbri di Dottori ... ." ''L'aeropittura futurista'' http://users.libero.it/macbusc/id22.htm&lt;/ref&gt; portraits of Mussolini (e.g. Dottori's ''Portrait of il Duce''), devotional religious paintings, decorative art, and pictures of planes.

Aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of 1929, ''Perspectives of Flight'', signed by [[Benedetta]], [[Depero]], [[Gerardo Dottori|Dottori]], [[Fillìa]], Marinetti, [[Enrico Prampolini|Prampolini]], [[Somenzi]] and [[:it:Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)|Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)]]. The artists stated that  "The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective" and that "Painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything." Crispolti identifies three main "positions" in aeropainting: "a vision of cosmic projection, at its most typical in Prampolini's 'cosmic idealism'  ... ; a 'reverie' of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairy-tale (for example in Dottori ...); and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery (particularly in [[Tullio Crali|Crali]], but also in Tato and Ambrosi)."&lt;ref&gt;Crispolti, E., "Aeropainting", in Hulten, P., ''Futurism and Futurisms'', Thames and Hudson, 1986, p.413&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters.  Major figures include [[Fortunato Depero]], [[Enrico Prampolini]], [[Gerardo Dottori]] and Crali. Crali continued to produce ''aeropittura'' up until the 1980s.

==Legacy==
Futurism influenced many other twentieth-century art movements, including [[Art Deco]], [[Vorticism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and much later [[Neo-Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, Neo-Futurism. Published by: Architectural Association School of Architecture https://www.jstor.org/stable/29543561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pinkus, ''Self-Representation in NeoFuturism and Punk''. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press https://www.jstor.org/stable/3190376&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct, having died out in 1944 with the death of its leader Marinetti.

Nonetheless, the ideals of Futurism remain as significant components of modern [[Western culture]]; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture. [[Ridley Scott]] consciously evoked the designs of [[Antonio Sant'Elia|Sant'Elia]] in ''[[Blade Runner]]''. Echoes of Marinetti's thought, especially his "dreamt-of metallization of the human body", are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture, and surface in [[manga]]/[[anime]] and the works of artists such as [[Shinya Tsukamoto]], director of the ''Tetsuo'' (lit. "Ironman") films. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the literary genre of [[cyberpunk]]—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the [[Internet]], such as [[Stelarc]] and [[Mariko Mori]], produce work which comments on Futurist ideals. and the art and architecture movement Neo-Futurism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/18509/facts.yes_is_more_an_archicomic_on_architectural_evolution.htm Yes is More.

Since 1889, London: Phaidon, 2012 http://www.architecturaldigest.com/ad/books/2012/jean-louis-cohen-future-of-architecture-book-article&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement in theatre began in 1988 with the creation of the [[Neo-Futurist]] style in Chicago, which utilizes Futurism's focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. Currently, there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/neofuturists-tml-twenty-five-years-history-anniversary/Content?oid=11871597 |title=Too Much Light at 25: An oral history |last1=Potter |first1=Janet |date=16 December 2013 |website=Reader |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Futurist ideas have been discerned in Western dance music since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1367-at-club-to-club-festival-dance-musics-growing-embrace-of-futurism-reigns/ At Club to Club Festival, Dance Music’s Growing Embrace of Futurism Reigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]'s 1986 album 'Futurista' was inspired by the movement. It features a speech from Tommaso Marinetti in the track 'Variety Show'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muzines.co.uk/articles/stranger-in-a-strange-world/1043 Ryuichi Sakamoto interview published ''Music Technology Magazine'' in August 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Italian director [[Marco Bellocchio]] included Futurist art in his feature film ''[[Vincere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MoMA {{!}} Finding The Robot|url = http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/02/06/finding-the-robot|website = www.moma.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] featured the exhibition "Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/futurism/ "Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe", Solomon R.

[[Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art]] is a museum in London with a collection centered around Italian futurist artists and their paintings.

== Early life and education ==
Wong Kwok-choi was born in 1970 in Hong Kong. Due to concerns about the future of Hong Kong at the time, Wong was sent away at the age of 14 to Long Island in the United States as a secondary school pupil.&lt;ref name=20140309mingpao&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131033/http://www.ol.mingpao.com/cfm/style5.cfm?File=20140309%2Fsta13%2Fuaa1.txt "生活達人﹕以抗爭藝術復修家園"].

"Building Dreams / 看透是一種藝術 – A look at 黃國才 (Kacey Wong)s delicate works", ''[[Muse (Hong Kong magazine)|Muse]]'' (2008),&lt;/ref&gt; He has practiced internationally as an architect and artist.

== Career ==
Upon graduation from university, Wong worked as an architect for nearly six years in New York, Japan, and Hong Kong, in the fields of graphic, interior and architectural design. He set up in independent practice.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; Finding that the professional world as an architect did not allow for the degree of freedom he desired, he gave up a well-paid professional career and left for further studies in England.&lt;ref name=20140309mingpao/&gt;&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; After finishing the masters programme in London in 1998, Wong returned to Hong Kong and taught sculpture and art appreciation at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] for two years.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Cover story". ''iMag'', 3 November 2000, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong later became Assistant professor in the school of design at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, until 2015.&lt;ref name=polyukacey/&gt;&lt;ref name=muse/&gt;

In 2003, Wong was bestowed the Rising Artist Award by the Hong Kong Arts Council and Outstanding Arts Education Award.&lt;ref name=polyukacey/&gt; The [[Hong Kong Museum of Art]] awarded Wong their Hong Kong Contemporary Arts Award in 2012.&lt;ref name=ecozine/&gt;

== Works ==
Wong stated that most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without identity or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering.&lt;ref name=20140309mingpao/&gt;&lt;ref name=2011raw&gt;[http://issuu.com/rawmagazine/docs/rawmagazinefinalonline?mode=window&amp;viewMode=doublePage "Kacey Wong is 'Superbeast'"]. ''Raw Magazine'', No. 1. December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, his repertoire has taken on a political dimension.

=== Space ===
''Home'' (1999), ''Personal Skyscraper'' (2000), and ''City Space'' (2001) were exhibitions where Wong was both exhibitor and curator.

"10 Boxes: Everything I've Ever Thought About, I Put Inside a Box" in 2000 was Wong's first solo exhibition. The series of ten sculptures, housed in wall-mounted boxes, each having its own name, explores a different theme or spatial relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Ralph (21 April 2000). "Box of tricks". ''South China Morning Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Office Block'' symbolises the power structures within companies; ''Only You'' is based on romantic relations; ''Destroy Them'' treats subjects like education and childhood influences.&lt;ref&gt;Binks, Hilary. "Boxed In". ''World Sculpture News'' (spring 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Wong created ''Wandering Home'', an installation consisting of a mobile home conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]].&lt;ref name=20091115singtao&gt;"「大鐵人」反思港人蝸居苦". ''Sing Tao Daily'', 15 November 2009 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small tin hut on the back of a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house is not exactly a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in [[Sham Shui Po]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mobilizing the Homeless", pg. HK-4, ''China Daily'' (Hong Kong edition), 24 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"三個車轆裝起流浪的心", pg. A26. ''Ming Pao'', 4 January 2008 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lai, Ying-kit (4 January 2008). "Tricycle mobile home offers little comfort for the homeless". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Wong created ''Tin Man No.11'', an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed.&lt;ref name=whatsnext&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsnext30x30.com/guest-artists/kacey-wong/|title=KACEY WONG黄国才 |publisher=whatsnext30x30.com|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; He extended the concept by creating ''Famiglia Grande'', a series of transformable cases.&lt;ref name=20091115singtao/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"一個流動豪宅之夢／Kacey Wong Dream of Street Sleepers", ''AM 730''. 12 April 2010 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I, Robot", ''Plan Magazine'', March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Morar dentro de um carro", ''Sabado'', 22 April 2010 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.&lt;ref name=time2008795&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2008795,00.html|title=An Art Boom in Hong Kong|date=16 August 2010|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work ''Paddling Home'', a {{convert|4|x|4|ft|abbr=on}} floating house, was set to sea in January 2010. The work, symbolising the Hong Kong's property market where the accommodation is high-density, small and pricey, was selected at the Hong Kong &amp; Shenzhen Bi City Biennale of Urbanism Architecture exhibition that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/culture/art/20100121/13646972|title=Two Men Show展場：海|date=21 January 2010|work=Apple Daily |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpaper.org/Story.aspx?ID=470103|script-title=zh:以藝術呈現樓市的迷思 |date=24 September 2013|work=Macau Daily|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design includes tiled walls, wooden floorboards, bay windows, a television, air-conditioning, roof space from which to drive a few golf balls and a 5-horsepower outboard motor.&lt;ref&gt;"Il était un petit... houseboat". ''Moteur Boat'', Oct 2010, pp. 22–23 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeWolf, Christopher (17 January 2010). "Art show that's struggling to stay afloat", pg. 3, ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; It was priced at a [[Numbers in Chinese culture#Eight|symbolical HK$888,888]] ($114,000). Wong said that, as the square foot price is [an astronomical] HK$55,555, ''Paddling Home'' is an ironic statement comparing the perils of owning a glitzily- and glossily-packaged high end residence to being on the high seas.&lt;ref&gt;"16方尺漂流屋「售」88.8888萬". ''Sing Tao Daily'', 4 December 2009 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in 2012, Wong said he considers ''Paddling Home'' his most challenging work to date.&lt;ref&gt;"Kacey Wong", ''Time Out'' (Hong Kong). 9–22 May 2012, pg 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ballball.jpg|thumb|190px|''Ball Ball'' (2014)]]
He published a photographic book, ''Drift City 2000–2010'', as the culmination of a ten-year project where he travelled the world and superposed himself as a cardboard skyscraper (Skyscraper Man) in different surroundings as a critique of modernism.&lt;ref name=headline92806&gt;[http://hd.stheadline.com/beauty/beauty_content.asp?contid=92806&amp;srctype=g "紙皮大廈披上身 黃國才十載遊離都市"]. Headline News. ''Sing Tao Daily'', 20 December 2010 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the project, Wong collected images from over 20 locations around the world, including one at the Egyptian pyramids made when he and his wife were on honeymoon in 2002. That image cost him a three-hour art lecture to police who demanded a substantial "photography fee".&lt;ref name=headline92806/&gt;

=== Environmentalism ===
Wong became interested in environmentalism through visiting a waste reprocessing centre in Hong Kong, and realising just how little was recycled. His works re-use or recycle materials obtained from rubbish tips.&lt;ref name=20130129goasia/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecozine/&gt; In 2010, Wong curated "Memory of the Forest", a collection of animal sculptures by himself and 13 students made using discarded wood, which symbolises the animals' lost habitats.&lt;ref name=2011raw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://programme.rthk.hk/rthk/tv/programme.php?name=tv/theworks&amp;d=2010-05-11&amp;p=2453&amp;e=108455&amp;m=episode|date=11 May 2010|title=The Works :Ai Weiwei in Hong Kong; Movie Review – "Iron Man 2"; Hong Kong Turkish Film Festival; "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"; "Memory of the Forest"|publisher=RTHK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"香港雕塑發展新貌", AM 730. 31 May 2010 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"黃國才", ''U Magazine'', April 2010 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong contributed a similar "Mega Musical Art Piece" to the 2012 Hong Kong Cleanup campaign in the form of an octopus.&lt;ref name=20130129goasia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkcleanup.org/en/content/hong-kong-cleanup-exhibit "The Hong Kong Cleanup Exhibit"]. Hong Kong Cleanup, 18 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Wong participated in a campaign of the [[Ocean Recovery Alliance]] in Hong Kong in April 2013, contributing ''Death by Amputation'' – a sculpture of a life-sized [[Shark finning|finned shark]] – to an exhibition in [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]] harbour in the hope that it will provoke thought on the source of food and the cruelty inflicted by humans on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1210975/ocean-film-festival-conjures-goddess-sharks|title=Ocean film festival conjures up goddess of sharks|work=South China Morning Post| date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20130409/51338681|script-title=zh:垃圾升華變藝術  另類保育海洋 |date=9 April 2013|work=Apple Daily |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"廢材藝術品喚醒保育海洋". pg. 46.

=== Protest art ===
Wong cites his political awakening being in 2011, following the arrest of mainland artist [[Ai Weiwei]].&lt;ref name=20140309mingpao/&gt;&lt;ref name=artnet273789/&gt; He responded by forming a group named Art Citizens (藝術公民), and rallied some 2,000 artists to march for Ai on 23 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/04/135985475/hong-kong-graffiti-challenges-chinese-artists-arrest|title=Hong Kong Graffiti Challenges Chinese Artist's Arrest|date=4 May 2011|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apple18878618/&gt; As curator for the group, he put together a month-long exhibition that opened on 26 May named "Love the Future" (愛未來) – a pun on Ai's name – with works of over 50 artists.&lt;ref name=henders&gt;

Fond of quoting Ai, Wong believes that art and politics are indissociable, and that no art is completely without political connotation. Wong sees art as one of the organic elements in the mix of political movements, playing an indirect and auxiliary role.&lt;ref name="arts-news.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecozine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecozine.com/article/kacey-wong|title=Kacey Wong|author=Wong, Esther |date=8 May 2013|work=Ecozine}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has variously participated in the annual [[Hong Kong 1 July marches|1 July protest marches]] riding in a pink armoured personnel carrier, walking around with a facsimile washing machine on his head, and guiding a 10-foot red robot he created.&lt;ref name=20140309mingpao/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"城市夢遊"， ''Next Magazine'', 13 September 2012 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20130701/18318313|script-title=zh:藝術家製道具讓市民進擊　 10呎「共人」諷吃人政權 |date=1 July 2013|work=Apple Daily |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the march on 1 July 2014, Wong created the “Warning Squad", where he and several people dressed as police officers holding parody banners inspired by those increasingly seen used by police officers at protests. His signs included “Love the Party” – echoing the CPC slogan  “Love the country, love the Party”  (愛國愛黨) – “Fake Commie”; “Party-State” referring to the one-party state within China; “Reddening” referring to the gradual infiltration of the communist ethos into Hong Kong; “Land Grabbing” referring to the land acquisition for development in the Northeast New Territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2014/07/15/warning-squad-polices-repression-of-pro-democracy-protesters/|title=Protest art criticises police 'repression' of pro-democracy activists |work=Hong Kong Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kacey blind side.jpg|thumb|260px|Wong drawing portraits during the Umbrella Revolution]]Wong was highly active during the [[Umbrella Revolution]]: he held a contest for the best logo to elevate awareness and generate more concern for the demand for "real universal suffrage" for Hong Kong. Using social media as a "safe platform" for universal participation, he generated considerable awareness and received entries from all over the world.&lt;ref name=artnet121249&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/art-world/artists-design-logos-for-hong-kongs-umbrella-revolution-121249|title=Best designs for the Hong Kong Umbrella Revolution|author= Li, Zoe|date=3 October 2014|work=artnet News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-silva/branding-a-revolution_b_6017088.html|title=Branding a Revolution|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc29407067&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29407067|title=How the humble umbrella became a HK protest symbol|date=29 September 2014|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20140929SCMPchow&gt;Chow, Vivienne (29 September 2014).

''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Wong held sessions where he would draw a person's portrait in one minute without looking at the paper &amp;ndash; the concept inspired by [[Nelson Mandela]]'s maxim "It always seems impossible until it's done". He also co-founded [[Umbrella Movement Art Preservation]], to make an inventory of works and their locations at protest sites, aiming to rescue key pieces before police clearances.&lt;ref name=20141116bostonglobe&gt;Sataline, Suzanne (16 November 2014).

For his personal exhibition in March 2015 entitled "Resisting Against Absurdity", Wong reunited pieces he created for previous protest marches and added new works:&lt;ref name=artnet273789/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1735273/hong-kong-artists-break-loose-confines-market-forces-amid-art-basel|title=Hong Kong artists break loose from confines of market forces amid Art Basel|date=11 March 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular the ''Black Cop Candle'' – a set of wax statues of policemen in riot gear and raised batons. These symbolise the seven "black" (meaning corrupt) cops who beat up a protester and who were caught on film so doing during the 2014 protests; lighting the candles would melt them and transform them into light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Artists-take-stock-of-the-Umbrella-Movement/37299 |title=Artists take stock of the Umbrella Movement |date=17 March 2015 |work=The Art Newspaper |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320185212/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Artists-take-stock-of-the-Umbrella-Movement/37299 |archivedate=20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Lifestyle/Entertainment/Arts/Frame-Up/2015/03/17/Art-and-politics-collide-at-Art-Basel-Hong-Kong/|title=Art and politics collide at Art Basel Hong Kong |date=17 March 2015 |work=The Star|location=Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other roles ===
Wong co-founded Street Design Union to study and advance the role of artists and designers in the socio-political sphere.&lt;ref name=ecozine/&gt; Since 2001, he has taken his "Personal Skyscraper Workshops" to primary schools to encourage children to admire the architecture. He does this by having pupils create wearable architectural clothing with foam boards and paper.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt;

In 2016, the [[M+]] in Hong Kong commissioned Wong to create the "M+ Rover" – a mobile gallery for their schools outreach programme. The Rover was created out of a hollowed-out container in which was installed a wooden interior using disused pallets to create the feel of a whale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westkowloon.hk/en/whats-on/current-forthcoming/m-rover&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==
Wong is an avid fan of war-games – an activity he partakes in every week which he says helps with mental agility. He also enjoys diving.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; Wong and his wife Margaret live with Ballball – a cat which had lost an eye in an accident. Wong chose to adopt him over other cats because he was unique.&lt;ref name=2011raw/&gt;&lt;ref name=artplus42&gt;"黃國才", pp 16–19, ''Art Plus''. No. 41 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong said: "Imagine you were to go to a pet shop and ask for a one-eyed cat... 'Sorry we don't do those' would be the response".&lt;ref name=artplus42/&gt;

'''''La Gommeuse''''' {{IPA-fr|la ɡɔmøz|}} is a 1901 [[oil on canvas]] painting by the Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. It dates from his so-called [[Picasso's Blue Period | Blue period]] and is noted for its caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Mañach painted on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Mark|title=Blue period Picasso – with a little secret – goes under the hammer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/09/picasso-la-gommeuse-blue-period-auction|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Anita|title=The US billionaire who got two Picassos for the price of one|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/11922971/The-US-billionaire-who-got-two-Picassos-for-the-price-of-one.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was offered for sale ''ex'' the [[Bill Koch (businessman) | William I.

''Gommeuse'' was sexually charged slang of the time for café-concert singers and their songs.&lt;ref name= "Sotheby's"/&gt;

== Background ==

The painting was executed in the second half of 1901 following Picasso's successful exhibition at the [[Vollard]] gallery that June. This was at the start of his [[Picasso's Blue Period | Blue period]] of 1901 to 1904, thought to have been occasioned by the suicide of his friend [[Carlos Casagemas]] earlier in the year, a time when his paintings were somewhat melancholic and characterized by somber monochromatic tones in blue and green.&lt;ref name= "Sotheby's"/&gt;

The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Mañach on the reverse is inscribed "Recuerdo a Mañach en el día de su santo", demonstrating the painting was intended as a gift for Mañach on his Saint's Day (29 June). Mañach was a Catalan anarchist who shared Picasso's studio flat in the [[Boulevard de Clichy]]. He worked as a talent scout for art dealers and was responsible for organising Picasso's successful 1901 Vollard show.

The '''Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois''' -- also known as '''Landmarks Illinois''' -- is a [[not-for-profit organization]] founded in 1971 to prevent the demolition of the [[Dankmar Adler]] and [[Louis Sullivan]] designed [[Chicago Stock Exchange#History|Chicago Stock Exchange Building]].  Although this effort failed the organization has grown to become a 2000-member statewide voice for historic preservation.

The founding mission was "to stop the demolition of significant buildings in downtown Chicago."  The LPCI has broadened its scope and geography "to embrace architecturally and historically significant archeological sites, structures, and historic districts in all the cities, towns and rural areas of Illinois."  Today LPCI holds conservation easements on 341 properties.  Among the historic buildings they have saved are the [[Marquette Building (Chicago)|Marquette Building]] and the [[Reliance Building]].

Landmarks Illinois was involved in a highly publicized preservation effort to save Mies van der Rohe's [[Farnsworth House (Plano, Illinois)|Farnsworth House]] from being dismantled and relocated from its original site along the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]].  Modern architecture enthusiasts from around the globe answered the call to donate funds, and the house was purchased at auction from Sotheby's on December 12, 2003.  A rare example of freestanding single family design by van der Rohe, the house is now operated by Landmarks Illinois and open to the public for tours.

In addition to preserving buildings, Landmarks Illinois has since 2007 also held an annual gala to acknowledge "Legendary Landmarks", described as "citizens who have made contributions to the civic and cultural life of Chicago and Illinois."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cultural stalwarts gain legendary status | work = Chicago Sun Times | date = March 7, 2007 | last = Lenoir | first = Lisa | page = 49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Medici Madonna''''' is an [[panel painting|oil-on-panel]] painting by the [[early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish]] artist [[Rogier van der Weyden]], dating from around 1460–1464 and housed in the [[Städel]], [[Frankfurt]], Germany.

The work is known to have been commissioned by the [[Medici]] family in [[Florence]], as testified by the Florentine coat of arms with a red lily at the center of the lower step. The work has been variously dated from 1450–1451, when the artist travelled to Rome visiting several Italian courts, or from 1460–1464, the same years of the ''[[Lamentation of Christ (Rogier van der Weyden)|Lamentation of Christ]]'', inspired by [[Beato Angelico]] and now at the [[Uffizi]].

==Description==
Above a gold background, van der Weyden painted a baldachin lined with precious [[damask]] cloth, under which are the [[Virgin with Child]], St. Peter, St. John the Baptist (patron saint of Florence), St. Cosmas (a protector of the House of Medici), and St. Damian.  [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas]] is portrayed while putting a coin in a handbag hanging from his belt, a reference of his legend, according to which he had accepted a small sum for  a medical performance, causing rage in his brother Damian.

In the foreground is a still life with the artist's typical attention to natural details. In the centre is a gilt metallic [[amphora]], in which are several lilies: the white ones symbolize the Virgin's purity, while the red ones are another reference to Florence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">[[File:Milan - Pinacothèque de Brera - Cour intérieure.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in [[Milan]].]]
A '''pinacotheca''' ({{lang-la|pinacotheca}} borrowed from {{lang-el|πινακοθήκη}}, πίναξ "(painted) board, tablet" + θήκη "box, chest") was a picture gallery in either [[ancient Greece]] or [[ancient Rome]]. The name is specifically used for the building containing pictures which formed the left wing of the [[Propylaea]] on the [[Acropolis]] at [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. The Pinacotheca was located right by the [[temple of Athena Nike]]. Though [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (Bk. I., xxii. 6) speaks of the pictures "which time had not effaced," which seems to point to [[fresco painting]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}, the fact that there is no trace of preparation for [[stucco]] on the walls shows that the paintings were [[easel]] pictures ([[J. G. Frazer]], ''Pausanias's Description of Greece'', 1898, ii. 252). The Romans adopted the term for the room in a private house containing pictures, statues, and other works of art.

In the modern world the word is often used as a name for a public [[art gallery]] concentrating on paintings, mostly in Italy (as "Pinacoteca"), such as the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]] of the [[Vatican Museums]] (which is usually meant when the plain word is used), the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in Milan (more often "the Brera" informally), with others in [[Bologna]], [[Siena]], and [[Turin]]. In [[Brazil]], there is the [[Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo]]. In [[Paris]], the [[Pinacothèque de Paris]]. In [[Munich]] the three main galleries are called the [[Alte Pinakothek]] ([[old master]]s), [[Neue Pinakothek]] (19th century) and [[Pinakothek der Moderne]]. At Hallbergmoos, near Munich Airport, there was the Pinakothek Hallbergmoos (20th and 21st century) between 2010 and 2014.

The '''prompter''' (sometimes '''prompt''') in a [[Theater (building)|theatre]] is a person who prompts or cues [[actor]]s when they forget their lines or neglect to move on the [[stage (theatre)|stage]] to where they are supposed to be situated.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2010), Pavis (1998, 289), and Taylor (1993, 253—254).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, many of the earlier duties of the prompter are undertaken by the [[Stage management|stage manager]], who will have a copy of the script called the '''prompt book'''.&lt;ref name=ken&gt;Kennedy (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most definitive version of the script for any one performance, and will contain details of all [[cue (theatrical)|cues]], with their precise timings with respect to the action on stage. &lt;ref name=hart&gt;Hartnoll and Found (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the prompt to direct [[Lighting design|lighting]], [[Sound design|sound]], [[fly system|flying]] effects and scene changes during a show. The prompt book also often contains [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] notes, so that the prompt is always aware of the intended positions and movements of all the actors on stage at any given time.

In some [[professional]] and high-quality [[community theatre]] productions, the prompt is never used during a [[performance]] to instruct actors if they forget a line or movement, only during a [[rehearsal]]. If prompting is absolutely necessary, it is done very quietly by another actor on-stage.

The prompt is located on the stage, in the [[prompt corner]] or "prompt side".&lt;ref name=ken/&gt;

In Elizabethan theatre the function of prompting was filled by the Book-Holder, who was also in charge of [[stage prop|prop]]s and calls.&lt;ref name=hart/&gt;

A '''protagonist''' ({{ety|grc|''πρωταγωνιστής'' (protagonistes)|one who plays the first part, chief actor}}) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dprwtagwnisth%2Fs πρωταγωνιστής], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/protagonist "protagonist"]. [[Dictionary.com]], [[Random House]]. Retrieved November 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; is the leading character of a story.

The protagonist is at the center of the story, makes the key decisions, and experiences the consequences of those decisions. The protagonist is the primary agent propelling the story forward, and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles. If a story contains a [[subplot]], or is a narrative made up of several stories, then each subplot may have its own protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Stephen. ''A Guide to Screenwriting Success: Writing for Film and Television''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield (2006) {{ISBN|9780742553019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protagonist is the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the [[antagonist]]. The antagonist will provide obstacles and complications and create conflicts that test the protagonist, thus revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=protagonist&amp;searchmode=none|title=protagonist - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==
The earliest known examples of a protagonist are found in [[Ancient Greece]]. At first, dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus. Then in ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] describes how a poet named [[Thespis]] introduced the idea of one actor stepping out and engage in a dialogue with the chorus. This was the invention of tragedy, and occurred about 536 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, K.O. ''History of the literature of Ancient Greece''. [Library of Useful Knowledge.] Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. London (1840) page 306&lt;/ref&gt; Then the poet [[Aeschylus]], in his plays, introduced a second actor, inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters. [[Sophocles]] then wrote plays that included a third actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/protagonist|title=Protagonist - literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Poetics''. Oxford University Press (January 20, 2013) {{ISBN|978-0199608362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Packard (author)|Packard, William]]. ''The Art of the Playwright''. Thunder’s Mouth Press. 1997 {{ISBN|1-56025-117-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Storey, Ian. Allan, Arlene. ''A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama''. John Wiley &amp; Sons (2008) {{ISBN|9781405137638}}. page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of the protagonist's origin cited that during the early period of Greek drama, the protagonist served as the author, the director, and the actor and that these roles were only separated and allocated to different individuals later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=0jhjDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT235&amp;dq=protagonist+definition+classical+greece&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDk7mB5PPeAhUmrlQKHXCxDT4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=protagonist%20definition%20classical%20greece&amp;f=false|title=Moreno's Personality Theory and its Relationship to Psychodrama: A Philosophical, Developmental and Therapeutic Perspective|last=Telias|first=Rozei|date=2018-07-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351021081|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a claim that the poet did not assign or create the protagonist as well as other terms for actors such as ''deuteragonist'' and ''tritagonist'' primarily because he only gave actors their appropriate part.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=lgpaDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT513&amp;dq=protagonist+protagonistes+classical+greece&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL0faS5PPeAhXT0J8KHbm9DSkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=protagonist%20protagonistes%20classical%20greece&amp;f=false|title=History of the Literature of Ancient Greece|last=Bart|first=M. P.|date=2018-03-22|publisher=Charles River Editors|isbn=9781632956316|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these actors were assigned their specific areas at the stage with the protagonist always entering from the middle door or that the dwelling of the ''[[deuteragonist]]'' (second most important character) should be on the right hand, and the ''[[tritagonist]]'' (third most important character), the left.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Ancient Greece, the protagonist is distinguished from the term "hero", which was used to refer to a human who became a semi-divine being. in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama|last=Storey|first=Ian|last2=Allan|first2=Arlene|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2008|isbn=1405102144|location=Malden, MA|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[Euripides]]' play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'' may be considered to have two protagonists. Phaedra is the protagonist of the first half, who dies partway through the play. Her stepson, the titular Hippolytus, assumes the dominant role in the second half of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Euripides. ''Hippolytos''. Oxford University Press (October 29, 1992) {{ISBN|978-0195072907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ibsen]]’s play ''[[The Master Builder]]'', the protagonist is the architect Halvard Solness. The young woman, Hilda Wangel, whose actions lead to the death of Solness, is the antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Ibsen, Henrik. Meyer, Michael Leverson. editor. ''Ibsen Plays: 1: Ghosts; The Wild Duck; The Master Builder''. Dramatists Play Service Inc. (1980) {{ISBN|9780413463302}}. page 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shakespeare’s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Romeo is the protagonist. He is actively in pursuit of his relationship with Juliet, and the audience is invested in that story. Tybalt, as an antagonist, opposes Romeo and attempts to thwart the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''Romeo and Juliet''. Bloomsbury Arden Shakespeare; Third edition (July 15, 2012) {{ISBN|9781903436912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shakespeare’s play ''[[Hamlet]]'', Prince Hamlet, who seeks revenge for the murder of his father, is the protagonist. The antagonist would be the character who most opposes Hamlet, Claudius (though, in many ways, Hamlet is his own antagonist).&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''Hamlet''. Simon &amp; Schuster (July 1, 1992) {{ISBN|978-0743477123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, a work will have a [[false protagonist]], who may seem to be the protagonist, but then may disappear unexpectedly. The character Marion in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) is an example.&lt;ref&gt;Kolker, Robert Phillip. ''Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho: A Casebook''. Oxford University Press (2004) {{ISBN|9780195169195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A novel that contains a number of narratives may have a number of protagonists. [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''[[The First Circle]]'', for example, depicts a variety of characters imprisoned and living in a [[gulag]] camp.&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader: New and Essential Writings, 1947–2005: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn'', Edward E. Ericson, Jr., Daniel J. Mahoney.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'', depicts fifteen major characters involved in or affected by a war.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Charles. 1992. ''Encyclopedia of Russian Literature''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 298–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Little Women]]'' boasts a cast of over five diverse females struggling with the inevitability of the crossing between childhood and womenhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14932247|title=A hunger for home : Louisa May Alcott's place in American culture|last=Sarah.|first=Elbert,|date=1987|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813511992|location=New Brunswick|oclc=14932247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Jane's spiritual and emotional growth captivate the social criticism of its day, exploring heavy subjects such as [[classism]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[religion]], and [[proto-feminism]] during the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charlotte Brontë's Novels: The Accents of Persuasion|last=Martin|first=Robert B|publisher=Norton|year=1996|isbn=|location=NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Peter and Wendy]], ''[[Wendy Darling]]'' is the protagonist.

In some cases, the protagonist is not a human: in [[Richard Adams]]' novel ''[[Watership Down]],'' a group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] rabbits, led by the protagonist Hazel, escape their warren after seeing a vision of its destruction, starting a perilous journey to find a new home.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Richard, 1920-2016.

'''"Replacements"''' is a [[short story]]  by American writer [[Lisa Tuttle]]. It concern a husband's surfacing insecurities as his wife's independence strengthens when she claims a bloodsucking pet for her very own.

Tuttle declared in an interview with M. M. Hall from ''Fantastic Metropolis'': "My first post-natal story to deal with in any way with motherhood was “Replacements”, written when my daughter was only seven months old. Make of that what you will…".&lt;ref name="fantastic"&gt;[http://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/i/tuttle/full/   The Mysterious Q&amp;A with Lisa Tuttle with M.M. hall]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Replacements" has been widely reprinted since being first published in 1992, both in Tuttle's own short story collections and various writers anthologies. It was also included on various "best of" anthologies in the year.
  
== Summary ==
As Stuart commences his walk to work, he notices  an animal "about the size of a cat, naked looking, with leathery, hairless skin and thin, spiky limbs that seemed too frail to support the bulbous, ill-proportioned body." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0452274893/ ''American Gothic Tales'': edited with introduction by Joyce Carol Oates, New York: Plume, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; Disgusted and horrified by the appearance of this animal, he crushes it with his foot. Immediately,  he is remorseful and his first instinct is to call his wife Jenny. Since he is not sure what her reaction will be, he waits to call her at the normal time in the afternoon. She is not able to take his call and does not return the call either. Stuart calls again, only to find that she has left work early. This, being unlike her, worries Stuart and he returns home as soon as possible.

Once home, he finds that Jenny brought one of the "creatures" with her. Stuart shows strong dislike towards the creature and wants Jenny to get rid of it. The two argue about what to do with Jenny's new "pet" but never come to a resolution. The creature begins taking up more of Jenny's time and attention. She also does abnormal activities with the creature (letting it drink blood from her). As this progresses, Stuart is regarded less and less and becomes very distanced from Jenny. Eventually, Jenny says that she is going to keep it whether Stuart likes it or not. Stuart then decides that he cannot live with the creature and the woman Jenny has become, and he moves out.

He begins to notice these creatures more and more. The women at work, women on the streets - every woman he sees seems to have one of these creatures. One evening while on his way home from work, he notices a woman sitting opposite with a gold chain that brings back memories. After leaving the train at the same stop as the woman, he strives to come up with something to say, but he sees the chain linked to one of the "pets" he despises and immediately lets her walk away. He absentmindedly walks to his old house where he sees the creature longing to be outside and he longing to be in.

==Adaptations==
The story was adapted for the 12th episode of ''[[The Hunger (TV series)|The Hunger]]'' season 2, also titled "Replacements" (28 November 1999).

{{Culture of Poland}}
'''Socialist realism in Poland''' ({{lang-pl|'''socrealizm'''}}) was a social, political, and esthetic doctrine enforced by the pro-Soviet communist government in the process of [[Stalinization]] of the postwar [[People's Republic of Poland]]. The official policy was introduced in 1949 by a decree of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] minister (later, Minister of Culture and Art) [[Włodzimierz Sokorski]]. As in all Soviet-dominated [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, [[Socialist realism]] became the main instrument [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|of political control]] in the building of [[totalitarianism]] in Poland. However, the trend has never become truly dominant. Following [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death on March 5, 1953, and the subsequent [[De-Stalinization]] of all [[People's Republic]]s, Polish artists, writers and architects started abandoning it around 1955. The De-Stalinization process peaked during the [[Polish October]].

==History==
[[File:KulturpalastWarschau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Palace of Culture and Science in [[Warsaw]] built using Soviet-drawn [[blueprint]]s in 1952–1955]]
The policy was enforced in Poland between 1949 and 1956 amidst the wave of gross human rights abuses committed by [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|the state security forces]]. It involved all domains of cultural politics including visual, music and literary arts, though its most spectacular achievements were made in the [[Culture of Poland#Architecture|field of architecture]]. The objectives of this new trend were explained in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was declared a key weapon in the creation of a new [[social order]]. It was intended to help spread the communist ideology by influencing citizens' consciousness as well as their outlook on life.

During this massive undertaking, a crucial role fell to designers perceived not as merely architects creating streets and edifices, but rather as "[[engineers of the human soul]]". The idea extended beyond aesthetics and into principles of [[urban design]] meant to express grandiose expectations and arouse [[Propaganda of success|feelings of stability]] and [[Propaganda in the Polish People's Republic|political power monopoly]] in [[Stalinist Poland]].

==Local characteristics==
[[File:Ministry of Agriculture Warsaw.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ministry of Agriculture, Warsaw, built 1953–1956]]
Since the [[Renaissance in Poland#Polish Renaissance architecture|style of the Renaissance]] was generally regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was to become Poland's socialist national format. However, in the course of incorporating these principles into new ideology, major changes were also introduced. One of these was to more closely reflect [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet architecture]], which resulted in the majority of new buildings blending into one another. The all-encompassing Stalinist vision propagated by the Soviet Union was best exemplified by the new [[Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw|Joseph Stalin Palace of Culture and Science]] (''Pałac Kultury i Nauki imienia Józefa Stalina'') constructed in [[Warsaw]] between 1952 and 1955.&lt;ref name="Palace-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/ckulturf/pages/publications/mz/architect.htm |title=The Height of (Architectural) Seduction: Reading the "Changes" through Stalin's Palace in Warsaw, Poland |author=Magdalena J. Zaborowska |accessdate=2008-04-18 |publisher=Centre for Cultural Research, University of Aarhus }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its design was based on [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|similar skyscrapers built in the USSR]] at that time. The 3,500 builders were brought in directly from the Soviet Union with their own blueprints, and housed in a suburban shantytown.&lt;ref name="Palace-2" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestufs.net/download/conferences/Warsaw_May07/BESTUFS_Warsaw_May07_Conference_Leaflet.pdf |publisher=Best Urban Freight Solutions |title=Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science |date=May 24, 2007 |format=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monumental form disseminated by the Communist Government reached its apogee with the construction of an entire new town near [[Kraków]] along with a [[steel mill]] soon to become the biggest in Poland. [[Nowa Huta]] was [[central planning|centrally planned]] as a major new centre of heavy industry, against substantial resistance from middle-class Cracovians. Its Main Square (''Plac Centralny'') was surrounded by huge blocks of flats populated by a new class of industrial workers employed at the [[Lenin]] Steelworks. Notably, the [[socrealism|socrealist]] centre of Nowa Huta is currently considered a monument of architecture. Other prominent examples of urban design included Marszałkowska Housing Estate (MDM) in Warsaw, Kościuszkowska Housing Estate (KDM) in [[Wrocław]], Main Station [[Gdynia Główna]], a housing estate in [[Kowary]], and the Palace of [[Upper Silesian Coal Basin|Coal-Basin]] Culture in [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]].

==Painting and sculpture==
[[File:Wojciech-Weiss-Manifest(1950-painting).jpg|thumb|left|upright|"Manifesto" by [[Wojciech Weiss]], 1950]]
Socialist [[realism (arts)|realism]] in [[Culture of Poland#Art|Polish art]] was confined to portraits of party leaders and various depictions of muscular labourers and battle scenes, with special attention paid to popular taste. Formally inspired by [[Neoclassicism]] as well as the local folk art, socrealism served strictly political and [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|pro-Soviet propaganda]] purposes; however, its most notable artists, such as [[Wojciech Weiss]] and [[Włodzimierz Zakrzewski]] were educated before Stalinism and inadvertently adhered to traditional Western techniques and technologies. Some of the most blatantly socrealist paintings were: "Pass-on the brick" (''Podaj cegłę'') [http://www.malarze.com/obraz.php?id=683&amp;l=pl pictured here], by [[Aleksander Kobzdej]], and "Thank you tractor operator" (''Podziękowanie traktorzyście'') [https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4qAnzEopvGc/R8HonUO9tGI/AAAAAAAAIJM/zjB3p8ty0Q0/w799-h599-no/P2230167.JPG pictured here], as well as "Comrade [[Bierut]] among labourers" (''Towarzysz Bierut wśród robotników'') by Helena and Juliusz Krajewski.
[[File:Socrealizm.jpeg|thumb|upright|Socialist-Realist [[allegory|allegories]] surrounding the [[Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw]]]]

In sculpture, there was a trend toward stone-carved allegories elevating the common worker, used mainly for architectural purposes, such as those surrounding the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, including mostly plaster busts of communist [[apparatchik]]s. The collection of Polish socrealist sculpture is exhibited at Kozłówka Palace near [[Lubartów]].

==Film and music==
{{see also|Socialist realism in Polish literature}}
While the socialist realism doctrine in [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet cinema]] originated around the time of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] ([[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]], [[Alexander Dovzhenko|Dovzhenko]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin|Pudovkin]]) and reached its peak in the 1930s, it did not have sufficient time to develop in postwar Poland. Therefore, the cult of the communist party remained alien to the local film industry. Among the more creative [[Cinema of Poland|Polish films]] loosely adhering to principles of socialist realism were ''Celuloza'' by [[Jerzy Kawalerowicz]], ''Pokolenie'' by [[Andrzej Wajda]] and ''Piątka z ulicy Barskiej'' by [[Aleksander Ford]]. The ideological stereotype gave birth to some inferior productions as well, such as ''Uczta Baltazara'' by Jerzy Zarzycki and Jerzy Passendorfer.

In [[Culture of Poland#Music|music]], the trend was limited to art song, film soundtrack, and pop-song based on local [[traditional music|folk tradition]]. Communist ideals were glorified in lyrics. Among the prominent composers were [[Jan Maklakiewicz]]: "Śląsk pracuje i śpiewa" (''Silesia Works and Sings''), Alfred Gradstein: "Na prawo most, na lewo most" (''A Bridge on the Right, and a Bridge on the Left''), and [[Andrzej Panufnik]]: "Symfonia Pokoju" (''The Symphony to Peace''). Widely promoted popular songs included "O Nowej to Hucie piosenka" (''This Song is about Nowa Huta'') [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWCAsbEgZzo&amp;feature=related featured here with the video]. The song is still well remembered by most Polish people of the older generation.

Following Stalin's death, and especially from 1953 on, critical opinions were heard with increasing frequency. Finally, as part of the [[Polish October|Gomułka political thaw]] from within the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], the entire doctrine was officially given up in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball King (2007), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=94LDaZ3efUYC&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;vq=thaw&amp;dq=%22Leon%20Kruczkowski%22&amp;lr&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q=thaw&amp;f=false  Western Drama Through the Ages]'' Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Houdini custom.jpg|alt=A close-up of Houdini staring to the camera|thumb|The Society grew under Harry Houdini's leadership—he is pictured here in 1920 in the middle of his tenure]]
Founded on May 10, 1902 in the back room of [[Martinka]]'s magic shop in New York, the Society expanded under the leadership of [[Harry Houdini]] during his term as National President from 1917–1926. Houdini sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians. Wherever he traveled, Houdini would give a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, making speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense.

For most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini, at his own expense, had been recruiting local magic clubs to join the SAM in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization.  Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join. As had happened in London, Houdini persuaded magicians to join.  The Buffalo club joined as the first branch, (later assembly) of the Society.  Chicago Assembly No. 3 was, as the name implies, the third regional club to be established by the S.A.M., whose assemblies now number in the hundreds. In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Three's charter, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past. Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere. This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic. In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold.  By the end of 1916, magicians' clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited  were offering to become assemblies.  He had created the richest and longest surviving organization of magicians in the world.

The SAM now embraces over 5,000 members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide. In July, 1926, Houdini was elected for the ninth successive time President of the Society of American Magicians. Every other president has only served for one year. He also was President of the Magicians' Club of London.&lt;ref name="Houdini!"&gt;{{cite book| author = Kenneth Silverman| title = Houdini!

==The Society of Young Magicians==
The Society of Young Magicians (SYM) is an organization devoted to assisting magicians, age seven through seventeen years. The Society of Young Magicians has clubs, known as "assemblies" located throughout the world; these assemblies are commonly jointly associated with an adult SAM assembly. When a member turns 18, they have the option to graduate to full membership in the Society of American Magicians.

The purpose of the Society of Young Magicians is to promote interest in [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] as a hobby that develops skill and self-confidence, the ability to speak in public, discipline that comes from learning, practicing and performing magic and a sense of service to others through helping others learn magic and by performing magic at charitable events.

The Society of Young Magicians has nearly 100 local chapters, or assemblies, around the world. Adult members of the Society of American Magicians supervise and instruct members of the SYM.

Dan Rodriguez is the SYM National Director. SYM's principal means of communication among its members is its e-zine, "The Magic SYMbol."

==Conventions==
The S.A.M. national convention is held annually, usually over the Fourth of July weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://magicsam.com/annual-convention/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724062502/http://magicsam.com/annual-convention/ |archivedate=2014-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Star Athletica, LLC v. Varsity Brands, Inc.''''', 580 U.S. ___ (2017), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case in which the Court decided under what circumstances aesthetic elements of "useful articles" can be restricted by [[copyright]] law. The Court created a two-prong "separability" test, granting copyrightability on conditions of separate identification and independent existence. In other words, the aesthetic elements must be identifiable as art if mentally separated from the article's practical use and must qualify as copyrightable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works if expressed in any medium.

The case concerned a dispute between two clothing manufacturers, [[Star Athletica]] and [[Varsity Brands]]. Star Athletica began creating [[cheerleading uniform]]s with [[Stripe (pattern)|stripes]], [[zigzag]]s, and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] insignia similar to some made by Varsity, produced at a far lower price point. Varsity sued Star Athletica for [[copyright infringement]] and Star Athletica claimed the clothing designs were uncopyrightable because their aesthetic designs were tied so closely to and guided by their utilitarian purposes as uniforms. The Court rejected this argument with a close reading of the statute and established that the clothing designs, as aesthetic elements of the useful article of clothing, could be copyrightable. The Court had declined to hear Star Athletica's follow-up question concerning whether Varsity's specific designs were original enough to be copyrightable, so that part of the case remained unaddressed and Varsity's copyright registrations stood.

The Court's conclusion that aesthetic elements of useful articles, and thereby clothing design elements, could be copyrighted excited [[fashion designer]]s and [[intellectual property]] scholars. Some loved the decision because they saw extending copyright to clothes as parity with other [[creative industries]] that had enjoyed copyrights for much longer. Others denounced the Court's opinion over ambiguities in how to enforce the new rules and because of its potential to end [[Fad|fashion trends]] in generic clothing.

==Background==
===Historical copyrightability and Varsity Brands===
At one time, clothing designs were [[Copyright law of the United States#Works subject to copyright law|not subject to copyright law]], or "uncopyrightable," in the United States. In 1941, the Court heard ''[[Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC]]'', which considered the [[fashion industry]]'s practice of boycotting sale of their "high fashion" works at places that would sell knock-offs made by other companies for lower prices, so-called "style piracy". The court ruled against [[Fashion Originators' Guild of America|the Guild]], saying that this practice of attempting to create a [[monopoly]] outside of the copyright system suppressed [[Free market|free competition]] and violated the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|312|457|1941|name=Fashion Originators' Guild of America v. FTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, outside fashion, ''[[Mazer v. Stein]]'' established in 1954 that an artistic statue created to adorn a lamp base could be copyrightable separately from the utilitarian lamp under expansions from the [[Copyright Act of 1909]]. The statue's mass-production alongside the lamp did not invalidate that.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|347|201|1954|name=Mazer v. Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another barrier to copyrightability in the United States is a certain vague [[Threshold of originality#United States|threshold of originality]] that must be met to be eligible for an intellectual property monopoly like a copyright or [[patent]]. In 1964's ''[[Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.]]'', the Court agreed with a lower court's ruling that Stiffel's popular lamp design was not original enough to warrant a patent preventing the lamp's sale by [[Sears]], rescinding that restriction and passing the design to the [[public domain]]. The Court's opinion indicated that the same logic would apply to an inappropriate copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|376|225|1964|name=Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] changed the copyright law to allow copyrighting aesthetic features of "useful articles,"&lt;ref name="HLR"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2017/11/star-athletica-l-l-c-v-varsity-brands-inc/ |title=Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc. |date=2017-11-04 |website=Harvard Law Review |access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information."&lt;ref name="17USC101"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was intended to better incorporate the ''Mazer v. Stein'' ruling&lt;ref name ="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Robert Kastenmeier |author-link=Robert Kastenmeier |url=https://www.copyright.gov/history/law/clrev_94-1476.pdf |date=1976-09-03 |title=House of Representatives Report No. 94-1476 |publisher=United States House of Representatives |page=105 |access-date=2018-07-21 |quote=Section 113 deals with the extent of copyright protection in "works of applied art." The section takes as its starting point the Supreme Court's decision in ''Mazer v. Stein'', 347 U.S. 201 (1954), and the first sentence of subsection (a) restates the basic principle established by that decision.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while clarifying the difference between the copyrightability of "[[applied art]]" and the more traditional, lesser restriction of "[[industrial design]]," the overall combination of features, provided by [[design patent]]s or [[trade dress]]. The Act said "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features" of useful articles were copyrightable only if "separable" from the utilitarian aspects of the design and capable of existing independently of the article.&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Fromer |first=Jeanne C. |last2=McKenna |first2=Mark P. |date=2018-05-30 |title=Claiming Design |journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review |volume=167 |ssrn=3186762}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broad definitional language lead to a proliferation of about ten competing, inconsistent legal tests for that separability,&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ginsburg |first=Jane C. |date=2016-09-01 |title='Courts Have Twisted Themselves into Knots': US Copyright Protection for Applied Art |url=https://lawandarts.org/article/courts-have-twisted-themselves-into-knots-u-s-copyright-protection-for-applied-art/ |journal=The Columbia Journal of Law &amp; the Arts |language=en |location=Rochester, NY |volume=40 |issue=1 |ssrn=2837728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2016/05/02/supreme-court-dives-into-copyright-fight-over-cheerleader-uniforms/#224b16325244 |title=Supreme Court Dives Into Copyright Fight Over Cheerleader Uniforms |last=Fisher |first=Daniel |date=2016-05-02 |website=Forbes |language=en |access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state of affairs criticized for appearing to have judges serve as art critics.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;

Because clothes have both aesthetic and utilitarian features in their designs, they fall under this useful article category; therefore, the shapes and cuts of clothing are not copyrightable. Designs placed on clothing were opened up to the possibility of copyrightability, subject to those tests.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt; Practically, the law was construed to mean that copyrighted two-dimensional designs could be placed on clothing, and fabric pattern sheets could be copyrighted before being cut to make clothing, but an article of clothing's overall color scheme and design could not be copyrighted because it was not capable of existing independently of the final useful article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt; |date=December 22, 2014 |title=''Compendium of US Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition'' |url=https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/docs/compendium-12-22-14.pdf |publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]] |page=41 |section=924.3(A) Clothing Designs |access-date=July 11, 2018 |quote=Clothing such as shirts, dresses, pants, coats, shoes, and outerwear are not eligible for copyright protection because they are considered useful articles.

Therefore, a fabric or textile design may be registered if the design contains a sufficient amount of creative expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[fashion designer]]s bristled under these rules, wondering why other creative industries like [[Film industry|films]] or [[Music industry|music]] were allowed to restrict access to their products with copyright and they were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/business/yourmoney/that-looks-familiar-didnt-i-design-it.html?mtrref=undefined |title=That Looks Familiar.

===Star Athletica lawsuit===
[[File:Uniform designs at issue in Star Athletica v Varsity Brands.png|thumb|left&lt;!-- to avoid conflict with the infobox --&gt;|The five cheerleading uniform designs involved in the case]]
Star Athletica was founded in January 2010 as a subsidiary of The Liebe Company. Varsity Brands accused Star Athletica of being created in retaliation for Varsity cancelling a deal with The Liebe Company's sports lettering subsidiary, aided by former Varsity employees knowledgeable about Varsity designs. Later that year,&lt;ref name="WhoOwnsCheerleaderUniforms"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/sports/who-owns-cheerleader-uniform-designs-its-up-to-the-supreme-court.html |title=Who Owns Cheerleader Uniform Designs? It’s up to the Supreme Court |last=Smith |first=Erin Geiger |date=2016-10-31 |website=The New York Times |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varsity Brands filed suit against Star Athletica for infringing five of its copyrighted designs for cheerleading uniforms.&lt;ref name="slipop2quote"&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2 (quoting [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22Star+Athletica%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40006&amp;case=7992815185039286726&amp;scilh=0 2014 WL 819422], *8-*9 (WD Tenn., Mar. 1, 2014)).&lt;/ref&gt; The Star Athletica designs were not exactly identical, physically or graphically, but Varsity's general description of allegedly copied elements in court filings, "the lines, stripes, coloring, angles, V’s [or chevrons], and shapes and the arrangement and placement of those elements," suited both designs and the case moved forward.&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt; Varsity also sued for [[trademark infringement]] under the [[Lanham Act]]&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt; and Star Athletica counter-sued Varsity under the Sherman Antitrust Act for allegedly monopolizing the cheerleading industry,&lt;ref name="VarsityBrief"&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/15-866-respondent-merits.pdf Brief of the Respondents] (Sep. 14, 2016), Star Athletica, LLC v.

In 2014, the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee]] ruled Star Athletica's favor on the grounds that the designs were not eligible for copyright restriction. According to [[United States federal judge|Judge]] [[Robert Hardy Cleland]], a design without the distinctive marks like chevrons and zigzags would not identifiable as cheerleading uniforms, so the designs were not separately identifiable. They were not conceptually separable because the marks, if viewed outside the context of the clothing, would have still evoked the idea of a cheerleading uniform.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

The district court's decision was reversed on [[appeal]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] with the majority of Judge [[Karen Nelson Moore]] joined by Judge [[Ralph B. Guy Jr.]]. Firstly, Moore said the district court should have deferred to the fact that the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]]'s trained personnel had granted the copyright registrations in the first place. On the questions of the case, Moore evaluated the competing separability tests, but ended up creating a new five-step test for the Circuit's analysis. In short, they found that the designs were copyrightable because  the clothes had the utility of being athletic wear and removing the designs did not affect that utility. She said the design could be separately identifiable because it could be held "side by side" with a blank dress and there would be no utilitarian difference, and it could certainly exist independently because the individual aspects like chevrons could appear in designs on other clothing items. Moore also said that a ruling in favor of Star Athletica would have rendered all paintings uncopyrightable because they decorated the rooms where they hung. Judge [[David McKeague]] dissented because of a disagreement over the application of one of the test's steps. The third step asked the court to determine the useful article's "utilitarian aspects." Instead of the majority's more general assessment of athletic wear, McKeague would have defined the uniforms as clothing the body "in an attractive way for a special occasion" and "identify[ing] the wearer as a cheerleader;" therefore, the aesthetic features could not be separated from the utilitarian to him.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

Star Athletica filed to be heard by the United States Supreme Court in January 2016. On May 2, 2016 the Court granted ''[[certiorari]]'' "to resolve widespread disagreement over the proper test for implementing §&amp;nbsp;101's separate-identification and independent-existence requirements." Star Athletica also wanted the Court to decide if Varsity's specific designs were sufficiently original to be copyrighted, but the Court declined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-866.htm ''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 1; see also ''No. 15-866'' (docket), United States Supreme Court] (last visited April 15, 2017) ("May 2, 2016 Petition GRANTED limited to Question 1 presented by the petition.")&lt;/ref&gt;

In their view, copyrighting the uniform designs would unduly stretch Congress's intent to copyright minor detailing on industrial designs like floral engravings on silverware, carvings in the backs of chairs, or prints on t-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Star-Athletica.pdf Brief of Intellectual Property Professors as ''Amicus Curiae''], ''Star Athletica, LLC v.

Varsity received an endorsement from the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]], which believed that extending copyright to clothing designs was critical to prevent exploitative copyists and preserve the United States's rapid rate of expansion in the worldwide fashion industry, representing $370 billion in domestic consumer spending and 1.8 million jobs.&lt;ref name="CouncilBrief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhoOwnsCheerleaderUniforms"/&gt; The [[Fashion Law Institute]] shared these interests and advised that a decision to copyright clothing designs would be a proper reading of the ''Mazer v.

Varsity Brands, Inc.'', No. 15-866, 580 U.S. ___ (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Both criticized the "fast-fashion" industry of duplicating expensive designs with increasingly-cheap 3D printing technology without paying the original creators.&lt;ref name="CouncilBrief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FashionLawBrief"/&gt; The Institute spoke highly of "geek fashion," including cosplay, as a burgeoning part of the industry rife with copyrightable expression.&lt;ref name="FashionLawBrief"/&gt; The [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] also supported Varsity. In part, the government claimed that the question of a proper separability analysis was unnecessary because, in creating the designs as drawings, Varsity had received a copyright for them and reserved the exclusive ability to reproduce that design however they chose in any medium. They pointed to a concession from Star Athletica that if, hypothetically, Varsity controlled ''[[The Starry Night]]'', Varsity would be able to restrict the printing of the painting on dresses.&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesBrief"&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/15-866_amicus_respondent_united_states.pdf Brief of United States as ''Amicus Curiae''], ''Star Athletica, LLC v.

The government also argued that, in applying the requested conceptual separability analysis, what mattered was that a uniform stripped of the design "remain[ed] similarly useful" when compared to the original. A blank dress was equivalent to a designer dress, so the design was copyrightable in the eyes of the government.&lt;ref name="UnitedStatesBrief"/&gt;

Star Athletica's lawyers gave the Court examples of how the graphic designs were utilitarian. For instance, the colors and shapes were arranged to create [[optical illusion|optical effects]] like the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] and deliberately change the cheerleader's appearance to make them appear taller, thinner, and generally more appealing. They considered this distinct from applying a pre-existing two-dimensional image to the uniform because the lines required for those illusions to function needed to be properly located on properly fitted uniforms.&lt;ref name="ViewFromTheCourtroom" /&gt; According to them, people often made those sorts of deliberately utilitarian decisions about their clothing to make themselves look better or happier.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/in-a-copyright-case-justices-ponder-the-fashion-industry.html |title=In a Copyright Case, Justices Ponder the Meaning of Fashion |last=Liptak |first=Adam |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 31, 2016 |website=The New York Times |access-date=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, were those designs placed on another object, such as a lunchbox, they would not be serving that utilitarian purpose anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/303599-justice-weigh-cheerleading-uniform-designs |title=Justices weigh cheerleading uniform designs |last=Balluck |first=Kyle |date=2016-10-31 |website=TheHill |language=en |access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associate Justice|Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], in particular, rejected that line of argument, citing the fact that the examples presented in evidence were two-dimensional works. In her view, it did not matter that the submitted designs were "superimposed" on three-dimensional uniforms&amp;mdash;the designs were submitted in two-dimensional images, so the designs were separated from the uniforms and copyrightable. After all, both parties agreed that the physical, three-dimensional uniform's cut and how it physically framed the body was not copyrightable. They were interested in the colors and aesthetic designs that were applied to the useful article.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt; She was not comfortable with vagueness she perceived in how Star Athletica wanted the Court to decide when a given two-dimensional design "is what makes an article utilitarian" when that design could conceivably be placed on anything.&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/11/argument-analysis-justices-worry-about-killing-knockoffs-with-copyright/ |title=Argument analysis: Justices worry about 'killing knockoffs with copyright' |last=Mann |first=Ronald |date=2016-11-01 |publisher=SCOTUSblog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] felt much the same and added that the designs did more than sit practically on the body because they sent a "particular message" that distinguished it from a blank dress, namely that the wearer was "a member of a cheerleading squad." Receiving this expression leaned him toward thinking of it as copyrightable expression.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt;

The members of the Court also considered more abstract aspects of the case. For example, it was unclear how a decision in Varsity's favor might affect military-style [[camouflage]] patterns and whether or not they could be restricted if fashion designs were copyrightable. Varsity supported the idea of camouflage copyrights, although Justice [[Elena Kagan]] pointed out the clear utilitarian function of camouflage patterns: concealment. On the industry side, women's fashion alone was a concern worth hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide. Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] speculated that the price of dresses could conceivably double if copyright terms were applied to designs and knock-off brands couldn't compete at lower prices.&lt;ref name=NYTOct31 /&gt; Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and he questioned Varsity over their concerns of monopolization effects, such as a uniform design becoming part of a school's brand identity and compelling them to buy exclusively from Varsity during a century of copyright restriction. In the end, Breyer expressed worry that designers or lawyers might resort to simply copyrighting drawings to sue over the design of any dress or suit.&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"/&gt; Sotomayor, formerly a representative of [[Fendi]] in cases brought against knock-offs, wondered aloud if a decision for Varsity would destroy those knock-offs brands, although she was not sure if that would be a bad thing.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtHearsArguments"/&gt; Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wondered whether it was "the domain of copyright to [restrict] the way people present themselves to the world."&lt;ref name="ArgumentAnalysisJusticesWorry"/&gt;

Breyer also got attention in the media for his aphorism about the purpose of fashion, "The clothes on the hanger do nothing; the clothes on the woman do everything." Kagan thought the sentiment was "so romantic."&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtHearsArguments"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ViewFromTheCourtroom" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTOct31/&gt;

Varsity Brands |last=Quinn |first=Gene  |last2=Brachmann |first2=Steve |date=2017-03-22 |website=IPWatchdog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas rejected arguments from Varsity and the United States that separability analysis was unneeded,&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; but also did away with all the lower court tests used previously. Instead, the opinion provided one canonical two-part test based on the statute and the ''Mazer v. Stein'' decision:&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...an artistic feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection if the feature '''(1)''' can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and '''(2)''' would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work either on its own or in some other medium if imagined separately from the useful article.&lt;ref name=slipop11&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After applying this test to the cheerleading uniforms, the Court ruled in Varsity's favor that the designs were separable from the useful article and could be copyrighted.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop10&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The separability analysis started with the admittedly permissive first requirement, identifying the designs as separately identifiable "pictoral, graphical, or sculptural works." The design needed to be able to exist independently, and Thomas concluded that the design did when it appeared in other media, such as the two-dimensional drawings submitted to the Copyright Office. In Thomas's view, this conceptual separation would not necessarily recreate the useful dress because the design's elements like the chevrons could appear on items in different contexts,&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop7-8&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and they did not conjure uniform even when that context was other items of clothing.&lt;ref name=slipop10/&gt; This analysis moved the consideration away from whether the item left after separation was useful, to solely whether or not the design itself was useful. A feature incapable of being separated was a utilitarian feature anyway, Thomas said.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop7-8/&gt;

Addressing concerns that this would grant control over more than the design, Thomas pointed out that the separated aesthetic element could not, itself, be a useful article. Someone also couldn't copyright a design and then exert control over its physical representation. A drawing a or small model of a car, copyrighted, could not restrict production of the functional automobile with the same body by a competitor. The car drawing would not suppress a rival car manufacturer in the automobile market, so Varsity's uniform drawing would not suppress Star Athletica in the uniform market because their uniforms could have the same cut.&lt;ref name=slipop7-8/&gt;

The final section of the opinion discussed objections to the decision raised by the parties in their briefs. There were no requirements that there be an equivalent useful article remaining after the design element was conceptually removed or that the removed element be "solely artistic." Thomas said discussions of the blank dress were unnecessary because the statute did not require the remaining work to be useful or "similarly useful," as the government had put it, because all that mattered was if the separated element was a pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work. Thomas said that adopting this requirement would have overruled ''Mazer'' because the reason the statue in that case was considered "applied art" was because the 1909 Act had removed an earlier distinction between aesthetic and useful works of art. That distinction was not reinstated by the 1976 Act, so there was to be no distinguishing between "conceptual" and "physical" separability.&lt;ref name=slipop12-15&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas further rejected Star Athletica's additional "objective" considerations from preexisting tests, namely that the work be identified as artistic contributions from a designer independent of the utilitarian purpose, and that the work still be marketable without the utilitarian function of the design.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slipop15-17&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; These were not within the statute, so Thomas dismissed them, saying that all that mattered was consumer perception and not the design's intent. Finally, regarding the idea that [[Legislative history#United States|Congress's noted reluctance]] to apply copyrightability to useful articles in general, Thomas said that congressional inaction was usually not a significant argument with courts. Thomas found a lot of the discussion moot because copyright could not restrict the cut of the design and copyright coverage was not mutually exclusive from design patenting.&lt;ref name=slipop15-17/&gt;

===Concurrence===
[[File:Attachment to 2017 opinion of Justice Ginsburg in Star Athletica v Varsity Brands.png|thumb|One page of the 11-page appendix to Justice Ginsburg's opinion, which highlighted that the designs were registered with the U.S. Copyright Office as "2-dimensional artwork"]]
Justice Ginsburg wrote an opinion concurring in judgement&amp;mdash;the cheerleading uniform designs were separable&amp;mdash;without joining in the majority's reasoning. The copyrights were not registered for the useful articles of clothing, emphasized Ginsburg. The registrations were for pictoral and graphical works that were then ''reproduced on'' the clothing.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica, LLC v. Varsity Brands, Inc.'', No. 15-866, 580 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 1 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment)&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Copyright Act of 1976 provided copyright claimants "the right to reproduce the work in or on any kind of article, whether useful or otherwise,"&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|17|113|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; the claimant of a pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work's copyright could restrict others from reproducing the work's elements on their separate useful articles. According to her, there was no need for the court to address the separability analysis issue at all.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt; To prove her point, Justice Ginsburg attached to her decision several pages of applications submitted by Varsity Brands to the Copyright Office, pointing to their claimed type of work being "2-dimensional artwork" or "fabric design (artwork)."&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-14 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concurrence's notes, Ginsburg mentioned that she also did not take a stand on whether or not Varsity's designs were actually original enough to be copyrightable. Nonetheless, she did refer to a previous case called ''[[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' and quoted its conclusion that "the requisite level of creativity [for copyrightability] is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice."&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Kennedy, dissented. While he agreed with much of the majority's reasoning, he disagreed with the framing and application of the majority's test and concluded the design was not separable from the uniform's useful article.&lt;ref name="breyer1"&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 1 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer also criticized what he considered vagueness in the majority's test. He thought that, under it, "virtually any industrial design" could be considered separable as soon as it was thought of in terms of art, whether via giving it a picture frame or [[Found art|merely calling the object art]] like a [[Marcel Duchamp]] [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|series]].&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 6-7 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Breyer's approach to the problem was to interpret what "identified separately" meant in the context of the statute. His reading was that, to be separable, the design features needed to be either physically separable from the article while leaving the utilitarian object functional or else the design features needed to be conceivably separable without conjuring a picture of the utilitarian object in someone's mind. He returned to ''Mazer v. Stein'' and applied his reasoning to two lamps, one with a [[Siamese cat]] statuette for a pole and one with an brass rod pole and a cat statuette attached elsewhere on its base. When it was elsewhere on the base, it could be physically separable and was therefore copyrightable as a figurine. When the cat was the pole, it couldn't be physically separated, but it could be conceptually separated from the context of the lamp without conjuring the idea of a lamp and was therefore copyrightable as a figurine.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2-4 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Applying his version of the test to the cheerleader uniforms, he found that the design was not physically separable. Further, picturing the design separately would reveal a cheerleader uniform "coextensive with that design and cut", so the design and useful article were not conceptually separable either.&lt;ref name="CopyrightsAtTheSupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breyer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breyer11"&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

He then considered [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)#Pair of shoes|shoes painted by]] [[Vincent van Gogh]] and turned to the examples of Congress's intended targets of copyright in the ''amicus curiae'' brief filed by the Intellectual Property Professors. Breyer found that copyrighting those embellishments was not the same as copyrighting an entire cheerleading uniform design because those examples were conceptually separable while the uniform design was not. He reiterated that van Gogh could certainly have received a copyright to prevent people from reproducing his painting, but the request in ''Star Athletica'' was an injunction against reproducing uniforms and Breyer felt this decision would be equivalent to giving van Gogh a design copyright that could prevent others from producing those shoes.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 4-6 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; He directly accused Varsity Brands of trying to acquire copyrights in order to "prevent its competitors from making useful three-dimensional cheerleader uniforms by submitting plainly unoriginal chevrons and stripes as cut and arranged on a useful article."&lt;ref name="breyer11"/&gt;

The majority opinion believed Breyer's concerns were not a bar to a design's copyrightability, and neither was Star Athletica's similar idea that the design couldn't be copyrighted because the designs would have the same outline as the useful article. They analogized the uniform's design to a mural on a curved dome, saying that the contour of the dome would not prevent the mural from being copyrightable. They also thought that Breyer's traditional view that a preexisting two-dimensional artwork applied to a portion of the clothing could be copyrighted was contradictory because then the statute would provide copyright restriction to designs that covered part of the clothing surface, but not designs that covered all of it.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 11&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsburg's concurrence agreed on the second point in its notes, and referred to the fact that portions of Varsity's claimed uniform designs do appear on other merchandise like t-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 2-3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment)&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the dissenting justice studied the state of the fashion industry at the time of the decision. Recent Congresses had rejected 70 bills to extend copyright to cover designs on useful articles, which he interpreted as [[Legislative intent|an unwillingness of lawmakers]] to enact the change. He cited the metrics provided by the Varsity ''amici'' Council of Fashion Designers of America to show that the fashion industry was doing very well for itself without copyright then quoted warnings from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] against wantonly expanding copyright monopolies. Seeing no pressing need to extend the restriction, he did not want to overstep the bounds of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]'s [[Copyright Clause]], especially when the available design patents afforded fifteen years of restriction and copyright could offer more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Athletica'', slip op. at 7-9 (Breyer, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
===Immediate reactions===
Varsity Brands's leadership and supporters were pleased by the decision. Varsity founder Jeff Webb said that it was a win for "the basic idea that designers everywhere can create excellent work and make investments in their future without fear of having it stolen or copied." [[Susan Scafidi]], founder of the Fashion Law Institute, had been involved in with the case from the district court level and lamented that it had to go all the way to the Supreme Court. Still, she praised Thomas's decision as a maintenance of the status quo based on the copyrightability of fabric patterns. Although it was important to her because she believed fashion designers deserved to restrict their valuable designs with copyright, she didn't think it would change things for designers because it was based on the language of the preexisting statute.&lt;ref name="OneYearLater"&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP41JX8xU2o |title=Star Athletica: One Year Later |date=2018-03-23 |last=The Federalist Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/939637/the-supreme-court-ruled-that-varsity-brands-cheerleading-uniform-designs-are-protected-by-copyright-law/ |title=The Supreme Court says the iconic American cheerleading uniform design is protected by copyright law |last=Mejia |first=Zameena |website=Quartz |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case resolution===
The case was passed back to the district court in Tennessee and, in August 2017, the case was settled out of court in favor of Varsity Brands, over Star Athletica's objection, by Star Athletica's insurance company. Star Athletica wanted to press a counter-claim following the Supreme Court's ruling that designs on the uniforms ''could'' be copyrightable with an argument that the ''particular'' Varsity designs in the case ''should not'' be copyrightable due to their simplicity. The settlement precluded that argument and closed the case with prejudice, so the seven years of litigation concluded firmly.&lt;ref name="AnUnsatisfyingEnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionindustrylaw.com/2017/09/25/star-athletica-an-unsatisfying-end/ |title=Star Athletica: An Unsatisfying End |last=Freeman |first=Helene M. |date=2017-09-25 |website=The Fashion Industry Law Blog |publisher=Phillips Nizer, LLP. |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Varsity Brands, Inc. v.

===Legal analyses===
[[Columbia Law School]] professor Ronald Mann provided an analysis of the opinion for [[SCOTUSblog]], remarking:

{{quote|What the court does not state expressly in that part of its opinion is that the standard for determining whether a graphic work (for example) is copyrightable is minimal. ... So once the court has said that any design can gain copyright protection if it would be protectable if placed first on a piece of paper, it really has ensured that all but the subtlest graphic designs will be able to gain copyright protection. ... To put [the Court's application of its test to the uniforms (quoted in the [[#Majority opinion|"majority opinion" section]] above)] more bluntly, once we determine that the designs 'hav[e] … graphic … qualities … [and could be] applied … on a painter’s canvas,' the test for copyrightability is met. ... I am sure that my colleagues who study intellectual property will write at length for years to come about the doctrinal nuances of the court’s discussion of the separability requirement, which seems to me a marked shift from most of the prior treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/opinion-analysis-court-uses-cheerleader-uniform-case-validate-broad-copyright-industrial-designs/ |title=Opinion analysis: Court uses cheerleader uniform case to validate broad copyright in industrial designs |last=Mann |first=Ronald |date=2017-03-22 |website=SCOTUSblog |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' felt ''Star Athletica'' was an important step towards removing subjectivity from the tests in this area of the law, such as by removing the framing problem that changed the outcome of the analysis based on how the usefulness of the article was defined, evidenced by Judge McKeague. However, the ''Review'' worried that the decision may not fully resolve conflicting lower court rulings because the conflicting majority and dissent were both based on close readings of the statute without enough clearly differentiating examples in the majority to completely discredit the alternative view. A potential contradiction in Thomas's majority opinion may not help on that front that pecerption; specifically, the assertion that surface designs are "inherently separable" from useful articles without being useful articles themselves and the assertion that other clothing bearing the design do not conjure the original useful article. The ''Review'' speculated that "these [[dicta]] imply that the independently existing work can have the shape and look of the article, evoke the same concepts, and even perform the same function and still be separable," and therefore be copyrightable.&lt;ref name="HLR"/&gt; Indeed, a 2018 disctrict court case, ''Silvertop Assocs., Inc. v. Kangaroo Mfg., Inc.'', ruled that a banana costume's physical features were separable from the costume and copyrightable because they could be painted on a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Silvertop Assocs., Inc. v. Kangaroo Mfg., Inc. |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=D.N.J. |date=2018-30-18 |url=https://casetext.com/case/silvertop-assocs-inc-v-kangaroo-mfg-inc |accessdate=2018-08-02 |quote=These features include: a) the overall length of the costume, b) the overall shape of the design in terms of curvature, c) the length of the shape both above and below the torso of the wearer, d) the shape, size, and jet black color of both ends, e) the location of the head and arm cutouts which dictate how the costume drapes on and protrudes from a wearer (as opposed to the mere existence of the cutout holes), f) the soft, smooth, almost shiny look and feel of the chosen synthetic fabric, g) the parallel lines which mimic the ridges on a banana in three-dimensional form, and h) the bright shade of a golden yellow and uniform color that appears distinct from the more muted and inconsistent tones of a natural banana. The Court finds that, if these features were separated from the costume itself and applied on a painter's canvas, it would qualify as a two-dimensional work of art in a way that would not replicate the costume itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors Jeanne C. Fromer and Mark P. McKenna were critical of the ambiguity of the decision because the three major stages of litigation resulted in three different majority decisions on three different grounds, with more divergent opinions among the dissents and concurrence. Because the courts allowed Varsity to define extremely narrow copyright restrictions in the registration then sue others like Star Athletica with general descriptions in court filings, they were concerned that this disconnect in requirements would lead to more controversial lawsuits, even outside the realm of useful articles. After all, a model car could be copyrighted as a sculpture, a drawing of that model could be copyrighted, and the claimant could use features of either equally to file copyright claims. Exactly what features of either were actually restricted was left up to debate because the registration's description could diverge almost entirely from the lawsuit's filing, so Fromer and McKenna contended it would be impossible to know what the copyright holder considered restricted before they described it in a lawsuit, let alone before the second party begins the desired copying. Moreover, in the absence of that description, they said it was impossible to perform a separability analysis and determine if the feature was even copyrightable at all before active litigation.&lt;ref name="ClaimingDesign"/&gt;

Sara Benson, a lawyer who agreed with the decision, has wondered if the court's explicit rejection of a copyrightability test that valued artistic effort on the designer's part may harm perception of designers' value to the clients they work for. She mentioned that that test had allowed designers to leverage their creativity for respect and credibility during corporate design processes, and that its removal may have removed some of their negotiating power.&lt;ref name="Benson2018"/&gt;

David Kluft of [[Foley Hoag]] has noted that this new ability to copyright design elements comes paired with criminal penalties if it comes to light that the elements have any utility. If the entity applying for copyright on the design knew about that utility, that would be considered false representation of a material fact in the copyright registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2018/04/star-athletica-and-the-expansion-of-useful-article-protection-copyright-office-permits-registration-of-automotive-floor-liner/ |title=Star Athletica and the Expansion of Useful Article Protection: Copyright Office Permits Registration of Automotive Floor Liner |last=Kluft |first=David |publisher=Foley Hoag, LLP |date=2018-04-24 |website=Trademark And Copyright Law |access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of [[John of Nepomuk|St. John of Nepomuk]] in [[Divina]] is the National Cultural Monument of [[Slovakia]]. Divina is a [[village]] and [[municipality]] in [[Žilina District]] in the [[Žilina Region]] of northern Slovakia. In [[History|historical records]] the [[village]] was first mentioned in 1325. The Statue of St. John of Nepomuk is registered in the Central List of the Slovak Memorial Fund under the number 1334/2.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pamiatky.sk/po/po/Details?id=9364|title=Pamiatkový objekt - podrobnosti|website=www.pamiatky.sk|language=sk|access-date=2017-06-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806221237/http://www.pamiatky.sk/po/po/Details?id=9364|archivedate=2017-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sandstone sculpture from 1796 standing on a stone base. The statue has a good artistic elaboration of the saint’s face and drapery. The saint does not have a traditional [[biretta]] on his head. The statue is a remembrance of the last male descendant of the [[Aristocratic family|aristocratic]] Szunyogh family – John Nepomuk Szunyogh, who is credited with the construction of the Divina church and rectory. In Slovakia, there are only few preserved architectural and artistic monuments that belonged to the count branch of the Szunyog family of [[Budatín Castle|Budatín]]. In 1588, the branch was promoted to [[baron]]s, later [[count]]s. The last male descendant was John Nepomuk Szunyogh, who died in 1798, leaving only one daughter Josephine. St. John of Nepomuk was his personal patron, to whom he had a special reverence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Image:Okres zilina.png|thumb|right|300px|Location of [[Žilina District]] in the [[Zilina Region]]]]

== St. John of Nepomuk ==
St. John of Nepomuk, Czech saint, died as a [[martyr]]. His tortured body was bound and thrown in the [[Vltava]] river. St. John of Nepomuk is one of the most frequently illustrated saints in the territory of the former [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg monarchy]] and there are monuments (mostly statues) of him in almost every village in Slovak and [[Czech Republic|Czechia]]. His statues and other monuments are all over the world. The fact that we can find St. John of Nepomuk also in less expected locations only confirms his universal respect. St. John is the patron of confessors, priests, sailors, rafters, millers and protector from drowning or tongue diseases. He is co-patron of the Czech Republic and [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-07-18|title=John of Nepomuk|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_of_Nepomuk&amp;oldid=791145027|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many churches and chapels have been consecrated to him in Central and Western Europe. St. John of Nepomuk churches and chapels can be found in [[Germany]], Czechia, [[Poland]], [[Italy]], Slovakia, [[Slovenia]], [[Austria]], [[Serbia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His is also worshipped in [[Spain]]. Since 16 May 1758, St. John of Nepomuk has been the patron saint of the Spanish Marine Forces (''Infantería de Marina'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/Armadaespannola/conocenos_organizacion/prefLang_es/03_Flota--04_Flota-Fuerza-Infanteria-Marina--03_patronazgo-cuerpo-infanteria-marina_es|title=Patronazgo del Cuerpo de Infantería de Marina|last=Fuerza de Infantería de Marina|first=|date=|website=www.armada.mde.es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530050704/http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenos_organizacion/prefLang_es/03_Flota--04_Flota-Fuerza-Infanteria-Marina--03_patronazgo-cuerpo-infanteria-marina_es|archive-date=2016-05-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside [[Europe]], there churches and chapels consecrated to him especially in [[Costa Rica]], [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Philippines]] and the [[United States|USA]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Also names of many municipalities in [[Latin America]] were given in respect of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-22|title=San Juan Nepomuceno, Bolívar|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=San_Juan_Nepomuceno,_Bol%C3%ADvar&amp;oldid=776621206|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanjuannepomuceno-bolivar.gov.co/index.shtml#8|title=Sitio web del municipio San Juan Nepomuceno en Bolívar|last=http://www.iprc.org.co|first=Equipo de Internet para la Rendición de Cuentas -|website=www.sanjuannepomuceno-bolivar.gov.co|language=es|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-24|title=San Juan Nepomuceno (Paraguay)|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=San_Juan_Nepomuceno_(Paraguay)&amp;oldid=99355169|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paraguay.cz/mesto-san-juan-nepomuceno/|title=Město San Juan Nepomuceno|website=www.paraguay.cz|access-date=2017-07-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522003046/http://www.paraguay.cz/mesto-san-juan-nepomuceno/|archivedate=2015-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=San_Juan_Nepomuceno_(Paraguay)|title=San Juan Nepomuceno (Paraguay) - Heraldry of the World|website=www.ngw.nl|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901041126/http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=San_Juan_Nepomuceno_%28Paraguay%29|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Interesting information about the statue was found in the recently discovered [[Canonical visitation]] of Divina from 1828: ''"On the territory of the parish, there is also on stone statue of St. John Nepomuk, which used to be located at the entrance to the Divina village near the stream along the road in 1796. It was built by the count John Szunyogh. After the fatal massive [[flood]] in 1822 that wrecked the entire village from the ground, the statue was swept away. It was found head-less. Later, thanks to the willingness of the count Stephen Csáky, the current patron of the church, it was repaired and placed in front of the rectory on the brick column."''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canonica visitatio, Nagy Divina|last=Vurum|first=Joseph|publisher=The Diocese of Nitra, manuscript|year=1828|isbn=|location=Nitra|pages=14|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blessing ceremony ===
The statue was uncovered on its new stand on Friday 2 June 2017 by Joachim Bleicker, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany in Slovakia together with Emil Molko, Mayor of Divina and Marek Sobola, author of the project. Subsequently, it was blessed by Mons. [[Tomáš Galis]], [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|Bishop]] of Žilina. It happened more than 190 years since it was restored after being damaged by a flood. Besides the Bishop, Ambassador of Germany and the Head of the Bishop Office, the ceremony was attended also by invited partners. The uncovering and blessing of the statue were followed by a vernissage presenting all partners of the monument restoration on panels.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tkkbs.sk/view.php?cisloclanku=20170605024|title=Biskup Galis požehnal obnovenú sochu sv.

[[Image:stewart-perowne-writer.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart Perowne]]
'''Stewart Henry Perowne''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Venerable Order of Saint John|KStJ]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (17 June 1901 – 10 May 1989) was a British diplomat, archaeologist, explorer and historian who wrote books on the history and antiquities of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Despite his [[homosexuality]], in 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer [[Freya Stark]]. The marriage was dissolved in 1952.

==Early life==
Born in [[Hallow, Worcestershire]], into a distinguished ecclesiastical family, Stewart Perowne was the grandson of [[John Perowne]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]], and the son of Helena Frances (née Oldnall-Russell) (1869–1922) and [[Arthur William Thomson Perowne]], who was the first [[Bishop of Bradford (diocese)|Bishop of Bradford]] and subsequently also [[Bishop of Worcester]]. His older brother was Francis Edward Perowne (1898–1988). His younger brother, Leslie Arthur Perowne (1906–1997), was Head of Music at the [[BBC]] and was responsible for bringing [[Albert Ketèlbey]] out of retirement to conduct a huge BBC Ketèlbey Concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] prior to [[World War II]].

Perowne was educated at [[Haileybury College]], where he was a champion sprinter, and at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where he studied Classical Archaeology and Architecture&lt;ref&gt;.[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUOvl9E3DRcC&amp;pg=PA295 Geniesse, Jane Fletcher ''Freya Stark Passionate Nomad'' Random House, Inc (2000) (p. 328) ''[[Google Books]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he gained a graduate degree in Classics. He went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1927 under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], as Head of Education in the Palestine Government Education Service, teaching at the [[Anglican]] St George's School in [[Jerusalem]]. He became fluent in spoken and written [[Arabic]]. In 1930 Perowne transferred to the administrative branch of the Palestine Government, working for a time as Assistant District Commissioner for [[Galilee]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;E. C. Hodgkin, 'Perowne, Stewart Henry (1901–1989)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]] (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57383, accessed 26 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 he was appointed an Officer of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33728/pages/4072 Perowne in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' 23 June 1931 (p. 4072)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic career==
[[Image:stark-perowne-1947.jpg|thumb|right|Perowne and [[Freya Stark]] on their wedding day in 1947]]
He later served in Malta, Aden, Iraq, Barbados, Libya and Israel.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/16/obituaries/stewart-perowne-87-diplomat-and-author.html Perowne's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 16 May 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[King George VI Coronation Medal|Coronation Medal]] in 1937. In 1938 Perowne worked for the [[BBC]], preparing talks and features for transmission by the overseas Arabic service. In the same year he deposited a collection of [[potsherd]]s with the [[British Museum]], most of which are of [[Bronze Age]] type and probably derive from the ancient site of Subr.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; In 1939 he was appointed Public Information Officer in Aden, where he developed a passion for archaeology, and where he discovered the seventh century BC sites of Imadiya and [[Beihan]].&lt;ref&gt;Perowne, Stewart 'Im'adiya and Beihan, Aden Protectorate', ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' No. 13 (1939), pp. 133–37)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 Perowne was appointed Public Relations Officer to the British embassy in [[Baghdad]]. In 1944 he succeeded the scholar [[Vyvyan Holt]] as oriental counsellor.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

During his diplomatic postings he designed stamps for [[Malta]] (1936), the [[Aden Protectorate]] (1938), [[Barbados]] (1949), [[Libya]] (1951), and currency notes for the [[West Indies Federation]] (1949) and Libya (1951).&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;

==Marriage==
Because of his career as a diplomat it was expected that Perowne should marry. As a homosexual he decided to embark on a [[mariage blanc]], and on 7 October 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer [[Freya Stark]] at St Margaret's church in [[Westminster]]. She was his senior by eight years and had been his assistant in [[Yemen]] when he was Information Officer. Stark's biographer has argued that she may not have known of Perowne's homosexuality, and of his taste for men in uniform.&lt;ref&gt;M. Izzard, Freya Stark: a biography (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geniesse, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/05/biography2 'Travelling tales of a reluctant virgin' ''[[The Observer]]'' 5 December 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1947 people's sexual proclivities were still part of their private lives and … no one among Freya's friends seemed able to warn her of the pitfalls of marriage to a homosexual."&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Confused as to why Perowne would not sleep with her, she wrote to him, "I think you have left something lying between us, untold. Whatever it is, it will not make me think less of you or care less for you." Eventually, after skirting around the subject, he wrote to her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is difficult to say what "normal" is – my friend a counsellor of St. George's Hospital always refuses to use the word and in both men and women, you have a wide and graded range from ultra-male to ultra-female with naturally most people in the middle ranges ... Now for myself, I put myself in the middle group. I have ordinary male abilities. I like male sports some of them, and I love the company of women. In fact, I find it hard to exist without it. At the same time, I am occasionally attracted by members of my own sex – generally. For some even pleasurable reason – by wearers of uniform.&lt;ref&gt;Geniesse, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite their similar interests the marriage could not survive and they divorced in 1952. There were no children.

==Later years==
In 1947 Perowne was appointed Colonial Secretary to [[Barbados]] where he was a member of the island's Legislative Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/38176/pages/273 Perowne in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' (p. 273)]&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming political adviser in [[Cyrenaica]] from 1950 to 1951. Here he discovered the ancient city-site of Aziris.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; Taking early retirement in 1951, after his divorce in 1952 he returned to Palestine, now the State of Israel, where he assisted [[Weston Henry Stewart]], the [[Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem]] in designing and organising model villages for [[Palestinian Arabs]] who had been made refugees as a result of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He was an Adviser to the UK delegation to the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN Assembly]] in Paris in November 1951.&lt;ref name=BM&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?searchTerm=henri&amp;orig=/research/search_the_collection_database/search_results_provenance.aspx&amp;personId=22639&amp;personAssociation=&amp;termDisplay=Perowne,+Stewart+Henry Perowne on the [[British Museum]] Collection Database]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he also began to write, his first book being ''Jerusalem, The One Remains'' (1954). Later books included ''The Life and Times of Herod the Great'' (1958), ''The Later Herods'' (1958), ''Hadrian'' (1960), ''Caesars and Saints'' (1962), ''The End of the Roman World'' (1966), and ''The Death of the Roman Republic'' (1969). Other books among the 18 he wrote include guides to Athens, Jerusalem, Rome and Malta. In addition, he was a frequent contributor to various edited works, encyclopaedias and academic journals, including ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]''.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; Perowne was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1944 and a Knight of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] (KStJ) in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/40378/supplements/158 Perowne in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' 7 January 1955 (p. 158)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he was named Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] (FSA). He was a Member of the Church of England Foreign Relations Council.

Perowne died in 1989 at [[Charing Cross Hospital]] in London aged 87 years old.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He was survived by his former wife, [[Freya Stark]].

'''Street art in Adelaide''' is a growing aspect of the wider public arts scene found in the [[Adelaide]] central business district. Adelaide [[street art]] includes the full gamut of contemporary street art mediums, including [[Stencil graffiti|stenciling]], [[mural]]s, [[Wheatpaste|paste-ups]], [[sticker art]] and [[yarn bombing]].

Whereas Adelaide street art was previously painted over on occasion by the local authorities,&lt;ref name="Advert-1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Spain | first = Katie  | date = 30 May 2012 | title = Topham Mall loses its street art | work = The Advertiser | url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/topham-mall-loses-its-art/story-fn6d2yge-1226372254162 | accessdate = 20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; street art in Adelaide is now recognised and cultivated by state and local governments through supportive policies, as well as events such as the ''Oi You! Urban Art Festival''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bayly | first = Jess | date = 18 March 2013 | title = Adelaide Urban Art Festival Bringing Banksy To Town | work = RipItUp.com | url = http://www.ripitup.com.au/lifestyle/article/adelaide-urban-art-festival-bringing-banksy-to-town | accessdate = 20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Street art locations ==
Adelaide's street art scene is physically centred in the [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide central business district]]. Stencils and other forms of street art such as yarn bombing also appears throughout suburbia and along public transport routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/photos-fnlmw1po-1227271614326?page=1 The Advertsiaer] ''Artists take it to Adelaide’s streets''.

'''''The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories''''' is a collection of seven illustrated stories by children's author [[Dr. Seuss]] published by [[Random House]] on September 27, 2011. Though they were originally published in magazines in the early 1950s, they had never been published in book form and are quite rare, described by the publisher as "the literary equivalent of buried treasure".&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{citation |title=The Bippolo Seed and Other Stories |publisher=[[Random House]] |url = http://www.randomhouse.com/book/43160/the-bippolo-seed-and-other-lost-stories-by-dr-seuss |accessdate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories were discovered by Charles D. Cohen, a Massachusetts dentist and a Seuss scholar and biographer, who also contributed an introduction to the collection.

==Plots==
The seven stories included in the book are as follows:&lt;ref name="RH"/&gt;
*"The Bippolo Seed" (60th-anniversary edition): a duck finds a rare seed that can grant wishes, but a cat tells him to wish for more than he needs, to get money; they end up losing the seed.
*"The Rabbit, the Bear, and the Zinniga-Zanniga": a rabbit escapes being eaten by convincing the bear that he has a rare but serious disorder.
*"Gustav, the Goldfish": a boy overfeeds a goldfish, causing it to grow until it fills a cellar. It was later adapted by [[Helen Palmer Geisel|Helen Palmer]] as "[[A Fish out of Water (book)|A Fish out of Water]]."
*"Tadd and Todd": two identical twins don't like being the same, so they try to be different by enhancing their looks but fail.
*"Steak for Supper": a boy brags about his steak dinner, causing strange beasts to follow him home, but it turns out to be stew.
*"The Strange Shirt Spot": a boy gets dirt on himself, to his mother's dismay, so he tries to get it off but fails. 
*"The Great Henry McBride": a boy dreams of having five jobs, all at once.

== Analysis ==
Some elements of the stories in this collection appeared in later books. The story "Gustav the Goldfish" was the basis for the [[Beginner Books|Beginner Book]] ''[[A Fish out of Water (book)|A Fish out of Water]]''. The book was written by Seuss's first wife [[Helen Palmer Geisel]], illustrated by [[P. D. Eastman]], and published in 1961.&lt;ref name=nel&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;164&lt;/ref&gt; "Gustav the Goldfish" rhymes, unlike ''A Fish out of Water''.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; Seuss later reused the basic plot of "The Strange Shirt Spot" for 1958's ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]''.&lt;ref name=nel/&gt; In both stories, a character tries to remove a spot from various household items but only manages to transfer the spot to one object after another.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;116&lt;/ref&gt;

The story "The Rabbit, the Bear, and the Zinniga-Zanniga" was recorded by [[Marvin Miller]] and released on the 1965 album ''Dr. Seuss presents..."Fox in Socks" and "Green Eggs &amp; Ham"'' on RCA Records.

==Origin==

Vulgar auteurism derives its name&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; from the [[auteur theory]], a key component of [[film criticism]] which posits that the director is the author ("auteur") of a film and that films should be analyzed in terms of how they fit into a director's larger body of work.&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; Also known as "auteurism," the auteur theory was introduced by French critics associated with the film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' during the 1950s and popularized in the [[United States]] in the 1960s by [[Andrew Sarris]].&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;

Several critics, including Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', have drawn parallels between the earliest French and American proponents of the auteur theory and vulgar auteurism.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=brody /&gt; However, many commentators on the movement consider vulgar auteurism to be distinct from the classical auteur theory, pointing to its concern with visual style over theme.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; The question of whether vulgar auteurism is a legitimate separate movement or a subset of the auteur theory remains a source of controversy in the [[film critic]] community.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;
According to film critic Peter Labuza, vulgar auteurism "seems to have been an unconscious movement before it ever had a name."&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; The earliest criticism identified as exhibiting "vulgar auteurism" was published in the Canadian film magazine ''Cinema Scope'' in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; ''Cinema Scope'' writer Andrew Tracy coined the term&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; in his 2009 article, "Vulgar Auteurism: The Case of Michael Mann".&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; Initially pejorative,&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; the term was repurposed by [[Mubi (website)|Mubi]] user John Lehtonen.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; In the early-going, the theory was explored not through text, but through images via a [[Tumblr]] simply entitled "Vulgar Auteurism",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://vulgarauteurism.tumblr.com/ Vulgar Auteurism]"&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by Lehtonen and filmmaker Kurt Walker, with contributions from Mubi critics Adam Cook and Daniel Kasman. Over the years which followed, Mubi's online film magazine began to publish more and more articles defending genres and directors which were unpopular with the critical mainstream.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; 

Vulgar auteurist ideas gained currency&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt; when one of the movement's leading proponents,&lt;ref name=patches /&gt; critic [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]], became the co-host of the television program ''[[Ebert Presents: At the Movies]]'', produced by [[Roger Ebert]]. However, while "vulgar auteurist" criticism was becoming popular, the term and the movement to which it corresponded remained obscure until the publication of an article by Calum Marsh, "Fast &amp; Furious &amp; Elegant: Justin Lin and the Vulgar Auteurs", in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' on May 24, 2013.&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt;&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt;&lt;ref name=kenigsberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenigsberg|first=Ben|title=From the Wire: Pinkerton's Notes on Vulgar Auteurism|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/from-the-wire-pinkertons-notes-on-vulgar-auteurism|publisher=Indiewire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===

Marsh's article was immediately controversial.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt; While some took issue with the films and filmmakers being championed by the proponents of vulgar auteurism,&lt;ref name=fsr /&gt; others took issue with the idea that vulgar auteurism was a movement distinct from the auteur theory.&lt;ref name=labuza /&gt;

One of the most vocal opponents of vulgar auteurism is former ''Village Voice'' critic Nick Pinkerton,&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt;&lt;ref name=singer /&gt; 
&lt;ref name=kenigsberg /&gt; who has written essays in praise of directors championed by the movement&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt; and whose 2012 article "The Bigger and Better Mousetraps of [[Paul W.S. Anderson]]" has been described as vulgar auteurist.&lt;ref name=foundas /&gt; Writing in his SundanceNow column following the publication of Marsh's article, Pinkerton described vulgar auteurism as "a shameless attention grab",&lt;ref name=pinkerton&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinkerton|first=Nick|title=BOMBAST #96|url=http://blog.sundancenow.com/weekly-columns/bombast-96|publisher=SundanceNow|access-date=2014-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302090231/http://blog.sundancenow.com/weekly-columns/bombast-96|archive-date=2014-03-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding: "Even more galling is the assumed attitude that the VA position stands alone against a vast, unsympathetic critical conspiracy to marginalize and underrate the products of industrial filmmaking. [...] The numbers, meanwhile, do not bear out claims of a highbrow conspiracy: ''[[Fast &amp; Furious 6]]'', which we’re assured is scorned by critics the world over, currently stands at 61% at [[Metacritic]], above ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' (54%), and within striking distance of arty jazz like ''[[Simon Killer]]'' and ''[[Post Tenebras Lux (film)|Post Tenebras Lux]]''."&lt;ref name=pinkerton /&gt;

'''William Holman Hunt''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit|OM]]}} (2 April 1827 – 7 September 1910) was an [[English painter]] and one of the founders of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].  His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid color, and elaborate symbolism.  These features were influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]], according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs.  For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact.  Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career.  He was always keen to maximize the popular appeal and public visibility of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Bronkhurst, ‘Hunt, William Holman (1827–1910)’, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
William Holman Hunt changed his surname from "Hobman Hunt" to Holman Hunt when he discovered that a clerk had misspelled the name after his baptism at the [[Anglican]] church of [[St Mary's Church, Ewell|Saint Mary the Virgin, Ewell]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Amor |first=Anne Clark |title=William Holman Hunt: the True Pre-Raphaelite |publisher=Constable |location=London |year=1989 |page=15 |isbn=0094687706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After eventually entering the [[Royal Academy]] art schools, having initially been rejected, Hunt rebelled against the influence of its founder [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]]. He formed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] movement in 1848, after meeting the poet and artist [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. Along with [[John Everett Millais]] they sought to revitalise art by emphasising the detailed observation of the natural world in a spirit of quasi-religious devotion to truth. This religious approach was influenced by the spiritual qualities of [[medieval art]], in opposition to the alleged rationalism of the [[Renaissance]] embodied by [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]. He had many pupils including [[Robert Braithwaite Martineau]].

Hunt married twice. After a failed engagement to his model [[Annie Miller]], he married Fanny Waugh, who later modelled for the figure of ''Isabella''. When she died in childbirth in [[Italy]], he sculpted her tomb at [[Fiesole]], having it brought down to the [[English Cemetery, Florence|English Cemetery]] in [[Florence]], beside the tomb of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]. He had a close connection with [[St Mark's English Church, Florence|St. Mark's Church in Florence]], and paid for the communion chalice inscribed in memory of his wife. His second wife, Edith, was Fanny's sister. At the time it was illegal in [[Great Britain]] [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|to marry one's deceased wife's sister]], so Hunt travelled abroad to marry her. This led to a grave conflict with other family members, notably his former Pre-Raphaelite colleague [[Thomas Woolner]], who had once been in love with Fanny and had married Alice, the third sister of Fanny and Edith.

Hunt's works were not initially successful, and were widely attacked in the art press for their alleged clumsiness and ugliness. He achieved some early note for his intensely naturalistic scenes of modern rural and urban life, such as ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'' and ''[[The Awakening Conscience]]''. However, it was for his religious paintings that he became famous, initially ''[[The Light of the World (painting)|The Light of the World]]'' (1851–1853), now in the chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]], [[England]]; a later version (1900) toured the world and now has its home in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, England.

In the mid-1850s Hunt travelled to the [[Holy Land]] in search of accurate topographical and ethnographical material for further religious works, and to employ his “powers to make more tangible Jesus Christ’s history and teaching”;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, W.H., ''Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood''; London: Macmillan; 1905, Vol. 1, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; there he painted ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'', ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'', and ''[[The Shadow of Death]]'', along with many landscapes of the region. Hunt also painted many works based on poems, such as ''[[Isabella, or the Pot of Basil|Isabella]]'' and ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]''. He eventually built his own house in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/whh/plates/house.html Victorian Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually had to relinquish painting because failing eyesight meant that he could not achieve the quality that he wanted. His last major works, including a large version of ''[[The Light of the World (painting)|The Light of the World]]'', were completed with the help of his assistant, [[Edward Robert Hughes]].

Hunt died on 7 September 1910 and was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11800 Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and commemoration==
Hunt published an autobiography in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/8048610&amp;referer=brief_results Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his late writings are attempts to control the interpretation of his work. That year, he was appointed to the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. At the end of his life he lived in [[Sonning]]-on-[[River Thames|Thames]].

His personal life was the subject of [[Diana Holman-Hunt]]'s book ''My Grandfather, his Life and Loves''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=British watercolours in the Victoria and Albert Museum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9HqAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 August 2014|ref=Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was depicted in two [[BBC]] [[Costume drama|period drama]]s. The first, ''[[The Love School]]'', in 1975, starred [[Bernard Lloyd]] as Hunt. The second was ''[[Desperate Romantics]]'', in which Hunt is played by [[Rafe Spall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/07/romantics.shtml BBC], ''BBC Drama Production presents Desperate Romantics for BBC Two''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing [[Mar Elias Monastery]] is a stone bench erected by the wife of the painter, who painted some of his major works at this spot. The bench is inscribed with biblical verses in [[Hebrew]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Arabic]] and [[English language|English]].
