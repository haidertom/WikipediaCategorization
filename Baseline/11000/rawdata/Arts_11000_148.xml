'''Anthony Hill''' (born 1930) is an [[England|English]] [[artist]], [[Painting|painter]] and [[relief]]-maker, originally a member of the post-[[World War II]] British art movement termed the Constructionist Group whose work was essentially in the international constructivist tradition.

His fellow members in this group were [[Victor Pasmore]], [[Adrian Heath (painter)|Adrian Heath]], [[John Ernest]], [[Kenneth Martin]], [[Mary Martin (artist)|Mary Martin]], [[Gillian Wise (artist)]] and [[Stephen Gilbert]]. He was born on 23 April 1930 in London, and studied at the St Martin's and the Central Schools of Art 1948–51. He began painting in the style of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] in 1948 but quickly moved on to geometric abstract idioms. He made his first relief in 1954 and abandoned painting for relief-making in 1956. One feature of these reliefs has been the use of non-traditional materials such as industrial aluminium and Perspex. His first one-man show of reliefs was held at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in 1958. He has participated in exhibitions of abstract and constructivist art in the UK, Paris, Germany, Holland, Poland, Switzerland and the USA. In 1978 he exhibited in the Arts Council's exhibition, Constructive Context, alongside a number if artists such as [[Jeffrey Steele (artist)|Jeffrey Steele]] and Peter Lowe who had begun working in a systematised constructive mode in the mid to late 1960s and came together in the Systems Group in December 1969. Hill, however, along with the Martins, declined membership of this group. In 1983 the [[Hayward Gallery]] held a major retrospective exhibition of Anthony Hill's constructivist work.

Anthony Hill has had a lifelong fascination with mathematics, and there are many mathematicians among his circle of acquaintances. Together with his colleague [[John Ernest]] he made contributions to graph theory ([[crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number]]) and in 1979, in recognition of a number of his mathematical papers, he was elected a member of the London Mathematical Society and made a visiting research associate in the Department of Mathematics at University College, London. But although almost all his reliefs have an underlying mathematical structure or logic, he was always insistent that in his art, in his own words, "the mathematical thematic or mathematical process can only be a component: one is calculating or organising something which is clearly not mathematical."  From the late 1980s onward, working in parallel with his systems-based work but in a very different mode, Anthony Hill exhibited dadaist pictures and collages under the pseudonym [[Achill Redo]]. The [[Tate Gallery]], London has collections under both of the names Anthony Hill and Achill Redo.

An excellent summary of the life and constructivist work of Anthony Hill, together with that of the other British constructivists, is given in [[Alastair Grieve]]'s authoritative book of 2005.

The '''Ardennes Cross''' is a wooden [[processional cross]] from the [[Carolingian period]], said to originate in a monastery in the Luxembourg [[Ardennes]]. Since 1894 it has been in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in Nuremberg (inventory number 763&amp;nbsp;kg).

Probably made between 825 and 850 in northern France by an unknown craftsman, it is 73&amp;nbsp;cm high, studded with gold and set with gems and coloured glass. It is one of the few surviving examples of a [[crux gemmata]] from the Carolingian period. These crosses were used in Christian liturgy between the 5th and 12th centuries, placed on the altar but without a figure of Christ. Their symbolic meaning and the impression given from a distance was more important than the cross' value and so (as here) coloured glass was also used alongside gemstones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">In the geometry of the [[Euclidean plane]], '''axiality''' is a measure of how much [[axial symmetry]] a shape has. It is defined as the ratio of areas of the largest axially symmetric subset of the shape to the whole shape. Equivalently it is the largest fraction of the area of the shape that can be covered by a mirror reflection of the shape (with any orientation).

A shape that is itself axially symmetric, such as an [[isosceles triangle]], will have an axiality of exactly one, whereas an asymmetric shape, such as a [[scalene triangle]], will have axiality less than one.

==Upper and lower bounds==
{{harvtxt|Lassak|2002}} showed that every [[convex set]] has axiality at least 2/3.&lt;ref name="lassak02"&gt;{{citation

For [[triangle]]s and for [[central symmetry|centrally symmetric]] convex bodies, the axiality is always somewhat higher: every triangle, and every centrally symmetric convex body, has axiality at least &lt;math&gt;2(\sqrt{2}-1)\approx 0.828&lt;/math&gt;. In the set of obtuse triangles whose vertices have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinates &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the axiality approaches &lt;math&gt;2(\sqrt{2}-1)&lt;/math&gt; in the limit as the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-coordinates approach zero, showing that the lower bound is as large as possible. It is also possible to construct a sequence of centrally symmetric [[parallelogram]]s whose axiality has the same limit, again showing that the lower bound is tight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The axiality of a given convex shape can be approximated arbitrarily closely in sublinear time, given access to the shape by oracles for finding an extreme point in a given direction and for finding the intersection of the shape with a line.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{harvtxt|Barequet|Rogol|2007}} consider the problem of computing the axiality exactly, for both convex and non-convex polygons. The set of all possible reflection symmetry lines in the plane is (by [[projective duality]]) a two-dimensional space, which they partition into cells within which the pattern of crossings of the polygon with its reflection is fixed, causing the axiality to vary smoothly within each cell. They thus reduce the problem to a numerical computation within each cell, which they do not solve explicitly. The partition of the plane into cells has &lt;math&gt;O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt; cells in the general case, and &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; cells for convex polygons; it can be constructed in an amount of time which is larger than these bounds by a logarithmic factor. Barequet and Rogol claim that in practice the area maximization problem within a single cell can be solved in &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; time, giving (non-rigorous) overall time bounds of &lt;math&gt;O(n^4)&lt;/math&gt; for the convex case and &lt;math&gt;O(n^5)&lt;/math&gt; for the general case.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{harvtxt|de Valcourt|1966}} lists 11 different measures of axial symmetry, of which the one described here is number three.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | mr = 0203589

 | volume = 4
 | year = 1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He requires each such measure to be invariant under [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity transformation]]s of the given shape, to take the value one for symmetric shapes, and to take a value between zero and one for other shapes. Other symmetry measures with these properties include the ratio of the area of the shape to its smallest enclosing symmetric superset, and the analogous ratios of perimeters.

{{harvtxt|Lassak|2002}}, as well as studying axiality, studies a restricted version of axiality in which the goal is to find a halfspace whose intersection with a convex shape has large area lies entirely within the reflection of the shape across the halfspace boundary. He shows that such an intersection can always be found to have area at least 1/8 that of the whole shape.&lt;ref name="lassak02"/&gt;

In the study of [[computer vision]], {{harvtxt|Marola|1989}} proposed to measure the symmetry of a [[digital image]] (viewed as a function &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; from points in the plane to [[grayscale]] intensity values in the interval &lt;math&gt;0\le w(p)\le 1&lt;/math&gt;) by finding a reflection &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the area integral&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\int\int w(p) w(\sigma(p))dx\,dy}{\int\int w(p)^2 dx\,dy}.&lt;/math&gt;
When &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of a given shape, this is the same as the axiality.

It was founded in 1999 by [[Rachel Levitsky]] as a reading series at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)|Bluestockings]] in New York, NY. The [[reading series]] quickly expanded to a matrix of readings, publications, and informal salons, featuring avant-garde feminist writing, with an emphasis on hybrid and [[Language poets|language-focused]] writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the press operates as a non-hierarchical collaborative, publishing books and hosting literary events with attention to diversity in its roster of authors and editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicole|first1=Disser|title=Independent Presses Not Immune to Diversity Problems that Plague the Rest of the Publishing Industry|url=http://www.bkmag.com/2014/10/22/independent-presses-not-entirely-immune-to-diversity-problems-that-plague-the-rest-of-the-publishing-industry/|website=www.bkmag.com|publisher=Brooklyn Magazine|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Belladonna* was started as a reading and salon series at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)]] on New York City’s Lower East Side in August 1999. The first publications were postcards by [[kari edwards]] for the May 4, 2000 reading at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)]]. Following the edwards postcards, and in collaboration with Boog Literature, Belladonna* began to publish commemorative "chaplets" (staple-bound pamphlets typically with fewer pages than a chapbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/poetry/resources/chapbook_publishers/|title=Chapbook Publishers - Poetry Society of America|website=www.poetrysociety.org|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced in very small print runs) of its readers' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitsky|first=Rachel|date=2010-08-04|title=Belladonna Books|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/389102|journal=American Book Review|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=5–5|doi=10.1353/abr.0.0122|issn=2153-4578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Belladonna* published chapbooks by [[Erica Hunt]] and [[Akilah Oliver]] and co-published its first full-length book, ''Four from Japan: Contemporary Poetry &amp; Essays by Women'', in collaboration with [https://www.pw.org/small_presses/litmus_press Litmus Press].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.litmuspress.org/books/four-from-japan/|title=Litmus Press|website=www.litmuspress.org|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Belladonna* published its first full-length books independently: ''Open Box'' by [[Carla Harryman]] and ''Mauve Sea-Orchids'', a book of poems in Spanish and English with facing page translations, by [[Lila Zemborain]] (translated by [[Rosa Alcalá]] and [[Mónica de la Torre]]). In celebration of its ten-year anniversary in 2009, Belladonna* published The Elders Series—eight multiply authored [[Perfect bound|perfect-bound]] books highlighting the continuity and transformation of the ideas, poetics, and artistic/political concerns of its poets' circle. Each book was conceived as "an anthology and a conversation between the guest curator and the elder(s) she hosts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Belladonna* has published, on average, two full-length books and 14 chaplets a year.

== Awards ==

In 2009, ''Bharat Jiva'' by [[kari edwards]] (co-published with Litmus Press) was a finalist for the [[Lambda Literary Award]] in Transgender Literature. Erica Doyle's ''Proxy'' was a 2013 finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in Lesbian Poetry and a winner of the [[Poetry Society of America]]'s Norma Farber First Book Award in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/03/and-the-winner-is-r-erica-doyles-proxy-wins-norma-farber-first-book-award|title=AND THE WINNER IS.... r. erica doyle's Proxy Wins Norma Farber First Book Award! by Harriet Staff|date=2018-04-04|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaTasha N.

== Readings ==

The Belladonna* reading series is foundational to the press's history and mission, predating even the first publications. The series is run by the reading series curators. Since 1999, curators have included Marcella Durand and Rachel Levitsky, erica kaufman, Emily Skillings, Krystal Languell, Jamila Wimberly, Cara Benson, Ariel Goldberg, LaTasha N. Nevada Diggs, Saretta Morgan, Chia-Lun Chang, Ana Paula, and Asiya Wadud. Belladonna* collaborates on the series with performance venues, academic institutions, arts and literary organizations, such as [[Abrons Arts Center|Abrons Art Center]], Asian American Writers' Workshop, Berl's Brooklyn Poetry Shop, BGSQD, Bluestockings, [[Bowery Poetry Club]], [[Brooklyn Art Library]], [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Brooklyn Public Library]], Bryant Park Reading Series, [[CUNY Graduate Center]], [[Dixon Place]], [[Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts|Eugene Lang College]], Housing Works Bookstore, La Casa Azul Bookstore, Lambda Literary, The Lesbian Herstory Archives, McNally Jackson, [[The Poetry Project]], [[Pioneer Works]], Pratt Institute, [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queen's College]], St. Mark's Bookstore, Unnameable Books, and [[ZieherSmith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/events/|title=Events {{!}} B E L L A D O N N A *|website=www.belladonnaseries.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belladonna* documents its reading series through audio and visual recordings, as well as through the production of short-run chaplets for each of its readers. There are over 230 individually numbered chaplets in the series. The majority are single-authored pamphlets of under 15 pages. Several chaplets are multiply authored and many contain both texts and images. The chaplets are produced in a limited run of 150 copies. When copies sell out, Belladonna* uploads a reading PDF of the chaplet so that the out-of-print work is freely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/chaplets/|title=Chaplets {{!}} B E L L A D O N N A *|website=www.belladonnaseries.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of Belladonna’s readings are recorded and available for streaming or downloading at [[PennSound]], an online project committed to preserving audio archives of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Belladonna.php|title=Pennsound:Belladonna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Belladonna's readers and chaplet authors are noted poets and writers, such as: [[Fanny Howe]] (#5), [[Mei-mei Berssenbrugge]] (#8), [[Lynne Tillman]] (#19), [[Anne Waldman]] (#26), [[Rosmarie Waldrop]] (#29), [[Alice Notley]] (#36), [[Lydia Davis]] (#40), [[Elaine Equi]] (#41), [[Maggie Nelson]] (#42), [[Anne Tardos]] (#47), [[Michelle Naka Pierce]] (#48), [[Leslie Scalapino]] (#50), [[Caroline Bergvall]] (#56), [[Susan Howe]] (#68), [[Lisa Robertson]] (#75), [[Ann Lauterbach]] (#85), [[Myung Mi Kim]] (#86), [[Dawn Lundy Martin]] (#89), [[Marjorie Welish]] (#91), [[Rae Armantrout]] (#92), Anna Moschovakis (#102), [[Evie Shockley]] (#104), [[Jean Day]] (#114), [[Dodie Bellamy]] (#116), [[Bhanu Kapil]] (#28 and #127), [[Eileen Myles]] (#38 and #128), [[Cecilia Vicuña]] (#131), [[Carmen Giménez Smith]] (#132), [[Renee Gladman]] (#65 and #133), [[Juliana Spahr]] (#144), and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/chaplets/|title=Chaplets {{!}} B E L L A D O N N A *|website=www.belladonnaseries.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belladonna* has been featured in many publications including American Review of Books, [[Poets &amp; Writers]], and [[Rain Taxi]], among others.

* In a special chapbook issue of American Book Review (Mar/Apr 2005), Corinne Robins reviewed five Belladonna* chaplets in an article called "Belladonna*: The Deadly Night Shades of Experimental Women’s Poetry”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robins|first1=Corinne|title=Belladonna*: The Deadly Night Shades of Experimental Women's Poetry|journal=American Book Review|date=April 2005|volume=26|issue=3|url=http://americanbookreview.org/issueContent.asp?id=15|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2005, Byron Coley and [[Thurston Moore]] had this to say about the Belladonna* chaplet series: "Each zine is a succinct piece by a female poet, all of whom share a common sense of adventure and active consciousness.

'''''Boy Peeling Fruit''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master Michelangelo Merisi da [[Caravaggio]] (1571–1610) painted circa 1592–1593.

This is the earliest known work by Caravaggio, painted soon after his arrival in Rome from his native [[Milan]] in mid 1592. His movements in this period are not certain. According to his contemporary Giulio Mancini he stayed for a short time with Monsignor Pandulfo Pucci in the Palazzo Colonna, but disliked the way Pucci treated him and left after a few months. (Pucci fed his boarders exclusively on greens, and Caravaggio referred to him later as 'Monsignor Salad'). He copied religious pictures for Pucci, (none survive), and apparently did a few pieces of his own for personal sale, of which ''Boy Peeling a Fruit'' would be the only known example. The piece may also date from slightly later, when he was working for [[Giuseppe Cesari]], the "cavaliere d'Arpino". As Caravaggio is said to have been painting only "flowers and fruit" for d'Arpino, this would again be a personal piece done for sale outside the workshop, but it was among the works seized from d'Alpino by Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]] in 1607, together with two other early Caravaggios, the ''[[Young Sick Bacchus]]'' and the ''[[Boy with a Basket of Fruit]]''. It is not known how these works came to be in Cesari's collection at the time.

The fruit being peeled by the boy is something of a mystery. Sources indicate it may be a [[pear]], which is probably correct but has been questioned; it may be a [[nectarine]] or [[plum]], several of which lie on the table, but these are not usually peeled; some have suggested a [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], a pear-shaped citrus fruit grown in Italy, but others object that the bergamot is sour and practically inedible.

Seen as a simple genre painting, it differs from most in that the boy is not 'rusticated,' that is, he is depicted as clean and well-dressed instead of as a 'cute' ragamuffin. An allegoric meaning behind the painting is plausible, given the complex [[Renaissance]] symbology of fruit. Caravaggio scholar John T. Spike has recently suggested that the boy demonstrates resistance to temptation by ignoring the sweeter fruits (fruits of sin) in favour of the bergamot, but no specific reading is widely accepted.

The model is thought to bear a resemblance to the angel in Caravaggio's ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Francis (Caravaggio)|Ecstasy of Saint Francis]]'' and to the boy dressed as [[Cupid]] on the far left in his ''[[Young Musicians (Caravaggio)|Young Musicians]]'', both about 1595 to 1597.

Several other versions of the work are known, all of which may be by Caravaggio; it has been suggested that at the early stage of his career, while he was still in the studio of Cavalier d'Arpino, Caravaggio's paintings were put in the studio's shop window, and if they attracted the attention of passing buyers, Caravaggio would feed the demand with additional versions. In 1996 John T. Spike identified the likely original as a painting auctioned in London that year {{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}, although others have argued that either the [[Chronology of works by Caravaggio|Ishizuka version]] or that in the British [[Royal Collection]] could be the prototype. The version in the Royal Collection  has been on display in the Cumberland Gallery of [[Hampton Court Palace]] since 2004.

'''''Broek in Waterland''''' is an 1889 [[oil painting]] by [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Indonesia|Indonesian]] artist [[Jan Toorop]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It is a [[pointillist]] image of the Dutch village of [[Broek in Waterland]] at twilight.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
After [[Seurat|Seurat's]] work premiered in [[Brussels]] in 1887, Toorop eagerly added those methods to his own repertoire. He became the most influential Dutch [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]], although his canvases in that style are rare and he frequently ignored that school's tenants, particularly the color principles. Their pointillist brushwork he used more readily, as in this painting. The couple gliding through the water may reflect his empathy for working men and women, a common Neo-Impressionist sentiment.

Toorop gave this landscape a very strong, geometrical structure. The sharply receding diagonals of the canals are echoed by the naked trunks of the pollard willows. These intersect with the ribbons of color in the sunset, its rosy hues firmly contrasting with the deep blues and greens of the landscape below.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt; ''Broek in Waterland'' was once coveted by the director of the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen|Boymans Museum]], who lauded its "'simple, usually disciplined structure,' 'distinction,' and controlled 'rhythmic composition.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopmans|first=Anita|title=Disputed Ownership: on the provenance of two works by Jan Toorop in the Boymans Museum|url=http://www.boijmans.nl/upload/File/toorop%20web%20UK.pdf|publisher=[[Netherlands Institute for Art History]]|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Historical information==
In February 1889, Toorop traveled to Broek in Waterland with [[Emile Verhaeren]], the Belgian poet and critic. Later that year, he painted this vivid image of the picturesque village, whose beauty had drawn emperors and tsars for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broek in Waterland|url=http://www.jan-toorop.com/artwork/1889/30|publisher=Jan Toorop Research Center|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Broek in Waterland'' was acquired by the IMA in 2002 as a gift in memory of Robert S. Ashby by his family and friends. It currently hangs in the Robert H. &amp; Ina M. Mohlman Gallery and has the acquisition number 2002.156.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Broek in Waterland|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/broek-waterland-toorop-jan|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Saracen]] arches and Byzantine mosaics complement each other within the Palatine Chapel]] 

The '''Palatine Chapel''' ({{lang-it|Cappella Palatina}}), is the royal [[chapel]] of the [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] kings of [[Sicily]] situated on the first floor at the center of the [[Palazzo dei Normanni|Palazzo Reale]] in [[Palermo]], southern [[Italy]].

Also referred to as a ''Palace church'' or ''Palace chapel'',{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=125}} it was commissioned by [[Roger II of Sicily]] in 1132 to be built upon an older chapel (now the crypt) constructed around 1080. It took eight years to build, receiving a royal charter the same year, with the [[mosaic]]s being only partially finished by 1143.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=125}} The sanctuary, dedicated to [[Saint Peter]], is reminiscent of a domed [[basilica]]. It has three [[apse]]s, as is usual in [[Byzantine architecture]], with six pointed arches (three on each side of the central nave) resting on recycled classical [[column]]s.

==Mosaics==
[[File:King - Dome interior - Capela Palatina - Palermo - Italy 2015.JPG|thumb|mosaic in the Palatine Chapel]]
The [[mosaic]]s of the Palatine Chapel are of unparalleled elegance as concerns elongated proportions and streaming draperies of figures. They are also noted for subtle modulations of colour and luminance. The oldest are probably those covering the ceiling, the drum, and the dome. The shimmering mosaics of the [[transept]], presumably dating from the 1140s and attributed to Byzantine artists, with an illustrated scene, along the north wall, of St. John in the desert and a landscape of ''Agnus Dei''.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=139}} Below this are five saints, the Greek fathers of the church, St. Gregory of Nissa, St. Gregory the Theologian, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom and St. Nicholas.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=139}} The three central figures, St. Gregory, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, allude to the Orthodox cult known as the Three Hierarchs, which originated fifty years earlier.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=139}} Every composition is set within an ornamental frame, not dissimilar to that used in contemporaneous mosaic [[icon]]s. [[Image:Arabischer Maler der Palastkapelle in Palermo 002.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Roger II of Sicily depicted on the [[muqarnas]] ceiling in an [[Islamic art|Arabic style]].]]

The rest of the mosaics, dated to the 1160s or the 1170s, are executed in a cruder manner and feature [[Latin]] (rather than Greek) inscriptions. Probably a work of local craftsmen, these pieces are more narrative and illustrative than transcendental. A few mosaics have a secular character and represent oriental [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. This may be the only substantial passage of secular Byzantine mosaic extant today.

==Chapel==
[[File:Cappella Palatina in Palermo Sicily.JPG|thumb|Cappella Palatina in Palermo Sicily]]
[[File:Cappella Palatina - sostre.jpg|thumb|[[Muqarnas]], a common element in [[Arabic architecture]]]]
The chapel combines harmoniously a variety of styles: the [[Norman architecture]] and door decor, the  [[Arabic architecture|Arabic arches]] and script adorning the roof, the [[Byzantine]] dome and mosaics. For instance, clusters of four [[eight-pointed star]]s, typical for Muslim design, are arranged on the ceiling so as to form a Christian [[cross]].

Other remarkable features of the chapel include the [[muqarnas]] ceiling, which is spectacular.  The hundreds of facets were painted, notably with many purely ornamental vegetal and [[zoomorphic]] designs but also with scenes of daily life and many subjects that have not yet been explained. Stylistically influenced by Iraqi [[Abbasid Caliphate|'Abbasid art]], these paintings are innovative in their more spatially aware representation of personages and of animals.

The chapel has been considered a union of a Byzantine church sanctuary and a Western basilica nave.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=19}} The sanctuary, is of an "Eastern" artistic nature, while the nave reflects "Western" influences.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=19}}

==Nave==
The nave, constructed under Roger II, did not contain any Christian images.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997b|p=110}} These were added later by Roger II's successors, [[William I of Sicily|William I]] and [[William II of Sicily|William II]].{{sfn|Tronzo|1997b|p=110}} The nave's ceiling consists of Arab, Greek and Latin inscriptions.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=19}}

The frame for the royal throne sets against the west wall of the nave.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=142}} There are six steps leading up to where the throne would be, along with two heraldic lions in two roundels upon the spandrels over the throne frame gabel.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=142}}

==Sanctuary==
[[File:Christ Pantocrator - Capela Palatina - Palermo - Italy 2015.JPG|thumb|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]]]]
As an expression of Norman culture, St. Dionysius and St. Martin are represented in the sanctuary.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=107}} Mosaics are of Byzantine culture in their composition and subjects.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=20}} The apex of the dome consists of the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]], with rows of angels, prophets, evangelists and saints.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=20}} The Byzantine motif ends abruptly with scenes from Christ's life along the south wall of the southern transept arm, while the north wall consists of warrior saints.{{sfn|Tronzo|1997a|p=20}}

==Analysis==
Slobodan Ćurčić considers the ''Palatine Cappella'' a reflection of Middle Byzantine art.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=142}} Illustrating architectural and artistic genius to juxtapose Sicily's "''melting pot''" culture.{{sfn|Ćurčić|1987|p=143-144}}

The '''Casa del Menandro''' ('''House of Menander''') is a house in [[Pompeii]], [[Italy]].  It is located in Region I, Insula 10, Entrance 4 (I.10.4). It covers an area of about {{Convert|1800|m2|ft2}}. The house was excavated between November 1926 and June 1932.&lt;ref name="STOA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/projects/ph/house?id=9|title=Casa del Menandro|website=www.stoa.org|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership of the house==

Della Corte thought the owner could be Quintus Poppaeus Sabinus due to a seal and a graffito in the entrance corridor mentioning 'Quintus' and other graffiti in the house referring to 'Sabinus'.&lt;ref name="STOA"/&gt;

The nationality of the owner is more in dispute than their economic status.  [[Pompeii]]’s Mediterranean climate enticed many [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to invest in holiday [[villa]]s there, so it is possible that the owner at the time of [[Vesuvius]]’ eruption in 79 AD was a wealthy tourist, not a local.&lt;ref name="PlanetWare"&gt;[http://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/pompeii-pompei-i-cm-pp.htm No Author Listed, House of Menander, Tourist Attractions in Pompeii, Italy 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art, architecture, and graffiti ==

===Fresco===

[[Image:Pompeii - Casa del Menandro - Menander.jpg|left|thumb|The fresco of [[Menander]] from which the house takes its name]]

The estate is referred to as “The House of Menander” because there is a well-preserved [[fresco]] of the ancient Greek Dramatist [[Menander]] in a small room off the [[peristyle]]. Some speculate the painting is not actually of Menander but rather of the owner of the house or another person reading works by Menander.

The house included other frescoes, including one depicting the death of [[Laocoon]].

=== Classical style and Hellenism ===

The large [[columns]] in the [[peristyle]] of the Casa del Menandro are representative of the [[Doric style]] of architecture, an offshoot of the [[Classical Style]], which also stems from [[Greece]].  The emphasis on Greek culture in Pompeian architecture is not surprising since Greek sailors had been using the port as a trading post before the [[Oscans]] founded the city in the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="ClassicalArchitecture"&gt;Roberts, Adam, Classical Architecture. London, Penguin Books. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peristyle"&gt;Curran, Leo, Pompeii: House of Pansa: Atrium and Peristyle, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graffiti===
Numerous examples of [[Roman graffiti]] can be observed on the exterior walls of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pompeiana.org/Resources/Ancient/Graffiti%20from%20Pompeii.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184129/http://www.pompeiana.org/resources/ancient/graffiti%20from%20pompeii.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Chypre''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃipʁ|pron}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʃipχ|}}) is the name of a family (or ''concept'') of [[perfume]]s that are characterised by an accord composed of [[citrus]] top[[note (perfumery)|note]]s, a middle centered on cistus [[labdanum]], and a mossy-animalic set of basenotes derived from [[oakmoss]]. Chypre perfumes fall into numerous classes according to their modifier notes, which include but are not limited to leather, florals, fruits, and [[amber]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chypre" Microsoft Encarta Dictionary, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cyprus by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Chypre'' is [[French language|French]] for [[Cyprus]]]]
The term ''chypre'' is [[French language|French]] for the island of [[Cyprus]]. Its connection to perfumery originated with the first composition to feature the bergamot-labdanum-oakmoss accord, [[François Coty]]'s 1917 perfume ''Chypre'' (now preserved at the [[Osmothèque]]), whose name was inspired by the fact that its raw materials came predominantly from Mediterranean countries.&lt;ref&gt;Turin, Luca, and Tania Sanchez. The Little Book of Perfumes: The 100 Classics. London: Profile, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although perfumes in a similar style had already been created in the 19th century, ''Chypre'' was so influential that it inspired many descendants, becoming the progenitor of a whole family of related fragrances sharing the same basic accord, which came to be known as chypres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museesdegrasse.com/mip/fla_ang/histo_gXIX.shtml#chypre Musées de Grasse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810105829/http://www.museesdegrasse.com/MIP/fla_ang/histo_gXIX.shtml |date=2007-08-10 }}, the International Perfume Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The chypre concept is characterised by the contrast between the fresh citrus accord and the woody-[[Oak moss|oakmoss]] base; often [[patchouli]] is considered an indispensable element as well.&lt;ref&gt;H&amp;R Fragrance Guide/Duftatlas/Atlas Olfactif, Quensen &amp; Oudras Verlag, Lamspringe, 2000, p. 14, {{ISBN|3-922805-69-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chypre accord is used in both male and female perfumery.

==In popular culture==
A notable literary reference to chypre is contained in the novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' by [[Dashiell Hammett]] (Knopf, 1929), in which the character Joel Cairo is described as carrying a chypre-scented handkerchief as part of his homosexual persona. Raymond Chandler's ''[[The Lady in the Lake]]'' (Knopf, 1943) also mentions a chypre-scented, monogrammed handkerchief. [[Brave New World]] written by [[Aldous Huxley]] in 1932, the main female character, Lenina Crowne, “dabbled herself with chypre” after drying off from a bath.

==Notable examples==
One of the most popular chypre perfumes was the original Miss Dior, a floral chypre launched by Christian Dior in 1947. The formula was later changed, likely due to issues with the ingredient oakmoss.  Since the mid-1980s, [[Karl Lagerfeld]] cologne, orange in color, called "Lagerfeld" is a modern chypre scent for both men and women.

In the 1950s and 60s in the USSR, "ШИПР" Shipr, became a popular men's fragrance. Today ШИПР is still available in Russian cosmetic stores and it is a popular scent among women.

==Style==
Modern chypre perfumes have various connotations such as floral, fruity, green, woody-aromatic, leathery, and animalic notes, but can easily be recognized by their "warm" and "mossy-woody" base which contrasts the fresh citrus top, and a certain bitterness in the dry-down from the oak moss and patchouli. The accord consists of:
*''Citrus'': singular or blends of [[bergamot orange|Bergamot]], [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]], [[Lemon]] or [[Neroli]]
*''[[Oakmoss]]'': mossy and woody
*''[[Patchouli]]'': camphoraceous and woody
*''[[Musk]]'': sweet, powdery, and animalic. Usually [[Synthetic musk|synthetic]] in modern times.

The composition is usually enhanced with a floral component through [[rose]] and [[jasmine]] oil.

Animalic notes such as [[civet]] can be added to this accord to provide richness, but are less popular in modern [[perfumery]]. The most common modifiers to this basic accord include [[patchouli]], [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[vetiver]], [[ambergris]], [[sandalwood]] and [[Rock rose|labdanum]] resin.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the chypre family from [http://www.museesdegrasse.com/mip/fla_ang/crea_classif.shtml#chypre Musées de Grasse]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-families of chypre==
The chypre fragrances generally fit into the Oriental and Woody family of [[fragrance wheel]] classification. They can also be classified into several styles:
*Leather and/or animalic chypres, such as ''Bandit'' by [[Robert Piguet]] (1944), ''[[Cabochard]]'' by [[Grès]] (1959), and ''[[Azurée]]'' (1969) by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]].
*Floral chypres, such as ''Knowing'' by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]], 1988.
*Fruity chypres, such as ''Femme'' by [[Rochas]], 1944, ''[[Mitsouko]]'' by [[Guerlain]], 1917, and ''Y'' by [[Yves Saint-Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], 1964.
*Green chypres, such as ''Givenchy III'' by [[Givenchy]] (1970), ''Aliage'' by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]], 1972 and ''Cuvée Spéciale'' by [[Charvet Place Vendôme|Charvet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charvet Cuvee Speciale |work=basenotes|url=http://www.basenotes.net/threads/262131-Charvet-Cuvee-Speciale|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Woody-aromatic chypres, such as ''Aromatics Elixir'' by [[Clinique]], 1972.
*Fresh-citric chypres, such as ''[[CK One]]'' by [[Calvin Klein]], 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4216">The interest in [[Crimea]]n legends started at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kondaraki, V. (1883). Legendi Krima, Moscow: Tipografiya Checherina.&lt;/ref&gt; The legends were published with a purpose of attraction of 
[[Tourism in Crimea|attracting tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, N. (1914). Legendi Krima, Moscow: Skoropechatnya A.A. Levenson; Marx, N. (1917). Legendi Krima, Odessa: Odesskie novosti.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Field work and publications of Crimean folklore were mostly done by non-professional folklorists. Therefore, it often happens that principles of classification of collected material are not known, and national origins of legends are not differentiated either.&lt;ref&gt;Zherdieva, A. (2012). ''Principles of publishing of Crimean legends''. Kultura narodov prichernomorya, № 220, 148-156.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Legends specifically of the  [[Crimean Tatars]] were published in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Birzgal, Jan. (1937). Qrьm tatar masallar ve legendalar. Simferopol: Qrım ASSR;Marx, N. (1914). Legendi Krima, Moscow: Skoropechatnya A.A.Levenson.&lt;/ref&gt; others are attributed to [[Greeks|Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;Kondaraki, V. (1883).Legendi Krima, Moscow:Tipografiya Checherina.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armenians|Armenian]],&lt;ref&gt;Fayzi, M. (1999). Legendi, predaniya i skazki Krima, Simferopol: KGMU.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Crimean Karaites]].&lt;ref&gt;Polkanov, V. (1995). Legendi i predaniya karaev (krimskih karaimov-turkov), Simferopol.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vul, R., Shlyaposhnikov, S. (1959). Krimskie legendi, Simferopol: Krimizdat.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most legends were collected in their original language, and  were translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] for publication. The nature of legend texts was influenced by translators/collectors’ professions and their cultural environment.&lt;ref&gt;Zherdieva, A. (2013). Crimean legends as phenomenon of world culture, Saarbrücken: LAP LAMBERTAcademic Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The most scientific approach for collecting legends was shown in the 1920s and 1930s, when scientific expeditions were supported by [[Communist party]], which had just come to power and started to support cultural development of national minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Birzgal, Jan. (1937). Qrьm tatar masallar ve legendalar. Simferopol: Qrım ASSR.&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, after Stalin’s repressions and [[deportation of Crimean Tatars]],  folklore became a subject for editing according to ideological demands of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Temnenko, G. (2002). “Crimean legend and some characteristics of modern cultural consciousness.” Etnografiya Krima XIX – XX vekov i sovremennie etnokulturnie processi.&lt;/ref&gt; It made the Soviet-era treatment of folklore a specific phenomenon in its own right, which is worthy of separate research.&lt;ref&gt;Zherdieva, A. (2010). “Models of mythologization of cultural consciousness in the coordinates of the Soviet ideology (by way of example, the ten postwar collection of Crimean legends).” Almanah Tradicionnaya kultura, № 2, 110-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Soviet Union collapsed, Crimean legends continued to be published commercially.&lt;ref&gt;Barskaya, Tatyana. (1999). Legendi i predaniya Krima. Yalta: Krimpress.&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from such publications for the popular market, national societies also took to publishing collections of legends.{{cn|date=March 2014}}

'''Edward Askew Sothern''' (1 April 1826 – 20 January 1881) was an English actor known for his comic roles in Britain and America, particularly [[Lord Dundreary]] in ''[[Our American Cousin]]''.

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===
Sothern was born in [[Liverpool]], the son of a merchant. He began studying medicine, and his parents hoped that he would become a minister,&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 22 January 1881, p. 9, col. F&lt;/ref&gt; but he decided against pursuing those professions. He worked as a clerk in the late 1840s and married Frances Emily "Fannie" Stewart (d. 1882). He began acting as an amateur in 1848 under the stage name of Douglas Stewart.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Holder, Heidi J. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26040 "Sothern, Edward Askew (1826–1881)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 7 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 he appeared in his first professional engagement at [[Saint Helier]] in [[Jersey]], as Claude Melnotte in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer Lytton]]'s ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]''. In the early 1850s, he played in various English companies without particular success in [[Portsmouth]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Birmingham]].

Sothern travelled to America in 1852, first playing Dr. Pangloss in ''[[The Heir at Law]]'' in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], with John Lacy's company at the [[National Theatre, Boston (1836)|National Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; He then played at the [[Howard Athenaeum]] in Boston and at [[Barnum's American Museum]] in New York.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1854, he joined the company at [[Wallack's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Edward Askew Sothern" at the ''American Theater Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of his career, Sothern's wife often performed with him. By 1856, he had begun using his own name, Sothern, on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Vol. VI, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; He had become associated with [[Laura Keene]]'s company in New York by 1856.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfaff&gt;Whitley, Edward. [http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/pfaffs/p132/ "Sothern, Edward Askew (Douglas Stewart)"], The Vault at Pfaff's, Lehigh University's digital library&lt;/ref&gt; He finally gained attention at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York starring as Armand in ''Camille''. The critic [[Clement Scott]] noted that while Sothern was "as handsome a man as ever stood on the stage", he was not naturally suited to romantic roles.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, vol. 1, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Our American Cousin'' ===
[[File:Lord Dundreary.jpg|thumb|right|Sothern as [[Lord Dundreary]]]]
As a result of his success in ''Camille'', Sothern was given a part in [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Laura Keene]]'s Theatre. This piece would later become famous as the play that [[Abraham Lincoln]] was watching when he was assassinated. Sothern's role was [[Lord Dundreary]], a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. At first, he was reluctant to accept the role; it was so small and unimportant that he felt it beneath him and feared it might damage his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Vol. VII, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned his qualms to his friend, [[Joseph Jefferson]], who had been cast in the leading role of Asa Trenchard in the play. Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: "There are no small parts, only small actors."&lt;ref&gt;Havard, Bernard. ''Walnut Street Theatre'', p. 40, Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-7385-5770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 1858, ''Our American Cousin'' premiered in New York. After a couple of unhappy weeks in the small role, Sothern began portraying the role as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to nonsensical references to sayings of his "bwother" Sam.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and merry mockery on both sides of the Atlantic. His exaggerated, droopy side-whiskers became known as "Dundrearys". Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Sothern made his London debut in the role when the play ran for 496 performances at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1861, earning rave reviews.&lt;ref&gt;"Edward Askew Sothern", ''Virtual American Biographies'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' wrote, "it is certainly the funniest thing in the world... a vile caricature of a vain nobleman, intensely ignorant, and extremely indolent".&lt;ref&gt;''The Athenaeum'', 16 November 1861&lt;/ref&gt;

Dundreary became a popular recurring character, and Sothern successfully revived the play many times, making Dundreary by far his most famous role. A number of spin-off works were also created, including Charles Gayler's sequel, ''Our American Cousin at Home, or, Lord Dundreary Abroad'' (Buffalo, New York, 1860,&lt;ref&gt;''Buffalo Daily Courier'', 1 November 1860&lt;/ref&gt; and then New York City, 1861&lt;ref&gt;Brown, T. Allston (1903). ''A History of the New York Stage, Volume I'', New York: Dodd, Mead, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Dundreary Married and Done For''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Sothern wrote his own play, ''Suspense'', produced for Keene's 1860-61 season.&lt;ref name=Pfaff/&gt; He won wide popularity from his interpretation of Sam Slingsby in [[John Oxenford]]'s ''Brother Sam'' (1862; revived in 1865), a play about Dundreary's brother.

=== 1860s and 1870s ===
In 1864, Sothern created the title role in [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]]'s ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'' at the Haymarket Theatre. The play was a great success. ''[[The Times]]'' praised Sothern's acting in the Act II scene where Sothern depicted "the most extravagant form of drunkenness... perpetually brought into contact with the real agony of mind which is now on the point of casting aside the mask of debauchery".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 May 1864&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in Robertson's ''Home'' and later claimed to have written some of the best scenes in each work (a claim that was disputed by Robertson).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Other plays written for the now-famous Sothern were ''The Woman in Mauve'', by Watts Phillips; ''The Favourite of Fortune'' and ''A Hero of Romance'' by [[John Westland Marston|Westland Marston]]; ''A Lesson for Life'' by [[Tom Taylor]]; and ''An English Gentleman'' by [[H. J. Byron]] (1871) at the Haymarket.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1871, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Sothern continued to act mostly in London until 1876, but also toured extensively in the British provinces, North America and Europe.

Sothern became popular with Robertson's crowd, including with the Haymarket's manager, [[John Baldwin Buckstone]], actor [[J. L. Toole]], and dramatists Byron and [[W. S. Gilbert]], who later wrote three plays for him, ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 119–20; 123–24&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ne'er-do-Weel]]'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/neerdowell/index.html Information about ''The Ne'er do Weel'' at the G&amp;S Archive], accessed 23 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 124 and 134–35&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'' (1881).&lt;ref name=Foggerty&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/foggerty/failure.html "Foggerty's Failure: A few background notes on ''Foggerty’s Fairy''"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 2007, accessed 23 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  He was known as a sportsman and bon vivant and became famous for his magic tricks, conversation and, especially, his [[practical jokes]] (he was born on [[April fool's day]]).  Sothern and his friends demanded that clerks sell them goods not carried by the store in question, staged mock arguments on public omnibuses, ran fake advertisements in newspapers, paid street urchins to annoy passers-by and so forth.  At one restaurant, Toole and Sothern removed the silver and hid under the table.  When the unfortunate waiter found the dining room empty and the silver gone, he ran to report the theft.  By the time he returned, Toole and Sothern had re-set the table as if nothing had happened.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Sothern left England to tour in America in early 1876 and wrote to Gilbert to be ready with a play by October that would feature him in a serious role.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;  This play eventually became ''Dan'l Druce''.  However, Sothern produced but did not star in the play.  Gilbert soon wrote another play for Sothern, this time a comedy, ''The Ne'er-do-Weel''.  Sothern was not pleased with the work, and Gilbert offered to take it back.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 123–24 and 134–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it was eventually produced, Sothern did not appear in it.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Sothern had already paid Gilbert for the play, and Gilbert was unable immediately to pay him back.  After various arrangements between Gilbert and Sothern involving American productions of another Gilbert play, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), Gilbert finally promised, in 1878, to write a new play for Sothern.  This was to be ''Foggerty's Fairy''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 134–35 and 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern's biographer T. Edgar Pemberton noted that one role he regretted not playing was Cheviot in ''Engaged''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Sothern continued to tour and perform Dundreary and other works.  In October 1877 at the Academy of Music in New York, he played the title role in ''[[Othello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Brander and Hutton, Laurence. [https://archive.org/details/lifeandartofedwi00mattrich ''The Life and art of Edwin Booth and his contemporaries''] (1906), p. 118, Boston: L. C. Page&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern's next great role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's ''The Crushed Tragedian'' (1878, originally named ''The Prompter's Box'') at the Haymarket.  ''The Era'' admired "the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes" of his portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 19 May 1878&lt;/ref&gt;  He next appeared in ''The Hornet's Nest'' by Byron at the Haymarket.  ''The Crushed Tragedian'' was not a great success in London, but it became a hit in New York.  ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' raved, "With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and it is as though he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ and you know that he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pemberton, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in [[Lord Lytton]]'s play ''Money'' as Sir Frederick Blount.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 10 April 1879, p. 8, col. B&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last years and family ===
In the autumn of 1879, after a long summer fishing trip, Sothern was on another [[United States|American]] tour.  ''The Era'' wrote in October 1879 that "It is proposed, during Mr Sothern's [American] engagement, to bring out revivals of ''The Crushed Tragedian'', ''Dundreary'', and ''David Garrick'', the new comedy by Mr Gilbert being reserved for the spring engagement."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', Drama in America column, 12 October 1879&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 February 1880 ''The Era'' reported: "Mr Sothern says that, although his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]], he would not take 6,000 guineas for it now.  It is a piece of the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 29 February 1880&lt;/ref&gt;  The same issue of ''The Era'' states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] in ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'', as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour.  Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the fall, although he fulfilled his performing commitments.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Sothern returned to [[England]] for a six-week holiday in June 1880, still planning to produce ''Fogerty's Fairy'' in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  After one illness and a short European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the fall, and his health declined until he died in January 1881, never having performed Gilbert's play.

[[File:Edward Askew Sothern gravestone.JPG|thumb|Sothern's grave in Southampton Old Cemetery]]
Sothern died at his home in Cavendish Square, London, at the age of 54 and is buried in [[Southampton Old Cemetery]], Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g186299-d216086/Southampton:United-Kingdom:The.Old.Cemetery.html Information about Sothern's burial site]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sothern was such a notorious practical joker that many of his friends missed his funeral, thinking it was a joke.  His sister, Mary Cowan, was the principal beneficiary of his last will, signed shortly before his death.  A previous will had given most of the estate to his widow and children.  Sothern's widow contested the will but lost, and it took Cowan until 31 May 1881 to obtain probate.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Gilbert suggested that she "underlet" ''Foggerty's Fairy'' to him, and he eventually had it produced.  Later, she wrote to him: "Allow me to say that of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness &amp; fairness &amp; I feel grateful to you for sparing me any trouble or anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern and his wife had four children, all of whom became actors: Lytton Edward (1851–1887), [[Edward Hugh Sothern|Edward Hugh (E. H.)]], George Evelyn Augustus T. (b. 1870; who used the stage name Sam Sothern) and Eva Mary.  E. H. Sothern became prominent on the American stage.  Sothern's house in [[Kensington]], London was a resort for people of fashion, and he was as much a favourite in America as in the United Kingdom.

== Famous hoax ==
Sothern's passion for practical joking amounted almost to a mania. He would often falsely announce the death of a friend or send people on fool's errands.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, Chapter IV, "Sothern in High Spirits", pp. 199 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; Among his most elaborate practical jokes was the following.  When the husband of actress [[Adelaide Neilson]], Philip Henry Lee, visited New York in the mid-19th century, he had been warned about the wild, bohemian behaviour of American authors, but expressed his doubt as to the veracity of the stories. Sothern assured him it was true and arranged a private dinner for Lee with twelve "writers and critics", who were really actors.  During the dinner, a quarrel arose over literary matters, culminating in a fight breaking out. The men, apparently drunk, brandished an axe, knives and revolvers. The room was filled with shouts, shots and struggle. Someone thrust a knife into Lee's hand, saying, "Defend yourself! This is butchery, sheer butchery!" Sothern advised him to "Keep cool, and don't get shot", before the joke was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, pp. 223–226&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fayum-35.jpg|thumb|upright|The single specimen of Gayet's mummy portraits from Antinoopolis for which information on its archaeological context is available. The heavily gilt portrait was found in winter 1905/06 and sold to [[Berlin]] in 1907. [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|Berlin, Egyptian Museum.]]]]
'''Mummy portraits''' or '''Fayum mummy portraits''' (also '''Faiyum mummy portraits''') is the modern term given to a type of naturalistic painted [[portrait]] on wooden boards attached to [[Upper Class|Upper class]] [[mummy|mummies]] from [[Roman Egypt]]. They belong to the tradition of [[panel painting]], one of the most highly regarded forms of art in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]]. The Fayum portraits are the only large body of art from that tradition to have survived.

Mummy portraits have been found across [[Egypt]], but are most common in the [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum Basin]], particularly from [[Hawara]] in the Fayum Basin (hence the common name) and the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city [[Antinoopolis]]. "Faiyum Portraits" is generally used as a stylistic, rather than a geographic, description. While painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases date back to pharaonic times, the Faiyum mummy portraits were an innovation dating to the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. p.193. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portraits date to the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman era]], from the late 1st century BC or the early 1st century AD onwards. It is not clear when their production ended, but recent research suggests the middle of the 3rd century. They are among the largest groups among the very few survivors of the [[panel painting]] tradition of the classical world, which was continued into [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and Western traditions in the post-classical world, including the local tradition of [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] in Egypt.

The portraits covered the faces of bodies that were mummified for burial. Extant examples indicate that they were mounted into the bands of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies. Almost all have now been detached from the mummies.&lt;ref&gt;Examples still attached are in the [[Egyptian Museum]], [[Cairo]] and the British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[Ancient Roman art|artistic traditions]] than [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian ones]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Lorna. Gahlin, Lucia. &lt;cite&gt;Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Reference to the Myths, Religions, Pyramids and Temples of the Land of the Pharaohs&lt;/cite&gt;. p.236 Hermes House. 2002. {{ISBN|1-84477-008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two groups of portraits can be distinguished by technique: one of [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) paintings, the other in [[tempera]]. The former are usually of higher quality.

About 900 mummy portraits are known at present.&lt;ref&gt;Corpus of all known specimens: Klaus Parlasca: ''Ritratti di mummie'', Repertorio d'arte dell'Egitto greco-romano Vol. B, 1-4, Rome 1969-2003; a further specimen discovered since: Petrie Museum UC 79360, B. T. Trope, S. Quirke, P. Lacovara: ''Excavating Egypt'', Atlanta 2005, p. 101, {{ISBN|1-928917-06-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority were found in the [[necropolis|necropoleis]] of Faiyum. Due to the hot dry Egyptian climate, the paintings are frequently very well preserved, often retaining their brilliant colours seemingly unfaded by time.

== History of research ==
[[Image:Engraving of finding mummies in Sakkara by Pietro Della Valle.gif|thumb|upright|Fanciful but inauthentic depiction of the mummies' discovery by Pietro Della Valle]]

===Pre-19th century===
The Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]], on a visit to [[Saqqara]]-[[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in 1615, was the first European to discover and describe mummy portraits. He transported some mummies with portraits to Europe, which are now in the [[Albertinum]] ([[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]]).&lt;ref name="Borg 10"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 10f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century collectors===
Although interest in Ancient Egypt steadily increased after that period, further finds of mummy portraits did not become known before the early 19th century. The provenance of these first new finds is unclear; they may come from [[Saqqara]] as well, or perhaps from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. In 1820, the Baron of Minotuli acquired several mummy portraits for a German collector, but they became part of a whole shipload of Egyptian artifacts lost in the [[North Sea]]. In 1827, Léon de Laborde brought two portraits, supposedly found in Memphis, to Europe, one of which can today be seen at the [[Louvre]], the other in the [[British Museum]]. [[Ippolito Rosellini]], a member of [[Jean-François Champollion]]'s 1828/29 expedition to Egypt, brought a further portrait back to [[Florence]]. It is so similar to de Laborde's specimens that it is thought to be from the same source.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt; During the 1820s, the British [[Consul General]] to Egypt, [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], sent several further portraits to [[Paris]] and [[London]]. Some of them were long considered portraits of the family of the Theban [[Archon]] Pollios Soter, a historical character known from written sources, but this has turned out to be incorrect.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt;

Once again, a long period elapsed before more mummy portraits came to light. In 1887, Daniel Marie Fouquet heard of the discovery of numerous portrait mummies in a cave. He set off to inspect them some days later, but arrived too late, as the finders had used the painted plaques for firewood during the three previous cold desert nights. Fouquet acquired the remaining two of what had originally been fifty portraits. While the exact location of this find is unclear, the likely source is from er-Rubayat.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt; At that location, not long after Fouquet's visit, the Viennese art trader Theodor Graf found several further images, which he tried to sell as profitably as possible. He engaged the famous [[Leipzig]]-based [[Egyptologist]] [[Georg Ebers]] to publish his finds. He produced presentation folders to advertise his individual finds throughout Europe. Although little was known about their archaeological find contexts, Graf went as far as to ascribe the portraits to known [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] pharaohs by analogy with other works of art, mainly coin portraits. None of these associations were particularly well argued or convincing, but they gained him much attention, not least because he gained the support of well-known scholars like [[Rudolf Virchow]]. As a result, mummy portraits became the centre of much attention.&lt;ref name="Barbara Borg 1998"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 13f., 34ff.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, their very specific aesthetic made them sought-after collection pieces, distributed by the global arts trade.

===Archaeological study: Flinders Petrie===
[[Image:Fayum-07.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of a portrait within its mummy wrappings, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1911.]]
In parallel, more scientific engagement with the portraits was beginning. In 1887, the British archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]] started [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at [[Hawara]]. He discovered a Roman [[necropolis]] which yielded 81 portrait mummies in the first year of excavation. At an exhibition in London, these portraits drew large crowds. In the following year, Petrie continued excavations at the same location but now suffered from the competition of a German and an Egyptian art dealer. Petrie returned in the winter of 1910/11 and excavated a further 70 portrait mummies, some of them quite badly preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie: ''Roman Portraits and Memphis IV'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; With very few exceptions, Petrie's studies still provide the only examples of mummy portraits so far found as the result of systematic excavation and published properly. Although the published studies are not entirely up to modern standards, they remain the most important source for the find contexts of portrait mummies.

===Late 19th and early 20th century collectors===
In 1892, the German archaeologist von Kaufmann discovered the so-called "[[Tomb of Aline]]", which held three mummy portraits; among the most famous today. Other important sources of such finds are at [[Antinopolis]] and [[Akhmim]]. The French archaeologist Albert Gayet worked at Antinoopolis and found much relevant material, but his work, like that of many of his contemporaries, does not satisfy modern standards. His documentation is incomplete, many of his finds remain without context.

===Museums===
Today, mummy portraits are represented in all important archaeological museums of the world. Many have fine examples on display, notably the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"&gt;Nicola Hoesch: ''Mumienporträts'' in: ''[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]], Bd. 8 (2000), p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were mostly recovered through inappropriate and unprofessional means, virtually all are without archaeological context, a fact which consistently lowers the quality of archaeological and culture-historical information they provide. As a result, their overall significance as well as their specific interpretations remain controversial.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt;

== Materials and techniques ==
A majority of images show a formal portrait of a single figure, facing and looking toward the viewer, from an angle that is usually slightly turned from full face. The figures are presented as busts against a monochrome background which in some instances are decorated. The individuals are both male and female and range in age from childhood to old age.

===Painted surface===
[[File:Portrait of the Boy Eutyches - Metmuseum 18.9.2.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a boy, identified by inscription as Eutyches, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
The majority of preserved mummy portraits were painted on boards or panels, made from different imported hardwoods, including [[oak]], [[Lime tree|lime]], [[sycamore]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]], [[ficus|fig]], and [[citrus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wrede, LÄ IV, 218&lt;/ref&gt; The wood was cut into thin rectangular panels and made smooth. The finished panels were set into layers of wrapping that enclosed the body and were surrounded by bands of cloth, giving the effect of a window-like opening through which the face of the deceased could be seen. Portraits were sometimes painted directly onto the canvas or rags of the mummy wrapping ([[cartonnage]] painting).

===Painting techniques===
The wooden surface was sometimes primed for painting with a layer of plaster. In some cases the primed layer reveals a preparatory drawing.
Two painting techniques were employed: [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) painting and animal glue [[tempera]].  The encaustic images are striking because of the  contrast between vivid and rich colours, and comparatively large brush-strokes, producing an "[[Impressionistic]]" effect. The tempera paintings have a finer gradation of tones and chalkier colours, giving a more restrained appearance.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; In some cases, [[gold leaf]] was used to depict jewellery and wreaths. There also are examples of hybrid techniques or of variations from the main techniques.

The Fayum portraits reveal a wide range of painterly expertise and skill in presenting a lifelike appearance. The naturalism of the portraits is often revealed in knowledge of anatomic structure and in skilled modelling of the form by the use of light and shade, which gives an appearance of three-dimensionality to most of the figures. The graded flesh tones are enhanced with shadows and highlights indicative of directional lighting.

==Subjects and social context of the paintings==

===People of Fayum===
Under Greco-Roman rule, Egypt hosted several [[Greeks|Greek]] settlements, mostly concentrated in [[Alexandria]], but also in a few other cities, where Greek settlers lived alongside some seven to ten million native [[Egyptians]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Winthrope L in Bugh, Glenn Richard. ed. "The Hellenistic Kingdoms". ''The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2006, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Faiyum's earliest Greek inhabitants were soldier-veterans and ''cleruchs'' (elite military officials) who were settled by the Ptolemaic kings on reclaimed lands.&lt;ref&gt;Stanwick, Paul Edmund. ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings as Egyptian Pharaohs.'' Austin: University of Texas Press. 2003, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Native Egyptians also came to settle in Faiyum from all over the country, notably the [[Nile Delta]], [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]], [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], to undertake the labor involved in the land reclamation process, as attested by personal names, local cults and recovered [[papyrus|papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, R.S. in Susan Walker, ed. ''Ancient Faces : Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications). New York: Routledge, 2000, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the population of Faiyum was Greek during the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, with the rest being native Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Bagnall, op cit."&gt;Bagnall, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; By the Roman period, much of the "Greek" population of Faiyum was made-up of either Hellenized Egyptians or people of mixed Egyptian-Greek origins.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the Roman Period, many veterans of the Roman army, who, initially at least, were not Egyptian but people from disparate cultural backgrounds, settled in the area after the completion of their service, and formed social relations and intermarried with local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alston|first1=R.|title=Soldier and Society in Roman Egypt: A Social History|date=1995|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', p. 184. Addison Wesley, {{ISBN|0-321-01618-1}}: "''But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that [[Ptolemy]] and [[Diophantus]], [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] and [[Hypatia]] were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized," to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.''"&lt;/ref&gt; DNA studies show genetic continuity between the Pre-Ptolemaic, Ptolemaic and Roman populations, indicating that foreign rule impacted the town’s population only to a very limited degree at the genetic level.&lt;ref name=Verena/&gt;

===Age profile of those depicted===
[[Image:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|upright|Man with sword belt, [[British Museum]].]]
Most of the portraits depict the deceased at a relatively young age, and many show children. According to Walker, [[Computed tomography|C.A.T.]] scans  reveal a correspondence of age and sex between mummy and image. He concludes that the age distribution reflects the low life expectancy at the time. It was often believed that the wax portraits were completed during the life of the individual and displayed in their home, a custom that belonged to the traditions of [[Greek art]],&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece'', Nigel Guy, Routledge Taylor and Francis group, p. 601&lt;/ref&gt; but this view is no longer widely held given the evidence suggested by the C.A.T. scans of the Faiyum mummies, as well as Roman census returns. In addition, some portraits were painted directly onto the coffin; for example, on a shroud or another part.

===Social status===
The patrons of the portraits apparently belonged to the affluent upper class of military personnel, civil servants and religious dignitaries. Not everyone could afford a mummy portrait; many mummies were found without one. Flinders Petrie states that only one or two per cent of the mummies he excavated were embellished with portraits.&lt;ref name="Borg 58"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The rates for mummy portraits do not survive, but it can be assumed that the material caused higher costs than the labour, since in antiquity, painters were appreciated as craftsmen rather than as artists.&lt;ref name="Borg 58"/&gt; The situation from the "[[Tomb of Aline]]" is interesting in this regard. It contained four mummies: those of Aline, of two children and of her husband. Unlike his wife and children, the latter was not equipped with a portrait but with a gilt three-dimensional mask. Perhaps plaster masks were preferred if they could be afforded.

[[Image:FuneraryMasksRomanEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Three-dimensional funerary masks of painted plaster from Faiyum (1st century), [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]].]]

Based on literary, archaeological and genetic studies, it appears that those depicted were native Egyptians, who had adopted the dominant Greco-Roman culture.&lt;ref name=Verena&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of some of those portrayed are known from inscriptions, they are predominantly Greek. Hairstyles and clothing are always influenced by Roman fashion. Women and children are often depicted wearing valuable ornaments and fine garments, men often wearing specific and elaborate outfits. Greek inscriptions of names are relatively common, sometimes they include professions. It is not known whether such inscriptions always reflect reality, or whether they may state ideal conditions or aspirations rather than true conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Hoesch: "Mumienporträts'"in: ''[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]'', Bd. 8 (2000), p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; One single inscription is known to definitely indicate the deceased's profession (a shipowner) correctly. The mummy of a woman named Hermione also included the term ''grammatike'' (γραμματική). For a long time, it was assumed that this indicated that she was a teacher by profession (for this reason, Flinders Petrie donated the portrait to [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], the first residential college for women in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), but today, it is assumed that the term indicates her level of education. Some portraits of men show sword-belts or even pommels, suggesting that they were members of the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture-historical context ==

===Changes in burial habits===
The burial habits of [[Ptolemaic Dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptians mostly followed ancient traditions. The bodies of members of the upper classes were [[mummy|mummified]], equipped with a decorated coffin and a mummy mask to cover the head. The [[Greeks]] who entered Egypt at that time mostly followed their own habits. There is evidence from [[Alexandria]] and other sites indicating that they practised the Greek tradition of [[cremation]]. This broadly reflects the general situation in [[Hellenistic]] Egypt, its rulers proclaiming themselves to be [[pharaoh]]s but otherwise living in an entirely Hellenistic world, incorporating only very few local elements. Conversely, the Egyptians only slowly developed an interest in the Greek-Hellenic culture that dominated the [[East Mediterranean]] since the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This situation changed substantially with the arrival of the Romans. Within a few generations, all Egyptian elements disappeared from everyday life. Cities like [[Karanis]] or [[Oxyrhynchus]] are largely Graeco-Roman places. There is clear evidence that this resulted from a mixing of different ethnicities in the ruling classes of Roman Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 40–56; Walker, Bierbrier: ''Ancient Faces'', pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious continuity===
Only in the sphere of religion is there evidence for a continuation of Egyptian traditions. Egyptian temples were erected as late as the 2nd century. In terms of burial habits, Egyptian and Hellenistic elements now mixed. Coffins became increasingly unpopular and went entirely out of use by the 2nd century. In contrast, mummification appears to have been practised by large parts of the population. The mummy mask, originally an Egyptian concept, grew more and more Graeco-Roman in style, Egyptian motifs became ever rarer. The adoption of Roman portrait painting into Egyptian burial cult belongs into this general context.&lt;ref&gt;summarised in: Judith A. Corbelli: ''The Art of Death in Graeco-Roman Egypt'', Princes Risborough 2006 {{ISBN|0-7478-0647-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Link with Roman funeral masks?===
Some authors suggest that the idea of such portraits may be related to the custom among the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]] of displaying ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imagines]]'', images of their ancestors, in the [[domus|atrium of their house]]. In funeral processions, these wax masks were worn by professional mourners to emphasize the continuity of an illustrious family line, but originally perhaps to represent a deeper evocation of the presence of the dead. [[Roman festivals]] such as the [[Parentalia]] as well as [[Religion in ancient Rome#Domestic and private cult|everyday domestic rituals]] cultivated ancestral spirits (see also [[veneration of the dead]]). The development of mummy portraiture may represent a combination of Egyptian and [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman funerary tradition]], since it appears only after Egypt was established as a [[Roman province]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Salon paintings"?===
The images depict the heads or busts of men, women and children. They probably date from c. 30 BC to the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Hoesch: ''Mumienporträts'' in: ''Der Neue Pauly'', Vol. 8 (2000), p. 464; others scholars, e.g. Barbara Borg suggest that they start under [[Tiberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; To the modern eye, the portraits appear highly individualistic. Therefore, it has been assumed for a long time that they were produced during the lifetime of their subjects and displayed as "salon paintings" within their houses, to be added to their mummy wrapping after their death. Newer research rather suggests that they were only painted after death,&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; an idea perhaps contradicted by the multiple paintings on some specimens and the (suggested) change of specific details on others. The individualism of those depicted was actually created by variations in some specific details, within a largely unvaried general scheme.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; The habit of depicting the deceased was not a new one, but the painted images gradually replaced the earlier Egyptian masks, although the latter continued in use for some time, often occurring directly adjacent to portrait mummies, sometimes even in the same graves.

===Realism and convention===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Together with the painted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan tombs]], the [[Lucanians|Lucanian]] tombs and the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]], the frescoes from [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and the [[Greek vase]]s, they are the best preserved paintings from ancient times and are renowned for their remarkable [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]]. It is, however, debatable whether the portraits depict the subjects as they really were. Analyses have shown that the painters depicted faces according to conventions in a repetitive and formulaic way, albeit with a variety of hairstyles and beards. They appear to have worked from a number of standard types without making detailed observations of the unique facial proportions of specific individuals which give each face its own personality.

===Style===

In the virtual absence of other panel paintings from the period in question, it is difficult to make firm statements about the stylistic context of the portraits. While it seems clear that they are not in continuity from Egyptian precedents, the same cannot be said for the northern shores of the Mediterranean, where such material is less likely to have survived, due to climatic conditions there. Evidence from frescoes, mosaics and other media suggests that stylistically, the mummy portraits broadly fit within the prevailing Graeco-Roman traditions then dominant around the Mediterranean.

==Coexistence with other burial habits==
The religious meaning of mummy portraits has not, so far, been fully explained, nor have associated grave rites. There is some indication that it developed from genuine Egyptian funerary rites, adapted by a multi-cultural ruling class.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; The tradition of mummy portraits occurred from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] to [[Nubia]], but it is striking that other funerary habits prevailed over portrait mummies at all sites except those in the Faiyum (and there especially Hawara and Achmim) and Antinoopolis. In most sites, different forms of burial coexisted. The choice of grave type may have been determined to a large extent by the financial means and status of the deceased, modified by local customs. Portrait mummies have been found both in rock-cut tombs and in freestanding built grave complexes, but also in shallow pits. It is striking that they are virtually never accompanied by any grave offerings, with the exception of occasional pots or sprays of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the mummy portrait tradition==
[[Image:Fayum-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a man]]
For a long time, it was assumed that the latest portraits belong to the end of the 4th century, but recent research has modified this view considerably, suggesting that the last wooden portraits belong to the middle, the last directly painted mummy wrappings to the second half of the 3rd century. It is commonly accepted that production reduced considerably since the beginning of the 3rd century. Several reasons for the decline of the mummy portrait have been suggested; no single reason should probably be isolated, rather, they should be seen as operating together.

*In the 3rd century the Roman Empire underwent a severe economic crisis, severely limiting the financial abilities of the upper classes. Although they continued to lavishly spend money on representation, they favoured public appearances, like games and festivals, over the production of portraits. However, other elements of sepulchral representation, like [[sarcophagi]], did continue.
*There is evidence of a religious crisis at the same time. This may not be as closely connected with the rise of Christianity as previously assumed. (The earlier suggestion of a 4th-century end to the portraits would coincide with the widespread distribution of Christianity in Egypt. Christianity also never banned mummification.) An increasing neglect of Egyptian temples is noticeable during the Roman imperial period, leading to a general drop in interest in all ancient religions.
*The [[Constitutio Antoniniana]], i.e. the granting of Roman citizenship to all free subjects changed the social structures of Egypt. For the first time, the individual cities gained a degree of self-administration. At the same time, the provincial upper classes changed in terms of both composition and inter-relations.
Thus, a combination of several factors appears to have led to changes of fashion and ritual. No clear causality can be asserted.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 88–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the limited nature of the current understanding of portrait mummies, it remains distinctly possible that future research will considerably modify the image presented here. For example, some scholars suspect that the centre of production of such finds, and thus the centre of the distinctive funerary tradition they represent, may have been located at Alexandria. New finds from [[Marina el-Alamein]] strongly support such a  view.&lt;ref name="Barbara Borg 1998"/&gt; In view of the near-total loss of Greek and Roman paintings, mummy portraits are today considered to be among the very rare examples of ancient art that can be seen to reflect "Great paintings" and especially Roman portrait painting.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt;

==Mummy portraits as sources on provincial Roman fashion==
[[Image:Fayum-13.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of a woman with curly hair, wearing a violet chiton and cloak and pendant earrings. [[British Museum]].]]

===Provincial fashions===
Mummy portraits depict a variety of different hairstyles. They are one of the main aids in dating the paintings. The majority of the deceased were depicted with hairstyles then in fashion. They are frequently similar to those depicted in [[sculpture]]. As part of Roman propaganda, such sculptures, especially those depicting the imperial family, were often displayed throughout the empire. Thus, they had a direct influence on the development of fashion. Nevertheless, the mummy portraits, as well as other finds, suggest that fashions lasted longer in the provinces than in the imperial court, or at least that diverse styles might coexist.

===Hairstyles===
Since Roman men tended to wear short-cropped hair, female hairstyles are a better source of evidence for changes in fashion. The female portraits suggest a coarse chronological scheme: Simple hairstyles with a central parting in the [[Tiberius|Tiberian]] period are followed by more complex ringlet hairstyles, nested plaits and [[toupee|curly toupées]] over the forehead in the late 1st century. Small oval nested plaits dominate the time of the [[Antonines]], simple central-parting hairstyles with a hairknot in the neck occur in the second half of the 2nd century. The time of [[Septimius Severus]] was characterised by [[toupée]]-like fluffy as well as strict, straight styles, followed by looped plaits on the crown of the head. The latter belong to the very final phase of mummy portraits, and have only been noted on a few mummy wrappings. It seems to be the case that curly hairstyles were especially popular in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 45–49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Egyptian - Female Portrait Mask - Walters 325.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The plaited hairstyle of this elite woman makes it possible to date this painting to the reign of [[Trajan]] (AD 98 – 117). [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

[[Image:Fayum-11.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Depiction of a woman with a ringlet hairstyle, an orange chiton with black bands and rod-shaped earrings. [[Royal Museum of Scotland]].]]

===Clothing===
Like the hairstyles, the clothing depicted also follows the general fashions of the Roman Empire, as known from statues and busts. Both men and women tend to wear a thin [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] as an undergarment. Above it, both sexes tend to wear a cloak, laid across the shoulders or wound around the torso. The males wear virtually exclusively white, while female clothing is often red or pink, but can also be yellow, white, blue or purple. The chiton often bears a decorative line (''[[laticlave|clavus]]''), occasionally light red or light green, also sometimes gold, but normally in dark colours. Some painted mummy wrappings from Antinoopolis depict garments with long sleeves and very wide ''clavi''. So far, not a single portrait has been definitely shown to depict the [[toga]], a key symbol of Roman citizenship. It should, however, be kept in mind that Greek cloaks and togas are draped very similarly on depictions of the 1st and early 2nd centuries. In the late 2nd and 3rd centuries, togas should be distinguishable, but fail to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewelry===
Apart from the gold [[wreath]]s worn by many men, with very few exceptions, only women are depicted with jewellery. This generally accords with the common jewellery types of the Graeco-Roman East. Especially the Antinoopolis portraits depict simple gold link chains and massive gold rings. There are also depictions of [[precious stone|precious]] or [[semi-precious stones]] like [[emerald]], [[carnelian]], [[garnet]], [[agate]] or [[amethyst]], rarely also of [[pearl]]s. The stones were normally ground into cylindrical or spherical beads. Some portraits depict elaborate [[collier (necklace)|colliers]], with precious stones set in gold.

The gold wreath was apparently rarely, if ever, worn in life, but a number have been found in graves from much earlier periods. Based on the plant wreaths given as prizes in contests, the idea was apparently to celebrate the achievements of the deceased in life.

There are three basic shapes of ear ornaments: Especially common in the 1st century are circular or drop-shaped pendants. Archaeological finds indicate that these were fully or semi-spherical. Later tastes favoured S-shaped hooks of gold wire, on which up to five beads of different colours and materials could be strung. The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a white bead or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine [[diadem (personal wear)|diadems]], and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold [[hairnet]]s. Many portraits also depict [[amulet]]s and [[pendant]]s, perhaps with magical functions.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''„Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ....“ Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art-historical significance ==
[[Image:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|Tondo with images of Septimius Severus and his family. [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].]]
The mummy portraits have immense art-historical importance. Ancient sources indicate that [[panel painting]] (rather than [[wall painting]]), i.e. painting on wood or other mobile surfaces was held in high regard. But very few ancient panel paintings
survive. One of the few examples besides the mummy portraits is the [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (around 200), which, like the mummy portraits, is believed to represent a provincial version of contemporary style.&lt;ref&gt;other examples: a framed portrait from Hawara (Walker, Bierbrier: ''Ancient Faces'', pp. 121–122, Nr. 117), the image of a man flanked by two deities from the same site (Walker, Bierbrier: ''Ancient Faces'', pp. 123–124, Nr. 119), or the 6th century BC panels from Pitsa in Greece [https://www.sikyon.com/sicyon/Painting/spainting_eg.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some aspects of the mummy portraits, especially their frontal perspective and their concentration on key facial features, strongly resemble later [[icon painting]]. A direct link has been suggested, but it should be kept in mind that the mummy portraits represent only a small part of a much wider Graeco-Roman tradition, the whole of which later bore an influence on [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] and [[Byzantine Art]].  A pair of panel "icons" of [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]] of comparable date (3rd century) and style are in the [[Getty Museum]] at [[Malibu, California|Malibu]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aisthesis.de/wbock/bilder/4-9si.gif image]&lt;/ref&gt; as with the cult of [[Mithras]], earlier examples of cult images were sculptures or pottery figurines, but from the 3rd century reliefs and then painted images are found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Weitzmann]] in The Icon, 1982, Evans Brothers Ltd, London, p. 3, (trans of Le Icone, Montadori 1981), {{ISBN|0-237-45645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Guerrilla Girls''' is an anonymous group of feminist, female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/guerrilla-girls-6858 Guerrilla Girls in Tate Modern Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The group formed in New York City in 1985 with the mission of bringing [[gender inequality|gender]] and [[racial inequality]] into focus within the greater arts community. The group employs [[culture jamming]] in the form of posters, books, billboards, and public appearances to expose discrimination and corruption. To remain anonymous, members don [[gorilla suit|gorilla masks]] and use pseudonyms that refer to deceased female artists. According to GG1, identities are concealed because issues matter more than individual identities,  "[M]ainly, we wanted the focus to be on the issues, not on our personalities or our own work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Guerilla Girls Bare All| url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml| archivedate=2014-01-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the spring of 1985, seven women launched the Guerrilla Girls in response to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s exhibition "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture" [1984), whose roster of 165 artists included only 13 women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/d/c/press_releases/W1siZiIsIjMyNzM2OSJdXQ.pdf?sha=6bd28a21a15dd204 MoMA Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Inaugurating MoMA's newly renovated and expanded building, this exhibition claimed to survey that era's most important painters and sculptors from 17 countries.&lt;ref name=Brenson&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenson|first=Michael|title=A Living Artists Show at the Modern Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/21/arts/a-living-artists-show-at-the-modern-museum.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of artists of color was even smaller, and none of them were women. [[File:Guerrilla Girls - V&amp;A Museum, London.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Guerrilla Girls at the V&amp;A Museum, London|left]]
 
A comment by the show's curator, [[Kynaston McShine]], further highlights that era's explicit art world gender bias: "Kynaston McShine gave interviews saying that any artist who wasn't in the show should rethink '''his''' career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guerrilla Girls|title=Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls, with an essay by Whitney Chadwick|date=1995|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=9780060950880|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In reaction to the exhibition and McShine's overt bias, they protested in front of MoMA. Thus, the Guerrilla Girls were born.

When the protests yielded little success, the Guerrilla Girls wheat-pasted posters throughout downtown Manhattan, particularly in the [[SoHo]] and [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Cooper1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Ashton Cooper | year=2010 | title=Guerrilla Girls speak on social injustice, radical art | work=A&amp;E | publisher=Columbia Spectator | url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/09/22/guerrilla-girls-speak-social-injustice-radical-art | accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, the group expanded their focus to include racism in the art world, attracting artists of color. They also took on projects outside of New York, enabling them to address sexism and racism nationally and internationally. Though the art world has remained the group's main focus, the Guerrilla Girls' agenda has included sexism and racism in films, mass and popular culture, and politics. [[Tokenism]] also represents a major group concern.&lt;ref name="Cooper1"/&gt;

During its first years, the Guerrilla Girls conducted "weenie counts," such that members visited institutions like the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and counted artworks' male-to-female subject ratios. Data gathered from the Met's public collections in 1989 showed that women artists had produced less than 5% of the works in the Modern Art Department, while 85% of the nudes were female.
[[File:Guerrilla Girls!.jpg|thumb|Guerrilla Girls wear gorilla masks whenever making public appearances.|left]]

Early organizing was based around meetings, during which members evaluated statistical data gathered regarding gender inequality within the New York City's art scene. The Guerrilla Girls also worked closely with artists, encouraging them to speak to those within the community to bridge the [[sex ratio|gender gap]] where they perceived it.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

When asked about the masks, the girls answer "We were Guerrillas before we were Gorillas. From the beginning the press wanted publicity photos. We needed a disguise. No one remembers, for sure, how we got our fur, but one story is that at an early meeting, an original girl, a bad speller, wrote 'Gorilla' instead of 'Guerrilla.' It was an enlightened mistake. It gave us our 'mask-ulinity.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |title=Interview |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |archivedate=2014-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Interview Magazine|New York Times]] the Guerrilla Girls were quoted, "Anonymous free speech is protected by the Constitution. You'd be surprised what comes out of your mouth when you wear a mask."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/info/interview%20mag.shtml |title=Interview Magazine |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805212205/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/info/interview%20mag.shtml |archivedate=2014-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1985, the Guerrilla Girls have worked for an increased awareness of sexism and greater accountability on the part of curators, art dealers, collectors and critics.&lt;ref name="guerrillagirls.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |title=Guerrilla Girls Bare All: An Interview |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |archivedate=2014-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is credited, above all, with sparking dialogue, and bringing national and international attention to issues of sexism and racism within the arts.

== Influences ==
Many feminist artists in the 1970s dared to imagine that female artists could produce authentically and radically different art, undoing the prevailing visual paradigm. The pioneering feminist critic, [[Lucy Lippard]] curated an all-women exhibition in 1974, effectively protesting what most deemed a deeply flawed approach, that of merely assimilating women into the prevailing art system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Chave, Anna C. "The Guerrilla Girls' Reckoning." ''Art Journal'' 70.2 (2011): 102-11. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaped by the 1970s women's movement, the Guerrilla Girls resolved to devise new strategies. Most noticeably, they realized that 1970s-era tools such as pickets and marches proved ineffective, as evidenced by how easily MoMA could ignore 200 protestors from the [[Women's Caucus for Art]]. "We had to have a new image and a new kind of language to appeal to a younger generation of women," recalls one of the founding Guerrilla Girls, who goes by "Liubov Popova."&lt;ref&gt;"Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Elizabeth Vigée LeBrun and Liubov Popova." January 19, 2008. ''Archives of American Art''. Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guerrilla Girls sought an alternative approach, one that would defeat views of the 1970s Feminist movements as man-hating, anti-maternal, strident, and humorless:&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Versed in poststructuralist theories, they adopted 1970s initiatives, but with a different language and style. Earlier feminists tackled grim and unfunny issues such as sexual violence, inspiring the Guerrilla Girls to keep their spirits intact by approaching their work with wit and laughter, thus preventing a backlash.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Work: actions, posters and billboards==
===Art world===
[[File:La Barbe et les Guerrilla Girls sous l'oeil d'Alice Coffin.jpg|thumb|French feminist group [[La Barbe]] (Beard) meets the Guerrilla Girls at the Palais de Tokyo (Paris, 2013).]]
Throughout their existence, the Guerrilla Girls have gained the most attention for their bold [[protest art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/guerrilla-girls|title=Brooklyn Museum: Guerrilla Girls|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Guerrilla Girls' projects (mostly posters at first) express observations, concerns, and ideals regarding numerous social topics. Their art has always been fact-driven, and informed by the group's unique approach to data collection, such as "weenie counts." To be more inclusive and to make their posters more eye-catching, the Guerrilla Girls tend to pair facts with humorous images.&lt;ref&gt;"We use facts, humor and outrageous visuals to expose sexism, racism and corruption in politics, art, film and pop culture."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Guerrilla Girls gained fame for wheat-pasting provocative campaign posters around New York City, the group has also enjoyed public commissions and indoor exhibitions.

In addition to posting posters around downtown Manhattan, they passed out thousands of small [[handbills]] based on their designs at various events.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt; The first posters were mainly black and white fact-sheets, highlighting inequalities between male and female artists with regard to number of exhibitions, gallery representation and pay. Their posters revealed how sexist the art world was in comparison to other industries and to national averages. For example, in 1985 they printed a poster showing that the salary gap in the art world between men and women was starker than the United States average, proclaiming "Women in America earn only 2/3 of what men do. Women artists earn only 1/3 of what men do." These early posters often targeted specific galleries and artists. Another 1985 poster listed the names of some of the most famous working artists, such as [[Bruce Nauman]] and [[Richard Serra]]. The poster asked "What do these artists have in common?" with the answer "They allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than 10% of women or none at all."
 
The group were also activists for equal representation of women in institutional art, and highlighted artist [[Louise Bourgeois]] in their "Advantages to Being a Women artist," poster in 1988 as one line read, "Knowing your career might not pick up till after you're 80."&lt;ref&gt;Louise Bourgeois; The Spider, The Mistress &amp; The Tangerine. Directed by Marian Cajori and Amei Wallach. 2008. New York, NY: Zeitgeist Films, 2009. DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Their pieces are also notable for their use of combative statements such as "When racism and sexism are no longer fashionable, what will your art collection be worth?"&lt;ref name="Cooper1" /&gt;''

Dearest Art Collector (1986)
Dearest Art Collector is a 560x430 mm screen-print on paper. This is one of thirty posters published in a portfolio entitled Guerrilla Girls Talk Back. This print is unusual in the portfolio in that it takes the form of an enlarged handwritten letter on baby pink paper. The extremely rounded cursive script crowned with a frowning flower exudes femininity, symbolizing the biting sarcasm for which the Guerrilla Girls were known for. The Guerrilla Girls sent this poster to well- known art collectors across the United States, pointing out how few works they owned by women artists. This send up of femininity is aimed at the expectation that, even when presenting a serious complaint, women should do so in a socially acceptable 'nice' way. "We know that you feel terrible about this" appeals to the feelings of the recipient. This piece was a commentary on how hard it is for female artists, and what lengths they must go through in order to be recognized and taken seriously. Women are constantly expected to perform a certain way and this print is the embodiment of how tumultuous it is for women all around the world to be recognized in the eyes of men with power.  The group later transcribed it into other languages and sent it to collectors outside the U.S. A practical joke with serious implications, this poster is now (somewhat ironically) a collector's item.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The posters were rude; they named names and they printed statistics (and almost always cited the source of those statistics at the bottom, making them difficult to dismiss). They embarrassed people. In other words, they worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tallman|first=Susan|title=Guerrilla Girls|journal=Arts Magazine|year=1991|volume=65|issue=8|pages=21–2|url=http://www.susan-tallman.com/guerilla-girls.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702074700/http://www.susan-tallman.com/guerilla-girls.pdf|archivedate=2 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Guerrilla Girls' first color poster, which remains the group's most iconic image, is the 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster, which used data from the group's first "weenie count." In response to the overwhelming amount of female nudes counted in the Modern Art sections, the poster asks, sarcastically, ''"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?"''. Next to the text is an image of the [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] painting [[La Grande Odalisque]], one of the most famous female nudes in Western art history, with a gorilla head placed over the original face.

In 1990, the group designed a [[billboard]] featuring the [[Mona Lisa]] that was placed along the [[West Side Highway]] supported by the New York City public art fund. For one day, New York's [[MTA Bus Company]] also displayed bus advertisements with Met. Museum poster. [[Stickers]] also became popular [[Business card|calling cards]] representative of the group.

The Guerrilla Girls infiltrated the bathrooms of the newly opened [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Soho]], placing stickers regarding [[Gender inequality|female inequality]] on the walls.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt; 
In 1998, Guerrilla Girls West protested at the [[San Jose Museum of Art]], over low representation of women artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.23.98/guerrillagirls-9816.html| title=Masking for Art | work=Metro| date=April 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to researching and exposing sexism in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have received commissions from numerous organizations and institutions, such as [[The Nation]] (2001),&lt;ref name="thenation.com"&gt;https://www.thenation.com/issue/april-2-2001/&lt;/ref&gt; Fundación Bilbao Arte (2002), [[Istanbul Modern]] (2006) and [[Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art]] (2007). They have also partnered with [[Amnesty International]], contributing pieces to a show under the organization's "Protect the Human" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |title=Press releases in 2014 |publisher=Amnesty International UK |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213002545/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public commissions===
In 2005, the group exhibited large-format posters ''Welcome to the Feminist Biennale'' at the [[Venice Biennale]] (the first in 110 years to be overseen by women), scrutinizing 101 years of Biennale history in terms of diversity. ''Where Are the Women Artists of Venice?'' explored the fact that most works owned by Venice's historical museums are kept in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Walter|title=Festive Venice|url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/reviews/walrobinson/robinson6-10-05.asp|work=Artnet|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/4032689 "Girl Power." ''The Economist''. June 2, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel. "Subdued Biennale forgoes shock factor." ''The New York Times''. June 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to produce special projects for international institutions, sometimes for the very institutions they have criticized. Offers that pose a dilemma are carefully considered, so as to avoid censure, since one way to improve institutions is to criticize them from inside.&lt;ref&gt;"Guerrilla Girl Gig," SUNY Stony Brook, NY, October, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 2006 poster ''The Future For Turkish Women Artists as Revealed by the Guerrilla Girls'', commissioned by [[Istanbul Modern]], demonstrated that the status of women artists in Turkey was better than in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;
http://vis129f.wikifoundry.com/page/Guerrilla+Girls%3A+"The+Future+for+Turkish+Women+Artists"-+Nicole+Young&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the [[Washington Post]] published their ''Horror on the National Mall!'', a one-page newspaper spread attacking the absence of diversity among tax-payer supported museums on the Mall in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/museums/features/2007/feminism-and-art/guerrilla_girls.html&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2007 ART-ATHINA, the Guerrilla Girls projected "Dear Art Collector" in Greek onto the entrance's façade. In 2015, they projected their "Dear Art Collector" animation onto a museum façade, taking on collectors who fail to pay employees a living wage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/your-art-fair-antidote-the-guerrilla-girls-turn-30/&lt;/ref&gt;
To commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the [[École Polytechnique massacre]], the University of Quebec commissioned their ''Troubler Le Repos'' (Disturbing The Peace) poster, whose texts addressed anti-women [[hate-speech]] since [[Ancient Greece]] to [[Rush Limbaugh]].

In 2009, they launched ''I'm not a feminist, but If I were this is what I'd complain about ... '', an interactive graffiti wall that enables women who don't see themselves as feminists the means to target gender issues with the hope that active participation will broaden their perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwci.ie/?/news/article/guerrilla_girls_take_on_irish_arts_exclusion_of_women&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, this traveled to Krakòw's Art Boom Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/julian-vigo/guerrilla-girls-plant-a-b_b_3462596.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, an advertising truck towed ''Do women Have To Be Naked To Get Into Boston Museums?'' around Boston.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2012/09/22/guerrilla-girls-launch-art-protest-targeting-museum-fine-arts/953Q0IyP3H9WxrWIcUhXUJ/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Invited by Yoko Ono to participate in the 2013 [[Meltdown Festival]], the Guerrilla Girls updated their 2003 ''Estrogen Bomb'' poster, which had premiered in [[The Village Voice]] in 2003.

During Winter 2016, they participated in "Twin City Takeover," art exhibitions and art projects organized by a consortium of local art organizations sited around Minneapolis and St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;https://wedompls.org/urban-projects/guerrilla-girls/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2015/guerrilla-girls-30th-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film world===
[[File:Guerrilla Girls Billboard.jpg|thumb|right|Guerrilla Girls billboard in Los Angeles protesting white male dominance at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] in 2002.]]

To protest the dearth of female directors, the Guerrilla Girls distributed stickers during the 2001 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/west-indies/&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Nation]] invited them to 
present ''Birth of Feminism'',&lt;ref name="thenation.com"/&gt; which they updated and presented in 2007 as a banner outside Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts. Since 2002, Guerrilla Girls Inc. have designed and installed billboards during the Oscars that address white male dominance in the [[film industry]], such as: "Anatomically Correct Oscars," "Even the Senate is More Progressive than Hollywood," "The Birth of Feminism,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliethebolt.net/page/page/319287.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325230231/http://www.juliethebolt.net/page/page/319287.htm |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Unchain the Women Directors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-for-a-change.com/blog/2006/02/guerrilla-girls-vs-king-kong.html |title=» Guerrilla Girls vs. King Kong |publisher=Art-for-a-change.com |date=2006-02-05 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2015 Reykjavik Arts Festival, the Guerrilla Girls displayed ''National Film Quiz'', a billboard criticizing the fact that 87% of national funding for films goes to men, despite women playing an important part of Iceland's public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;http://grapevine.is/culture/movies-theatre/2015/06/24/the-boys-club-men-are-strong-and-carry-around-big-cameras/&lt;/ref&gt; 
In light of 2016's #Oscarssowhite campaign, the Guerrilla Girls updated the above billboards, presenting them on downtown Minneapolis streets for "Twin City Takeover."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guerrillagirls.com/exhibitions/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and social issues===
Although the Guerrilla Girls' protest art directed at the art world remains their most well-known work, throughout their existence the group has periodically targeted politicians, specifically conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Those criticized have included [[George H.W. Bush|George Bush]], [[Newt Gingrich]], and most recently [[Michele Bachmann]]. In 1991, the Artist and Homeless Collaborative invited them to work with homeless women to create posters in response to homelessness and the first Gulf War. 
Between 1992 and 1994, Guerrilla Girl posters addressed the 1992 Presidential election, reproductive rights (done for march on Washington in 1992), gay and lesbian rights, and the LA riots.  During the 2012 election, they displayed their ''Even Michele Bachman believes. ...   '' on a billboard adjacent a football stadium to advertise her plan to: ban same-sex marriages, require Voter Id Checks, and spend money implementing statewide voter IDs.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/19/entertainment/la-et-cm-guerrilla-girls-use-twist-to-make-bachmann-a-gay-marriage-booster-20121019&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2013 posters discussed the Homeland Terror Alert system and Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign.

In 2016, the Guerrilla Girls launched the "President Trump Announces New Commemorative Months" campaign in the form of stickers and posters, which they distributed during the "Women's March on Washington" in LA and NYC, as well as the J20 event at the Whitney Museum of Art&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2017/01/20/speak-out-on-inauguration-day-words-at-the-whitney-museum-take-aim-at-trump/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fire Fink protest at MoMA.&lt;ref&gt;https://hyperallergic.com/360236/protesters-demand-moma-drop-trump-advisor-from-its-board/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work: publications and merchandise==

To shed light on inequality in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have published numerous books. In 1995, they published their first book, ''Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls,'' a compilation of 50 works plus a self-interview.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Guerrilla-Girls-Guerilla/dp/0060950889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dery. "Art Attack." ''The New York Times Book Review''. July 30, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, they published ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'', a consciousness-raising comic book that sold 82,000 copies, as it explores how art history's male domination constrained several female artists' careers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Guerrilla-Bedside-Companion-History-Western/dp/014025997X&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, they published ''Bitches, Bimbos and Ballbreakers'', a down and dirty catalogue of "The Top Stereotypes from Cradle to Grave." Offering thumbnail histories for cultural clichés ranging from "Daddy's Girl," "the Girl Next Door," "the Bimbo/Dumb Blonde" to "the Bitch /Ballbreaker", each is given "trademark Guerrilla Girl treatment: pointed factoids and cool graphics."&lt;ref&gt;Hoban, Phoebe (January 4, 2004). [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/theater/art-masks-still-in-place-but-firmly-in-the-mainstream.html "Masks Still in Place but Firmly in the Mainstream"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/media/2004/01/bitches-bimbos-and-ballbreakers&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 2004 book ''The Guerrilla Girl's Museum Activity Book'' (reissued in 2012) parodies children's museum activity books. Meant to teach children how to both appreciate and critique museums, this book provides activities that reveal the problematic aspects of museum culture and major museum collections. In 2009, they published a history of hysteria, ''The Hysterical Herstory Of Hysteria And How It Was Cured From Ancient Times Until Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books |title=Books by the Guerrilla Girls |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |accessdate=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; MFC-Michèle Didier reprinted it in 2011 and 2016.

==Presentations==
An important part of Guerrilla Girls' outreach since 1985 has been presentations and workshops at colleges, universities, art organizations and sometimes at museums. The presentations, known as "gigs", attract hundreds and sometimes thousands of attendees. In the gig, they play music, videos, show slides and talk about the history of their work, how it has evolved. At the end the GGs interact with audience members. New work is always included and gig material changes all the time. They have done hundreds of these events and have travelled to nearly every state as well as Europe, South America and Australia.

In recognition of their work, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to give talks at world-renowned museums, including a presentation at the MoMA's 2007 "Feminist Futures" Symposium. They have also been invited to speak at art schools and universities across the globe, and gave a 2010 commencement speech at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].
To mark the 30th anniversary of the Guerrilla Girls, [[Matadero Madrid]] hosted "Guerrilla Girls: 1985-2015," an exhibition featuring most of the collective's production accompanied by a series of events including a talk/performance by Guerrilla Girl members Frida Kahlo and Käthe Kollwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mataderomadrid.org/ficha/4093/guerrilla-girls.html|title=Guerrilla Girls 1985-2015|website=MataderoMadrid|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/119127188|title=GUERRILLA GIRLS CONFERENCIA / PERFORMANCE|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also showed the 1992 documentary "Guerrilla in Our Midst" by Amy Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guerrillasinourmidst.com/|title=Guerrillas In Our Midst|website=guerrillasinourmidst.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Diversity===
Despite having routinely challenged art institutions to display more artists of color, both members and critics want the Guerrilla Girls to be more diverse. Zora Neale Hurston recalls Guerrilla Girl membership as "mostly white" and largely mirroring the art world demographics that they critiqued.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-zora-neale-hurston-and-agnes-martin-15840|title=Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Zora Neale Hurston and Agnes Martin, 2008 May 17 - Oral Histories {{!}} Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|last=Richards|first=Judith Olch|last2=Hurston|first2=Zora Neale|date=2008-05-17|website=www.aaa.si.edu|access-date=2016-06-07|last3=Martin|first3=Agnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sporting gorilla masks to downplay personal identity, some members attribute Guerilla Girl interests to the fact that de facto leaders "Frida Kahlo" and "Kathe Kollwitz" are both white.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; ("Frida Kahlo" has also been criticized for her appropriation of a Latina artist's name.)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=No No's: Guerrilla Girls at the State Theatre|last=Lodu|first=Mary|date=March 2016|work=INREVIEW|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, any precise information on the demographics of the Guerrilla Girls is impossible, for they have "staunchly, and problematically, resisted being surveyed as to the makeup of their own membership."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Several Guerrilla Girls who are people of color have faced numerous challenges. Despite the Guerrilla Girls' stance against tokenism, some artists of color abandoned Guerrilla Girl membership due to [[tokenism]], silencing, disrespect, and [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; As a woman of color, "Alma Thomas" describes having felt uncomfortable wearing the Guerrilla Girls' signature gorilla mask.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-jane-bowles-and-alma-thomas-15838|title=Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Jane Bowles and Alma Thomas, 2008 May 8 - Oral Histories {{!}} Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|last=Richards|first=Judith Olch|last2=Bowles|first2=Jane|date=2008-05-08|website=www.aaa.si.edu|access-date=2016-06-07|last3=Thomas|first3=Alma}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Thomas" recalls little effort being devoted to understanding the challenges of artists of color. "Their whiteness was such that they. ...   didn't understand that blacks were being put in a completely separate world in the art world, that black male artists and black female artists are completely separated, completely segregated to this day."&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Ultimately, this widespread antagonism led to many "artists of color [leaving] after a few meetings because they could sense the unspoken hierarchy in the group."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stein|first=Gertrude|date=Summer 2011|title=Guerrilla Girls and Guerrilla Girls BroadBand: Inside Story|jstor=41430727|journal=Art Journal|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-wave feminism and essentialism ===
[[File:Good Luck getting that estrogen bomb.jpg|thumb|Anonymous MCAD student protest against the Guerrilla Girls]]Emerging at the tail end of the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], the Guerrilla Girls navigated the differences between established and emerging feminist theory during the 1980s. "Alma Thomas" describes this grey-area that the Guerrilla Girls occupied as "universalist feminism," bordering on [[Gender essentialism|essentialism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Art Historian Anna Chave considers the Guerrilla Girls' essentialism much more profound, leading the group to be "assailed by ... a rising generation of women wise in the ways of poststructuralist theory, for [their] putative naiveté and susceptibility to essentialism."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Essentialist views are most clearly exhibited in two Guerrilla Girl books:''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'' (1998) and the controversial ''Estrogen Bomb'' (2003–13) campaign. Regarding the former, "Alma Thomas" worried that ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'' "was so embedded in that second-wave feminist and even pre-second-wave essentialism" that it fulfilled some assumption that all women artists are feminist artists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Students at [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design]] criticized their ''Estrogen Bomb'' poster campaign, describing it as insensitive towards transgender people since it ties the female gender to estrogen, the same sort of essentialist link the Guerilla Girls aim to critique.&lt;ref&gt;Cherneff, Lila, 2015-12-28, "Guerrilla Girls Stumble at MCAD," Radio Program, https://soundcloud.com/minneculture/guerrilla-girls-stumble-at-mcad, 2016-05-31, KFAI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/guerrilla-girls-exclusionary-feminism/|title=The Guerrilla Girls, 'estrogen bombs' and exclusionary feminism|last=Jones|first=Hannah|date=2016-04-20|website=Twin Cities Daily Planet|publisher=Adaobi Okolue|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from essentialism, the Guerrilla Girls have also been critiqued for failing to integrate [[intersectionality]] into their work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Internal disputes ===
Leading up to a highly publicized 2003 lawsuit, there was increasing animosity toward "Frida Kahlo" and "Käthe Kollwitz." Despite founding members' initial intention to create a non-hierarchal, equitable power structure, there was an increasing sense that two people were making "the final decisions no matter what you said."&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Several Guerrilla Girls felt that their second book, ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'', primarily represented the views of "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz". Some even felt that "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" completely controlled the book, despite their having selected material created collectively by all Guerrilla Girls. There was even suspicion that these two not only claimed all the credit, but took all of the profits. Some members condemned the book as "undemocratic and ... against the spirit of the [Guerrilla] Girls."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As the Guerilla Girls gained in popularity, tensions led to what the Girls later called the "banana split," as five members actually split from the collective. Soon after several members stepped aside to form Guerrilla Girls Broadband, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" moved to trademark the name "Guerrilla Girls, Inc." to distinguish their realm from those of Guerrilla Girls BroadBand and [[Guerrilla Girls On Tour|Guerrilla Girls On Tour!]], whose focus is discrimination in the theater world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even though their former colleague "Gertrude Stein" was in the on-tour group, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" charged them with copyright and trademark infringement and unjust enrichment. Many members of the group felt especially betrayed that "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" had launched their lawsuit under their real names, Jerilea Zempel and Erika Rothenberg.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Toobin 2005"&gt;Jeffrey Toobin. "Girls Behaving Badly."''New Yorker''. May 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

This prompted negative reactions from both current and former Guerrilla Girls, who objected to "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" claiming responsibility for having created the collective effort, as well as the flippancy with which they exchanged their anonymity for legal standing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Louis L. Stanton|Judge Louis L. Stanton]], who handled the case, rejected the "bizarre" suggestion that defendants sporting gorilla masks be allowed to testify in his courtroom. He also stated that "Mundane court procedures for adjudicating legal rights and the ownership of property require direct and cross-examination of real persons with real addresses and attributes."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Toobin 2005"/&gt;

In their forty-five page complaint, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" described themselves as the group's "guiding forces," even though the Guerrilla Girls were "informally organized, [and] had no official hierarchy." Initially, they asked the court to stop Guerrilla Girls Broadband from calling themselves Guerrilla Girls and sought millions of dollars in damages. In 2006, they settled with the theatre group who agreed to go by Guerrilla Girls on Tour.

=== Selling-out ===
Upon their 1985 debut, the Guerrilla Girls were "lauded by the very establishment they sought to undermine." They have since exhibited at Tate Modern, Venice Biennale, Centre Pompidou, MoMA, which additionally grants them a broader audience for their concerns.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/guerrilla-girl-power-have-americas-feminist-artists-sold-out-1666140.html|title=Guerrilla girl power: Have America's feminist artists sold out?|last=Adams|first=Guy|date=2009-04-08|website=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this relationship has only intensified, as the Guerrilla Girls presented their exhibitions in museums and even allowed their works to be collected by hegemonic institutions. Although some have questioned the efficacy, if not hypocrisy, of the group's working within the system that they originally denigrated, few would challenge their decision to let the Getty Institute house their archives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Members and names==
[[File:2016GuerrillaGirlsRochesterArtCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Two members of the Guerrilla Girls join a panel discussion at the Rochester Art Center in 2016 in Rochester, Minnesota]]

Membership in the New York City group is by invitation only, based on relationships with current and past members, and one's involvement in the [[contemporary art]] world. A [[mentoring]] program was formed within the group, pairing a new member with an experienced Guerrilla Girl to bring them into the fold. Due to the lack of formality, the group is comfortable with individuals outside of their base claiming to be Guerrilla Girls; Guerrilla Girl 1 stated in a 2007 interview: "It can only enhance us by having people of power who have been given credit for being a Girl, even if they were never a Girl." Men are not allowed to become Guerrilla Girls, but may support the group by assisting in promotional activities.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

Guerrilla Girls names are [[wikt:pseudonym|pseudonyms]] generally based on dead female artists. Members goes by names such as [[Kathe Kollwitz]], [[Alma Thomas]], [[Rosalba Carriera]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Julia de Burgos]], and [[Hannah Höch]]. Guerrilla Girls' "Carriera" is credited with the idea of using pseudonyms as a way to not forget female artists. Having read about Rosalba Carriera in a footnote of ''Letters on Cézanne'' by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], she decided to pay tribute to the little-known female artist with her name. This also helped to solve the problem of media interviews; the group was often interviewed by phone and would not give names, causing problems and confusion amongst the group and the media. Guerrilla Girl 1 joined in the late 1980s, taking on her name as a way to memorialize women in the art community who have fallen under the radar and did not make as notable as an impact as the names takes on by other members.&lt;ref name="Oral1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Judith Olch Richards | year=2007 | title=Interview with Guerrilla Girls Rosalba Carriera and Guerrilla Girl 1  | work= | publisher=Archives of American Art | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-rosalba-carriera-and-guerrilla-girl-1-15843 | accessdate=10 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gorilla symbolism==
[[File:Kingkongposter.jpg|thumb|270x270px|The 1933 film ''King Kong'' was influential to the concept of a Guerilla Girl.]]
The idea to adopt the gorilla as the group's symbol stemmed from a spelling error. One of the first Guerrilla Girls accidentally spelled the group's name at a meeting as "gorilla."&lt;ref name="guerrillagirls.com" /&gt; Despite the fact that the idea of using a gorilla as group symbol might have been accidental, the choice is nevertheless pertinent to the group's overall message in several key ways.

To begin with, the gorilla in popular culture and media is often associated with [[King Kong]], or other images of trapped and tamed apes. In the 2010 SAIC Commencement, the comparison between institutionalized artists and tamed apes was explicitly made:

&lt;blockquote&gt; And last, but not least, be a great ape. In 1917, Franz Kafka wrote a short story titled ''A Report to An Academy'', in which an ape spoke about what it was like to be taken into captivity by a bunch of educated, intellectual types. The published story ends with the ape tamed and broken by the stultified academics. But in an earlier draft, Kafka tells a different story. The ape ends his report by instructing other apes NOT to allow themselves to be tamed. He says instead: break the bars of your cages, bite a hole through them, squeeze through an opening ... and ask yourself where do YOU want to go&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books/images/SAICcommencement5%2022%2010.pdf |title=School of the Art Institute of Chicago Commencement Address |publisher=Guerrillagirls.com |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005181705/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books/images/SAICcommencement5%2022%2010.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Guerillagirlad.png|left|thumb|210x210px|This is Guerrilla Girl ad using an Ingres image with the trademark gorilla mask with facts about gender inequality in the art industry.]] --&gt;
The gorilla is also typically associated with masculinity. The Met. Museum poster is in part shocking because of its juxtaposition of the eroticized female [[odalisque]] body, and the large, snarling gorilla head. The addition of the head detracts from the male [[gaze]] and changes the way in which viewers are able to look at or understand the highly sexualized image. Further, the addition of the gorilla questions and modifies stereotypical notions of female beauty within Western art and popular culture, another stated goal of the Guerrilla Girls. [[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, La Grande Odalisque, 1814.jpg|thumbnail|The original image by Ingres without the addition of the gorilla head represents the kind of art that the Guerrilla Girls take issues with, like the common issues of exoticism and sexualization of women.|left|199x199px]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Guerrilla Girls, who wear the masks of big, hairy, powerful jungle creatures whose beauty is hardly conventional ... believe all animals, large and small, are beautiful in their own way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girls|first=Guerrilla|title=Bitches, Bimbos, and Ballbreakers: The Guerrilla Girls' Illustrated Guide to Female Stereotypes'|year=2003|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-200101-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though this goal has never been explicitly stated by the group, in the history of Western art, primates have often been associated with the visual arts, and with the figure of the artist. The idea of ''ars simia naturae'' ("art the ape of nature") maintains that the job of art is to "ape", or faithfully copy and represent nature. This was an idea first popularized by Renaissance thinker [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] who alleged that "the artist in imitating nature only follows Nature's own command."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jason|first=H.W.|title=Apes and Ape Lore in the Renaissance and Middle Ages|year=1952|publisher=The Warburg Institute, University of London|location=London|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''H.N. Jacobsens Bókahandil''' is the oldest [[bookshop]] in [[Tórshavn]] and [[Faroes|Faroe]]. It is also one of the oldest shops still in business in the [[Faroe Islands]] today.

The bookshop was established on [[St. Olaf]]s day on 29 July 1865 by [[bookbinder]] '''Hans Nicolai Jacobsen'''. He was the father of [[Jakob Jakobsen]] (1864-1918), who is one of the most important Faroese [[philologist]]s.

H. N. Jacobsen was one of the initiators of a public meeting in [[Tórshavn]] in 1888, aiming at public support for “the protection and preservation of the [[Faroese language]] and [[tradition]]s”, as the notice announcing the meeting said. This is considered as the official start of the Faroese National Movement.

The original book shop was in the old main street "Gongin", but 1918 it was moved to the Market Square "Vaglið", at the start of Niels Finsens gøta, where it still stands today.

With its characteristic Faroese grass roof and big [[maple trees]] in the foreground, it is a [[landmark]] in Tórshavn.  
In addition, a section of H.N. Jacobsens Bókahandil operates an antiquarian bookshop.

The '''Indian Naval Ensign''' (also known as the '''Indian White Ensign''') is a naval ensign used by ships of the [[Indian Navy]].

The blue ensign of the [[Star of India (flag)|Star of India]] was used from 1879–1928 as the [[naval ensign]] of Her Majesty's Indian Marine (1879-1892) and then the Royal Indian Marine (1892-1928). It then became the [[naval jack]] and was used from 1928–1947 by the Royal Indian Marine (1928-1934) and then the Royal Indian Navy (1934-1950). The [[white ensign]] of the [[Royal Navy]] was used from 1928–1950 as the naval ensign of the Royal Indian Marine and then the Royal Indian Navy. The [[Flag of India]] has been used since 1947 as the naval jack of the Indian Navy.

From 26 January 1950, when India became a republic, until 2001, the Indian Navy used a modified version of the British Naval Ensign, with the Union Flag replaced with the Indian Tricolor in the canton.&lt;ref name="insignia"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Designs of Crests and Badges in the Services|url=http://pib.nic.in/archive/docs/DVD_38/ACC%20NO%20807-BR/HOM-1950-01-06_484.pdf|website=Press Information Bureau of India - Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, this flag was replaced with a white ensign bearing the Indian Navy crest, as the previous ensign was thought to reflect India's colonial past. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/23navy.htm|title=Indian Navy to change its ensign|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However complaints arose that the new ensign was indistinguishable as the blue of the naval crest easily merged with the sky and the ocean. Hence in 2004, the ensign was changed back to the [[St. George's cross]] design, with the addition of the emblem of India in the intersection of the cross. 

In 2014, the ensign as well as the naval crest was further modified to correct the omission of the national motto in [[Devanagari]] script: '''सत्यमेव जयते''' ([[Satyameva Jayate]]) which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs' in [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2716049/Indian-Navy-launch-Satyameva-Jayate-credo-new-logo.html|title=Indian Navy to launch Satyameva Jayate credo with a new logo|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kid Notorious''''' is an American [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] that aired from October 22 to December 17, 2003 on [[Comedy Central]]. It starred [[Hollywood]] film producer [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] as himself. Episode plots were often bizarre and [[absurdism|absurdist]] in nature, featuring Evans as a [[James Bond]] type character. [[Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] also appeared on the show as himself. The show was directed by [[Pete Michels]].

==Characters==
* [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert "Kid Notorious" Evans (himself)]], a playboy Hollywood producer who finds himself mixed up in bizarre and absurd situations but never loses his cool.
* Tollie Mae ([[Niecy Nash]]), Evans's loud and obese maid. Spends most of her time binge eating chocolate and lusting after [[Denzel Washington]]. Her catchphrase is "Not in my job description." Tollie Mae was named for Tollie Mae Wilson, who was Evans's housekeeper at the time of his marriage to [[Ali MacGraw]].
* [[Alan Selka|Alan "English" Selka (himself)]], Evans's long suffering butler. A running gag involves Puss Puss farting into his face. Voiced by Evans's real life butler, Alan Selka, who is reportedly very much like his character in real life.
* Puss Puss, Evans's beloved cat, who follows him wherever he goes; she plays chess and smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Puss has a hate-hate relationship with English which has included pistol-whipping, neck crushing, releasing flatulence into face and placing piranha in the sauna.
* [[Slash (musician)|Saul "Slash" Hudson (himself)]], the former lead guitarist for [[Guns N' Roses]]. As in real life, Slash is Evans's close friend and next-door neighbor.
* [[Donald Rumsfeld]] ([[Billy West]]), the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] at the time. He is depicted as a sidekick and poker buddy of Evans and Slash.

In 1981, after delivering a speech at the [[Washington Hilton Hotel]] on March 30, President Reagan is [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|shot]] by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]]. Near death, Reagan's life is in the balance in the hands of doctors at [[George Washington University Hospital]]. At the [[White House]] however, there is chaos as [[Reagan's cabinet]] is led by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Alexander Haig]].

==Adaptation==
{{Main|Killing Reagan (film)}}
On September 26, 2015, about a week after the book's release, [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] announced that a [[television film]] adaptation is in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2015/09/24/National-Geographic-Channel-adapting-Killing-Reagan-as-a-TV-movie/1571443089768/|title=National Geographic Channel adapting 'Killing Reagan' as a TV Movie|publisher=[[UPI.com]]|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, it was announced that [[Tim Matheson]] and [[Cynthia Nixon]] would play Ronald and Nancy Reagan respectively in the upcoming television film.&lt;ref name="Reagancast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/06/killing-reagan-tim-matheson-cynthia-nixon|title=Tim Matheson and Cynthia Nixon join Killing Reagan as Ronald and Nancy|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=May 6, 2016|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in late May.&lt;ref name="Reagancast"/&gt;  It premiered Sunday, October 16 at 8 PM.

== Criticism ==
Following the release of '''''Killing Reagan: The Violent Assault That Changed a Presidency,''''' Reagan biographers [[Craig Shirley]], [[Steven Hayward]], [[Paul Kengor]], and [[Kiron Skinner]], along with a handful of former Reagan aides, immediately began to challenge the book on its factual inaccuracies and historical fabrications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Killing Bill: Reagan aides assail O'Reilly's book, 'Total B.S.'|url = http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/killing-bill-reagan-aides-assail-oreillys-book-total-b.s./article/2573723#.VhbMdKdiyO8.twitter|website = Washington Examiner|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those four Reagan biographers, who had written 19 biographies on Ronald Reagan among them, penned an op-ed for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on October 16 that highlighted what they claimed to be major historical inaccuracies and outright fabrications used in O'Reilly's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = What Bill O'Reilly's new book on Ronald Reagan gets wrong about Ronald Reagan|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/16/what-bill-oreillys-new-book-on-ronald-reagan-gets-wrong-about-ronald-reagan/?postshare=7181445002710500|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-10-16|access-date = 2015-10-22|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Craig Shirley, Kiron K. Skinner, Paul|last = Kengor|first2 = Steven F.|last2 = Hayward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional criticisms surfaced from officials that served in the Reagan Administration, who were present at the events discussed in the book, yet dispute what actually happened. [[Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr.|A. B. Culvahouse]], who served as Counsel to the President from 1987 to 1989, calls one of the key anecdotes of O'Reilly's book describing a meeting focused on President Reagan's fitness to hold office "a debunked myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A.

In response, O'Reilly took to the airwaves on October 19, responding to the criticism and calling his critics "zealots and jealous people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = O'Reilly Fires Back at Killing Reagan Critics: They Don't Want Us Telling Truth|url = http://www.mediaite.com/tv/oreilly-fires-back-at-killing-reagan-critics-they-dont-want-us-telling-truth/|website = www.mediaite.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called the criticisms "comical," to which Reagan historian Shirley responded "So far, I've written four books on Ronald Reagan, written dozens of articles, given dozens of lectures, am a trustee of [[Eureka College]], taught a course there [titled] Reagan 101, and have lectured at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] and the [[Rancho del Cielo|Reagan Ranch]].

The following day, [[Edwin Meese|Ed Meese]], who served as Counselor to the President (1981–1985) and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] (1985–1988), penned a joint op-ed with Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Executive Director [[John Heubusch]] detailed more inaccuracies in O'Reilly's book, saying "we believe that ''Killing Reagan'' does a real disservice to our 40th president and to history itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = O'Reilly's &amp;quot;Killing Reagan&amp;quot;: Fiction, Posing as Biography {{!}} RealClearPolitics|url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/21/oreillys_killing_reagan_fiction_posing_as_biography.html|website = www.realclearpolitics.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, [[Frank Donatelli]], President Reagan's Assistant for Political and Intergovernmental Affairs, also penned an op-ed for ''[[The Washington Times]]'' disputing O'Reilly's key thesis as another discredited "senility myth" about Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FRANK DONATELLI: Another Ronald Reagan senility myth|url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/20/frank-donatelli-another-ronald-reagan-senility-myt/|website = The Washingtion Times|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More criticisms came from reporters at ''The Washington Post'', who looked into O'Reilly's claim to have "double-sourced everything" in his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = O'Reilly Responds To Critics Of 'Killing Reagan': 'We Just Portrayed Him As A Man,' Not 'As God'|url = http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/28/oreilly-responds-to-critics-of-killing-reagan-we-just-portrayed-him-as-a-man-not-as-god/|website = The Daily Caller|date = 2015-09-29|accessdate = 2015-10-22|first = Jamie|last = Weinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 2015, about a month ''after'' the book was published, O'Reilly's researcher first reached out to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to obtain a document that O'Reilly himself called a "key part of the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = O’Reilly’s ‘Killing Reagan’ co-author still fishing for key 1987 memo|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/10/20/oreillys-killing-reagan-co-author-still-fishing-for-key-1987-memo/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-10-20|access-date = 2015-10-22|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Erik|last = Wemple}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, it was reported that Annelise Anderson, the fact-checker that O'Reilly and Dugard commissioned to research and fact-check the manuscript for ''Killing Reagan'', pulled out of the project after realizing that the authors were "distorting" material, in her opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = After reading manuscript, scholar bailed on 'Killing Reagan' project|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/10/21/after-reading-manuscript-scholar-bailed-on-killing-reagan-project/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-10-21|access-date = 2015-10-22|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Erik|last = Wemple}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[National Review]]'' she further stated, "Why the authors want to present this distorted 'witch and wimp' view of [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy [Reagan]]] and the 40th president is puzzling, especially since an alternative view of the effect of Reagan's near-death experience is so readily available."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Killing the Reagan Legacy|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/424663/killing-reagan-legacy-annelise-anderson|website = www.nationalreview.com  |publisher = National Review Online|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Will]] called the book a work of "nonsensical history and execrable citizenship." He added that it "should come with a warning: 'Caution—you are about to enter a no-facts zone.'"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/roger-ailes-fox-news-wrecked-conservatism.html?ref=opinion&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">The '''Kiltubbrid Shield''' is an [[Iron Age]] wooden shield from [[Ireland]]. It was discovered during the 19th century in the [[townland]] and parish of [[Kiltubbrid]], [[County Leitrim]], Ireland. It is probably the only perfect article of its description found in Europe,{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}} and dates from the [[La Tène culture|late Celtic (La Tène)]] period.{{sfn|Ridgeway|1901|pp=478}}

==Description==
The Kiltubbrid shield is a remarkably well-preserved example of an ancient Irish wooden shield. It was discovered {{nobreak|in 1863}}, buried {{convert|3|m|1}} deep in a turf bog, at [[Kiltubbrid]] townland and just north of [[Lough Scur]].{{sfn|Coffey|1913|pp=75}} The shield is a perfect specimen, oval in shape, with a perfect central boss {{convert|7.6|cm|1}} high, and seven slightly raised concentric circles (ribs), plain on the reverse, with a handle, the whole carved out of one piece of wood.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}}{{sfn|Drummon|1871|pp=218}}  The original measurements were {{convert|66|cm|1}} in height by {{convert|53|cm|1}} in width, with a thickness of {{convert|1.25|cm|1}}. Unlike ancient classic shields, through which the forearm was passed, the Irish wooden shield, grasped by the cross-piece underneath the umbo (boss), could be projected to full arm's length during battle.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} The wood was probably [[alder]].{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}}{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}}

Kiltubrid-Alder-wooden-shield-Ireland2.png|3rd illustration
Kiltubrid Shield Illustration.png|4th illustration
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The shields was probably covered with leather, painted and decorated.{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}}{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} The ribs show an indentation on one side, presenting a remarkable interruption in the symmetry of the ornament.  Shrinkage may have caused the indentation.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=466}} MacAllister wondered if the indentation is a survival of the observation-notch which adorned shield edges in medieval time, or if this interruption of circular ornament reflected a widespread taboo and superstition against closed rings which prevailed at the time.{{sfn|MacAlliaster|1921|=p-171}}

==Etymology==
[[Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh]] stated in Ogygia (1685) that the Irish name for alder was Fearn, because "shields are made of it". The Irish word ' sciath,' i. e. shield, is more recently applied to a shallow wicker basket, of oval shape — sometimes called a skib — ' used for straining potatoes, and which closely resembles in size and form of the Kiltubbrid wooden shield.{{sfn|Coffey|1913|pp=75}}{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=490}}

==Purpose==
[[File:Irish Battle Scene Swords, Spears, and Shields.png|thumb|Irish Battle Scene Swords, Spears, and Shields]]
The toughness and density of the alder would, in itself, be a firm defence against the thrusts of swords, if not spears,{{sfn|Wilde|1861|pp=492}} but half-inch thick wooden shields would be useless against Roman javelins.{{sfn|Drummon|1871|pp=218}}

An illustration sculptured on a stone cross at [[Kells, County Meath]] evidently depicts a conflict between different tribes or cultures; one armed with long-handled spears and circular bossed-shields, the opposing warrior shields have no boss, and are armed with short swords, of a kind often found on [[crannog]]s and first adopted with the introduction of iron as a primary material for weapons of warfare.{{sfn|Wood-Martin|1895|pp=467}}

'''''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''''' ('''''The Young Ladies of Avignon''''', and originally titled '''''The Brothel of Avignon''''')&lt;ref name="Richardson91p19"/&gt; is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. The work, part of the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], portrays five nude female [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] from a [[brothel]] on Carrer d'Avinyó (Avignon Street) in [[Barcelona]]. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none is conventionally [[Femininity|feminine]]. The women appear as slightly menacing and rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. Three figures on the left exhibit facial features in the [[Iberians|Iberian]] style of Picasso's native Spain, while the two on the right are shown with [[African traditional masks|African mask-like]] features. The [[Race (human classification)|racial]] [[Primitivism]] evoked in these masks, according to Picasso, moved him to "liberate an utterly original artistic style of compelling, even savage force."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Hunter and John Jacobus, ''Modern Art'', Prentice-Hall, New York, 1977, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_OCk5D-2rfYC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22Les+Demoiselles+d%27Avignon%22+%22savage%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hVSHVPiYGIu7UfvTgoAG&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Les%20Demoiselles%20d'Avignon%22%20%22savage%22&amp;f=false Gina M.

In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in favor of a flat, two-dimensional [[picture plane]], Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. This [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both [[Cubism]] and [[Modern art]].

''Les Demoiselles'' was revolutionary and controversial, and led to widespread anger and disagreement, even amongst the painter's closest associates and friends. Matisse considered the work something of a bad joke, yet indirectly reacted to it in his 1908 ''[[Bathers with a Turtle]]''. Braque too initially disliked the painting, yet perhaps more than anyone else, studied the work in great detail. And effectively, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the Cubist revolution.&lt;ref name="Visions of the Modern" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U_10BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=reaction+to+Les+Demoiselles+d%27Avignon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=teKKVN24LoLUOJTzgZgF&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Emily Braun, Rebecca Rabinow, ''Cubism: The Leonard A.

At the time of its first exhibition in 1916, the painting was deemed immoral.&lt;ref name="Green, Courtauld"&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/83671/sample/9780521583671ws.pdf ''Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''], edited by Christopher Green, Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, Cambridge University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The work, painted in Picasso's studio at [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in [[Montmartre]], Paris, was seen publicly for the first time at the Salon d'Antin in July 1916, at an exhibition organized by the poet [[André Salmon]].

==Background and development==

Picasso came into his own as an important artist during the first decade of the 20th century. He arrived in Paris from Spain around the turn of the century as a young, ambitious painter out to make a name for himself. Although he eventually left most of his friends, relatives and contacts in Spain, he continued to live and paint in Spain while making regular trips back to France. For several years he alternated between living and working in Barcelona, Madrid and the Spanish countryside, and made frequent trips to Paris.

By 1904, he was fully settled in Paris and had established several studios, important relationships with both friends and colleagues. Between 1901 and 1904, Picasso began to achieve recognition for his [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue period]] paintings. In the main these were studies of poverty and desperation based on scenes he had seen in Spain and Paris at the turn of the century. Subjects included gaunt families, blind figures, and personal encounters; other paintings depicted his friends, but most reflected and expressed a sense of [[Depression (mood)|blueness]] and despair.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4609 Melissa McQuillan, ''Pablo Picasso'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

He followed his success by developing into his [[Picasso's Rose Period|Rose period]] from 1904 to 1907, which introduced a strong element of sensuality and sexuality into his work. The Rose period depictions of acrobats, circus performers and theatrical characters are rendered in warmer, brighter colors and are far more hopeful and joyful in their depictions of the bohemian life in the Parisian [[avant-garde]] and its environs. The Rose period produced two important large masterpieces: ''Family of Saltimbanques'' (1905), which recalls the work of [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–1877) and [[Édouard Manet]] (1832–1883); and ''[[Boy Leading a Horse]]'' (1905–06), which recalls [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]'s ''Bather'' (1885–87) and [[El Greco]]'s ''Saint Martin and the Beggar'' (1597–1599). While he already had a considerable following by the middle of 1906, Picasso enjoyed further success with his paintings of massive oversized nude women, monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of [[Paul Gauguin]] and showed his interest in primitive (African, [[Micronesia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]) art. He began exhibiting his work in the galleries of [[Berthe Weill]] (1865–1951) and [[Ambroise Vollard]] (1866–1939), quickly gaining a growing reputation and a following amongst the artistic communities of [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]].&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

Picasso became a favorite of the American art collectors [[Gertrude Stein]] and her brother [[Leo Stein|Leo]] around 1905. The Steins' older brother Michael and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew [[Allan Stein]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.duvarpaper.com/main.php?g2_itemId=4883 Picasso Portrait de Allan Stein.

Gertrude Stein began acquiring Picasso's drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal ''Salon'' at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905 he met [[Henri Matisse]] (1869–1954), who was to become in those days his chief rival, although in later years a close friend. The Steins introduced Picasso to [[Claribel Cone]] (1864–1929), and her sister [[Etta Cone]] (1870–1949), also American art collectors, who began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy, and Michael and Sarah Stein became important patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.&lt;ref&gt;Mellow, James R.

A painting that was called Fauvist and brought Matisse both public derision and notoriety. [[Hilton Kramer]] wrote: "owing to its long sequestration in the collection of the Barnes Foundation, which never permitted its reproduction in color, it is the least familiar of modern masterpieces. Yet this painting was Matisse's own response to the hostility his work had met with in the Salon d'Automne of 1905."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilton Kramer|Kramer, Hilton]].

[[File:Rousseau-Hungry-Lion.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Henri Rousseau]], ''[[The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope]]'', 1905, was the reason for the term [[Fauvism]], and the original "Wild Beast"]]

The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of Henri Matisse and the [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] group. The latter gained their name after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

Although the pictures were widely derided—"A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public", declared the critic [[Camille Mauclair]] (1872–1945)—they also attracted some favorable attention.&lt;ref name=oup-fauvism/&gt; The painting that was singled out for the most attacks was Matisse's ''[[Woman with a Hat]]''; the purchase of this work by [[Gertrude Stein|Gertrude]] and [[Leo Stein]] had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization from the bad reception of his work.&lt;ref name=oup-fauvism/&gt;

Matisse's notoriety and preeminence as the leader of the new movement in modern painting continued to build throughout 1906 and 1907, and Matisse attracted a following of artists including [[Georges Braque]] (1880–1963), [[André Derain]] (1880–1954), [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] (1876–1958). Picasso's work had passed through his [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue period]] and his [[Picasso's Rose Period|Rose period]] and while he had a considerable following his reputation was tame in comparison to his rival Matisse. To make matters worse Matisse shocked the French public again at the 1907 [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]] when he exhibited his painting ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Blue Nude]],'' completed in early 1907. The ''Blue Nude'' was one of the paintings that would later create an international sensation at the [[Armory Show of 1913]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;''Matisse, Henri''. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online. Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the spring of 1907 when he began to paint ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', until its completion later in the year, Picasso was vying with Matisse for the preeminent position of being the perceived new leader of Modern painting. Upon its completion the shock and the impact of the painting propelled Picasso into the center of controversy and all but knocked Matisse and Fauvism off the map, virtually ending the movement by the following year. In 1907 Picasso joined the art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] (1884–1979). Kahnweiler was a German art historian, art collector who became one of the premier French [[art dealer]]s of the 20th century. He became prominent in Paris beginning in 1907 for being among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, and especially his painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' Before 1910 Picasso was already being recognized as one of the important leaders of Modern art alongside Henri Matisse who had been the undisputed leader of [[Fauvism]] and who was more than ten years older than he was and his contemporaries the Fauvist [[André Derain]] and the former [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] and fellow [[Cubist]], [[Georges Braque]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/news/2016/02-Feb/wild-men-of-paris-architectural-record-may-1910.pdf "The Wild Men of Paris"]. The ''[[Architectural Record]]'', July 2002 (PDF). Retrieved 15 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1992 essay ''Reflections on Matisse'', the art critic [[Hilton Kramer]] wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;After the impact of ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', however, Matisse was never again mistaken for an avant-garde incendiary. With the bizarre painting that appalled and electrified the [[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]], which understood the ''Les Demoiselles'' was at once a response to Matisse's ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' (1905–1906) and an assault upon the tradition from which it derived, Picasso effectively appropriated the role of avant-garde ''wild beast''—a role that, as far as public opinion was concerned, he was never to relinquish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilton Kramer|Kramer, Hilton]]. "The Triumph of Modernism: The Art World, 1985–2005, 2006". ''Reflections on Matisse''. 162. {{ISBN|0-15-666370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kramer goes on to say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas Matisse had drawn upon a long tradition of European painting—from [[Giorgione]], [[Poussin]], and [[Watteau]] to [[Ingres]], [[Cézanne]], and [[Gauguin]]—to create a modern version of a pastoral paradise in ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'', Picasso had turned to an alien tradition of [[primitive art]] to create in ''Les Demoiselles'' a netherworld of strange gods and violent emotions. As between the mythological nymphs of ''Le bonheur de vivre'' and the grotesque effigies of ''Les Demoiselles,'' there was no question as to which was the more shocking or more intended to be shocking. Picasso had unleashed a vein of feeling that was to have immense consequences for the art and culture of the modern era while Matisse's ambition came to seem, as he said in his ''Notes of a Painter,'' more ''limited''—limited that is, to the realm of aesthetic pleasure. There was thus opened up, in the very first decade of the century and in the work of its two greatest artists, the chasm that has continued to divide the art of the modern era down to our own time.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, pp.162–163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been argued that the painting was a reaction to [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' and ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Blue Nude]]''.&lt;ref name="archivesdefrance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilton Kramer|Kramer, Hilton]].

==Influences==

Painted in Paris during the summer of 1907, Picasso had created hundreds of sketches and studies in preparation for the final work.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson 1991, 43"&gt;Richardson 1991, 43&lt;/ref&gt; He long acknowledged the importance of [[Spanish art]] and [[Iberian sculpture]] as influences on the painting. The work is believed by critics to be influenced by African tribal masks and the [[art of Oceania]], although Picasso denied the connection; many art historians remain skeptical about his denials. Several experts maintain that, at the very least, Picasso visited the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]] (known today as [[Musée de l'Homme]]) in the spring of 1907 where he saw and was unconsciously influenced by African and Tribal art several months before completing ''Les Demoiselles.''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson, John]].

In 1907, when Picasso began to work on ''Les Demoiselles'', one of the old master painters he greatly admired was [[El Greco]] (1541–1614). At the time El Greco was largely obscure and under-appreciated. Picasso's friend [[Ignacio Zuloaga]] (1870–1945) acquired El Greco's masterpiece, the ''[[Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'', in 1897 for 1000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/the_vision_of_saint_john/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=110001018&amp;collID=11&amp;vw=0 The Vision of Saint John]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 18 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While Picasso was working on ''Les Demoiselles'', he visited his friend [[Ignacio Zuloaga]] in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's ''Opening of the Fifth Seal.''&lt;ref&gt;Horsley, Carter B. ''[http://www.thecityreview.com/elgreco.html The Shock of the Old]''. The City Review, 2003. Retrieved 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' and the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the [[Painting style|stylistic similarities]] and the relationship between the [[Iconography|motifs]] and [[Motif (visual arts)|visually identifying]] qualities of both works were analyzed.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Theater of the Absurd''. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J. ''Picasso's Apocalyptic Whorehouse''. 40–47&lt;/ref&gt;

El Greco's painting, which Picasso studied repeatedly in Zuloaga's house, inspired not only the size, format, and composition of ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', but it inspired its apocalyptic power.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 430&lt;/ref&gt; Later, speaking of the work to Dor de la Souchère in Antibes, Picasso said: "In any case, only the execution counts. From this point of view, it is correct to say that Cubism has a Spanish origin and that I invented Cubism. We must look for the Spanish influence in Cézanne. Things themselves necessitate it, the influence of El Greco, a Venetian painter, on him. But his structure is Cubist."&lt;ref name="Souchère15"&gt;D. de la Souchère, ''Picasso à Antibes'', 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of the painting to other group portraits in the Western tradition, such as ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' by [[Titian]] (1488–1576), and the same subject by [[Rubens]] (1577–1640), in the [[Prado]], has also been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cézanne and Cubism===
[[File:Paul Cézanne 047.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Paul Cézanne]]'s ''[[The Bathers (Cézanne)|Les Grandes Baigneuses]]'' (1906, oil on canvas, 210.5 × 250.8&amp;nbsp;cm., 82{{fraction|7|8}} × 98{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]) is generally believed to be a likely inspiration for ''Les Demoiselles''.]]

Both [[Paul Gauguin]] (1848–1903) and [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) were accorded major posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris between 1903 and 1907, and both were important influences on Picasso and instrumental to his creation of ''Les Demoiselles.'' According to the English art historian, collector and author of ''The Cubist Epoch'', [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]], both of those artists were particularly influential to the formation of [[Cubism]] and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 20&amp;ndash;27&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper goes on to say however ''Les Demoiselles'' is often erroneously referred to as the first Cubist painting. He explains,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Demoiselles'' is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the ''Demoiselles'' is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although not well known to the general public prior to 1906, Cézanne's reputation was highly regarded in [[avant-garde]] circles, as evidenced by [[Ambroise Vollard]]'s interest in showing and collecting his work, and by [[Leo Stein]]'s interest. Picasso was familiar with much of Cézanne's work that he saw at Vollard's gallery and at the Stein's. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in a large scale museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 Cézanne retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] greatly impacted the direction that the avant-garde in Paris took, lending credence to his position as one of the most influential artists of the 19th century and to the advent of Cubism. The 1907 Cézanne exhibition was enormously influential in establishing Cézanne as an important painter whose ideas were particularly resonant especially to young artists in Paris.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Picasso and Braque found the inspiration for their [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] works in Paul Cézanne, who said to observe and learn to see and treat nature as if it were composed of basic shapes like ''cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones.'' Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]], [[Juan Gris|Gris]] and others to experiment with ever more complex multiple views of the same subject, and, eventually to the fracturing of form. Cézanne thus sparked one of the most revolutionary areas of artistic enquiry of the 20th century, one which was to affect profoundly the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref name="Joann Moser" /&gt;

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the European cultural elite were discovering [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Oceanic art|Oceanic]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]] and Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those cultures. Around 1906, Picasso, Matisse, [[André Derain|Derain]] and other artists in Paris had acquired an interest in primitivism, [[Iberian sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 27&lt;/ref&gt; [[African art]] and [[African tribal masks|tribal masks]], in part because of the compelling works of Paul Gauguin that had suddenly achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cataloguedesouvr1903salo#page/68/mode/2up Gauguin at the Salon d'Automne, 1903]&lt;/ref&gt; and an even larger one in 1906&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cataloguedesouvr1906salo#page/190/mode/2up Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne, 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; had a stunning and powerful influence on Picasso's paintings.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

In the autumn of 1906, Picasso followed his previous successes with paintings of oversized nude women, and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art. Pablo Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting and his writing as well. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to ''Les Demoiselles'' in 1907.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

According to Gauguin biographer [[David Sweetman]], Pablo Picasso as early as 1902 became an aficionado of Gauguin's work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio (1875–1940), in Paris. Durrio had several of Gauguin's works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work. Durrio tried to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris. After they met Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin's stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces and gave Picasso a first ''La Plume'' edition of ''Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin.''&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, 563&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 461&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to Gauguin's ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri]]'' (literally meaning 'savage'), a gruesome phallic representation of the Tahitian goddess of life and death intended for Gauguin's grave. First exhibited in the 1906 retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on ''Les Demoiselles.'' Sweetman writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gauguin's statue ''Oviri'', which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, 562–563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Richardson,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Picasso's interest in [[stoneware]] was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome ''Oviri.'' Until 1987, when the [[Musée d'Orsay]] acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the ''Demoiselles.'' Although just under 30 inches high, ''Oviri'' has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by ''Oviri.'' 50 years later he was delighted when [Douglas] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his Cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to primitivism.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 459&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Europe's [[Colonisation of Africa|colonization of Africa]] led to many economic, social, political, and even artistic encounters. From these encounters, Western visual artists became increasingly interested in the unique forms of African art, particularly masks from the Niger-Congo region. In an essay by Dennis Duerden, author of ''African Art'' (1968), ''The Invisible Present'' (1972), and a former director of the [[BBC World Service]], the mask is defined as "very often a complete head-dress and not just that part that conceals the face".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The "Discovery" of the African Mask|last = Duerden|first = Dennis|publisher = |year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 29–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of visual art and image appealed to Western visual artists, leading to what Duerden calls the "discovery" of African art by Western practitioners, including Picasso.

[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|200px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris just prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']]

The stylistic sources for the heads of the women and their degree of influence has been much discussed and debated, in particular the influence of [[African tribal masks]], [[art of Oceania]],&lt;ref&gt;Green is careful to use the two terms together throughout his discussion, 49–59&lt;/ref&gt; and pre-Roman Iberian sculptures. The rounded contours of the features of the three women to the left can be related to [[Iberian sculpture]], but not obviously the fragmented planes of the two on the right, which indeed seem influenced by African masks.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 58–9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Weschler]] says that, &lt;blockquote&gt;in many ways, much of the moldering cultural and even scientific ferment that characterized the first decade and a half of the twentieth century and that laid the foundations for much of what we today consider modern can be traced back to ways in which Europe was already wrestling with its bad-faith, often strenuously repressed, knowledge of what it had been doing in Africa. The example of Picasso virtually launching cubism with his 1907 ''Desmoiselles d’Avignon'', in response to the sorts of African masks and other colonial booty he was encountering in Paris’s Musee de l’Homme, is obvious.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, Picasso emphatically denied the influence of African masks on the painting: "African art? Never heard of it!" (''L'art nègre? Connais pas!''),&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Picasso's words were transcribed by Fels F., "Opinions sur l'art nègre". ''Action'', Paris, 1920; and [[Pierre Daix|Daix, P.]]. "Il n'y a pas d'art nègre dans les Demoiselles d'Avignon". In ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'' Paris, October 1970. Both are quoted in Anne Baldassari, "''Corpus ethnicum'': Picasso et la photographie coloniale", in ''Zoos humains. De la Vénus hottentote aux reality shows'', Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard, Gilles Boëtsch, Eric Deroo, Sandrine Lemaire, Edition La Découverte, 2002. 340–348&lt;/ref&gt; asserting instead that the primitivism in his work during, before and after the painting of ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' from spring 1906 through the spring of 1907 was primarily influenced by Iberian sculpture.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RichJ"&gt;Richardson 1991, 451&lt;/ref&gt; Some Iberian [[relief]]s from [[Osuna]], then only recently excavated, were on display in the Louvre from 1904. [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] Greek sculpture has also been claimed as an influence.

The influence of Iberian sculpture became an issue in 1939, when [[Alfred Barr]] claimed that the primitivism of the ''Demoiselles'' derived from the art of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and the French Congo.&lt;ref&gt;Barr 1939, 55&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso insisted that the editor of his "catalogue raissonne", [[Christian Zervos]], publish a disclaimer: the 'Demoiselles,' he said, owed nothing to [[African art]], everything to the reliefs from Osuna that he had seen in the Louvre a year or so before.&lt;ref&gt;Daix, Pierre. "Il n'y a pas d'art nègre dans les Demoiselles d'Avignon". ''Gazette des Beaux Arts'', Paris, October 1970. 247–70&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he is known to have seen African tribal masks while working on the painting, during a visit to the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro|Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero]] with [[Andre Malraux]] in June 1907, about which he later said "When I went to the Trocadero, it was disgusting. The flea market, the smell. I was all alone. I wanted to get away, but I didn't leave. I stayed, I stayed. I understood that it was very important. Something was happening to me, right. The masks weren't like any other pieces of sculpture, not at all. They were magic things."&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;''[http://www.bbcactive.com/BroadcastLearning/MediaSupportFiles/PLOAM3%20synopsis.pdf The Private Life of a Masterpiece]''. [[BBC]] Series 3, Episode 9. 17, 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, 2005, discusses the visit, and also postcards of African people owned by Picasso. 49–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A magical encounter at the root of modern art". ''The Economist'', 9 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] is often credited with introducing Picasso to African sculpture of [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] extraction in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards &amp; Wood, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso biographer John Richardson recounts in ''A Life of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916,'' art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s recollection of his first visit to Picasso's studio in July 1907. Kahnweiler remembers seeing ''dusty stacks of canvases'' in Picasso's studio and ''African sculptures of majestic severity.'' Richardson comments: ''so much for Picasso's story that he was not yet aware of [[African tribal masks|Tribal art]].''&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 34&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph of Picasso in his studio surrounded by [[African art|African sculptures]] c.1908, is found on page 27 of that same volume.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Although ''Les Demoiselles'' had an enormous and profound influence on [[modern art]], its impact was not immediate, and the painting stayed in Picasso's studio for many years. At first, only Picasso's intimate circle of artists, dealers, collectors and friends were aware of the work. While many were shocked and some outraged, influential people such as [[Georges Braque]] and [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] were supportive. Soon after the late summer of 1907, Picasso and his long-time lover Fernande Olivier (1881–1966) had a parting of the ways. The re-painting of the two heads on the far right of ''Les Demoiselles'' fueled speculation that it was an indication of the split between Picasso and Olivier. Although they later reunited for a period, the relationship ended in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 47, 228&lt;/ref&gt;

A photograph of the ''Les Demoiselles'' was first published in an article by [[Gelett Burgess]] entitled "The Wild Men of Paris, Matisse, Picasso and Les Fauves", ''The Architectural Record'', May 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris, Matisse, Picasso and Les Fauves", ''The Architectural Record'', May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Les Demoiselles'' would not be exhibited until 1916, and not widely recognized as a revolutionary achievement until the early 1920s, when [[André Breton]] (1896–1966) published the work.&lt;ref name="Richardson 1991, 43"/&gt; Richardson goes on to say that [[Henri Matisse]] was fighting mad upon seeing the ''Demoiselles'' at Picasso's studio. He let it be known that he regarded the painting as an attempt to ridicule the modern movement; he was outraged to find his sensational ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Blue Nude]],'' not to speak of ''[[Le bonheur de vivre|Bonheur de vivre]],'' overtaken by Picasso's "hideous" whores. He vowed to get even and make Picasso beg for mercy. Just as the ''Bonheur de vivre'' had fueled Picasso's competitiveness, ''Les Demoiselles'' now fueled Matisse's.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Picasso's closed circle of friends and colleagues there was a mixture of opinions about ''Les Demoiselles''. [[Georges Braque]] and [[André Derain]] were both initially troubled by it although they were supportive of Picasso. According to [[William Rubin]], two of Picasso's friends, the art critic [[André Salmon]] and the painter [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1879–1964), were enthusiastic about it while [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (1880–1918) wasn't. Both the art dealer-collector [[Wilhelm Uhde]] (1874–1947), and art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] were more enthusiastic about the painting however.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 43–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kahnweiler ''Les Demoiselles'' was the beginning of Cubism. He writes:

{{quote|Early in 1907 Picasso began a strange large painting depicting women, fruit and drapery, which he left unfinished. It cannot be called other than unfinished, even though it represents a long period of work. Begun in the spirit of the works of 1906, it contains in one section the endeavors of 1907 and thus never constitutes a unified whole.

The nudes, with large, quiet eyes, stand rigid, like mannequins. Their stiff, round bodies are flesh-colored, black and white. That is the style of 1906.

In the foreground, however, alien to the style of the rest of the painting, appear a crouching figure and a bowl of fruit. These forms are drawn angularly, not roundly modeled in chiaroscuro. The colors are luscious blue, strident yellow, next to pure black and white. This is the beginning of Cubism, the first upsurge, a desperate titanic clash with all of the problems at once.|Kahweiler, 1920&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/riseofcubism00kahn Daniel Henry Kahnweiler, ''The Rise of Cubism'', New York, Wittenborn, Schultz. This is the first translation of the original German text entitled ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'', Munich, Delphin-Verlag, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Public view and title==
From 16 to 31 July 1916 ''Les Demoiselles'' was exhibited to the public for the first time at the [[Salon d'Antin]], an exhibition organized by André Salmon titled ''L'Art moderne en France''. The exhibition space at 26 rue d'Antin was lent by the famous couturier and art collector [[Paul Poiret]]. The larger [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Salon des Indépendants]] had been closed due to World War I, making this the only Cubists exhibition in France since 1914.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cwL7aF-EB84C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=%22l'art+moderne+en+france%22,+%22Salon+d'Antin%22,+%22Paul+Poiret%22,+André+Salmon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XMXjJdIOR_&amp;sig=w2iVvIpxdnORyuiZ0UEjI4piC9k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OYQBU_DMIePB7AavgYGIDA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22l'art%20moderne%20en%20france%22%2C%20%22Salon%20d'Antin%22%2C%20%22Paul%20Poiret%22%2C%20André%20Salmon&amp;f=false Monica Bohm-Duchen, ''The Private Life of a Masterpiece'', University of California Press, 2001], {{ISBN|9780520233782}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 1916 a review was published in ''Le Cri de Paris'':&lt;ref name="Le cri de Paris"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65218498/f1.image ''Lettres &amp; Art, Cubistes'', Le cri de Paris, 23 July 1916, p. 10], A20, No. 1008, Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Cubists are not waiting for the war to end to recommence hostilities against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all four corners of the canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Le cri de Paris" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Picasso referred to his only entry at the Salon d'Antin as his Brothel painting calling it ''Le Bordel d'Avignon'' but André Salmon retitled it ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' so as to lessen its scandalous impact on the public. Picasso never liked the title, however, preferring "las chicas de Avignon", but Salmon's title stuck.&lt;ref name="Richardson91p19"&gt;Richardson 1991, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other time the painting might have been exhibited to the public prior to a 1937 showing in New York was in 1918, in an exhibition dedicated to Picasso and Matisse at Galerie Paul Guillaume in Paris, though very little information exists about this exhibition or the presence (if at all) of ''Les Demoiselles''.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt;

Afterwards, the painting was rolled up and remained with Picasso until 1924 when, with urging and help from Breton and [[Louis Aragon]] (1897–1982), he sold it to designer [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] (1853–1929), for 25,000 francs.&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel, 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franck, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

Picasso drew each of the figures in ''Les Demoiselles'' differently. The woman pulling the curtain on the upper right is rendered with heavy paint. Composed of sharp [[geometric shape]]s, her head is the most strictly Cubist of all five.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 31&lt;/ref&gt; The curtain seems to blend partially into her body. The Cubist head of the crouching figure (lower right) underwent at least two revisions from an [[Iberians|Iberian]] figure to its current state. She also seems to have been drawn from two different perspectives at once, creating a confusing, twisted figure. The woman above her is rather manly, with a dark face and square chest. The whole picture is in a two-dimensional style, with an abandoned perspective.

Much of the critical debate that has taken place over the years centers on attempting to account for this multiplicity of styles within the work. The dominant understanding for over five decades, espoused most notably by [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.|Alfred Barr]], the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and organizer of major career retrospectives for the artist, has been that it can be interpreted as evidence of a transitional period in Picasso's art, an effort to connect his earlier work to Cubism, the style he would help invent and develop over the next five or six years.&lt;ref name=Steinberg&gt;Steinberg, L., ''The Philosophical Brothel''. [[October (journal)|October]], no. 44, Spring 1988. 7–74. First published in ''Art News'' vol. LXXI, September/October 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic [[John Berger]], in his controversial 1965 biography ''The Success and Failure of Picasso'',&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Success and Failure of Picasso|year=1965|publisher=Penguin Books, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-679-73725-4 |pages=73–77|author=Berger, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; interprets ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' as the provocation that led to Cubism:

{{quote|Blunted by the insolence of so much recent art, we probably tend to underestimate the brutality of the Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. All his friends who saw it in his studio were at first shocked by it. And it was meant to shock…

A brothel may not in itself be shocking. But women painted without charm or sadness, without irony or social comment, women painted like the palings of a stockade through eyes that look out as if at death – that is shocking. And equally the method of painting. Picasso himself has said that he was influenced at the time by archaic Spanish (Iberian) sculpture. He was also influenced – particularly in the two heads at the right – by African masks…here it seems that Picasso's quotations are simple, direct, and emotional. He is not in the least concerned with formal problems. The dislocations in this picture are the result of aggression, not aesthetics; it is the nearest you can get in a painting to an outrage…

I emphasize the violent and iconoclastic aspect of this painting because it is usually enshrined as the great formal exercise which was the starting point of Cubism. It was the starting point of Cubism, in so far as it prompted Braque to begin painting at the end of the year his own far more formal answer to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon…yet if he had been left to himself, this picture would never have led Picasso to Cubism or to any way of painting remotely resembling it…It has nothing to with that twentieth-century vision of the future which was the essence of Cubism.

Yet it did provoke the beginning of the great period of exception in Picasso's life. Nobody can know exactly how the change began inside Picasso. We can only note the results. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, unlike any previous painting by Picasso, offers no evidence of skill. On the contrary, it is clumsy, overworked, unfinished. It is as though his fury in painting it was so great that it destroyed his gifts…

By painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon Picasso provoked Cubism. It was the spontaneous and, as always, primitive insurrection out of which, for good historical reasons, the revolution of Cubism developed.&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt;}}

In 1972, art critic [[Leo Steinberg]] in his essay ''The Philosophical Brothel'' posited a wholly different explanation for the wide range of stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches—which had been ignored by most critics—he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles can be read as a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture the gaze of the viewer. He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

The earliest sketches feature two men inside the brothel; a sailor and a medical student (who was often depicted holding either a book or a skull, causing Barr and others to read the painting as a [[memento mori]], a reminder of death). A trace of their presence at a table in the center remains: the jutting edge of a table near the bottom of the canvas. The viewer, Steinberg argues, has come to replace the sitting men, forced to confront the gaze of prostitutes head on, invoking readings far more complex than a simple allegory or the autobiographical reading that attempts to understand the work in relation to Picasso's own history with women. A world of meanings then becomes possible, suggesting the work as a meditation on the danger of sex, the "trauma of the gaze" (to use a phrase of [[Rosalind Krauss]]'s invention), and the threat of violence inherent in the scene and sexual relations at large.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

According to Steinberg, the reversed gaze, that is, the fact that the figures look directly at the viewer, as well as the idea of the self-possessed woman, no longer there solely for the pleasure of the male gaze, may be traced back to [[Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'' of 1863.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; [[William Rubin]] (1927–2006), the former Director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at [[MoMA]] wrote that "Steinberg was the first writer to come to grips with the sexual subject of the Demoiselles."&lt;ref&gt;Rubin (1994), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years after writing ''The Philosophical Brothel'', Steinberg wrote further about the revolutionary nature of ''Les Demoiselles'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Picasso was resolved to undo the continuities of form and field which [[Western art]] had so long taken for granted. The famous stylistic rupture at right turned out to be merely a consummation. Overnight, the contrived coherences of [[representational art]] - the feigned unities of time and place, the stylistic consistencies - all were declared to be fictional. The ''Demoiselles'' confessed itself a picture conceived in duration and delivered in spasms. In this one work Picasso discovered that the demands of discontinuity could be met on multiple levels: by cleaving depicted flesh; by elision of limbs and abbreviation; by slashing the web of connecting space; by abrupt changes of vantage; and by a sudden stylistic shift at the climax. Finally, the insistent staccato of the presentation was found to intensify the picture's address and symbolic charge: the beholder, instead of observing a roomfuI of lazing whores, is targeted from all sides. So far from suppressing the subject, the mode of organization heightens its flagrant eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artchive.com/theory/steinbrg/steinbrg.htm] Leo Steinberg selections, http://www.artchive.com.

At the end of the first volume of his (so far) three volume Picasso biography: ''A Life Of Picasso. The Prodigy, 1881–1906,'' [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] comments on ''Les Demoiselles.'' Richardson says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is at this point, the beginning of 1907, that I propose to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] ''Demoiselles'' on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the ''Demoiselles'' is rooted in Picasso's past, not to speak of such precursors as the [[Iron Age]] [[Iberian sculpture|Iberians]], [[El Greco]], [[Gauguin]] and [[Cézanne]], it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since [[Giotto]]. As we will see in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of [[20th-century art]]. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson John]]. ''A Life of Picasso.

==Feminist interpretation==

===Form over content===

[[Leo Steinberg]] in his 1988 text "The Philosophical Brothel" quotes from an uncited source which may provide insight regarding Picasso's intent in the creation and context of ''Les Demoiselles D'Avignon''. Quoting from an anonymous but well-informed New Yorker, Steinberg suggests that "in 1907 Picasso had contracted VD, and painted the Demoiselles to vent his rage against women".&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Leo 1988"&gt;Steinberg, Leo. "The Philosophical Brothel". October 44 (1988): 7–74. Web. 4 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption may be reinforced in the artist's referral to the work as "My first exorcism-painting". In 1965 the British critic [[John Berger]] suggested that Picasso, during his first years in Paris, "probably was suffering from venereal disease and was obsessed by it". Then, in her ''Picasso: Art as Autobiography'', Mary Gedo substantiated Berger's suspicion (having had it confirmed by [[Françoise Gilot]]). Accordingly, she interpreted much of the evolution and final character of the ''Demoiselles'' in the light of the artist's medical history and consequent ambivalence toward women.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Leo. "Retrospect: Sixteen Years After," postscript to reprint of "The Philosophical Brothel," October, no. 44, Spring 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While critics such as [[Alfred H. Barr Jr.]] would prefer that the work be discussed in purely formalistic qualities, [[Edwin Mullins]] states that the effect of STIs cannot be so easily be disregarded and that though these are "not today's experiences of art, they are among the experiences out which, and for which, art has been made - and without which a great deal of art would not have been made at all".&lt;ref name="Mullins, Edwin B. 1985"&gt;Mullins, Edwin B. ''"Man-Eaters." The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women''. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 1985. 39-56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carol Duncan]] in her 1973 article "Virility and Domination in Early Twentieth-Century Vanguard Painting" states that:

{{quote|No painting of this decade better articulates the male-female dichotomy and the ambivalence men experience before it... What is so remarkable about this work is the way it manifests the structural foundation underlying both the femme fatale and the new primitive woman. Picasso did not merely combine these into one horrible image; he dredged up from his psyche the terrifying and fascinating beast that gave birth to both of them. The Demoiselles prismatically mirrors her many opposing faces: whore and deity, decadent and savage, tempting and repelling, awesome and obscene, looming and crouching, masked and naked, threatening and powerless.&lt;ref name="Duncan, Carol 1982"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/barnard/arthist/wolff/pdfs/week6_duncan.pdf Duncan, Carol. "Virility and Domination in Early Twentieth-Century Vanguard Painting."] ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany''. By Norma Broude and [[Mary D. Garrard]]. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1982. 293-313. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These sources in close connection to each other suggest that the portrayal of women in the post-modern era may be more closely linked to the spread of STIs, than some individuals and institutions within the art world would like to recognize. To quote Edwin Mullins in ''The Painted Witch'' (1985) "One day somebody will have the art world reaching for its smelling-salts with a study of the effects of disease on the making of art."&lt;ref name="Mullins, Edwin B. 1985"/&gt;

Steinberg dismissed many of Barr's views which favoured that ''Les Demoiselles D'Avignon'' could be reduced to a strictly formal figure composition. In particular that Barr argued that the intellectual observer would address the work was to view it in strictly formalistic qualities: the work was a triumph of form over content; to see it with intelligence was to see it resolved into abstract energies.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Leo 1988"/&gt; Barr's methodology of addressing Picasso's work was not fundamentally challenged until Leo Steinberg's article. Steinberg felt that by 1988 this method of critique had transformed from criticism to cliché and that reducing the work to a purely formal figure composition would make it a mere forerunner of things to come. Picasso had indeed abandoned the ''[[memento mori]]'' allegory but not the sexual thematics of the painting.&lt;ref name="Foster, Hal 1907"&gt;Foster, Hal. "1907." ''Art since 1900: Modernism, Antimodernism, Postmodernism''. New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004. 78-84. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna C. Chave]] for example in "New Encounters with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Gender, Race, and the Origins of Cubism" addresses that the work had come to be understood to mark or even to have precipitated the demise of the old visual order and the advent of the new. A momentous act of destruction, the painting is also understood as one of creation.&lt;ref name=anna&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chave|first= Anna C.|title=New Encounters with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Gender, Race, and the Origins of Cubism|journal= The Art Bulletin|volume= 76|issue=4|year=1994|pages=597–611|jstor=3046058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designated the first Cubist painting "the signal for the Cubist revolution" in its full-fledged dismantling of representational conventions the painting is now more loosely considered a curtain raiser or trigger to Cubism. Others had pulled crucial triggers before Picasso. When Baudelaire told Manet, "You are only the first in the decrepitude of your art," he referred to the scandalously frank picture of a courtesan, ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', rendered with startling flatness in 1865. For that matter, a compressed or compromised female form, often that of prostitute or femme fatale, would come to serve almost as an avatar of modernism.' Picasso, often lifted his imagery from the lexicon of European art and by revisiting works, jolted the viewer into reacting to it afresh."&lt;ref name=anna/&gt; If the disintegration of the great traditions of painting could already be detected in Olympia, the evidence of that decrepitude was plainly that much further advanced in Les Demoiselles. And insofar as it calls the very notion unified style, and so the possibility of finish, into question, the painting's ruptured aspect made it serve the purpose of signifying a moment of rupture particularly well. The evolution of Cubism was impelled by a realization of "the conventional rather than the imitative nature of representation", as art history professor Christine Poggi succinctly phrases it; and a corollary of that realization was "that style can be a kind of mask, to be worn at will", so that "there was no reason to observe the law of unity".&lt;ref name=anna/&gt;

===Did they have to be whores?===

The employment of the disenfranchised female as visual icon within the art world is a fact that feminist critics have diagnosed, as the avant-garde's testing of cultural limits, where the female body, as symptomatic of a visual regime where "Woman" serves as "the very ground of representation, both object and support of a desire which, intimately bound up with power and creativity, is the moving force of culture and history."&lt;ref name=anna/&gt; The ability of male artists to form new expressive modes of representation filled with dynamic power is not a new concept within art history; Duncan in particular emphasizes and exposes the relationship between art historians and the avant-garde painters of the post modern era in that art historians emphasize the notion: "that avant-garde art consists of so many movements of individual artistic freedom, a freedom evidenced in the artist's capacity for innovation"&lt;ref name="Duncan, Carol 1982" /&gt; and in this freedom both artist and historian are freed to analyze and construct work in a larger structure without recognizing the social constraints and responsibilities of the past and their impact on contemporary society. Duncan questions where does this innovation arise? Is it completely unmotivated? A gift from God? We may never know. Picasso in discussing the work was often resistant to acknowledge any guidance in context; favouring instead to address it in a way which ranged from vague, humorous and sarcastic. For example, when "speaking to Kahnweiler in December 1933, Picasso recalled the jokes he and his friends bandied about the women in the ''Demoiselles'' painting, identifying one of them as Picasso's girlfriend, Fernande, another as Marie Laurencin, a third as the grandmother of his poet friend Max Jacob-"all in a brothel in Avignon!" &lt;ref name="Steinberg, Leo 1988"/&gt;

Picasso in choosing his subject matter with the intention of creating a new visual language as addressed by Barr that "The ''Demoiselles'' is a transitional picture, a laboratory or, better, a battlefield of trial and experience; but it is also a work of formidable, dynamic power unsurpassed in European art of its time" &lt;ref name="Foster, Hal 1907"/&gt; Did the work have to be a representation of whores? Couldn't the Proto-Cubist effects previously described have been accomplished just as easily with a cast of card players?" &lt;ref name="Steinberg, Leo 1988"/&gt; According to various critical sources such as Steinberg, Chave, Mullins, Rubins and other critics of ''Les Demoiselles'' the answer is no. They had to be whores. If the viewer is able to fully understand the disquieting effect created by Picasso in their viewing of the work, this reshaping of power could only have been accomplished by the role of Woman or as labelled by Edwin Mullins; Man-Eaters. This is due to the entity of Woman existing as the symbolic embodiment of the natural world in its beauty and ferocity to exist in contrast and outside of the hegemonic structures created by man. As such, a picture of a dangerous woman is powerful because it is the icon of a man's innermost terrors."&lt;ref name="Mullins, Edwin B 1985"&gt;Mullins, Edwin B. "Man-Eaters." The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 1985. 39-56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As, Woman is a creature which threatens to usurp the power and control of her male counterpart through the employment of her sex; described by Freud as Castration Anxiety. The anxiety present in Les Demoiselles presumes as virtually every critic who has addressed Les Demoiselles the picture's intended viewer is male and heterosexual. As conventionally, both the act of painting and that of viewing have been described as phallic acts, acts of penetration performed on that passive receptacle, the blank field of the canvas and the critic Jean Clair once pithily proclaimed, "The gaze is the erection of the eye."' Such metaphors and the general conceit of penetration as a trope for knowing implicitly exclude the female artist and viewer, as such and from a masculinist vantage point, the work would be read as a horror story, but from a feminist one it could be, to the contrary, a fable or even a good omen of vengeance won against male tyranny.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Chave, Anna C. "New Encounters with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Gender, Race, and the Origins of Cubism." The Art Bulletin, vol. 76, no. 4, 1994, pp. 597–611. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3046058.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The trauma of the gaze===

Freudian analysis is a fairly recent step in literature devoted to the painting. Several psychoanalytic scenarios dealing with the "primal scene" and the "castration complex" apply well to ''Les Demoiselles D'Avignon''. They help us understand both the suppression of the "memento mori" allegory and the brutality of the finished picture.&lt;ref name="Foster, Hal 1907"/&gt; According to Sigmund Freud the female body figures in male fantasy are mapped as a castrated body, ''Les Demoiselles'' do not simply represent a figure of impotence; rather, woman becomes phallic through her association with this powerful fantasmatic energy. As Steinberg and others see them, Picasso's demoiselles are eminently phallic: the prostitute second from left "arrives like a projectile"; the one in the centre is "a pillar nude"; the crouching figure at the right evokes "a jumping jack"; and all the women "start up like jerked puppets."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; To construct the female figure as a phallus is, in Freudian terms, a fetishistic strategy, a gesture at once of recognition and disavowal of the alarming fact that women have no penises. Numerous critics have framed Picasso's act in creating ''Les Demoiselles'' in related terms, as a self-ministering ploy to exorcise his private "demons," his fear of women and others. "My first exorcism-painting," the artist once called the picture, in an oft-quoted statement.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; The demons within the work however, represented are mere fissions of danger. As, the images presented are merely paintings on canvas and rather than putting the viewer at risk of physical harm allow them to address their anxiety within the sanitized gallery space.&lt;ref name="Mullins, Edwin B 1985"/&gt; Freud's short text Medusa's head with all its multitude of meanings - Including the notion that Medusa's head is the female sex organ - the sight of which arouses castration anxiety in the young male; the image of castration itself (decapitation); and the denial of castration, on the one hand by the multiplication of penises (her hair consists of snakes) and, on the other, by its power to turn the spectre to stone, in other words, into an erect, albeit dead, phallus.&lt;ref name="Foster, Hal 1907"/&gt;

===Rubin, Seckel, Cousins===
The 1994 book ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' by [[William Rubin]], Helene Seckel and Judith Cousins represents an in-depth analysis of the work and its genesis. Rubin suggests that some of the figure's faces symbolize the disfigurements of [[syphilis]], and that the painting was created following a series of brothel visits by Picasso, who was then temporarily separated from his mistress [[Fernande Olivier]]. Rubin interprets the painting as expressing the artist's [[atheism]], his willingness to risk anarchy for freedom, his fear of disease and illness, and, most forcefully, 'his deep-seated fear and loathing of the female body, which existed side by side with his craving for and ecstatic idealization of it.'&lt;ref&gt;Frey, Julia. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DF1E3EF933A05757C0A963958260 "Anatomy of a Masterpiece"]. ''The New York Times'', 30 April 1995. Retrieved 21 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] had seen the painting at the Salon d'Antin, yet remarkably seems to have purchased ''Les Demoiselles'' without asking Picasso to unroll it in his studio so that he could see it again.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt; André Breton later described the transaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember the day he bought the painting from Picasso, who strange as it may seem, appeared to be intimidated by Doucet and even offered no resistance when the price was set at 25,000 francs: "Well then, it's agreed, M. Picasso." Doucet then said: "You shall receive 2,000 francs per month, beginning next month, until the sum of 25,000 francs is reached.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Richardson quotes Breton in a letter to Doucet about ''Les Demoiselles'' writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt; through it one penetrates right into the core of Picasso's laboratory and because it is the crux of the drama, the center of all the conflicts that Picasso has given rise to and that will last forever....It is a work which to my mind transcends painting; it is the theater of everything that has happened in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;John Richardson, with Marilyn McCully, ''A Life Of Picasso The Triumphant Years, 1917–1932'', Albert A. Knopf 2007, p. 244, {{ISBN|978-0-307-26666-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, it seems Doucet paid 30,000 francs rather than the agreed price.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt; A few months after the purchase Doucet had the painting appraised at between 250,000 and 300,000 francs. Richardson speculates that Picasso, who by 1924 was on the top of the art world and didn't need to sell the painting to Doucet, did so and at that low price because Doucet promised ''Les Demoiselles'' would go to the [[Louvre]] in his will. However, after Doucet died in 1929 he did not leave the painting to the Louvre in his will, and it was sold like most of Doucet's collection through private dealers.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt;

In November 1937 the [[Jacques Seligmann &amp; Company|Jacques Seligman &amp; Co.]] art gallery in New York City held an exhibition titled "20 Years in the Evolution of Picasso, 1903–1923" that included ''Les Demoiselles.'' The [[Museum of Modern Art]] acquired the painting for $24,000. The museum raised $18,000 toward the purchase price by selling a [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] painting and the rest came from donations from the co-owners of the gallery [[Germain Seligman]] and Cesar de Hauke.&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City mounted an important Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940. The exhibition entitled: ''Picasso:40 Years of His Art,'' was organized by [[Alfred H. Barr]] (1902–1981), in collaboration with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The exhibition contained 344 works, including the major and then newly painted ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' and its studies, as well as ''Les Demoiselles.''&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel, 350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In July 2007, ''[[Newsweek]]'' published a two-page article about ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' describing it as the "most influential work of art of the last 100 years".&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;Plagens, Peter. ''[http://www.newsweek.com/2007/06/23/which-is-the-most-influential-work-of-art-of-the-last-100-years.html Which Is the Most Influential Work of Art of the Last 100 Years?]'', Art, Newsweek, 2 July/9 July 2007, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Holland Cotter]] argued that Picasso "changed history with this work. He'd replaced the benign ideal of the Classical nude with a new race of sexually armed and dangerous beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/arts/design/11picasso.html|title=When Picasso Changed His Tune|last=Cotter|first=Holland|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 February 2011|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is prominently featured in the 2018 season of the television series ''[[Genius (U.S. TV series)|Genius]]'' which focuses on Picasso's life and work.

{{distinguish|Letterhead}}

Letterheads Australia is a group of signwriters and decorative artists dedicated to preserving and passing down traditional sign making skills. The Letterheads meet at least annually for a weekend event to practise and exchange accumulated techniques and skills of the craft.

== History ==
The  [[Letterheads|Letterheads movement]] originated in the USA in the 1970s and has since spread to a number of countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, The UK, The Netherlands and Norway.

From original article [[Letterheads]]: "Originated in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in 1975 by a group of sign shop apprentices and sign artists; Rick Flores, John Frazier, Bob Mitchell, Mark Oatis, Mike Rielly, Earl Vehill, Mike Author, Joe Tedesco, Jim Schultz. and Noel Weber. The term "Letterheads" was coined by Earl Vehill. All were unified by an interest in sign design principles and techniques which were no longer taught or valued by most of the contemporary classes, or by the shops in which they worked. Many were understudies of the talented and generous Jerry Albright, and all were acquainted with sign artist Larry Albaugh, in whose studio many early meetings were held. The early gatherings were informal, and consisted of a fair amount of partying, centered around discussions of the sign trade. Sharing, exemplified by Jerry Albright, became the strength of the group. Together with this dedication to sharing and participation was an especial focus upon books and resources, particularly sign instruction and lettering manuals dating to the early 1900s.

Throughout the 1970s, meetings were confined to [[Colorado]] but membership began to grow. Keith Knecht, out of Ohio, joined early on. Knecht, a well-known signmaker and pinstriper who began his career in 1956, died August 30, 2011, at the age of 71. Hundreds of new members joined during the early 1980s, and the movement took off from there. There was a meeting at Noel's in the summer of 1982 and then Mike Jackson's Oklahoma meet in October of the same year. Raymond Chapman had a Texas gathering in November, 1983. The composition of the seminal group, as well as the timeline of early meetings, is a matter of record within the sign industry, and can be verified by a review of letters and articles published in Signs of the Times and SignCraft magazines.

The group now has grown worldwide and numbers in the thousands. The Letterheads traditionally gather for one annual "International" meet in the US or Canada, as well as 10 or more smaller regional meets throughout, but not limited to, the [[United States|US]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the [[UK]]. 2005 marked the first meet held in [[Greece]].

Meets typically last for several days, and consist of attendees participating in lettering, striping, carving, gold leafing ([[Gilding metal|gilding]]) and often glass art. Besides the incredible amount of talent and skill demonstrated during these events, it is the free exchange of knowledge and camaraderie amongst people of the same trade that makes these weekends remarkable.

The Letterhead mission is to pass on trade "secrets" and skills through the ages, "keeping their craft alive" for future generations. With the onset of computers and vinyl films for signmaking, the Letterhead mission of passing down the traditional skills is more important today than ever before."

Placed by Leticia Green Stevenson Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, May 29, 1918. |This plaque marks the site of the Lost Speech.]]

'''Lincoln's''' "'''Lost Speech'''" was a speech given by [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[Bloomington Convention]] on May 29, 1856, in [[Bloomington, Illinois]]. Traditionally regarded as lost because it was so engaging that reporters neglected to take notes, the speech is believed to have been an impassioned condemnation of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. It is possible the text was deliberately "lost" owing to its controversial content.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Speech==
Lincoln's Lost Speech was given at the  since demolished building at the corner of East and Front Streets in downtown [[Bloomington, Illinois]], known as [[Major's Hall]] on May 29, 1856.&lt;ref name=descriptive/&gt; Lincoln gave the speech at the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act|Anti-Nebraska]] [[Bloomington Convention]] that culminated with the founding of the state [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=descriptive&gt;[[Federal Writer's Project]], ''Illinois: A Descriptive and Historical Guide'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=soYJZ1cXqr8C&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=tfSA0O7JzmCIOIGMyMedGqaaFuc Google Books]), A.C. McClurg &amp; Company, Chicago: 1939, p. 164, ({{ISBN|1603540121}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no known transcripts or written accounts of the Lost Speech, other than a brief summary in the local press. Eyewitnesses have offered snippets of some of Lincoln's content that day. [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] asserted that some of [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech]] was not based on new concepts at the time of its delivery. He wrote that Lincoln's "house divided against itself cannot stand" originated with the famous Bloomington speech of 1856.&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;Briggs, John Channing. ''Lincoln's Speeches Reconsidered'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=DV_JviCyOJ4C&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=nHRjHK4lziG35ncN8bIOsjJZ0WE#PPA165,M1 Google Books]), JHU Press, 2005, pp. 165&amp;ndash;66, ({{ISBN|0801881064}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Editor of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' [[Joseph Medill]] claimed that Chicago lawyer [[Henry Clay Whitney]]'s transcript of the speech was accurate; Whitney's version was later debunked.&lt;ref name=ida/&gt;&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt;

It is thought that the speech was a strongly worded derision of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].&lt;ref name=btown&gt;"[http://www.downtownbloomington.org/content.php?section=history The Historical Significance of Downtown Bloomington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213033750/http://www.downtownbloomington.org/content.php?section=history |date=2008-02-13 }}", Our History, ''Downtown Bloomington Association'', accessed April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2018}} It is known that Lincoln's condemnation of the expansion of slavery was strong.&lt;ref name=pantagraph&gt;Cima, Greg. "[http://www.pantagraph.com/articles/2006/05/30/news/114095.txt Inspiration found in 'lost speech']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", ''The Pantagraph'' ([[Bloomington, Illinois]]), May 30, 2006, accessed April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional reason given for the lack of any written recollection of the Lost Speech is that Lincoln's skilled and powerful oration had mesmerized every person in attendance. Reporters were said to have laid down their pencils and neglected note taking, as if hypnotized by Lincoln's words. When the speech ended no notes existed, so media reports of the day simply recorded the fact that the speech had been delivered.&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;Peterson, Merrill D. ''Lincoln in American Memory'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=D_FjY_ARcGoC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=aCWgQidhecgrdIC3JM1tsWn_4X0 Google Books]), Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 154, ({{ISBN|0195096452}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence in Herndon's recollections that the fact that the speech was "lost" may not have been an accident. So strongly worded was Lincoln's oration that others in attendance feared the words might lead to a crumbling of the Union and that Lincoln consented to suspending "its repetition" for the duration of the 1856 campaign.&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt;

==Whitney version==
In 1896, Chicago attorney [[Henry Clay Whitney]] published his [https://archive.org/details/abrahamlincoln00linc account of the speech] in an issue of ''[[McClure's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=mcclures&gt;[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln, Abraham]], Whitney, Henry Clay and [[Joseph Medill|Medill, Joseph]]. "Lincoln's Lost Speech", Now First Published from the Unique Report", ([https://books.google.com/books?id=gyQXHAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Henry+Clay+Whitney+Lost+SPeech&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), ''McClure's Magazine'', S.S. McClure, September 1896, pp. 319&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lifeoflincoln/&gt; Whitney claimed he had taken notes during the speech and based his version of the speech upon those notes.&lt;ref name=lifeoflincoln&gt;Whitney, Henry Clay and Miller, Marion Mills. ''Life of Lincoln'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=F5rlYX9XSZMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), The Baker &amp; Taylor Company, New York: 1908, pp. 327&amp;ndash;52.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Whitney's version was given some credibility. [[Ida Tarbell]] sought out Joseph Medill, who was present at the Lost Speech, and he claimed that Whitney's version displayed "remarkable accuracy".&lt;ref name=ida&gt;[[Ida M. Tarbell|Tarbell, Ida M]]. ''All In a Day's Work: An Autobiography'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=qrZBbVRIO10C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=OyvDtlAWc7cCOYSDfceobVtfj-Q#PPA173,M1 Google Books]), 2003, University of Illinois Press, p. 173, ({{ISBN|0252071360}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarbell was unwittingly carried away by the story, but others were skeptical. Former Lincoln private secretary [[John George Nicolay]] declared Whitney's version devoid of Lincoln's style and a fraud.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt; [[Robert Lincoln]], Abraham's son, agreed with Nicolay's assessment.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt; In 1900, the [[McLean County, Illinois|McLean County]] Historical Society&lt;ref name=mclean&gt;The location of the speech, Bloomington, Illinois, is found in [[McLean County, Illinois|McLean County]].&lt;/ref&gt; declared their skepticism.&lt;ref name=mclean2&gt;Prince, Ezra M., ed.  ''[http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3543:20.lincoln Meeting of May 29, 1900 Commemorative of the Convention of May 29, 1856 That Organized the Republican party in the State of Illinois (Transactions of the McLean County Historical Society v. 3)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610230629/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3543%3A20.lincoln |date=June 10, 2011 }}, 1900, Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project, [[Northern Illinois University]], accessed April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, Lincoln researcher and Director of the [[Chicago Historical Society]] Paul M. Angle exposed Whitney's version of the speech and his claims of its validity as a "fabrication".&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt;

==Importance==
Lincoln's Lost Speech was famous, with a status considered legendary by the time Tarbell became enamored with Whitney's version of it.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt; Lincoln was said to have spoken "like a giant inspired" and the tale of how the speech came to be lost was well known.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt; Many who attended the speech considered it the greatest of Lincoln's life.&lt;ref name=angle&gt;Angle, Paul M. ''Abraham Lincoln by Some Men Who Knew Him'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=SNRoMIHas8wC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=lincoln+%22lost+speech%22&amp;lr=&amp;sig=546Akyu1x2NCbyiroi7iUYBYhxU Google Books]), Ayer Publishing, 1950, pp. 29&amp;ndash;30, ({{ISBN|083691242X}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Given at the first state convention, which essentially founded the [[Illinois Republican Party]], the speech thrust Lincoln into the national political limelight.&lt;ref name=pantagraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=angle/&gt;

Though it was known as the Lost Speech, its content influenced people nonetheless. Those who heard it were often asked to repeat what they heard and a frenzied group of supporters spearheaded Lincoln's drive toward a second-place finish among [[U.S. Vice President|U.S. vice presidential]] candidates in 1856.&lt;ref name=illtimes&gt;Wheeler, Samuel P. "[https://archive.is/20130127033640/http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid:7179 Adultery, Murder and Lincoln]," ''Illinois Times'', December 27, 2007, accessed April 18, 2088.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13915">A '''magician's assistant''' is  a performer in a [[magic (illusion)|magic act]] who is not billed as the magician or principal name in the act. The role of an assistant can include holding the [[theatrical property|prop]]s that are used by a [[Magician (illusion)|magician]], shifting props onto and off the stage, and serving as a living prop in illusions that involve manipulation of the human body. Other aspects of the role can include dancing or acting as visual ornamentation, sometimes for simple aesthetic purposes and sometimes to misdirect audience attention. The figure of the glamorous female assistant has become a stereotype or icon in art, popular media and fiction.&lt;ref name="johnstone"&gt;{{cite journal

Although magician's assistants appear to play a supporting role and receive a lesser [[Billing (film)|billing]] than the magician who appears to be the source of illusions, the assistant is often the one making the mechanics of the illusions work. In the words of [[Joanie Spina]], who worked for 11 years as principal assistant, choreographer and artistic consultant to illusionist [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...I did find fault with the term "assistant" because it sounds like someone rolling props on and off stage when many of us were highly trained actors and dancers.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History and critiques==

[[File:FarlaAssistents.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Sabrina and Vanessa with illusionist [[Christian Farla]]]]
Assistants have been part of magic shows for most of the recorded [[Timeline of magic|history of magic]] as a performance art. Despite their often crucial role in magic acts they, and the work they do, have suffered from negative public perceptions. The assistant's role has often been stereotyped as consisting of menial tasks and having the primary purpose of adding a visually aesthetic element to an act. This is associated with the perception that assistants are usually female and often dressed in revealing costumes. Although there have been plenty of instances of male assistants throughout the history of magic, the glamorous female stereotype has made a particular impact because female assistants were a prominent feature of illusion shows during the 20th century, when magic began to reach huge new audiences, first through the burgeoning of live [[vaudeville]] and [[variety shows]] and then through television. The glamorous female assistant has become an iconic image that continues in modern media and literature.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="womeninboxes"&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.womeninboxes.com
 |title = ''Women in Boxes''
 |publisher = WIB, LLC
 |accessdate = 2007-04-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature of the glamorous female assistant iconography is the frequency with which assistants play the role of "victim" in illusions where they are tied up, apparently cut with blades, penetrated with spikes or swords or otherwise tortured or imperilled. Examples include ''[[Aztec Lady]]'', ''[[Devil's Torture Chamber]]'', ''[[Mismade Girl]]'', ''[[Radium Girl]]'', ''[[Zig Zag Girl]]'', and, perhaps most famous of all, ''[[Sawing a woman in half]]''.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The topic of assistants portrayed as victims in violent illusions was featured in "Violent magic" the final episode of the six-part [[BBC]] television documentary series ''Magic'' in 2004, see {{cite web
 |url = http://www.magicweek.co.uk/backissues_0200-0249/0230.htm

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted illusion designer and historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] has identified the advent of the sawing illusion as a turning point in magic history and a moment which, more than any other, marks the origin of the cliche of the female assistant as victim. It is generally agreed that a "sawing" type illusion was first performed publicly by [[P. T. Selbit]] in January 1921. His presentations of what he titled "''Sawing through a woman''" made an enormous impact and greatly affected public expectations of stage magic for decades afterwards. Steinmeyer has explained:&lt;ref name="hiding"&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher = William Heinemann/Random House
 |year = 2003
 |pages = 277–295
 |isbn = 0-434-01325-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Robert-Houdin]], both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions. Victorian gowns often made it unrealistic for a lady to take part in an illusion or be pressed into a tight space.&lt;ref name="hiding2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:DietrichKlein.jpg|thumb|Magician Dorothy Dietrich sawing celebrity assistant and comedian Robert Klein in half on TV]] One female magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]] has turned the tables and used men as assistants, sawing them in half.  

Changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of "victim" both practical and popular. Steinmeyer notes: "During the 1900s, as a shapely leg became not only acceptable on the stage but admired, it was fashionable to perform magic with a cast of attractive ladies".&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

That was only part of the story, however. The trauma of war had helped to desensitize the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were also tiring of the gentler forms of magic represented by the likes of [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. It took something more shocking, such as the horrific productions of the [[Grand Guignol]] theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

In contrast to the publicity given to Selbit, the names of the assistants who made this influential act work have received almost no publicity. There were two premieres of the illusion. Selbit first presented it to an audience in December 1920; however, on that occasion the spectators were a small group of invited theatrical agents and promoters who Selbit hoped would book the act. The public premiere then occurred on 17 January 1921 at the [[Finsbury Park]] Empire music hall after Selbit was hired by the Moss Empire group. According to Steinmeyer, the assistant at the 1920 preview was Jan Glenrose, Selbit's main assistant at that time. The public performances featured principal assistant Betty Barker.&lt;ref name="hiding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artandartifice"&gt;{{cite book

Many of these illusions, together with others that involve appearances, disappearances or escapes, involve assistants being shut in boxes of one sort or another. This has led to the nickname "box jumper" which, although it could be applied to a male assistant, is usually inferred to be a female assistant.&lt;ref name="boxjumpers1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that has been given for the predominance of women in this role is that the illusions sometimes require an assistant that can fit into cramped spaces and women have an advantage in that they tend to be smaller and more limber than men.&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hiding2"/&gt;

[[Feminist]] critics have taken the above aspects of illusions and performances as evidence to support claims that magic is [[misogynist]]ic, but this view has been contested by some magicians and assistants. However, a few prominent assistants have stated that they deserve better recognition for their efforts and achievements (see "[[#Documentaries|Documentaries]]" below).&lt;ref name="johnstone"/&gt;

Some modern magic acts have preserved the glamorous elements of the female assistant iconography while attempting to give full recognition to female performers by billing women as equal partners in acts. A notable example was the husband and wife act [[Pendragons|The Pendragons]], for which Charlotte Pendragon wore very revealing costumes and did traditional "box jumping" roles yet received equal billing with her husband. She was also honored in her own right as a top professional magician. Another example, although with more modest and conservative costuming, is [[Kristen Johnson (escape artist)|Kristen Johnson]], who receives equal billing with her husband Kevin Ridgeway when they perform together as a magic act and often stars in her own right as an [[escapology|escape artist]].

'''Mary McMurtrie''' &lt;small&gt;DA SBA&lt;ref group=note&gt;Society of Botanical Artists&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; (26 June 1902 &amp;ndash; 1 November 2003) was a Scottish botanical artist and horticulturalist. She wrote and illustrated several books of wild flowers and became internationally recognised for her botanical art. She continued painting and publishing until she was over a hundred years old, becoming recognised as the oldest working artist in Britain.

==Early life==
Mary Margaret McMurtrie (née Mitchell), daughter of George and Jeannie Mitchell, was born in [[Skene, Aberdeenshire|Skene]] in rural [[Aberdeenshire]] where her father was the headmaster of the local school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Mitchell, Mary Margaret (Statutory Births 238/00 0017)|work=Statutory Births 1855-2013|accessdate=28 January 2015|url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/content/help/index.aspx?r=554&amp;402|publisher=[[ScotlandsPeople]]|subscription=yes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123091046/http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/content/help/index.aspx?r=554&amp;402|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at [[Albyn School|Albyn School for Girls]] in Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=clark /&gt; From early childhood she sketched animals in the fields near her home. She proved herself adept at art so she went to [[Gray's School of Art]] where she was one of the first female students. She came first in her year when she graduated and so would have won the prize of a study visit to Italy. However, because this was not considered appropriate for a girl (who it was assumed would only go on to become a housewife), the prize was instead awarded to the boy who came second. She then took a course at the College of Domestic Science in Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=scotsobit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/mary-mcmurtrie-1-493424|title=Mary McMurtrie|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=Scotsman|date=10 November 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222225303/http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/mary-mcmurtrie-1-493424|archivedate=22 February 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horticulture==
She married Rev John McMurtrie (son of Rev John McMurtrie and grandson of [[John McMurtrie (moderator)|Very Rev John McMurtrie]]), the minister of Skene, in 1924 and the couple had four children. In her book ''Where the Apple Ripens'', [[Jessie Kesson]] recalled her childhood memory of the exotic [[Himalayan cowslip]]s in the McMurtries' [[manse]] garden at the time when they befriended the girl from the nearby orphanage.&lt;ref name=fiddes /&gt;  McMurtrie's husband died in 1949 and so she had to bring up her two youngest children on her own. As well as painting flowers, she had a love of horticulture so she moved from Skene to Aberdeen to set up a horticultural nursery in her garden where it became a thriving business.&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt; She wrote the description of Skene parish in the ''[[Third Statistical Account of Scotland]]'' and published articles of local interest in the ''[[Scots Magazine]]'' and the ''Deeside Field''.&lt;ref name="fiddes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fiddes|first1=Jim|title=From Brodiach to Bervie : a history of Skene and Westhill|date=2012|publisher=Leopard|location=Inverurie|isbn=978-0-9570999-1-3|pages=258, 342–344, 366|chapter=Some Skene Worthies: Mary McMurtrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1960 she bought 16th-century [[Balbithan House]] near [[Kintore, Aberdeenshire]], a country mansion which she completely restored.&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=canmore&gt;{{cite web|title=Balbithan House|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/19508/details/balbithan+house/|work=Canmore|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland|accessdate=10 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222182813/http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/19508/details/balbithan%20house/|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fiddes /&gt; She transformed the gardens there into a leading North East Scotland nursery, specialising in alpines, rock plants and old garden flowers. In particular, she cultivated roses, violas, pinks, primulas and other native wild flowers.&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=tolquhon /&gt;&lt;ref name=pandg&gt;{{cite web|title=Balbithan House, Inverurie, Scotland Record Id: 211|url=http://www.parksandgardens.org/places-and-people/site/211|work=Parks and Gardens UK|publisher=Parks and Gardens Data Services Ltd.|accessdate=10 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222001235/http://www.parksandgardens.org/places-and-people/site/211|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She, along with such gardeners as [[Margery Fish]] and [[Gladys Emma Peto]], were the only people who kept some old varieties of garden flowers.&lt;ref name=clark /&gt;

==Botanical art==
With her detailed knowledge of wild flowers she developed her watercolour flower painting beyond a hobby. She always painted directly from life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary McMurtrie D.A, S.B.A. |url=http://balbithan.weebly.com/events.html |work=North East Open Studios |publisher=North East Open Studios |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NHRkyOd9?url=http://balbithan.weebly.com/events.html |deadurl=no |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She did a lot of painting when holidaying in the [[Algarve]], and in [[Kenya]] where her daughter lived. McMurtrie exhibited her paintings in local art galleries and eventually became internationally recognised as one of Britain's leading botanical painters.&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt; The [[University of Lisbon]] commissioned her to illustrate ''The Flowers of the Algarve'', a series of six booklets published between 1973 and 1998.&lt;ref name=sunhoney&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary McMurtrie DA|url=http://sunhoney.haston.me/books.html|publisher=Sunhoney Books|accessdate=10 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140845/http://sunhoney.haston.me/books.html|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the author, she painted the illustrations for [[Roy Genders]]' 1975 book ''Growing Old-fashioned Flowers''.&lt;ref name=horwood&gt;{{cite book|last=Horwood|first=Catherine|title=Gardening Women : their stories from 1600 to the present|year=2010|publisher=Virago|location=London|isbn=9781844084630|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMurtrie retired from running the nursery and moved back to Aberdeen where she did the illustrations and text for her first book of flowers, ''Wild Flowers of Scotland'', published when she was 80. ''Scots Roses of Hedgerows and Wild Gardens'' was published in 1998 and ''Scottish Wild Flowers'' in 2001.&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=tolquhon&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary McMurtrie|url=http://www.tolquhon-gallery.co.uk/Artists/Mary%20McMurtrie.htm|work=Artists|publisher=Tolquhon Gallery|accessdate=10 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221234210/http://www.tolquhon-gallery.co.uk/Artists/Mary%20McMurtrie.htm|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boyd&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Peter|title=Mary McMurtrie, painter of Scots Roses 1902-2003|url=http://www.peterboyd.com/mcmurtrie.htm|publisher=Peter D.A.

Mary McMurtrie completed the illustrations for ''Old Cottage Pinks'' shortly before her death on 1 November 2003 at the age of 101.  She had continued to paint until the last few weeks of her life and had just completed proof reading her latest book.&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=tolquhon /&gt; Peter McEwan, author of the ''Dictionary of Scottish Art'', said "She was one of the outstanding &amp;ndash; and possibly the outstanding &amp;ndash; botanical flower painters in Scotland of her era. She had exhibitions of her work in France, in Portugal, in Kenya, at the Royal Horticultural Society in London, and, of course, here in Scotland". The UK charity for the elderly [[Counsel and Care]] had recognised her as the oldest active artist in Britain.&lt;ref name=scotsobit /&gt;

After her death, some of her unpublished paintings were published in ''Mary McMurtrie's Country Garden Flowers''&lt;ref name=clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Timothy|title=Mary McMurtrie's Country Garden Flowers|year=2009|publisher=Garden Art Press|location=Woodbridge|isbn=9781870673600|url=http://www.antiquecollectorsclub.com/uk/store/pv/9781870673600/mary-mcmurtrie-s-country-garden-flowers/timothy-clark|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221214211/http://www.antiquecollectorsclub.com/uk/store/pv/9781870673600/mary-mcmurtrie-s-country-garden-flowers/timothy-clark|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sign .jpg|thumb|300x300px]]
The '''Millay Colony for the Arts''' is an arts community offering residency-retreats and workshops in [[Austerlitz, New York]], and free arts programs in local public schools. Housed on the former property of [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning feminist/activist poet and playwright [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], the Colony's campus offers artists, students, and art lovers residencies, retreats, and classes.


==History==
[[File:MillayColonyBarn.jpg|thumb]] In 1925, Edna St. Vincent Millay bought ''[[Steepletop]]'', a house with a blueberry farm in Austerlitz, NY, named after a pink, conical [[wildflower]] that grows there.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', May 16, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; With her husband, Millay built a barn from a [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] kit, and then a writing cabin, and a tennis court.  

After the poet's death in 1950, her sister [[Norma Millay Ellis]] moved to Steepletop. In 1973, she founded The Millay Colony, which was established as a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;"Millay Farm Becoming an Arts Colony," The New York Times, February 20, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Norma Millay Ellis donated the barn and surrounding acreage to The Millay Colony. The barn was subsequently renovated to provide accommodations and studio space for four resident artists. 

In the mid-1990s, The Millay Colony commissioned architectural firm [http://www.michaelsinger.com/project/millay-colony-for-the-arts/ Michael Singer Studio], in consultation with an advisory committee of six artists with disabilities, to design an additional building for the Colony using the principles of universal access and environmentally friendly design.&lt;ref&gt;"An Artists' Retreat Is Extending Its Welcome," New York Times, October 3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  

This 3,550 square foot building currently houses The Millay Colony's offices and public rooms, and provides accommodations and studio space for three additional artists, for a total capacity of seven. 

The Colony is adjacent to [[Steepletop]], Edna St. Vincent Millay's former home and gardens, which today are maintained by the [http://www.millay.org/ Millay Society] (established as a nonprofit in 1972). The Millay Society also holds rights to the poet's intellectual property and operates as a separate organization from The Millay Colony. The house and gardens are a [[National Historic Landmark]].

==Arts Education==
The Millay Colony offers Workshop Retreats, formulated and taught by artists with a commitment to teaching. These affordable, multi-day classes, held on The Millay Colony's campus, invite artists at all stages of their career to develop new work while engaging with other artists.

Concurrently, the Colony offers a multiform program of arts education to more than 500 public school children in four local school districts each year, as well as professional development/teacher training on using the arts across disciplines for local teachers.

==Residencies==
The Millay Colony offers residencies to emerging and established visual artists, writers, and composers—individually and in collaborating groups – from April to November. These artists and groups receive private bedrooms and private studios as well as all meals and access to the Colony's libraries, darkroom, music room and the natural resources on the campus adjacent Harvey Mountain State Forest.

October 1 is the date to apply for residencies in April to July of the following year.  

March 1 is the date to apply for residencies in August to November of the same year. 

All residencies are reviewed anonymously by juries of artists, critics and curators.  The Colony hosts over 60 residents per year.

The '''''namsadang''''' ({{IPA-ko|nam.sa.daŋ}}) is a [[Korea]]n itinerant troupe which consists of male performers who present various [[performing arts]] such as [[acrobatic]]s, [[singing]], [[dancing]] and [[playing]] like a [[circus]].&lt;ref name="eng.baudeogi-namsadang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.baudeogi.com/namsadang/default.asp |title=Namsadang:Professional acrobatics, Song and Dance groups |publisher=Anseon Namsadang Baudeogi Festival |accessdate=2008-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919094741/http://eng.baudeogi.com/namsadang/default.asp |archivedate=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is said that ''namsadang'' was spontaneously formed before 1900 during the [[Joseon Dynasty]]&lt;ref name="Baudeogi Origin"&gt;

and used to wander about marketplaces and villages.&lt;ref name="eng.baudeogi-namsadang" /&gt; The troupe was considered the lowest class in society along with ''[[cheonmin]]'' (vulgar commoners) or ''[[baekjeong]]'' (butchers), so that very few historical documents remain on them. However, since a record that a [[puppetry|puppet show]] was performed during the [[Silla period]] (57 BCE – 935 CE) has been found, it is assumed that similar types of itinerant companies appeared in [[Korean history]] a long time ago.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;

During the late Joseon Dynasty, there were several ''namsadang'', but the one whose base was set in Cheongryongsa temple (청룡사) in [[Anseong]], [[Gyeonggi Province]] was the most famous.&lt;ref name="eng.baudeogi-namsadang" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatemple.net/korea_temple/traditional_temple/history/view.asp?temple_seq=337&amp;category_id=7 남사당이 쉬어갔던 작은 절집 청룡사&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They became called ''namsadang'' because the troupe were composed of only men and ''"nam"'' (남, {{linktext|男}}) means a male in [[Korean language|Korean]]. Later, a few female members were accepted to join in the group though.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://namsadang.culturecontent.com/n_info/n_info_01.asp |title=유랑예인집단 남사당&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212946/http://namsadang.culturecontent.com/n_info/n_info_01.asp |archive-date=2011-07-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six performances which the troupe performs are collectively called ''Namsadang nori'' (남사당놀이), literally meaning ''nori'' (놀이) performed by ''namsadang''. Nori refers to play, game or performance in Korean. The ''namsadang nori'' includes ''[[pungmul nori]]'' (풍물, Korean spinning hat dance), ''beona nori'' (버나놀이, spinning [[hooping|hoop]]s and dishes), ''salpan'' (살판, [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]]), ''eoreum'' (어름, [[tightrope]] dancing), ''deotboegi'' (덧뵈기, [[Korean mask|mask dance]] drama), and ''deolmi'' (덜미, [[puppetry|puppet play]]). All six ''nori'' are associated with each other and integrate various activities such as music, [[wikt:feat|feat]], [[acrobatics]], [[stunt]], play, dance, and mask dance. Originally there were ten performances on Namsadang-nori but only six have been brought down until now.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://koreandb.empas.com/life/nolyee/detail?sn=39 엠파스 - 한국학&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 1964, the South Korean government designated ''deolmi'' (puppet play) as the third [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property]].&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt; Later, on August 1, 1988, all six performances of ''Namsadang nori'' were included as Important Intangible Cultural Properties as well.

==Troupe organization==
''Namsadang'' usually consisted of 40 ~ 50 members of all ages. The head of the group is called ''kkokdusoe'' (꼭두쇠, {{IPA-ko|k͈okt͈usʰwe}})&lt;ref name="eng.baudeogi-namsadang" /&gt; and the second-in-command is called ''golbaengisoe'' (골뱅이쇠 {{IPA|[kolbɛŋiːsʰwe]}}). Underneath there were ''tteunsoe'' (뜬쇠 {{IPA|[t͈ɯːnsʰwe]}}), ''gayeol'' (가열 {{IPA|[kajʌl]}}), ''ppiri'' (삐리 {{IPA|[p͈iɾi]}}), ''jeoseungpae'' (저승패 {{IPA|[tɕʌsʰɯŋpʰɛ]}}), and ''deungjimkkun'' (등짐꾼 {{IPA|[tɯŋdʑimk͈un]}}). ''Tteunsoe'' is the head of the each performance or senior performer and ''gayeol'' is a performer. ''Ppiri'' is an apprentice. In addition, ''jeoseungpae'' refers to elderly members and ''deungjimkkun'' is porters.&lt;ref name="eng.baudeogi-namsadang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baudeogi Origin" /&gt; 

The troupe was well-organized and strictly disciplined by rules. Because entertainers like singers or actors were often despised in that age, the troupe recruited its members among the orphans, poor farmers` children and sometimes even through kidnapping. They were not well-paid. Very often they were offered only meals and beds and a small amount of money. They had tough lives.&lt;ref name="eng.baudeogi-namsadang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

The troupe may have functioned as a homosexual community, with each member taking the role of ''Sutdongmo'', "butch", or ''Yodongmo'', "queen".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Hv2Wkwbw3wC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=namsadang+gay&amp;source=web&amp;ots=HA0m0I3Pm-&amp;sig=42Y5UBhE6xzO8kBreMamvsC1Mf4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=11&amp;ct=result] ''Pacific Homosexualities'', by Stephen O.

==Namsadang nori==
Namsadang's ''yeonhui'' (연희, 演戱) or performances were held on the ground instead of theaters. When ''namsadang'' found a village, they had to get a permission from the leader of the village in order to present their talents. Members of ''namsadang'' performed the six ''nori'' in the biggest yard of the village. The sequence of six ''nori'' is as follows.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

===Pungmul nori===
[[File:Korea-Namsadang-Sangmo nori-02.jpg|thumb|200px|''Sangmo nori'']]
''[[Pungmul nori]]'' (풍물놀이) is the first performance of ''namsadang nori'', combined with music, dance, ''sangmo nori'' (상모놀이, spinning streamer hat performance) and various other activities. ''Pungmul'' instruments comprise four [[percussion instrument]]s such as ''[[Jing (instrument)|jing]]'' ([[gong]]), ''[[kkwaenggwari]]'' (another kind of gong), ''[[buk (drum)|buk]]'' (drum), ''[[janggu]]'' (double-headed drum) and several ''[[sogo]]'' ([[tabor (instrument)|tabors]]) and nallari/[[Taepyeongso]] (double-reed), which make unique melodies and rhythms.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt; The music played by the four instruments of ''pungmul'' (i.e. ''jing, kkwaenggwari, buk, janggu'') is called ''[[samul nori]]'' (four piece playing).&lt;ref&gt;[http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=151769&amp;v=44 엠파스 백과사전&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beona-nori===
''Beaona nori'' (버나놀이) is a performance with ''beona''.  This can be a dish, a [[Sink|basin]], or a sieve frame. Performers spin and toss the ''beona'' into the air by using a [[tobacco]] pipe or a long wooden stick while exchanging witty talks with a clown called ''maehossi'' (매호씨) or ''sorikkun'' (소리꾼).&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=239849&amp;v=43 엠파스 백과사전&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salpan===
The word ''salpan'' (살판) comes from the saying that "if you do well, you will be alive (''salpan''), and if you don't, you will be dead" (jookeulpan). It is also called ''ttangjaeju'' (땅재주), literally meaning talents held on the ground.  The performer executes various acrobatic feats called "gondu" (곤두) while exchanging humorous banter with a ''maehossi'' (clown).&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

===Eoreum===
[[File:Korea-Jeonju-Jultagi-02.jpg|thumb|200px|Tightrope dancing by ''namsadang'' called either ''eoreum'' or ''jultagi'']]
''[[Eoreum]]'' (어름) or ''jultagi'' (줄타기) is tightrope dancing. It is called "eoreum" because the ''nori'' is as hard and cautious as walking on thin ice (''eoreum'' means "thin ice" in Korean). The performer or eoreum-sani dances, sings songs, and does aerial stunts on the rope which is tightly fastened 3 meters off the ground. The performer also exchanges witty talks with a ''maehossi'' on the ground and all his performance is accompanied with special rhythm made by a drum.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

===Deotboegi===
''Deotboegi'' (덧뵈기) means "See with the mask on". Generally, this performance has good humor and tendency to tickle the fancy of the public. ''Deotboegi'' gains high popularity among audience. However it also contains keen satire on the society and [[yangban]] or the noble class of Joseon Dynasty.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

===Deolmi===
[[File:Korean puppetry-Kkokdugaksi noreum-01.jpg|thumb|200px|Puppets used for ''deolmi'']]
''Deolmi'' (덜미) or puppet play is played last. It is also known as ''"[[Kkoktugakshi Nori|kkokdu kagsi noleum]]"'' (꼭두각시놀음), which comprises the three words: ''kkokdu'' (puppet), ''gaksi'' (maiden) and noleum (''nori'', performance). In addition, the puppetry is called ''"parkcheomji noleum"'' (박첨지놀음) and ''"Hongdongji nori"'' (홍동지놀이), all of which are named after the main characters in the play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://engdic.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=33309&amp;contentno=33309 엔싸이버 백과검색 - 꼭두각시놀음&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, puppet plays appeared first in the early age of the [[Silla Dynasty]] (BC 57 – 935 AD). All the other puppet plays disappeared later on, but ''deolmi'' survives and has been brought down through generations. Its main story is about the resistance against the dominant aristocratic class and satirizes corrupt [[Buddhist priest]]s.  So the play appealed to the commoners and the poor public, which perhaps explains its popularity, and ultimately why it has survived so many years. It was designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property before the other parts of the ''namsadang nori''.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=256553&amp;v=46 엠파스 백과사전&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally performers use about 40 puppets and around 10 hand props.&lt;ref name="ocp.go.kr"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ocp.go.kr/l_guide/school/52.html |title=인형들이 하는 연극(꼭두각시놀음)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151744/http://www.ocp.go.kr/l_guide/school/52.html |archive-date=2011-06-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baudeogi==
Probably the most famous and eminent person ever in the history of ''namsadang'' is ''Baudeogi''&lt;ref name="Baudeogi Origin" /&gt; Her real name is Kim Amdeok (김암덕).  She was born as the daughter of a poor peasant farmer and joined the troupe at the age of 5 in 1853. She had the great makings of the six performances, and with her amazing skills and artistic talent, became a big star among the public. When Baudeogi was 15, she was unanimously elected as ''kkokdusoe'' (leader of the troupe) by the troupe members. That was quite unusual because at that time only male could be a leader and she was so young. This might prove her talents and high popularity. In 1865, [[Heungseon Daewongun]], the regency called in her troupe to court and had them cheer workers who engaged in constructing a new palace. They made a great success in their job, and the regency gave her a [[jade]] headband button. At that time, only high rank officials could possess and her fame spread nationwide ever since. This is regarded as the beginning of Korean entertainment business as well as Baudeogi is appraised as the first popular entertainer of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.baudeogi.com/namsadang/namsadang_03.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The local festival of Anseong is called "Baudeogi Festival" in the honor of her. It is held in [[Anseong]] in October every year.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.baudeogi.com/festival/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The significance of ''namsadang nori'' can be found in its common touch. This came into existence spontaneously and performed for the poor farmers, folks, traders, and other middle-class and low-class people. It functioned as consolation for the public and gained high popularity among the general populace. And though it is not so refined as other Korean musical styles (i.e. [[Dodeuri]]) and dances (i.e. [[Kommu]] (reflist 18) (Sword Dance) for the noble class, it may be seen as performance meant to convey and have most powerful appeal to emotion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Restoration==
The troupe was re-established in Anseong, which is the birthplace of the old ''namsadang'', to preserve its cultural heritage. The new troupe has its regular performances on every Saturday and also provides overseas performances from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=293140 Official Site of Korea Tourism Org.: Anseong Baudeogi Festival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Grounds Print Workshop, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;New Grounds Print Workshop&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''New Grounds Print Workshop''', founded in 1996 by Regina Held, is a [[nontoxic]] printmaking facility specializing in [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] and relief [[printmaking]]. It is located in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], United States. According to the mission statement on their website, New Grounds is "dedicated to providing artists with a professional, informative, safer and well-equipped environment for the creation of fine prints while promoting the artists and exhibiting their work."{{cite quote|date=October 2018}}

== Origins and goals ==
New Grounds was founded in response to three particular needs: 
#The need for a printmaking center in Albuquerque offering classes, press and studio access to all artists working in intaglio and relief printmaking. 
#The need to educate the general public about printmaking by offering studio tours, lectures and exhibitions. 
#The need for this facility to be nontoxic.  At that time all printmaking constituted a high health risk to artists in addition to having a negative impact on the environment. 

A good definition of nontoxic, or green printmaking, can be found on Friedhard Kiekeben's website, NontoxicPrint.com: "the term nontoxic/non-toxic has become synonymous with safety-conscious practice. Nontoxic processes still use a variety of chemicals, and the ultimate safety of any material and process is dependent on their informed use."{{cite quote|date=October 2018}}

New Grounds utilized the research of the innovators Keith Howard&lt;ref name=praga&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Keith|title="Intaglio and the Tradition of Toxicity." Keith Howard’s Non-Toxic Printmaking Page.|url=http://www.praga.com/Imagon/imhoward.htm|accessdate=October 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917021811/http://www.praga.com/Imagon/imhoward.htm|archivedate=2004-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Zaffron to build a completely green studio, and, according to a research paper&lt;ref name=nontoxicprint&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiekeben|first=F.|title=The Green Print Studio|url=http://www.nontoxicprint.com/thegreenprintstudio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Liz Chalfin from Zea Mays Printmaking studio, New Grounds was one of the first nontoxic printmaking studios in the United States.

{{quote|It all began with a non-toxic studio in her remodeled [[South Valley, New Mexico|South Valley]] garage, where artists would rent press access on an hourly basis and Held taught classes. At that time, New Grounds also offered [[papermaking]] classes and access to the papermaking studio. In 2000, Regina expanded to the current 3500 square foot commercial space in [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque, New Mexico|Nob Hill]]. Now, more than five years later, New Grounds includes a thriving gallery that represents member and international artists whose works Regina consigns. It is also a shared workspace where resident artists have the use of two large print rooms, five presses, comfortable work and storage areas, a break room, and areas in which to shoot photographic plates for gravures and to etch plates for intaglio prints. Another entire room, with its own press, is devoted to classes, where everything from monotype to the alternative process, gumoil printing, is taught.&lt;ref name=marylandprintmakers&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher|first=Janet|title=A Summer at New Grounds Print Workshop, Albuquerque, NM|url=http://marylandprintmakers.org/newsletter.asp?id=214|publisher=Maryland  Printmakers|accessdate=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Impact ==
New Grounds Print Workshop has had a significant influence on the promotion of nontoxic printmaking. Other workshops have modeled their facilities after New Grounds and printmakers from school teachers to university professors from around the world have studied nontoxic printmaking there.&lt;ref name=Artnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Kamerick|first=Megan|title=Albuquerque Art emerges from the shadows|newspaper=Art Business News|date=December 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ad Encyclopaedia-Britannica 05-1913.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], now out of print and out of copyright.]]

An '''out-of-print book''' is a book that is no longer being [[published]]. The term can apply to specific editions of more popular works, which may then go in and out of print repeatedly, or to the sole printed edition of a work, which is not picked up again by any future publishers for reprint. Most works that have ever been published are out of print at any given time, while certain highly popular books, such as the Bible, are always "in print". Less popular [[out of print]] books are often rare and may be difficult to acquire unless scanned or [[e-book|electronic copies]] of the books are available. With the advent of [[book scanning]], and [[print-on-demand]] technology, fewer and fewer works are now considered truly out of print.

A publisher creates a [[print run]] of a fixed number of copies of a new book. Print runs for most modern books number in the thousands. These books can be ordered in [[Bulk purchasing|bulk]] by [[bookseller]]s, and when all the bookseller's copies are sold, the bookseller has the option to order additional copies. If the initial print run sells out and demand still exists, the publisher will have more copies printed, if possible. When the book is no longer selling either at a rate fast enough to pay for the [[inventory]] costs, or to justify another print run, the publisher will cease to print additional copies, and may [[Remaindered book|remainder]] or [[Pulping|pulp]] the remaining unsold copies. When all of the books in a print run have been sold to booksellers, the book is said to be "out of print", meaning that a bookseller cannot get any further copies from the publisher. If a book sells out unexpectedly quickly, it may be considered out of print briefly when its initial print run is exhausted, but is usually soon reprinted.

Publishers may choose to list a book as "out of stock indefinitely", instead of declaring it out of print, as the publisher may have to give up copyright when declaring it out of print. Publishers will often let a book go out of stock for long periods, then reprint the book, usually with a new cover and formatting, to catch the presumably built up demand for the book. The author or their estate may have copyright reverted to them once the publisher has declared it out of print.

The longer a book has been out of print, the more difficult it may be to obtain a copy. If there is enough demand for an out-of-print book, and all [[copyright]] issues can be resolved, another publisher may republish the book in the same manner as the original publisher might have reprinted it. In some cases, an out-of-print book, even one that sold very poorly, may be republished if the author becomes popular again.

A reader who wishes to purchase an out-of-print book must either find a bookseller that still has a copy, wait for another print run, or find someone who will sell their own copy as a [[used book]]. The advent of the Internet has made this process much easier, as many websites sell used books offered by bookstores and individuals.

Some publishers intentionally limit the print run of some or all titles to fewer copies than the anticipated demand, in creating [[Special edition|limited edition]]s marketed to [[Book collecting|collectors]]. In these cases, there is an implicit or explicit promise to collectors that the book will not be reprinted, at least in the same form as originally published. For instance, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s book ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'', with a limited edition print run, is, according to [[BookFinder.com]], the most sought after out-of-print book in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://report.bookfinder.com/2006/ BookFinder.com releases Top 10 Out-of-Print Books of 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119033812/http://report.bookfinder.com/2006/ |date=2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookfinder.com/books/bookfinder_report_2011/ BookFinder.com releases Top 10 Out-of-Print Books of 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colonnina votiva Viale Lombardia, angolo Via Vittorio Veneto.JPG|thumb|One of the [[Plague crosses (Brugherio)|plague crosses in Brugherio, Italy]], which record where there were open air altars in 1576]]
[[File:Plague Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1198683.jpg|thumb|The Plague Cross at [[Ross-on-Wye]], [[Herefordshire]], England, close to the site of a mass burial of plague victims]][[File:Headless cross1.jpg|thumb|The Plague Stone or Vinegar Stone at Friargate, [[Derby]], England]][[File:PestkreuzSchalkenbach.jpg|thumb|180px|Commemorative ''Pestkreuz'' dated 1665, near [[Schalkenbach]], Germany]]
The term '''plague cross''' can refer to either a mark placed on a building occupied by victims of [[plague (disease)|plague]]; or a permanent structure erected, either to enable plague sufferers to trade while minimising the risk of [[Infectious disease|contagion]], or to commemorate past victims of the disease.  A wide variety of forms of plague cross existed in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, until plague largely disappeared by the eighteenth century.

==Plague notices==
At times of plague, it was common to mark the doors of victims of the disease with a large painted cross, either in red or black paint.  In later times, large printed crosses were often affixed to doors.   [[Daniel Defoe]] reported, at the time of the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] in 1665, that the [[Lord Mayor of London]], in his regulations, stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/376/pg376.txt Daniel Defoe, ''Journal of the Plague Year'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"That every house visited [by the disease] be marked with a red cross of a foot long in the middle of the door, evident to be seen, and with these usual printed words, that is to say, "Lord, have mercy upon us," to be set close over the same cross, there to continue until lawful opening of the same house."&lt;/blockquote&gt;  About the same time, [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote on 7 June 1665:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepys.info/1665/plague.html  Samuel Pepys, ''Diary'', June 7, 1665]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I did in Drury-lane see two or three houses marked with a red cross upon the doors, and "Lord have mercy upon us" writ there - which was a sad sight to me, being the first of that kind that to my remembrance I ever saw."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Market structures and "vinegar stones"==
In some locations, stone structures were set up outside established market areas, as temporary [[market cross]]es denoting places where town and country dwellers could trade with one another while supposedly minimising the risk of contagion.  For example, at [[Macclesfield]] in [[Cheshire]] in 1603 and 1646, Greenway cross was "used as a 'plague cross,' to which country people came to sell their provisions to the dwellers in the town."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DZExAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22plague+cross%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sde0T_TDJ6WI6QGwsfXjDw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBg Chetham Society, ''Remains, Historical &amp; Literary, Connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester'', Volume 97, 1876]&lt;/ref&gt;   

At [[York]], stone crosses were erected during an outbreak of plague in 1604, on main roads about one mile outside the city, to denote temporary locations where trading could take place.  There, each cross held a small pool of water into which money was placed and from which it could be removed in trading.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19030611&amp;id=9OISAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iP4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3494,2877451  Toledo Blade, June 11, 1903, ''Plague Cross''].  Accessed 19 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Derby plague of 1665|In Derby in 1665]], a headless cross or "vinegar stone" was erected, in which the water was replaced by [[vinegar]] as a disinfectant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derbyarboretum.co.uk/headless_cross.htm  The Headless Cross at Derby].  Accessed 19 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The "vinegar stone" at [[Wentworth, South Yorkshire|Wentworth]] in Yorkshire is supposed to have a similar origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1318227  "Vinegar stone" at Wentworth], ''Geograph.com''. Accessed 19 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], stone crosses or ''Pestkreuze'' were also set up in some locations to commemorate those who died as a result of the plague.  Memorial crosses to individual plague victims were also set up at churches, as at [[Trittenheim]].{{cn|date=May 2012}}

Accessed 19 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plague columns==
{{main|Plague column}}
Plague columns, also known as [[Marian and Holy Trinity columns|Marian or Holy Trinity columns]], are found throughout Europe, and frequently as thanksgiving for the ending of a plague. Examples include:

'''Roman art''' refers to the visual arts made in [[Ancient Rome]] and in the territories of the [[Roman Empire]].  Roman art includes [[Roman architecture|architecture]], [[painting]], [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]] and [[Roman mosaic|mosaic work]]. Luxury objects in [[metal-work]], [[engraved gem|gem engraving]], [[ivory carving]]s, and [[Roman glass|glass]] are sometimes considered in modern terms to be minor forms of Roman art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Toynbee |first=J. M. C. |date=December 1971 |title=Roman Art |journal=The Classical Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=439–442 |doi=10.1017/S0009840X00221331 |jstor=708631}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this would not necessarily have been the case for contemporaries.  Sculpture was perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, but figure painting was also very highly regarded. The two forms have had very contrasting rates of survival, with a very large body of sculpture surviving from about the 1st century BC onward, though very little from before, but very little painting at all remains, and probably nothing that a contemporary would have considered to be of the highest quality.

[[Ancient Roman pottery]] was not a luxury product, but a vast production of "fine wares" in ''[[terra sigillata]]'' were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. [[Roman coins]] were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers.

==Introduction==
{{Ancient art history}}
{{double image|right|Menade.jpg|170|Giovane-seduto.JPG|150|'''Left image:''' A Roman fresco from [[Pompeii]] showing a [[Maenad]] in [[History of silk|silk dress]], first century AD&lt;br/&gt;'''Right image:''' A fresco of a young man from the Villa di Arianna, [[Stabiae]], 1st century AD.}}
While the traditional view of the ancient Roman artists is that they often borrowed from, and copied Greek precedents (much of the Greek sculptures known today are in the form of Roman marble copies), more recent analysis has indicated that Roman art is a highly creative [[pastiche]] relying heavily on Greek models but also encompassing [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]], native Italic, and even [[Egyptian art|Egyptian]] visual culture. Stylistic [[eclecticism]] and practical application are the hallmarks of much Roman art.

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], Ancient Rome’s most important historian concerning the arts, recorded that nearly all the forms of art&amp;nbsp;– sculpture, landscape, portrait painting, even genre painting&amp;nbsp;– were advanced in Greek times, and in some cases, more advanced than in Rome.  Though very little remains of Greek wall art and portraiture, certainly Greek sculpture and vase painting bears this out. These forms were not likely surpassed by Roman artists in fineness of design or execution.  As another example of the lost "Golden Age", he singled out [[Peiraikos]], "whose artistry is surpassed by only a very few&amp;nbsp;... He painted barbershops and shoemakers’ stalls, donkeys, vegetables, and such, and for that reason came to be called the 'painter of vulgar subjects'; yet these works are altogether delightful, and they were sold at higher prices than the greatest [[paintings]] of many other artists.”&lt;ref&gt;Sybille Ebert-Schifferer, ''Still Life: A History'', Harry N. Abrams, New York, 1998, p. 15, {{ISBN|0-8109-4190-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "vulgar" is used here in its original meaning, which means "common".

The Greek antecedents of Roman art were legendary. In the mid-5th century BC, the most famous Greek artists were [[Polygnotos]], noted for his wall murals, and [[Apollodorus (painter)|Apollodoros]], the originator of [[chiaroscuro]]. The development of realistic technique is credited to [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], who according to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] legend, are said to have once competed in a bravura display of their talents, history’s earliest descriptions of [[trompe l’oeil]] painting.&lt;ref&gt;Ebert-Schifferer, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In sculpture, [[Skopas]], [[Praxiteles]], [[Phidias]], and [[Lysippos]] were the foremost sculptors. It appears that Roman artists had much Ancient Greek art to copy from, as trade in art was brisk throughout the empire, and much of the Greek artistic heritage found its way into Roman art through books and teaching. Ancient Greek treatises on the arts are known to have existed in Roman times, though are now lost.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 252"&gt;Piper, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Many Roman artists came from Greek colonies and provinces...&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 158" /&gt;

[[File:Roman sacrifice Louvre Ma992.jpg|thumb|left| Preparation of an [[animal sacrifice]]; marble, fragment of an architectural [[relief]], first quarter of the 2nd century CE; from Rome, Italy]]
The high number of Roman copies of Greek art also speaks of the esteem Roman artists had for Greek art, and perhaps of its rarer and higher quality.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 158"&gt;Janson, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the art forms and methods used by the Romans&amp;nbsp;– such as high and low relief, free-standing sculpture, bronze casting, vase art, [[mosaic]], [[cameo (carving)|cameo]], coin art, fine jewelry and metalwork, funerary sculpture, perspective drawing, [[caricature]], genre and [[portrait painting]], [[landscape painting]], architectural sculpture, and [[trompe l’oeil]] painting&amp;nbsp;– all were developed or refined by Ancient Greek artists.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 248–253&lt;/ref&gt; One exception is the Roman bust, which did not include the shoulders. The traditional head-and-shoulders bust may have been an Etruscan or early Roman form.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 255"&gt;Piper, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually every artistic technique and method used by [[Renaissance]] artists 1,900 years later, had been demonstrated by Ancient Greek artists, with the notable exceptions of oil colors and mathematically accurate perspective.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 253"&gt;Piper, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Where Greek artists were highly revered in their society, most Roman artists were anonymous and considered tradesmen. There is no recording, as in Ancient Greece, of the great masters of Roman art, and practically no signed works. Where Greeks worshiped the aesthetic qualities of great art, and wrote extensively on artistic theory, Roman art was more decorative and indicative of status and wealth, and apparently not the subject of scholars or philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing in part to the fact that the Roman cities were far larger than the Greek city-states in power and population, and generally less provincial, art in Ancient Rome took on a wider, and sometimes more utilitarian, purpose.  Roman culture assimilated many cultures and was for the most part tolerant of the ways of conquered peoples.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 158"/&gt; Roman art was commissioned, displayed, and owned in far greater quantities, and adapted to more uses than in Greek times.  Wealthy Romans were more materialistic; they decorated their walls with art, their home with decorative objects, and themselves with fine jewelry.

In the Christian era of the late Empire, from 350 to 500 CE, wall painting, [[Roman mosaic|mosaic ceiling and floor work]], and funerary sculpture thrived, while full-sized sculpture in the round and panel painting died out, most likely for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 261"&gt;Piper, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium (renamed Constantinople), Roman art incorporated Eastern influences to produce the Byzantine style of the late empire.  When Rome was sacked in the 5th century, artisans moved to and found work in the Eastern capital. The Church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]] employed nearly 10,000 workmen and artisans, in a final burst of Roman art under [[Emperor Justinian]] (527–565 CE), who also ordered the creation of the famous mosaics of [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in the city of [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
{{Main|Pompeian Styles|Roman Wall Painting (200 BC-79 AD)}}
[[File:Pompeii Painter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pompeii|Pompeian]] painter with painted statue and framed painting, [[Pompeii]]]]
[[File:Affresco romano - eracle ed onfale - area vesuviana.JPG|thumb|[[Heracles]] and [[Omphale]], Roman fresco [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth Style]] (45-79 AD), [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]], Italy]]
Of the vast body of Roman painting we now have only a very few pockets of survivals, with many documented types not surviving at all, or doing so only from the very end of the period. The best known and most important pocket is the wall paintings from [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and other sites nearby, which show how residents of a wealthy seaside resort decorated their walls in the century or so before the fatal eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 CE. A [[Pompeian Styles|succession of dated styles]] have been defined and analysed by modern art historians beginning with [[August Mau]], showing increasing elaboration and sophistication.

Starting in the 3rd century CE and finishing by about 400 we have a large body of paintings from the [[Catacombs of Rome]], by no means all Christian, showing the later continuation of the domestic decorative tradition in a version adapted - probably not greatly adapted - for use in burial chambers, in what was probably a rather humbler social milieu than the largest houses in Pompeii. Much of [[Nero]]'s palace in Rome, the [[Domus Aurea]], survived as grottos and gives us examples which we can be sure represent the very finest quality of wall-painting in its style, and which may well have represented significant innovation in style.  There are a number of other parts of painted rooms surviving from Rome and elsewhere, which somewhat help to fill in the gaps of our knowledge of wall-painting.  From [[Roman Egypt]] there are a large number of what are known as [[Fayum mummy portraits]], bust portraits on wood added to the outside of [[mummy|mummies]] by a Romanized middle class; despite their very distinct local character they are probably broadly representative of Roman style in painted portraits, which are otherwise entirely lost.

Nothing remains of the Greek paintings imported to Rome during the 4th and 5th centuries, or of the painting on wood done in Italy during that period.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 252"/&gt; In sum, the range of samples is confined to only about 200 years out of the about 900 years of Roman history,&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 190"&gt;Janson, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; and of provincial and decorative painting.  Most of this wall painting was done using the secco (“dry”) method, but some [[fresco]] paintings also existed in Roman times.  There is [[Roman mosaic|evidence from mosaics]] and a few inscriptions that some Roman paintings were adaptations or copies of earlier Greek works.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 190"/&gt; However, adding to the confusion is the fact that inscriptions may be recording the names of immigrant Greek artists from Roman times, not from Ancient Greek originals that were copied.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 253"/&gt;  The Romans entirely lacked a tradition of figurative vase-painting comparable to that of the Ancient Greeks, which the Etruscans had emulated.

===Variety of subjects===
[[File:Zeffiro-e-clori---pompeii.jpg|thumb|250px|upright=1.25|left|''The Wedding of [[Zephyrus]] and [[Chloris]]'' (54–68 AD, [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth Style]]) within painted architectural panels from the Casa del Naviglio]]
Roman painting provides a wide variety of themes: animals, still life, scenes from everyday life, portraits, and some mythological subjects. During the Hellenistic period, it evoked the pleasures of the countryside and represented scenes of shepherds, herds, rustic temples, rural mountainous landscapes and country houses.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 253"/&gt; Erotic scenes are also relatively common. In the late empire, after 200AD, early Christian themes mixed with pagan imagery survive on catacomb walls.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 260"&gt;Piper, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape and vistas===
[[File:Pompejanischer Maler um 10 20 001.jpg|thumb|[[Boscotrecase]], [[Pompeii]]. Third style]]
The main innovation of Roman painting compared to Greek art was the development of landscapes, in particular incorporating techniques of perspective, though true mathematical perspective developed 1,500 years later. Surface textures, shading, and coloration are well applied but scale and spatial depth was still not rendered accurately. Some landscapes were pure scenes of nature, particularly gardens with flowers and trees, while others were architectural vistas depicting urban buildings. Other landscapes show episodes from mythology, the most famous demonstrating scenes from the ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional view, the art of the ancient East would have known landscape painting only as the backdrop to civil or military narrative scenes.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Ernst Gombrich]].&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, defended by [[Franz Wickhoff]], is debatable. It is possible to see evidence of Greek knowledge of landscape portrayal in Plato's ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''  (107b–108b): &lt;blockquote&gt;... and if we look at the portraiture of divine and of human bodies as executed by painters, in respect of the ease or difficulty with which they succeed in imitating their subjects in the opinion of onlookers, we shall notice in the first place that as regards the earth and mountains and rivers and woods and the whole of heaven, with the things that exist and move therein, we are content if a man is able to represent them with even a small degree of likeness&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''  (107b–108b), trans W.R.M. Lamb 1925. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DCriti.|Online at the Perseus Project] accessed 27 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Still life===
Roman [[still life]] subjects are often placed in illusionist niches or shelves and depict a variety of everyday objects including fruit, live and dead animals, seafood, and shells. Examples of the theme of the glass jar filled with water were skillfully painted and later served as models for the same subject often painted during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portraits===
{{further|Roman portraiture}}
[[File:Portrait of family of Septimius Severus - Altes Museum - Berlin - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Severan Tondo]], a panel painting of the imperial family, c. 200 AD; [[Antikensammlung Berlin|Antikensammlung, Berlin]]]]
[[File:Fayum-11.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fayum mummy portrait]] of a woman from [[Roman Egypt]] with a ringlet hairstyle. [[Royal Museum of Scotland]].]]

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, "The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out&amp;nbsp;... Indolence has destroyed the arts."&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, ''The Portrait in the Renaissance'',  Bollingen Foundation, New York, 1966, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XXXV:2 trans H. Rackham 1952.  Loeb Classical Library&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece and Rome, wall painting was not considered as high art. The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was [[panel painting]], i.e. [[tempera]] or [[encaustic painting]] on wooden panels. Unfortunately, since wood is a perishable material, only a very few examples of such paintings have survived, namely the [[Severan Tondo]] from c. 200 AD, a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office, and the well-known [[Fayum mummy portraits]], all from Roman Egypt, and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality. The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face, from which almost all have now been detached. They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. The background is always monochrome, sometimes with decorative elements.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from Greco-Roman traditions than Egyptian ones. They are remarkably realistic, though variable in artistic quality, and may indicate that similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive. A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived, as have coin portraits, some of which are considered very realistic as well.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold glass===

Accessed 2 October 2016, p. 7: "''Other important contributions to scholarship included the publication of an extensive summary of gold glass scholarship under the entry ‘Fonds de coupes’ in Fernand Cabrol and Henri Leclercq’s comprehensive Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie in 1923. Leclercq updated Vopel’s catalogue, recording 512 gold glasses considered to be genuine, and developed a typological series consisting of eleven iconographic subjects: biblical subjects; Christ and the saints; various legends; inscriptions; pagan deities; secular subjects; male portraits; female portraits; portraits of couples and families; animals; and Jewish symbols. In a 1926 article devoted to the brushed technique gold glass known as the Brescia medallion (Pl. 1), Fernand de Mély challenged the deeply ingrained opinion of Garrucci and Vopel that all examples of brushed technique gold glass were in fact forgeries. The following year, de Mély’s hypothesis was supported and further elaborated upon in two articles by different scholars. A case for the Brescia medallion’s authenticity was argued for, not on the basis of its iconographic and orthographic similarity with pieces from Rome (a key reason for Garrucci’s dismissal), but instead for its close similarity to the Fayoum mummy portraits from Egypt. Indeed, this comparison was given further credence by Walter Crum’s assertion that the Greek inscription on the medallion was written in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. De Mély noted that the medallion and its inscription had been reported as early as 1725, far too early for the idiosyncrasies of Graeco-Egyptian word endings to have been understood by forgers.''"

"''Comparing the iconography of the Brescia medallion with other more closely dated objects from Egypt, Hayford Peirce then proposed that brushed technique medallions were produced in the early 3rd century, whilst de Mély himself advocated a more general 3rd-century date. With the authenticity of the medallion more firmly established, Joseph Breck was prepared to propose a late 3rd to early 4th century date for all of the brushed technique cobalt blue-backed portrait medallions, some of which also had Greek inscriptions in the Alexandrian dialect. Although considered genuine by the majority of scholars by this point, the unequivocal authenticity of these glasses was not fully established until 1941 when Gerhart Ladner discovered and published a photograph of one such medallion still in situ, where it remains to this day, impressed into the plaster sealing in an individual loculus in the Catacomb of Panfilo in Rome (Pl. 2). Shortly after in 1942, Morey used the phrase ‘brushed technique’ to categorize this gold glass type, the iconography being produced through a series of small incisions undertaken with a gem cutter’s precision and lending themselves to a chiaroscuro-like effect similar to that of a fine steel engraving simulating brush strokes.''"&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Gold glass, or gold sandwich glass, was a technique for fixing a layer of [[gold leaf]] with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in [[Hellenistic glass]] and revived in the 3rd century AD.  There are a very few large designs, including a very fine group of portraits from the 3rd century with added paint, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] by pressing them into the mortar. They predominantly date from the 4th and 5th centuries. Most are Christian, though there are many pagan and a few Jewish examples. It is likely that they were originally given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year.  Their [[iconography]] has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25-26,&lt;/ref&gt;  Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture.  As time went on there was an increase in the depiction of saints.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  The same technique began to be used for gold [[tesserae]] for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.

The earlier group are "among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity",&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, "The Catacombs" at illustration 7.7&lt;/ref&gt; and represent the best surviving indications of what high quality Roman portraiture could achieve in paint. The Gennadios medallion in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Late Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local [[dialect]] features.  He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, no. 264, entry by J.D.B.; see also no. 265; [http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170006564 Medallion with a Portrait of Gennadios], Metropolitan Museum of Art, with better image.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an [[Early Medieval]] [[crux gemmata]] in [[Brescia]], in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and [[Ostrogoths|Gothic]] queen [[Galla Placida]] and her children;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 338-340; Beckwith, 25&lt;/ref&gt; in fact the knot in the central figure's dress may mark a devotee of [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, 611&lt;/ref&gt;  This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on the medallion is written in the [[Greeks in Egypt|Alexandrian dialect of Greek]] and hence most likely depicts a family from [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jás Elsner (2007).

===Triumphal paintings===
[[File:Roman fresco from Boscoreale, 43-30 BCE, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Roman fresco from the [[Villa Boscoreale]], 43–30 BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Casti Amanti - Banquet.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman fresco with a banquet scene from the Casa dei Casti Amanti, [[Pompeii]]]]
From the 3rd century BC, a specific genre known as ''Triumphal Paintings'' appeared, as indicated by Pliny (XXXV, 22).&lt;ref name="Pliny"&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137&amp;query=head%3D%232431&amp;chunk=book online at the Perseus Project]&lt;/ref&gt; These were paintings which showed triumphal entries after military victories, represented episodes from the war, and conquered regions and cities. Summary maps were drawn to highlight key points of the campaign.
[[Josephus]] describes the painting executed on the occasion of [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]]'s [[Destruction of Jerusalem|sack of Jerusalem]]:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;There was also wrought gold and ivory fastened about them all; and many resemblances of the war, and those in several ways, and variety of contrivances, affording a most lively portraiture of itself. For there was to be seen a happy country laid waste, and entire squadrons of enemies slain; while some of them ran away, and some were carried into captivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown and ruined by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the walls of most populous cities upon the tops of hills seized on, and an army pouring itself within the walls; as also every place full of slaughter, and supplications of the enemies, when they were no longer able to lift up their hands in way of opposition. Fire also sent upon temples was here represented, and houses overthrown, and falling upon their owners: rivers also, after they came out of a large and melancholy desert, ran down, not into a land cultivated, nor as drink for men, or for cattle, but through a land still on fire upon every side; for the Jews related that such a thing they had undergone during this war. Now the workmanship of these representations was so magnificent and lively in the construction of the things, that it exhibited what had been done to such as did not see it, as if they had been there really present. On the top of every one of these pageants was placed the commander of the city that was taken, and the manner wherein he was taken.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''The Jewish Wars'' VII, 143-152 (Ch 6 Para 5). Trans. William Whiston [http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-7.htm Online] accessed 27 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These paintings have disappeared, but they likely influenced the composition of the historical reliefs carved on military [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], the [[Arch of Titus]], and [[Trajan's Column]].  This evidence underscores the significance of landscape painting, which sometimes tended towards being perspective plans.

[[Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli|Ranuccio]] also describes the oldest painting to be found in Rome, in a tomb on the [[Esquiline Hill]]:

{{quote|It describes a historical scene, on a clear background, painted in four superimposed sections.  Several people are identified, such Marcus Fannius and Marcus Fabius. These are larger than the other figures&amp;nbsp;... In the second zone, to the left, is a city encircled with [[Crenellation|crenellated]] walls, in front of which is a large warrior equipped with an oval buckler and a feathered helmet; near him is a man in a short tunic, armed with a spear...Around these two are smaller soldiers in short tunics, armed with spears...In the lower zone a battle is taking place, where a warrior with oval buckler and a feathered helmet is shown larger than the others, whose weapons allow to assume that these are probably Samnites.}}

This episode is difficult to pinpoint. One of Ranuccio's hypotheses is that it refers to a victory of the consul [[Fabius Maximus Rullianus]] during the second war against [[Samnites]] in 326 BC. The presentation of the figures with sizes proportional to their importance is typically Roman, and finds itself in plebeian reliefs. This painting is in the infancy of triumphal painting, and would have been accomplished by the beginning of the 3rd century BC to decorate the tomb.

==Sculpture==
{{main|Roman sculpture|Roman portraiture}}
[[File:26 colonna traiana da estt 05.jpg|thumb|Section of [[Trajan's Column]], CE 113, with scenes from the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]]]
Early Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]], themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in [[terracotta]], usually lying on top of a [[sarcophagus]] lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding [[Roman Republic]] began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] far east, official and [[Roman patrician|patrician]] sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 58–63; Henig, 66-69&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2nd century BC, "most of the sculptors working in Rome" were Greek,&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 24&lt;/ref&gt; often enslaved in conquests such as that of [[Corinth]] (146 BC), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66–69; Strong, 36–39, 48; At the trial of [[Verres]], former governor of [[Sicily]], [[Cicero]]'s prosecution details his depredations of art collections at great length.&lt;/ref&gt;

A native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments of prosperous middle-class Romans, which very often featured portrait busts, and [[Roman portraiture|portraiture]] is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]] or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous bronze head supposedly of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of [[Italy|Italic]] style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen in the coins of the consuls, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the [[basilica]]s of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even [[Londinium]] had a near-colossal statue of [[Nero]], though far smaller than the 30 metre high [[Colossus of Nero]] in Rome, now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66–71&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a successful [[freedman]] (c. 50-20 BC) has a [[frieze]] that is an unusually large example of the "plebeian" style.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66; Strong, 125&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial portraiture was initially Hellenized and highly idealized, as in the [[Blacas Cameo]] and other portraits of [[Augustus]].
[[File:Luk Konstantyna 6DSCF0032.JPG|thumb|[[Arch of Constantine]], 315: [[Hadrian]] lion-hunting (left) and sacrificing (right), above a section of the Constantinian frieze, showing the contrast of styles.]]

The Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in [[relief]], culminating in the great [[Roman triumphal column]]s with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating [[Trajan's Column|Trajan]] (113 CE) and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] (by 193) survive in Rome, where the [[Ara Pacis]] ("Altar of Peace", 13 BC) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined, and the [[Sperlonga sculptures]] it at its most baroque.  Some late Roman public sculptures developed a massive, simplified style that sometimes anticipates Soviet [[socialist realism]].  Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the [[Arch of Constantine]] and the base of the [[Column of Antoninus Pius]] (161),&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 73–82;Strong, 48–52, 80–83, 108–117, 128–132, 141–159, 177–182, 197–211&lt;/ref&gt; [[Campana relief]]s were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus.

All forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver [[Warren Cup]], glass [[Lycurgus Cup]], and large cameos like the [[Gemma Augustea]], [[Gonzaga Cameo]] and the "[[Great Cameo of France]]".&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 6; Strong, 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;  For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of [[Ancient Roman pottery|pottery vessels]] and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving through a late 2nd century "baroque" phase,&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 171–176, 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace.  The contrast is famously illustrated in the [[Arch of Constantine]] of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with [[roundel]]s in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the ''[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|Four Tetrarchs]]'' (c. 305) from the new capital of [[Constantinople]], now in [[Venice]]. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] found in both monuments the same "stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity&amp;nbsp;– in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 9 (both quotes), more generally his Ch 1; Strong, 250–257, 264–266, 272–280&lt;/ref&gt;

This revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which [[Christianity]] was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors, as in the famous fragments of a colossal [[acrolithic]] [[Colossus of Constantine|statue of Constantine]], and the 4th or 5th century [[Colossus of Barletta]].  However rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the [[consular diptych]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 287–291, 305–308, 315–318; Henig, 234–240&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Roman sculpture is divided into five categories: portraiture, historical relief, funerary reliefs, sarcophagi, and copies of ancient Greek works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gazda |first=Elaine K. |year=1995 |month= |title=Roman Sculpture and the Ethos of Emulation: Reconsidering Repetition |journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |volume=97 |issue=Greece in Rome: Influence, Integration, Resistance |pages=121–156 |id=  |accessdate= |quote="According to traditional art-historical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], Roman sculpture is divided into a number of distinct categories--portraiture, historical relief, funerary reliefs, sarcophagi, and copies."|doi=10.2307/311303 |publisher=Department of the Classics, Harvard University |jstor=311303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the belief of early archaeologists, many of these sculptures were large [[polychrome]] [[terra-cotta]] images, such as the Apollo of Veii (Villa Givlia, Rome), but the painted surface of many of them has worn away with time.

===Narrative reliefs===
While Greek sculptors traditionally illustrated military exploits through the use of mythological allegory, the Romans used a more documentary style. Roman reliefs of battle scenes, like those on the [[Column of Trajan]], were created for the glorification of Roman might, but also provide first-hand representation of military costumes and military equipment. Trajan's column records the various [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian wars]] conducted by [[Trajan]] in what is modern day [[Romania]]. It is the foremost example of Roman historical relief and one of the great artistic treasures of the ancient world. This unprecedented achievement, over 650 foot of spiraling length, presents not just realistically rendered individuals (over 2,500 of them), but landscapes, animals, ships, and other elements in a continuous visual history&amp;nbsp;– in effect an ancient precursor of a documentary movie. It survived destruction when it was adapted as a base for Christian sculpture.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 256"&gt;Piper, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; During the Christian era after 300 AD, the decoration of door panels and sarcophagi continued but full-sized sculpture died out and did not appear to be an important element in early churches.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 261"/&gt;

==Minor arts==
[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|The [[Blacas Cameo]] of [[Augustus]], from his last years or soon after]]
===Pottery and terracottas===
{{main|Ancient Roman pottery|Campana relief}}
The Romans inherited a tradition of art in a wide range of the so-called "minor arts" or [[decorative art]]. Most of these flourished most impressively at the luxury level, but large numbers of [[terracotta]] figurines, both religious and secular, continued to be produced cheaply, as well as some larger [[Campana relief]]s in terracotta.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 191-199&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman art did not use vase-painting in the way of the ancient Greeks, but vessels in [[Ancient Roman pottery]] were often stylishly decorated in moulded relief.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 179-187&lt;/ref&gt;  Producers of the millions of small [[oil lamp]]s sold seem to have relied on attractive decoration to beat competitors and every subject of Roman art except landscape and portraiture is found on them in miniature.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 200-204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass===
{{main|Roman glass}}
Luxury arts included fancy Roman glass in a great range of techniques, many smaller types of which were probably affordable to a good proportion of the Roman public. This was certainly not the case for the most extravagant types of glass, such as the [[cage cup]]s or ''diatreta'', of which the [[Lycurgus Cup]] in the [[British Museum]] is a near-unique figurative example in glass that changes colour when seen with light passing through it. The Augustan [[Portland Vase]] is the masterpiece of Roman [[cameo glass]],&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 215-218&lt;/ref&gt; and imitated the style of the large [[engraved gem]]s ([[Blacas Cameo]], [[Gemma Augustea]], [[Great Cameo of France]]) and other [[hardstone carving]]s that were also most popular around this time.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 152-158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mosaic===
{{main|Roman mosaic}}
Roman mosaic was a minor art, though often on a very large scale, until the very end of the period, when late-4th-century Christians began to use it for large religious images on walls in their new large churches; in earlier Roman art mosaic was mainly used for floors, curved ceilings, and inside and outside walls that were going to get wet.  The famous copy of a Hellenistic painting in the ''[[Alexander Mosaic]]'' in Naples was originally placed in a floor in [[Pompeii]]; this is much higher quality work than most Roman mosaic, though very fine panels, often of [[still life]] subjects in small or [[micromosaic]] [[tesserae]] have also survived.  The Romans distinguished between normal ''[[opus tessellatum]]'' with ''tesserae'' mostly over 4&amp;nbsp;mm across, which was laid down on site, and finer ''[[opus vermiculatum]]'' for small panels, which is thought to have been produced offsite in a workshop, and brought to the site as a finished panel.  The latter was a Hellenistic genre which is found in Italy between about 100 BC and 100 AD.  Most signed mosaics have Greek names, suggesting the artists remained mostly Greek, though probably often slaves trained up in workshops.  The late 2nd century BC [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina]] is a very large example of the popular genre of [[Nilotic landscape]], while the 4th century [[Gladiator Mosaic]] in Rome shows several large figures in combat.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 116-138&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orpheus mosaic]]s, often very large, were another favourite subject for villas, with several ferocious animals tamed by [[Orpheus]]'s playing music. In the transition to Byzantine art, hunting scenes tended to take over large animal scenes.

===Metalwork===
Metalwork was highly developed, and clearly an essential part of the homes of the rich, who dined off silver, while often drinking from glass, and had elaborate cast fittings on their furniture, jewellery, and small figurines.  A number of important [[hoard]]s found in the last 200 years, mostly from the more violent edges of the late empire, have given us a much clearer idea of Roman silver plate.  The [[Mildenhall Treasure]] and [[Hoxne Hoard]] are both from [[East Anglia]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 140-150; jewellery, 158-160&lt;/ref&gt;  There are few survivals of upmarket [[ancient Roman furniture]], but these show refined and elegant design and execution.

===Coins and medals===
[[File:HADRIANUS RIC II 938-789065.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hadrian]], with "RESTITVTORI ACHAIAE" on the reverse, celebrating his spending in [[Achaia (Roman province)|Achaia]] (Greece), and showing the quality of ordinary bronze coins that were used by the mass population, hence the wear on higher areas.]]
Few [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] reach the artistic peaks of the best Greek coins, but they survive in vast numbers and their iconography and inscriptions form a crucial source for the study of Roman history, and the development of imperial iconography, as well as containing many fine examples of portraiture. They penetrated to the rural population of the whole Empire and beyond, with barbarians on the fringes of the Empire making their own copies.  In the Empire medallions in precious metals began to be produced in small editions as imperial gifts, which are similar to coins, though larger and usually finer in execution.  Images in coins initially followed Greek styles, with gods and symbols, but in the death throes of the Republic first [[Pompey]] and then [[Julius Caesar]] appeared on coins, and portraits of the emperor or members of his family became standard on imperial coinage.  The inscriptions were used for propaganda, and in the later Empire the army joined the emperor as the beneficiary.

It was in the area of architecture that Roman art produced its greatest innovations. Because the Roman Empire extended over so great of an area and included so many urbanized areas, Roman engineers developed methods for city building on a grand scale, including the use of [[concrete]].  Massive buildings like the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] and the [[Colosseum]] could never have been constructed with previous materials and methods.  Though concrete had been invented a thousand years earlier in the Near East, the Romans extended its use from fortifications to their most impressive buildings and monuments, capitalizing on the material’s strength and low cost.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 160"&gt;Janson, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete core was covered with a plaster, brick, stone, or marble veneer, and decorative polychrome and gold-gilded sculpture was often added to produce a dazzling effect of power and wealth.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 160"/&gt;

Because of these methods, Roman architecture is legendary for the durability of its construction; with many buildings still standing, and some still in use, mostly buildings converted to churches during the Christian era.  Many ruins, however, have been stripped of their marble veneer and are left with their concrete core exposed, thus appearing somewhat reduced in size and grandeur from their original appearance, such as with the Basilica of Constantine.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 165"&gt;Janson, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Republican era, Roman architecture combined Greek and Etruscan elements, and produced innovations such as the round temple and the curved arch.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman power grew in the early empire, the first emperors inaugurated wholesale leveling of slums to build grand palaces on the Palatine Hill and nearby areas, which required advances in engineering methods and large scale design.  Roman buildings were then built in the commercial, political, and social grouping known as a forum, that of Julius Caesar being the first and several added later, with the Forum Romanum being the most famous.  The greatest arena in the Roman world, the [[Colosseum]], was completed around 80 AD at the far end of that forum. It held over 50,000 spectators, had retractable fabric coverings for shade, and could stage massive spectacles including huge gladiatorial contests and mock naval battles. This masterpiece of Roman architecture epitomizes Roman engineering efficiency and incorporates all three architectural orders&amp;nbsp;– Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 162"&gt;Janson, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Less celebrated but just as important if not more so for most Roman citizens, was the five-story ''insula'' or city block, the Roman equivalent of an apartment building, which housed tens of thousands of Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the reign of Trajan (98–117 AD.) and Hadrian (117–138 AD) that the Roman Empire reached its greatest extent and that Rome itself was at the peak of its artistic glory&amp;nbsp;– achieved through massive building programs of monuments, meeting houses, gardens, aqueducts, baths, palaces, pavilions, sarcophagi, and temples.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 256"/&gt; The Roman use of the [[arch]], the use of [[concrete]] building methods, the use of the [[dome]] all permitted construction of vaulted ceilings and enabled the building of these public spaces and complexes, including the palaces, [[public baths]] and [[basilicas]] of the "Golden Age" of the empire. Outstanding examples of dome construction include the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Baths of Caracalla]]. The Pantheon (dedicated to all the planetary gods) is the best preserved temple of ancient times with an intact ceiling featuring an open "eye" in the center. The height of the ceiling exactly equals the interior diameter of the building, creating an enclosure that could contain giant sphere.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 165"/&gt; These grand buildings later served as inspirational models for architects of the Italian Renaissance, such as [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. By the age of Constantine (306-337 AD), the last great building programs in Rome took place, including the erection of the [[Arch of Constantine]] built near the [[Colosseum]], which recycled some stone work from the forum nearby, to produce an eclectic mix of styles.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 260"/&gt;

[[Roman aqueducts]], also based on the arch, were commonplace in the empire and essential transporters of water to large urban areas. Their standing masonry remains are especially impressive, such as the [[Pont du Gard]] (featuring three tiers of arches) and the [[aqueduct of Segovia]], serving as mute testimony to their quality of their design and construction.&lt;ref name="Janson, p. 162"/&gt;

==Plot==
{{Long plot|film|date=September 2017}}
In 1964 [[Acapulco]], Frank Forbes, Levar Mathis, and Nadine Henly are anxiously pushing their employer, Howard Hughes, to phone in to a press conference.

In 1958 [[Los Angeles]], Frank picks up Marla Mabrey, a devout [[Baptists|Baptist]] beauty queen, alongside her strict mother Lucy. Marla is under contract with Hughes' [[RKO Pictures]], receiving $400 a week (${{Inflation|US|400|1958|r=-1|fmt=c}} today) and living in a beautiful home. Frank becomes Marla's main driver, chauffeuring her to the singing and dancing classes set up for Hughes' current retinue of 26 contract starlets.

Marla patiently waits for her screen test for ''Stella Starlight'', but delays frustrate Marla and her mother, compounded by the fact that they have yet to meet Hughes. Marla befriends fellow RKO starlet Mamie. Levar regularly reminds Frank that the starlets cannot have boyfriends, and the chauffeurs must avoid any friendships with the girls. Frank is also devoutly religious, though he and his fiancée Sarah have secretly had sex, which they believe makes them effectively married already. When Lucy decides that they should return to [[Virginia]], Marla opts to continue waiting for her screen test.

With her mother gone, Frank and Marla develop a deep connection. He lets her drive the car, and even tells her the full detail of his relationship with Sarah when Marla confides her virginity. Marla eventually shares that her worries over conforming to the Hollywood "rules" of being a great singer, dancer, or having a big bosom. Frank tells her that the rules do not apply to her. Marla finally meets Hughes in a private bungalow, where she turns down his offer of a drink and talks frankly about her aspirations to act. Nadine, Hughes' executive secretary, sets up Marla's screen test. Frank also meets Hughes for the first time, during which Hughes takes an immediate liking to him and brings Frank into his inner circle of staff.

Hughes becomes very reclusive, worried that the minority shareholders at [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA), who openly disagree with how he runs the company, will try to have him committed so that they can control the company. His right-hand-man [[Noah Dietrich]] upsets Hughes by suggesting he see a psychiatrist, and Hughes gets legal advice that he should get married so his "wife" can refuse to sign any commitment papers. Marla's screen test is a meaningless façade. Later, she sings Frank a song she wrote for him, leading to them sharing a passionate kiss. They quickly stop themselves; Marla tells him that she feels like an adulterer, but Frank says that he will break up with Sarah.

While Frank is gone, Marla is called to another late night meeting with Hughes. She is very upset about Frank and consumes alcohol for the first time. When Hughes finally joins her, a very drunk Marla tells him how special he is. She performs her song for Hughes, who becomes emotional and suddenly proposes marriage, resulting in them having sex. The next day, Frank is devastated when she reveals that she is engaged to someone (she doesn't say who) and rudely dismisses him.

Within days, Hughes marries [[Jean Peters]] to protect him from being committed, fires Noah and hires Robert Maheu to be the CEO of his companies. Maheu warns him that the TWA shareholders could force Hughes to physically appear in court on charges of mismanaging TWA.

Marla is upset with herself for believing Hughes' proposal and having sex with him. When she later informs Hughes that she is pregnant with his child, he reacts by suggesting she is lying and looking for money. She is again very dismissive and rude to Frank, then returns to Virginia.

Hughes takes his entourage out of the U.S., becoming more and more reclusive.  When the U.S. courts decide in favor of the minority TWA shareholders, with a judgement for $645 million, Hughes has to sell his most cherished asset, his father's original [[Hughes Tool Company]], to pay off the debt.

The story then jumps forward to 1964, with Frank, Levar, and Nadine waiting for Hughes to make his call to the U.S. press. It concerns a book written by Miskin, Mamie's ex-boyfriend, who claims to have interviewed Hughes in person and that Hughes has complete dementia, which could cost him the rest of his empire. Marla suddenly arrives with Matt, her and Hughes' five-year-old, with news that Mamie is ready to confirm in court that Miskin never met Hughes &amp;ndash; so Hughes does not need to take the call.  When he learns that Matt is there, he finds the strength to make the phone call. Hughes talks in great detail about many current and past events &amp;ndash; proving he is lucid &amp;ndash; then confirms that he has never met Miskin.

Frank immediately quits his job, goes after Marla and Matt, and the three leave together to live as a family in Los Angeles.

Todd McCarthy of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' wrote "At once an amusingly eccentric take on a billionaire fixated with controlling other people's lives and a romance about a young couple constipated by the conservative religious and social sexual mores of the 1950s, this is a fitfully funny quasi-farce that takes off promisingly, loses its way mid-flight and comes in for a bumpy but safe landing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/rules-dont-apply-review-946080|title='Rules Don't Apply': Film Review – AFI Fest|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|date=November 11, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Variety'' critic Peter Debruge wrote "Warren Beatty certainly took his time in getting this sprawling [[Spruce Goose]] of a movie off the ground, as the romance distracts from the Howard Hughes portrait, or vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/rules-dont-apply-review-warren-beatty-1201914442/|title=AFI Film Review: 'Rules Don't Apply'|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=November 11, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian''{{'s}} Jordan Hoffman awarded the film 3/5 stars, writing, "The legend's odd and energetic film is a mix of fun, sadness and fatigue, and while not everything falls into place, it has its share of entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/11/rules-dont-apply-review-warren-beatty-as-howard-hughes-a-strangely-compelling-vanity-project|title=Rules Don't Apply review – Warren Beatty as Howard Hughes: a strangely compelling vanity project|website=[[The Guardian]]|first=Jordan|last=Hoffman|date=November 11, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Thompson of IGN gave the film a 6/10 and wrote "It's an odd beast of a movie that sometimes works perfectly and is absolutely enchanting and then at other times just feels leaden and either half-baked or overdone. The story is great, there is some snappy dialogue and some nicely drawn characters and the cast can't be faulted [...] but unlike directors such as the [[Coen brothers]], Beatty fails to make it pop and, in most cases, criminally underutilizes them – this does both them and the film a disservice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/rules-dont-apply-review|title=Rules Don't Apply Review|website=[[IGN]]|first=Simon|last=Thompson|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Palmer of ''The Reel Deal'' gave the film a rating of 3/10, writing, "As someone who appreciates Warren Beatty's place and contribution to Hollywood history, I hope and pray he appears in at least one more great film, because ending his career on something as poorly assembled and downright boring as ''Rules Don't Apply'' would be devastating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thereeldealsite.wordpress.com/2016/11/24/rules-dont-apply-a-boring-disappointing-return-for-warren-beatty/ |title='Rules Don’t Apply' a Boring, Disappointing Return for Warren Beatty|website=The Reel Deal|first=David|last=Palmer|date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seapunk''' is a [[subculture]] that originated on [[Tumblr]] in 2011. It is often associated with an aquatic-themed style of fashion, [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Internet art|net art]], [[iconography]], and allusions to [[popular culture]] of the 1990s. The advent of seapunk also spawned its own [[electronic music]] [[microgenre]], featuring elements of [[Southern hip hop]] and [[pop music]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B music]] of the 1990s. Seapunk gained limited popularity as it spread through the [[Internet]], although it was said to have developed a [[Chicago]] [[Nightclub|club]] scene.&lt;ref name="ChicagoReader"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/seapunk-twitter-tumblr-ultrademon-zombelle-molly-soda/Content?oid=5389539|title=The Week Seapunk Broke|last=Raymer|first=Miles|date=January 12, 2016|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|publisher=Sun-Times Media, LLC|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, seapunk started as a [[Fad|trend]] and an [[Internet meme]] on [[Tumblr]] in 2011. The term "seapunk" was coined by [[DJ]] Lil Internet in 2011, when he humorously wrote in a tweet on [[Twitter]] saying, "Seapunk leather jacket with barnacles where the studs used to be."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/fashion/Seapunk-a-Web-Joke-With-Music-Has-Its-Moment.html|title=Little Mermaid Goes Punk: Seapunk, a Web Joke With Music, Has Its Moment|last=Detrick|first=Ben|date=March 2, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|via=|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, ''Cluster Mag'' reported on the emergence of seapunk in [[electronic media]] and quoted [[Pictureplane]], who described seapunk as "a mostly [[Internet phenomena|Internet-based phenomenon]] birthed out of the [[Tumblr]] and [[Twitter]] universes as a means to describe a lifestyle aesthetic that is all things oceanic and of the sea."&lt;ref name="Cluster Mag"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://theclustermag.com/2011/12/the-abyss-seapunk-splishsplash-oceangang/ | title=The Abyss: #seapunk #splishsplash #oceangang | last=Stephens | first=Alexis | date=December 5, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909201415/http://theclustermag.com/2011/12/the-abyss-seapunk-splishsplash-oceangang/ | archive-date=September 9, 2015 | accessdate=September 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles Raymer of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described seapunk music as "a style of music that incorporates bits of 90s [[house (music)|house]], the past 15 years or so of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] and the latest in [[Southern hip hop|southern trap rap]]—all overlaid with a twinkly, narcotic energy that recalls [[new-age music]] and [[chopped and screwed]] [[hip hop]] [[Mixtape|mix tapes]] in roughly equal measure."&lt;ref name="ChicagoReader" /&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', seapunk music "constitutes a tiny [[Music genre|music subgenre]]" that contains elements of [[Witch house (music genre)|witch house]], [[chiptune]], [[drum and bass]] and [[Southern hip hop|Southern rap]]. ''The New York Times'' also noted that some seapunk tracks [[remix]] songs from [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] acts such as [[Beyoncé]] and [[Aaliyah]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; In January 2012, an article about seapunk music was featured in the ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' magazine. Katia Ganfield interviewed Lily Redwine (a.k.a. [[Ultrademon]]) in the article, titled "Seapunk: A new club scene intent on riding sub-bass sound waves into the future".&lt;ref name="Dazed &amp; Confused Seapunk Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katiaganfield.tumblr.com/post/15519605971/my-article-in-most-recent-dazed-and-confused-about|title=Seapunk: A new club scene intent on riding sub-bass sound waves into the future|last=Ganfield|first=Katia|date=January 2012|publisher=Waddell Limited|pages=26–270|access-date=August 16, 2016|work=Dazed &amp; Confused|issue=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seapunk was said to have developed a [[Chicago]] club scene.&lt;ref name="ChicagoReader" /&gt;

Notable seapunk artists include [[Azealia Banks]], [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], [[Blank Banshee 0|Blank Banshee]], [[Isaiah Toothtaker]], [[Slava]], [[Unicorn Kid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/lana-del-rey-grimes|title=Lana Del Rey + Grimes|website=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|publisher=Time Out Digital Ltd.|access-date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheGuardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/14/seapunk-has-now-gone-pop|title=Seapunk: Scenester in-joke or underground art movement?|last=Stehlik|first=Lucy|date=December 14, 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion imagery==

Seapunks often wear [[bright green]], [[blue]], [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[cyan]] or [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]] clothing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/mar/20/youth-subcultures-where-have-they-gone|title=Youth subcultures: what are they now?|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|date=March 20, 2014|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring nautical themes such as [[mermaid]]s or [[dolphin]]s, plastic [[Ray Ban wayfarers]], [[shell jewelry]], feathers, [[tartan]] overshirts associated with the [[surfer]] subculture, [[baseball cap]]s, [[tie dye]], transparent plastic jackets, and [[skipper cap]]s.  Symbols such as yin-yangs, [[smiley|smiley faces]] and references to the 1990s are also a part of the style.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2012/11/azealia-banks-rihanna-seapunk-beef-saturday-night-live-video/|title=Seapunks Salty Over Rihanna and Azealia Banks’ ‘Net Aesthetics|last=Martins|first=Chris|date=November 14, 2012|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hair and makeup===
Seapunks often dye their hair, and sometimes facial hair, with varying shades of [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[Lilac (color)|lilac]], and sea blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/27/merman-colour-is-the-next-big-thing-in-mens-hair-5268577/|title=Merman colour is the next big thing in men’s hair|last=Scott|first=Ellen|date=June 27, 2015|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|access-date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seapunk styling was appropriated by several mainstream [[popular music]] and [[hip hop]] artists during the 2010s, most notably [[Kreayshawn]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Soulja Boy]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Azealia Banks]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Frank Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1891900/frank-ocean-blue-hair/|title=Frank Ocean Is Basically A Merman|last=Muller|first=Marissa G.|date=August 7, 2014|website=[[MTV#Internet|MTV]]|access-date=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seapunk digital imagery and use of social networking media==

Images featuring neon flashing colors and rotating geometric shapes floating above oceans of brilliant blue or green water flood the pages tagged with a #Seapunk [[hashtag]] on [[Tumblr]]. Seapunk digital imagery draws largely from 1990s 3D [[Internet art|net art]]. The aforementioned imagery has given rise to other internet-based subgenres consisting of similar themes, such as slimepunk and icepunk.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

Rapper [[Azealia Banks]] used seapunk imagery in her "Atlantis" music video in 2012.&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/11/azealia-banks-rihanna-seapunk-beef-saturday-night-live-video/|title=Seapunks Salty Over Rihanna and Azealia Banks' 'Net Aesthetics|last=Martins|first=Chris|date=14 November 2012|work=Spin Magazine|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Rihanna]] was influenced by seapunk in her "[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]" performance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Respect"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://respect-mag.com/you-never-thought-seapunk-would-take-it-this-far-zombelle-talks-azealia-banks-rihanna-the-week-the-second-internet-exploded|title=You Never Thought Seapunk Would Take It This Far|last=Harwood|first=Nick|date=November 30, 2012|publisher=Respect|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of seapunk imagery were claimed to have influenced designers such as [[Versace]] and Cartiergod's "Ocean Gang".&lt;ref name="DailyBeast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/10/seapunks-internet-trend-takes-high-fashion-from-proenza-schouler-to-versace-photos.html|title=Seapunks Internet Trend Takes High Fashion, from Proenza Schouler to Versace|last=Sidell|first=Misty White|date=December 10, 2012|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Japanese Arts''' was founded in 1937 by a group of Dutch collectors of, and dealers in, [[Japanese art]]. Originally called '''The Society for Japanese Arts and Crafts''', the society became international in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlistings.com/associations/d/1824/society-for-japanese-arts/ Art Listings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/society-japanese-arts.asp Artlino.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It currently has over 800 members in 29 countries.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.society-for-japanese-arts.org/about%20us.htm Society for Japanese Arts - About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916061013/http://www.society-for-japanese-arts.org/about%20us.htm |date=2010-09-16 }} Retrieved 29 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society sponsors lectures, exhibitions and publications.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; It awards grants through the Heinz M. Kaempfer Fund, and publishes the journal ''Andon'' (ISSN 0168-2997) in English, which provides results of in-depth research about various [[ukiyo-e]] artists, e.g. [[Utagawa Kunisada III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viewingjapaneseprints.net/texts/topictexts/jf_pubs.html viewing Japanese Prints]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35003">[[Image:Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Cover of the 1992 release of Symphony No. 3, conducted by [[David Zinman]]]]

The '''Symphony No. 3''', [[Opus number|Op.]] 36, also known as the '''''Symphony of Sorrowful Songs''''' ({{lang-pl|Symfonia pieśni żałosnych}}), is a [[symphony]] in three [[movement (music)|movements]] composed by [[Henryk Górecki]] in [[Katowice]], Poland, between October and December 1976. The work is indicative of the transition between Górecki's [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] earlier manner and his more [[tonality|tonal]] later style. It was premièred on 4 April 1977, at the [[Royan Festival|Royan International Festival]], with [[Stefania Woytowicz]] as soprano and [[Ernest Bour]] as conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

A solo [[soprano]] sings Polish texts in each of the three movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~felluga/holocaust/goreckilyrics696.html |title=Words in Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 (in translation) |website=Web.ics.purdue.edu |date=1944-09-26 |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is a 15th-century Polish lament of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]], the second a message written on the wall of a [[Gestapo]] cell during World War II, and the third a [[Silesia]]n folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the [[Silesian uprisings]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;Ellis, David. "[http://www.mahlerarchives.net/archives/ellisevocations.pdf Evocations of Mahler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917102253/http://www.mahlerarchives.net/archives/ellisevocations.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}" (PDF). ''Naturlaut'' 4(1): 2–7, 2005. Retrieved 22 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The first and third movements are written from the perspective of a parent who has lost a child, and the second movement from that of a child separated from a parent. The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation through war.

Until 1992, Górecki was known only to [[connoisseurs]], primarily as one of several composers from the [[Polish School (music)|Polish School]] responsible for the postwar [[Music of Poland#Classical music|Polish music renaissance]].{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}} That year, [[Elektra Records#Beginnings|Elektra-Nonesuch]] released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the [[London Sinfonietta]], that topped the classical [[Record chart|charts]] in Britain and the United States. To date, it has sold more than a million copies, vastly exceeding the expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th-century composer. This success, however, has not generated similar interest in Górecki's other works.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=170}}

==Background==
Despite a political climate that was unfavorable to modern art (often denounced as "[[Formalism (music)|formalist]]" by the [[communism|communist]] authorities), post-war Polish composers enjoyed an unprecedented degree of compositional freedom following the establishment of the [[Warsaw Autumn]] festival in 1956.{{sfn|Thomas|2005|pp=85–6}} Górecki had won recognition among avant-garde composers for the experimental, [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] and [[serialism|serialist]] works of his early career; he became visible on the international scene through such modernist works as ''Scontri'', which was a success at the 1960 Warsaw Autumn, and his First Symphony, which was awarded a prize at the 1961 Paris Youth Bienniale.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=134}} Throughout the 1960s, he continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].

During the 1970s, Górecki began to distance himself from the serialism and extreme dissonance of his earlier work, and his Third Symphony, like the preceding choral pieces ''Euntes ibant et flebant'' (Op. 32, 1972) and ''Amen'' (Op. 35, 1975), starkly rejects such techniques. The lack of harmonic variation in Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's progression towards the harmonic [[minimalist music|minimalism]] and the simplified textures of his more recent work.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; Because of the religious nature of many of his works during this period, critics and musicologists often align him with other modernist composers who began to explore radically simplified musical textures, [[tonality]], and [[melody]], and who also infused many of their works with religious significance. Like-minded composers, such as [[Arvo Pärt]] and [[John Tavener]], are frequently grouped with Górecki under the term "[[holy minimalism]]," although none of the composers classified as such has admitted to common influences.

==Composition==
In 1973, Górecki approached the Polish [[Folklore|folklorist]] Adolf Dygacz in search of traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the [[Silesia]] region in south-western Poland. Górecki was impressed by the melody "Where has he gone, my dear young son?" (''Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?''), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the [[Silesian Uprising]]s of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said "for me, it is a wonderfully poetic text. I do not know if a 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the wringing of hands: it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son."{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=81}}

[[File:'Palace”, Zakopane, A-406 M 03.jpg|thumb|''The Palace'' in [[Zakopane]]; the former Nazi Gestapo prison was where the composer took an inscription scrawled on a cell wall for the composition of his symphony.]]

Later that year, Górecki learned of an inscription scrawled on the wall of a cell in a German [[Gestapo]] prison in the town of [[Zakopane]], which lies at the foot of the [[Tatra mountains]] in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old  [[:fy:Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna|Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna]], a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read ''O Mamo, nie płacz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie'' (Oh Mamma do not cry, no.  Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words".{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=82}} He later explained, "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me."{{sfn|Górecki|2003}}

Górecki now had two texts: one from a mother to her son, the other from a daughter to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century [[Folk music|folk song]] from the southern city of [[Opole]].&lt;ref name="McCusker" /&gt; Its text contains a passage in which the [[Virgin Mary]] speaks to her [[Jesus|Son]] dying on the cross: "O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother&amp;nbsp;..." (''Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany&amp;nbsp;...''). Górecki said, "this text was folk-like, anonymous. So now I had three acts, three persons&amp;nbsp;... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from [[Psalm 94|Psalm 93/94]] in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated Your people, O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans.{{' "}}{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=83}} However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony "about war". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent [[lament]]s.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=83}}

==Instrumentation and score==
The symphony is constructed around simple harmonies, set in a neo-[[mode (music)|modal]] style&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, Imre.

''Le Chercheur de traces''. Retrieved on 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which makes use of the [[medieval music]]al modes, but does not adhere strictly to medieval rules of composition. A performance typically lasts about 54 minutes. Ronald Blum describes the piece as "mournful, like [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], but without the bombast of percussion, horns and choir, just the sorrow of strings and the lone soprano".&lt;ref name="Blum" /&gt; The work consists of three [[elegiac]] movements, each marked ''Lento'' to indicate their slow [[Tempo|tempi]].&lt;ref&gt;Han-Leon, Chia. "[http://inkpot.com/classical/goreckisym3.html Symphony No.3, op.36 (1976)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611145606/http://inkpot.com/classical/goreckisym3.html |date=2007-06-11 }}". ''The Flying Inkpot'', 9 December 1999. Retrieved on 22 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Strings dominate the musical textures and the music is rarely loud—the dynamics reach ''[[fortissimo]]'' in only a few bars.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;

The symphony is scored for solo [[soprano]], four [[flute]]s (two players doubling on [[piccolo]]s), four [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}}, two [[bassoon]]s, two [[contrabassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]] in F, four [[trombone]]s, [[harp]], [[piano]] and [[string section|strings]]. Górecki specifies exact complements for the string forces: 16 first [[violin]]s, 16 second violins, 12 [[viola]]s, 12 [[cello]]s, and 8 [[double bass]]es. For most of the score, these are in turn divided into two parts, each notated on a separate [[Staff (music)|staff]]. Thus the string writing is mainly in ten different parts, on ten separate staves. In some sections some of these parts are divided even further into separate parts, which are written on the same staff, so that ten staves are still used for a greater number of parts.

Unusually, the score omits [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]]s, [[bass clarinet]]s, and [[trumpet]]s. The bassoons, contrabassoons, and trombones play only in the first movement, and only for a few bars (bassoons and contrabassoons: 339–342 and 362–369; trombones: 343–348 and 367–369).

The [[musicologist]] Adrian Thomas notes that the symphony lacks [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] outside of [[musical mode|modal]] inflections (that is, occasional use of pitches that fall outside the mode), and that it does not require nonstandard techniques or [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] playing. Thomas further observes that "there is no second-hand stylistic referencing, although if predecessors were to be sought they might be found, distantly removed, in the music of composers as varied as [[J.S. Bach|Bach]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Piotr Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], and even [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]."{{sfn|Thomas|2005|p=265}}

Krzyż Monastery'') in the [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]]. Comprising three [[Theme (music)|thematic]] sections, the movement opens with a [[canon (music)|canon]] based on a 24-bar theme, which is repeated several times.  The canon begins in 2 parts; then, for each repetition of the theme, an extra part is added, until the canon is in eight parts (with the top two parts doubled at the octave, making for ten voices total), using a 24-bar melody in the [[Aeolian mode]] on E. It begins with the double basses, 2nd part, with each succeeding entry occurring one [[bar (music)|measure]] later (i.e., a new entry begins every 25 measures), each starting a diatonic [[interval (music)|fifth]] above the last.  That means that each appearance of the melody in a new part is in a different mode, in this order:

# [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] on E (double basses, 2nd part)
# [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]] on B (double basses, 1st part)
# [[Locrian mode|Locrian]] on F{{music|#}} (cellos, 2nd part)
# [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] on C (cellos, 1st part)
# [[Ionian mode|Ionian]] on G (violas, 2nd part)
# [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] on D (violas, 1st part)
# [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] on A (2nd violins, 2nd part)
# [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] on E (1st violins, 2nd part)

After the 8-part canon is played, it is repeated, with the 1st parts of the 1st and 2nd violins (silent up to this point) doubling the other violin parts an octave higher.

After that, the canon continues, but the voices gradually drop out one by one, from the lowest upwards and the highest downwards; the instruments in question then double, or play the parts of, a higher or lower voice that is still playing, in this order ('→' means 'double/play the parts of'):

# Double basses: 2nd part (low E Aeolian) → 1st part (B Phrygian) [''canon reduced to 7 voices'']
# 1st violins: 1st part (highest E Aeolian) → 2nd part (high E Aeolian)
# Double basses (B Phrygian) → Cellos, 2nd part (F{{music|#}} Locrian)
# Cellos: 2nd part (F{{music|#}} Locrian) → 1st part (C Lydian) [''canon reduced to 6 voices'']
# 2nd violins: 1st part (high A Dorian) → 2nd part (A Dorian)
# Double basses (F{{music|#}} Locrian) → Cellos (C Lydian)
# Cellos (C Lydian) → Violas, 2nd part (G Ionian)
# 2nd violins (A Dorian) → Violas, 1st part (D Mixolydian)
# 1st violins (high E Aeolian) → 2nd violins (A Dorian) [''canon reduced to 4 voices'']
# Double basses fall silent
# 1st violins (A Dorian) → 2nd violins + violas, 1st part (D Mixolydian) [''canon reduced to 2 voices'']

The canon ends, with all the strings (except the double basses) ending on a single note, E4.

The soprano enters on the same note in the second section and builds to a climax on the final word, at which point the strings enter forcefully with the climax of the opening canon. The third section of the movement (''Lento—Cantabile semplice'') is a long ''[[dénouement]]'', another canon based on the same melody in the opening canon; but this time it starts with 8 parts (the top two doubled in octaves), and the voices drop out from high to low:

# 1st violins: 1st part (highest E Aeolian) → 2nd part (high E Aeolian)
# 2nd violins: 1st part (high A Dorian) → 2nd part (A Dorian)
# 1st violins sustain an E5 drone
# 2nd violins sustain an E4 drone as 1st violins fall silent
# Violas: 1st part (D Mixolydian) → 2nd part (G Ionian)
# Violas sustain an E3 drone as 2nd violins fall silent
# Cellos: 1st part (C Lydian) → 2nd part (F{{music|#}} Locrian)
# Cellos sustain an E2 drone as violas fall silent
# Double Basses: 1st part (B Phrygian) → 2nd part (melody in low E Aeolian)

The movement thus ends with the lower strings, and the piano (briefly recalling the second section of the movement).

The nine-minute second movement is for soprano, clarinets, horns, harp, piano, and strings, and contains a [[libretto]] formed from the prayer to the Virgin Mary inscribed by Blazusiakówna on the cell wall in [[Zakopane]].&lt;ref name="McCusker" /&gt; According to the composer, "I wanted the second movement to be of a highland character, not in the sense of pure folklore, but the climate of [[Podhale]]&amp;nbsp;... I wanted the girl's monologue as if hummed&amp;nbsp;... on the one hand almost unreal, on the other towering over the orchestra."{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=91}}

The movement opens with a folk [[drone (music)|drone]], A–E, and a melodic fragment, E–G{{music|sharp}}–F{{music|sharp}}, which alternate with sudden plunges to a low B{{music|flat}}–D{{music|flat}} [[Dyad (music)|dyad]]. Thomas describes the effect as "almost cinematic&amp;nbsp;... suggest[ing] the bright open air of the mountains".{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=91}} As the soprano begins to sing, her words are supported by the orchestra until she reaches a climaxing top A{{music|flat}}. The movement is resolved when the strings hold a chord without [[Dynamics (music)|diminuendo]] for nearly one and a half minutes. The final words of the movement are the first two lines of the Polish [[Ave Maria]], sung twice on a repeated pitch by the soprano.

The tempo of the third movement is similar to that of the previous two, and subtle changes in dynamism and [[Musical mode|mode]] make it more complex and involving than it may at first appear. With a duration of approximately seventeen minutes, it comprises three verses in [[A minor]]&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; and, like the first movement, is constructed from evolving variations on a simple motif. The melody is established in the opening verse, and the second and third verses revisit the cradling motifs of the second movement. As in the second movement, the motifs are built up from inversions of plain [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[seventh chord]]s stretching across several octaves. As the soprano sings the final words, the key changes to a pure [[diatonic]] [[A major]] which accompanies, in writer David Ellis's words, the "ecstatic final stanza":&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;
{{blockquote|O sing for him / God's little song-birds / Since his mother cannot find him.&lt;br&gt;
And you, God's little flowers / May you blossom all around / that my son may sleep a happy sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Mason Hodges, John.

''Critique'', 1993. Retrieved on 22 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The orchestra returns to A minor before a final postlude in A major.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; In Górecki's own words: "Finally there came that unvarying, persistent, obstinate 'walczyk' [on the chord of A], sounding well when played piano, so that all the notes were audible. For the soprano, I used a device characteristic of highland singing: suspending the melody on the third [C{{music|sharp}}] and descending from the fifth to the third while the ensemble moves stepwise downward [in sixths]".{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=82}}

==Interpretation==
[[Image:Fouquet Madonna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean Fouquet]], ''Madonna and Child'', c. 1450.]]
The symphony was dedicated to Górecki's wife Jadwiga Rurańska. When asked why, Górecki responded, "Who was I supposed to dedicate it to?"{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=133}} He never sought to explain the symphony as a response to a political or historical event. Instead, he maintained that the work is an evocation of the ties between mother and child.  Górecki was commissioned to write music in response to the Holocaust in the 1960s but was unable to finish any of the pieces he started for that purpose.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=134}} While Górecki stated that for many years he sought to produce a work specifically in response to [[Auschwitz]], he resisted that interpretation of the symphony, which he preferred to be viewed in a wider context. Other critics have attempted to interpret the symphony in spiritual terms, an approach which Górecki also dismissed.&lt;ref name="JPz"/&gt; Still others have suggested that the symphony can be understood as a compendium of Polish history:

{{quotation|
The symphony alludes to each of the main historical and political developments in Poland's history from the 14th century to 1976, the year of its composition. What is more, each of the three movements appears to represent a different age .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and [they are] chronologically contiguous. The composer seems to have created three separate and discrete "chapters" in his summary of Poland's history.{{sfn|Howard|2007|pp=215–6}}
}}

Górecki said of the work, "Many of my family died in concentration camps. I had a grandfather who was in Dachau, an aunt in Auschwitz. You know how it is between Poles and Germans. But Bach was a German too—and Schubert, and Strauss. Everyone has his place on this little earth. That's all behind me. So the Third Symphony is not about war; it's not a ''[[Dies Irae]]''; it's a normal Symphony of Sorrowful Songs."{{sfn|Jacobson|1995|p=191}}

==Critical and cultural reception==
Górecki's Symphony No. 3 was written in 1976, when Górecki was, in the words of the music critic Jane Perlez, "a fiery figure, fashionable only among a small circle of modern-music aficionados".&lt;ref name="JPz"&gt;Perlez, Jane (27 February 1994).

Retrieved 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 world première at the Royan Festival, [[Ernest Bour]] conducting, was reviewed by six western critics, all of them harshly dismissive.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=136}} Heinz Koch, writing for ''Musica'', said that the symphony "drags through three old folk melodies (and nothing else) for an endless 55 minutes".&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Heinz. "Mit wichtigen bundesdeutschen Beiträgen". Musica 31, no. 4. 1977. p 332. ''Da schleift einer drei alte Volksliedmelodien (und sonst nichts) 55 endlose Minuten lang.''&lt;/ref&gt; Górecki himself recalled that, at the premiere, he sat next to a "prominent French musician" (Górecki did not name names, though it was probably [[Pierre Boulez]]), who, after hearing the twenty-one repetitions of an A-major chord at the end of the symphony, loudly exclaimed "[[Feces|Merde]]!"{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=216}}

The symphony was first recorded in Poland in 1978 by the soprano [[Stefania Woytowicz]].{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=136}} It was deemed a masterpiece by Polish critics,{{sfn|Howard|2007|p=217}} although, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, recordings and performances of the work were widely criticised by the press outside Poland.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=136}} The symphony drew hostility from critics who felt that Górecki had moved too far away from the established avant-garde style and was, according to Dietmar Polaczek (writing for ''Österreichische Musikzeitschrift''), "simply adding to the decadent trash that encircled the true pinnacles of avant-gardism".&lt;ref&gt;Polaczek, Dietmar.

Although Gorecki's name was featured prominently on the front cover, the [[sleeve notes]] on the back provided precious little information about the work,{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=137}} and Górecki's name appeared in smaller type than those of the main actors.&lt;ref&gt;Wierzbicki, James.

The writer [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]] described the symphony's success as essentially a phenomenon of the [[compact disc]], and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out.{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}} Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in ''A guide to the symphony'', wondered whether the commercial success of the work was "a flash in the pan" or would turn out to have lasting significance.{{sfn|Layton|1995|p=401}} In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, "[are people] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?"{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}} Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' phenomenon of 1958: "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity."{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}} Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. &lt;!--Was that the end of a sentence? I used the required four dots, spaced only to the right; reformat with three dots if there was no period there in the original--&gt;Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed."{{sfn|Steinberg|1998|p=171}}

At least a dozen recordings were issued in the wake of the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Fearless (1993 film)|Fearless]]'' (1993), and in the soundtrack to [[Julian Schnabel]]'s ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996).{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=152}} An art gallery in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.{{sfn|Howard|1998|p=152}}. On June 24, 2018, in an unprecedented gesture, the host of SiriusXM followed a playing of the Zinman/Upshaw recording by asking the listeners to consider parallels between the theme of the texts referencing the separation of mothers and children to the then current political situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2888">[[Per Nørgård]]'s '''Symphony No. 3''' was composed between 1972 and 1975 for large orchestra and chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Jørgen I. (1996). [https://www.chandos.net/chanimages/Booklets/CH9491.pdf Booklet for Symphony No. 3 / Concerto In Due Tempi], Chandos Records.&lt;/ref&gt; It lasts about 45 minutes.

==Background==
In 1972, the Music Department of the Danish State Radio commissioned Nørgård to create a large-scale symphonic work. The ''Third Symphony'' was composed over the next three years, during which Nørgård was given the opportunity to test fragments of his composition with both small ensembles and a full orchestra. Though Nørgård does not normally test his compositions on any instrument, he considered it necessary to determine the limits of perceptible [[polyphony]].&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;Nørgård, Per (1975). "[http://www.kb.dk/da/kb/nb/mta/dcm/udgivelser/norgard/artikler/InsideASymphony.1975.pdf Inside a Symphony]," ''Numus West'' 12 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The compositional process resulted in a number of other works, including ''Lila'', ''Libra'', ''Turn'', ''Spell'', and ''Singe die Gärten''.&lt;ref name="inside" /&gt; The last of these was incorporated into the symphony's second movement. The complete symphony was premiered in [[Copenhagen]] on 2 September 1976 by [[Herbert Blomstedt]] with the [[Danish National Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Kullberg, Erlin. "[http://www.pernoergaard.dk/eng/udvalgte/140.html Symphony No. 3]," pernoergaard.dk.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The symphony has two movements:

{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman
| ''Moderato''
| ''Allegretto''
}}

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for three [[flute]]s (1st doubling [[alto flute]], all doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s and [[cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s (both doubling [[E flat clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s (1st doubling trumpet in D, 3rd doubling [[bass trumpet]]), three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], at least five [[percussion]]ists (2 pairs of crash [[cymbals]], sleighbells, [[tubular bells]], [[crotales]], [[glockenspiel]], [[vibraphone]], [[xylophone]], [[marimba]]), [[descant recorder]], one or two [[harp]]s, [[piano]], [[celesta]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[string instrument|strings]], and two choirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schirmer.com/default.aspx?TabId=2420&amp;State_2874=2&amp;workId_2874=21630 Per Nørgård: Symphony No. 3 work information], G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5888">'''Taring Padi''' is a community of [[Underground art|underground]] artists in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. The group was formed in 1998 during the general upheaval following the fall of [[Suharto]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Arbuckle ''Art by Taring Padi collective'' at http://undergrowth.org/teeth_of_the_rice_plant_taring_padi&lt;/ref&gt;

Taring Padi are well known for the production of cartoon like posters embedded with political and social justice messages, using the ''cukil'' ([[woodcut]]) technique onto [[paper]] or [[canvas]]. In addition to their print work, they also create [[kinetic sculpture]]s, [[street theater]] performances, [[punk rock]] and [[techno music]].

After the fall of Suharto, Taring Padi occupied an abandoned [[art school]] which they used as a residence and workspace for creating art, music and theater. Following the [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake]], Taring Padi became based in a studio in [[Sembungan]] village, [[Bantul]], [[Yogyakarta]]. The group is well known among international [[art collectors]] and underground communities such as the [[Just Seeds]] Artists Cooperative. 

Works by Taring Padi have been shown in many formal and non-formal settings including Indonesia's National Gallery in [[Jakarta]] and at the [[31st Century Museum]], Chiang Mai, [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vimeo|16954545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taring Padi was also included in the group show ''Sisa: re-use, collaborations and cultural activism from Indonesia'' at the [[University of Technology, Sydney]] gallery.

In 2004 a film about Taring Padi by filmmakers Jamie Nicolai and Charlie Hillsmith,''Indonesian Arts, Activism and Rock 'n' Roll'' was screened on the SBS (Special Broadcasting Service) in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Art, Activism and Rock 'n' Roll by Margie Farrel {{cite web |url=http://www.aiaa.org.au/news/news20/activism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221140032/http://www.aiaa.org.au/news/news20/activism.html |archivedate=2011-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A short cut of this film can be seen at [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=m4qJsUOYms0|title=Art, Activism and Rock 'n' Roll}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker Rohan Langford has made a brief profile of Taring Padi artist Aris Prabawa, who in 2010 held solo shows at the Asia Australia Arts Centre (4A) and Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre in Sydney, Australia.

Taring Padi regularly run workshops at their studio and undertake collaborative projects with communities and national and international art and political groups.
In May 2010 Taring Padi and networks, together with the victims of Siring Village and surrounds, collaborated to commemorate the 4th anniversary of the [[Sidoarjo mud flow|Lapindo Mud disaster]] near [[Surabaya]]. They held etching, screenprinting, painting and singing workshop activities culminating with a carnival and a people's stage show on the edge of the dam containing the mud. A film documenting this project can be seen and downloaded at engagemedia.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engagemedia.org/Members/ruben/videos/bercermin-dalam-lumpur-en/view Reflections in the Mud] at [http://www.engagemedia.org engagemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 in Chiang Mai, Thailand (hosted by [[Empty Space (artist community)|Empty Space]]) and 2012 in Yogyakarta (hosted by Taring Padi), Taring Padi collaborated with Thai and Myanmar artists in the project ''Under, After and In Between''. ''Under, After and In Between'' focused on the different circumstances of each country and group and how they can influence the purpose of artistic work. The projects culminated in performances in [[Chiang Mai]], [[Bangkok]], [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Kulon Progo]].  The third installment of the project was scheduled to be held in [[Yangoon]], [[Myanmar]] in 2014 hosted by [[ThuKhuma Khaye Art Theatre]].

Taring Padi published its book ''Seni Membongar Tirani'' (Art Smashing Tyranny) in 2011 in Indonesian and English covering 10 years of the collective's work, including art work and academic articles.&lt;ref&gt;Taring Padi, (2011) ''Taring Padi: Seni Membongkar Tirani'' (Taring Padi: Art Smashing Tyranny)', Lumbung Press, Yogyakarta.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was launched in a number of cities in Indonesia in 2012 including  [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[Denpasar]] in [[Bali]], [[Makassar]], [[Medan]], and [[Padang]].

[[Image:Etty – The Dawn of Love.jpg|right|300px|thumb|''The Dawn of Love'', 1828,  {{convert|88.8|by|96|cm|in|abbr=on}}|alt=Naked woman sitting beside a sleeping man]]
'''''The Dawn of Love''''', also known as '''''Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love''''', is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by English artist [[William Etty]], first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the [[Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] in [[Bournemouth]]. Loosely based on a passage from [[John Milton]]'s 1634 [[masque]] ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'', it shows a [[nude (art)|nude]] [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] leaning across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work, he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this, ''The Dawn of Love'' is one of his more unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present a challenge to the viewer mirroring the plot of ''Comus'', in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.

While a few critics praised elements of its composition and execution, ''The Dawn of Love'' was very poorly received when first exhibited. Etty had developed a reputation for painting realistic figures, and his stylised Venus was thought unduly influenced by foreign artists such as [[Rubens]] as well as being overly voluptuous and unrealistically coloured, while the painting as a whole was considered tasteless and obscene. ''The Dawn of Love'' was not among the 133 paintings exhibited in the major 1849 [[retrospective exhibition]] of Etty's works, and its exhibition in Glasgow in 1899 drew complaints for its supposed obscenity. In 1889 it was bought by [[Merton Russell-Cotes|Sir Merton Russell-Cotes]], and has remained in the collection of the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum ever since.

==Background==
[[File:William Etty - Pandora Crowned by the Seasons, 1824.jpg|thumb|''Pandora Crowned by the Seasons'' (1824). Following the success of ''Cleopatra'', Etty tried to replicate its success with further history paintings containing nude figures.|alt=Standing naked woman, surrounded by naked people, being crowned by four scantily dressed figures]]
[[William Etty]] was born in 1787, the son of a [[York]] baker and miller.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=8925|title=William Etty}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began as an apprentice printer in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=23}} On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London "with a few pieces of chalk crayons",{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=157}} with the intention of becoming a [[history painting|history painter]] in the tradition of the [[Old Masters]].{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=86}} He enrolled at the [[Royal Academy]], and after a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter [[Thomas Lawrence]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=15}} Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the [[life class]] and copying other paintings.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=15}}{{sfn|Green|2011|p=61}} A follower of [[John Opie]], who promoted the unfashionable painting style of [[Titian]] and [[Rubens]] over the then-prevalent formal style of [[Joshua Reynolds]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=12}} Etty was unsuccessful in all the Academy's competitions and every work he submitted to the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in the 1810s was rejected.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=15}} In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works in the Summer Exhibition, ''[[The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia]]'' (also known as ''The Triumph of Cleopatra'').{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=31}} This painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=118}} He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=198}} Following the exhibition of ''Cleopatra'', over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting [[Nude (art)|&lt;!-- Normally this would be overlinking, but in this context readers are likely to want to learn more about the tradition of nude art --&gt;nude figures]] in biblical, literary and mythological settings.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024806/http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html|archivedate=11 February 2015|title=About the artist|publisher=Manchester Art Gallery|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 [[Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice]].{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=53}} Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=55}} Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of [[female nudity]] as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p = 54}}{{efn-ua|Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=32–33}}}}

==Composition==
{{Quote box|width=21em|align=right|salign=right|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
And on the tawny sands and shelves
Trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves
By dimpled brook and fountain-brim
The wood-nymphs, decked with daisies trim
Their merry wakes and pastimes keep;
What hath night to do with sleep?
Night hath better sweets to prove,
Venus now wakes, and wakens Love.
Come, let us our rites begin;
'Tis only day-light that makes sin
Which these dun shades will ne'er report.
Hail! Goddess of nocturnal sport.
&lt;/poem&gt;|source=''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'', lines 117–28}}
''The Dawn of Love'' illustrates an early passage from ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'', a 1634 [[masque]] by [[John Milton]]. ''Comus'' is a morality tale in which the female protagonist, referred to only as "The Lady", becomes separated from her family. She encounters the debauched magician [[Comus]] who captures and imprisons her, and uses all the means at his disposal to try to inflame her sexual desires. The Lady resists all temptation, and using her reason and sense of morals resists Comus's efforts to draw her into intemperance or surrender to desire.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=116}}

Etty's painting is not a direct illustration of a scene from ''Comus''. Instead, it is inspired by an early passage in which Comus, prior to his meeting with The Lady, muses on the notion that sin is only problematic if others become aware of it, and thus that it is right and natural to surrender to base desires while under cover of darkness, arguing that "What hath night to do with sleep? Night hath better sweets to prove, Venus now wakes, and wakens Love".{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=116}} Etty's painting shows the nude [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], as "Goddess of nocturnal sport", reaching across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=116}}&lt;ref name="NMM"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 April 1828|title=Fine Arts|publisher=Henry Colburn|location=London|volume=III|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Etty had built his reputation on his renowned ability to paint realistic human figures, Venus in ''The Dawn of Love'' is highly stylised, and painted in a deliberate pastiche of the style of Rubens.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=116}}

''The Dawn of Love'' intentionally presents a moral dilemma to viewers. By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes the same argument as that presented by Comus, that it is rational for the viewer to succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=116}}

While Etty regularly painted nudity, he rarely depicted physical intimacy other than in combat, and ''The Dawn of Love'' is unusual among his works; Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson commented in 2007 that ''The Dawn of Love'' "is a subject so untypical of Etty that one finds difficulty in understanding why he painted it".{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=259}}

==Reception==
[[Image:Etty - The World Before the Flood (Southampton).jpg|right|thumb|Etty's ''[[The World Before the Flood]]'', exhibited later in 1828, also illustrated Milton, in this case ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=113}}|alt=Large number of semi-naked people]]
Etty exhibited the painting in February 1828 at the [[British Institution]] under the title of ''Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love''.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=116}}{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=23}} It immediately met with a storm of derision from critics for the style in which Venus was painted;{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=116}} one of the few positive reviews was that of ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'', whose critic considered "the figure of Venus is delightfully drawn and most voluptuously coloured; and the way in which she awakens love, by ruffling the feathers of his wings, is exquisitely imagined and executed".&lt;ref name="NMM" /&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' commented that "the drawing is free and flowing" and "the colouring, though rich, is perfectly natural", but felt that "the subject is, however, handled in a way entirely too luscious (we might, with great propriety, use a harsher term) for the public eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=British Institution |day_of_week=Monday |date=4 February 1828 |page_number=3 |issue=13506 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Literary Gazette]]'' conceded that the painting was "very attractive, especially in colour", but considered the painting's "voluptuousness" as "one of the most unpardonable sins against taste", and chided Etty's "careless" drawing, observing that "it is impossible that an artist who has for so many years, and so unremittingly, studied the living model, can err in that respect from want of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=9 February 1828|title=Fine Arts: British Institution|journal=The Literary Gazette|location=London|issue=577|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Monthly Magazine]]'' complained of Venus's "sullen colour and corpulent shape", as well as Etty's "excessive exposure of [Venus's] figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fine Arts Exhibitions|journal=The Monthly Magazine|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[La Belle Assemblée]]'', meanwhile, felt that Etty's representation of Venus "though a fine voluptuous woman, is not, either in supremacy of beauty, or according to any received description of the love-inspiring goddess, a Venus", and complained that "the colouring of the flesh is chalky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1828|title=Fine Arts Exhibitions, &amp;c: British Institution|journal=La Belle Assemblée|location=London|volume=7|issue=39|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harshest criticism came from an anonymous reviewer in ''[[The London Magazine]]'':
{{quote|text=This small picture&amp;nbsp;... we utterly condemn, not for the nudity or indecency of which some have complained, but because there is a total want of beauty, grace, and expression, to clothe the nakedness and abstract the mind from it. Mr.&amp;nbsp;Etty seems conscious of the coldness of his flesh-colour, and atones for it by the flabbiness of his figures. They are {{not a typo|any thing}} but voluptuous or alluring. We would recommend to our artist to leave these small unfinished vignettes, these little doughy Rubenses as "toys of desperation" to others. His firm, broad, manly pencil, requires wider scope and a different subject.|sign=''The London Magazine'', April 1828&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1828|title=Notes on Art|journal=The London Magazine|location=London|volume=I|issue=1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An anonymous reviewer in the same publication later that year returned to the theme, chiding Etty for his imitation of foreign artists rather than attempting to develop a new and unique style of his own, observing that "we cannot imitate the voice or the actions of another, without exaggerating or caricaturing them", complaining that there is "[no] propriety in seeing the Venuses of Titian, the fables of heathenism, or the base occupations of Dutch boors, placed in parallel with those subjects which form the basis [of] all our future hopes", and observing that "surely, Rubens ought here [in England] to be held up as rock to avoid, not a light to follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1828|title=The British Institution|journal=The London Magazine|location=London|volume=I|issue=2|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Etty – Musidora- The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed'.jpg|right|upright|thumb|''[[Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed']]'' (exh.&amp;nbsp;1846). Etty continued to paint nudes throughout his career, but rarely again depicted physical intimacy.|alt=Naked woman standing in a stream]]
In February 1828, shortly after the exhibition of ''The Dawn of Love'', Etty defeated [[John Constable]] by 18 votes to five to become a full [[Royal Academician]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=52}} at the time the highest honour available to an artist.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}}{{efn-ua|In Etty's time, honours such as knighthoods were only bestowed on presidents of major institutions, not on even the most well respected artists.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}}}} From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press on his supposed indecency and tastelessness, Etty continued to be a prominent painter of nudes but began to make conscious efforts to reflect moral teachings in his work.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=42}} He died in 1849,{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} working and exhibiting up until his death{{sfn|Burnage|2011e|p=243}} and remained well-regarded as an artist despite being judged by many as a pornographer. [[Charles Robert Leslie]] observed shortly after Etty's death that {{nowrap|"[Etty]}} himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leslie|first=Charles Robert|date=30 March 1850|title=Lecture on the Works of the late W. Etty, Esq, R.A., by Professor Leslie|journal=The Athenæum|location=London|issue=1170|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in his work declined as [[Victorian painting|new movements]] came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}}

''The Dawn of Love'' (under its original title of ''Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love'') was exhibited in 1829 at the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists|Birmingham Society of Arts]], but other than that its history during Etty's lifetime is not recorded. No record of its original sale exists, and it was not among the 133 paintings included in the major [[retrospective exhibition]] of Etty's works at the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1849.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=157}} It is known that in 1835 it was in the collection of textile entrepreneur [[Joseph Strutt (philanthropist)|Joseph Strutt]], but it was not among the paintings sold on his death in 1844.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=157}} In June 1889 it was bought from an unknown buyer for an unknown sum by [[Sir Merton Russell-Cotes]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=157}} and has remained in the collection of the [[Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] in [[Bournemouth]] ever since.{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=56}} It was shown at an 1899 exhibition of works from Russell-Cotes's collection at the [[Glasgow Corporation Gallery]].{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=56}} This exhibition caused some controversy owing to its supposed obscene nature; in 1894 a number of supposedly obscene [[Printmaking|prints]] of works by major artists had been removed from a Glasgow shop by police and magistrates, and it was felt inappropriate for a publicly funded educational body to be displaying a work of equal obscenity.{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=57}} Several luminaries of the art world such as [[Frederic Leighton]] intervened, and the exhibition went ahead.{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=58}} ''The Dawn of Love'' was also exhibited at a 1955 [[Arts Council]] exhibition,{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=157}} and was one of the works exhibited in a major retrospective of Etty's works at the [[York Art Gallery]] in 2011–12.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=117}}

'''''The Peasant Wedding''''' is a 1567 [[genre painting]]&lt;ref name="Art History at Khan Academy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Hs2GZKOhw|title=Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Peasant Wedding, c. 1566-69, Smarthistory, Art History at Khan Academy|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by  the [[Dutch People|Dutch]] [[Renaissance]] painter and [[printmaker]] [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], one of his many depicting [[peasant]] life. It is currently housed in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]]. Pieter Bruegel the Elder enjoyed painting peasants and different aspects of their lives in so many of his paintings that he has been called Peasant-Bruegel, but he was in fact a  sophisticated  [[intellectual]], and many of his paintings have a symbolic meaning and also a moral aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/bruegel/pieter_e/10/index.html|title=Paintings of peasant life (1567-68) by Pieter BRUEGEL the Elder|publisher=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/bruegel/|title=Bruegel|publisher=Web Museum, Paris|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templegallery.com/content/thesis_part4.pdf|title=The marriage at Cana|publisher=Temple Gallery|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The [[bride]] is in front of the green textile  wall-hanging, with a paper-crown hung above her head. She is also wearing a crown on her head, and she is sitting passively, not participating in the eating or drinking taking place around her. The Bridegroom is not in attendance of the wedding feast in accordance to Flemish custom.  The feast is in a [[barn]] in the summertime; two sheaves of grain with a rake recalls the work that harvesting involves, and the hard life [[peasant]]s have. The plates are carried on a door off its hinges. The main food was [[bread]], [[porridge]] and [[soup]]. Other features of the scene include two pipers playing the [[pijpzak]], an [[breeching (boys)|unbreeched]] boy in the foreground licking a plate, the wealthy man at the far right feeding a dog by putting bread on the bench, and a mysterious extra foot seen under the load of dishes being carried by the two men in the right foreground. The scene is claimed to depict an accurate portrayal of the 16th-century way of celebrating a peasant wedding.&lt;ref name="Art History at Khan Academy"/&gt;

==The groom==
There has been much conjecture as to the identity of the groom in this painting. [[Gilbert Highet]] has argued that the groom is the man in the centre of the painting, wearing a dark coat and seen in profile,&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Highet. 1945. Bruegel's Rustic wedding. ''American Magazine of Art'' 38. 274-276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Highet. 1967. Where is the Bridegroom? ''Horizon: A Magazine of the Arts.'' 9.2:112-115.&lt;/ref&gt; or the ill-bred son of a wealthy couple, seen against the far wall, to the right of the bride, eating with a spoon, same as [[Gustav Glück]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Glück, ed. 1937. ''Bilder aus Bruegels Bildern.'' Vienna: Verlag Von Anton Schroll &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that according to contemporary custom, the groom is not seated at the table but may be the man pouring out beer.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wied |first1=Alexander |last2=Van Miegroet |first2=Hans J. |title=Bruegel |publisher=Grove Art Online |accessdate=27 January 2015 |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T011669pg1 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or he may be according to the same custom serving the food instead. According to this theory, the groom is the young man wearing a red cap, who is serving his guests the food, handing out plates to his guests.&lt;ref name=Pickwick&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madamepickwickartblog.com/2010/06/second-helpings-on-the-peasant-wedding-feast/helpings-on-the-peasant-wedding-feast |title=Helpings on the peasant wedding feast|publisher=Madame Pickwick Art|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] vein, [[Rudy Rucker]] speculates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rudy Rucker, Notes |url=http://www.rudyrucker.com/bruegel/bruegelnotesposted.pdf|p=54|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|... the groom is the man in the red hat, passing food towards the bride. The motion of a husband, to penetrate the wife. Note that near him are no less than three phallic symbols pointing towards the wife: the man’s arm, the knife on the table, and the salt-cellar (?) on the table. Note also that at the end of the man’s arm is an ellipse of an angle-seen dish that is oriented and located in the right location to represent the bride’s vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rudolf von Bitter Rucker, As Above So Below |isbn= 0765327538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some authors have even suggested that the groom is not even included in the painting. Van der Elst speculated that this could be the depiction of an old Flemish proverb, like some of ''"There is an old Flemish proverb: 'It is a poor man who is not able to be at his own wedding.' That seems to be the case here."''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph van der Elst. 1944. ''The last flowering of the Middle Ages''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Some argued that it is a presentation of the mystical [[The Wedding at Cana|Wedding of Cana]].&lt;ref name=Cana /&gt;
Lindsay and Bernard Huppé speculated that the painting was a Christian allegory, symbolizing corruption, depicting the corrupted Church, which was supposed to be the bride of Christ, but the groom has not appeared to claim his corrupt bride.&lt;ref&gt;K. C. Lindsay and Bernard Huppé. March 1956. Meaning and Method in Breughel's Paintings. ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' Vol. 14, No. 3. 376-386.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was parodied in ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Anthea|title=Translation: Here and There, Now and Then|year=1996|publisher=Intellect Books|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agu3vbQl5QAC&amp;pg=PA129|chapter=Translating Astérix|authorlink=Anthea Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Screech|first=Matthew|title=Masters of the ninth art: bandes dessinées and Franco-Belgian identity|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvkGQnWZf1gC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[comedy]], a '''throwaway line''' (also: '''throwaway joke''' or '''throwaway gag''') is a [[joke]] delivered "in passing" without being the [[punch line]] to a [[comedy routine]], part of the [[wikt:buildup|build up]] to another joke, or (in the context of [[drama]]) there to advance a story or develop a character. Throwaway lines are often [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s, or [[in-joke]]s, and often delivered in a [[deadpan]] manner.

In [[comic strip]]s ([[Sunday comics]] in particular) throwaway gags are often placed in the throwaway panels of the comic, and are located there so that removing the throwaway panels for space reasons will not destroy the narrative of the central comic.

In [[episodic fiction]], a line intended originally as a throwaway line in one episode may later be [[retconned]] by being incorporated into the [[back-story]] of the main drama, and used to develop the longer-term plot.

[[File:Usgal2.jpg|thumb|Petroglyph depicting an [[Indian bison]]]]

'''Usgalimal rock engravings''' or Usgalimal [[Petroglyphs]] at Usgalimal village, in [[South Goa]],  is one of the most important prehistoric sites in [[western India]].&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

==Overview==
Situated on the banks of river [[Kushavati]], these engravings exhibit earliest traces of human settlement  in India. These petroglyphs (rock art) are approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years old and belong to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] or [[Mesolithic]] eras. More than 100 distinct figures, spread an area of 500 sqm., including images of bulls, [[labyrinths]] and human figures are carved on [[laterite]] stones.&lt;ref name=arc&gt;{{cite book|last=Indian Archaeological Society|title=Purātattva, Issue 36|year=2006|publisher=[[Indian Archaeological Society]]|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usgal&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalyan Kumar Chakravarty, Robert G.

The site was discovered in 1993, when local villagers took the archaeologists to the bend in west-flowing river Kushavati outside the village, with mysterious engravings on the laterite shelf. The layer of mud covering up the engravings had been washed away by monsoon floods facilitating their discovery.  Subsequently, when the soil was cleared more engravings were found. In the coming years, [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) put up signage and started promoting the site as a tourist destination, while the Forest Department declared it a protected area. Some of the finds are displayed in the [[Panaji]] Archaeological Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Goa|author= David Abram|publisher=Rough Guides|year=2004|isbn=1843530813 |page=190 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGZRtj4OnccC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Usgalimal+rock+engravings&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4_Qrmyxe-H&amp;sig=N9DzDV2EgGrJwa1MaRxgvP2y5r4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gO9FT7-SD4HUrQfw7LmXCw&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Usgalimal%20rock%20engravings&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle''''' (c. 1665-70) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Mount Stuart House]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "760. A HILLY LANDSCAPE WITH A WATERFALL AND A RUINED CASTLE.  [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 198.]] A ruined castle stands on a high rocky hill to the right. In the left foreground a stream, on whose rocky banks grow firs, forms a waterfall and flows along the foot of the hill. A great fir stands on a bank ; some felled trees lie near. To the right are two houses amid trees at the foot of the castle-hill. In the left distance is a mountain. In the style of [[Allaert van Everdingen|A. van Everdingen]]. "This capital production of art is painted in a broad free manner, and possesses great force and effect " (Sm.). 
Canvas, 47 inches by 71 inches. In the collection of the [[Marquess of Bute]], London, [[Jean Paul Richter|Richter]]'s 1884 catalogue, No. 145 ; it was in that collection in 1835 (Sm.), and was mentioned by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]] in 1854 (iii. 481)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/241/mode/1up  Entry 760 for ''''Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made in this period and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape.

'''''Wayne's World''''' is a 1992 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]], produced by [[Lorne Michaels]], and written by [[Mike Myers]] and [[Bonnie and Terry Turner]]. It stars Myers in his feature film debut as Wayne Campbell and [[Dana Carvey]] as Garth Algar, a pair of rock fans who broadcast a [[public-access television|public-access television show]]. It also features [[Rob Lowe]], [[Tia Carrere]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Ed O'Neill]], [[Ione Skye]], [[Meat Loaf]], and [[Alice Cooper]].

''Wayne's World'' was released in the US on February 14, 1992. It was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and it remains the highest-grossing [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on ''Saturday Night Live'' skits]]. A sequel, ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', was released on December 10, 1993.

==Plot==
In [[Aurora, Illinois]], rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World'', from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for $10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his [[Cantonese]]. He purchases a 1964 [[Fender Stratocaster]] electric guitar he has long coveted.

Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an [[Alice Cooper]] concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a [[music video]] for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records.

While filming the revamped ''Wayne's World'' under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of [[amusement arcade]]s. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust.

Wayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive. As he leaves, Cassandra changes her mind about Benjamin. Wayne apologizes and they return to Aurora.

The ''Wayne's World'' crew hacks into Sharp's satellite television and broadcast the Crucial Taunt performance from Wayne's basement, where Sharp and Benjamin converge. Sharp declines to offer Crucial Taunt a record contract, Cassandra breaks up with Wayne and departs with Benjamin for a tropical resort, Stacy reveals that she is pregnant with Wayne's child, and a fire destroys Wayne's house.

Dissatisfied, Wayne and Garth turn to the film's audience and halt proceedings. They restart the scene and unmask Benjamin as "Old Man Withers" in a ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' parody ending. Still unsatisfied, they start again with a "mega happy ending" in which Cassandra signs a record contract and reunites with Wayne, Garth begins a relationship with a waitress, and Benjamin learns that money and good looks do not necessarily bring happiness.

==Production==
''Wayne's World'' was greenlit by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1991. It was the second [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch]] following ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2017/02/02/mike-myers-couldnt-drive-during-waynes-world/ |title=Mike Myers couldn't drive during 'Wayne's World' |work=[[New York Post]] |date=2017-02-02 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Lorne Michaels]] hired [[Penelope Spheeris]] to direct, who had directed several music [[documentary film|documentaries]]. Spheeris said, "I had been just struggling as a female director in this business for many years. I was 45 years old when I got that job. I just kept hanging in there. And ''Wayne's World'' happened, and it sort of flipped my life around."&lt;ref name="Vanity-Fair"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pirnia |first=Garin |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/wanyes-world-25th-anniversary-penelope-spheeris-interview |title=How Wayne's World Made—and Broke—Its Director's Career |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=2017-02-06 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spheeris clashed with Myers during filming. She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that Myers was "emotionally needy and got more difficult as the shoot went along. You should have heard him bitching when I was trying to do that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' scene: 'I can't move my neck like that! Why do we have to do this so many times? No one is going to laugh at that!'" She said she attempted to assuage Myers by having her daughter provide him snacks,&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2008/06/16/mike-myers-man-mystery/|title=Mike Myers: Man of Mystery|date=2008-06-16|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on one occasion he stormed off the set, upset that there was no margarine for his bagel.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; Myers and Spheeris argued over the [[final cut (film editing)|final cut]] of the film, causing Myers to prevent Spheeris from directing ''[[Wayne's World 2|Wayne' World 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brandon Kirby |agency= |title=Mike Myers, Dana Carvey Set Aside 'Wayne's World' Feud at Academy Screening |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/waynes-world-feud-mike-myers-445044 |quote=Carvey and Spheeris both notoriously fell out with Myers despite the 1992 film's huge success.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an 84% "Certified Fresh" rating based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10, with the critical consensus stating, "An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catchphrases, ''Wayne's World'' is also fondly regarded because of its endearing characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waynes_world/|title=Wayne's World|website=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/waynes-world |title=Wayne's World Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roger Ebert]] said in his review: "I walked into ''Wayne's World'' expecting a lot of dumb, vulgar comedy, and I got plenty, but I also found what I didn't expect: a genuinely amusing, sometimes even intelligent, undercurrent." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waynes-world-1992|title=Wayne's World Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1992) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=Rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Desson Howe]] wrote in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' that making a movie out of such a "teeny sketch" is "better than you'd expect" but criticized the finale as "an attempt to lampoon movie endings" "and a despair-driven inability to end the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/waynesworldpg13howe_a0aea2.htm|title=Wayne's World (PG-13)|last=Howe|first=Desson|website=Washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on pop culture===

Filled with [[pop culture]] references, the sketches and the film started catchphrases such as "''Schwing!''" and "[[Sarcasm|Schyea]]", as well as popularizing "[[That's what she said]]", "Party on!" and the use of "[[Not!]]" after apparently affirmative sentences in order to state the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/schwing-mike-myers-dana-carveys-waynes-world-reunion-recap/ |title=Schwing!

'''''Witches' Flight''''' ({{lang-es|Vuelo de Brujas}}; also known as '''''Witches in Flight''''' or '''''Witches in the Air'''''), is an oil on canvas painting completed in 1798 by the Spanish painter [[Francisco Goya]]. It was part of a series of six paintings related to [[witchcraft]] acquired by the [[Pedro Téllez-Girón, 9th Duke of Osuna|Duke]] and [[María Josefa Pimentel, Duchess of Osuna|Duchess of Osuna]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;The six paintings were ''Witches' Flight'', ''[[The Spell (painting)|The Spell]]'', ''[[Witches' Sabbath (Goya, 1798)|Witches' Sabbath]]'', ''[[The Witches' Kitchen]]'', ''[[The Devil's Lamp]]'', and ''[[The Stone Guest (painting)|The Stone Guest]].'' ({{cite web |title=Sotheby's to sell original receipt for Goya painting in Danny Boyle's art heist movie Trance |publisher=ArtDaily |date=24 May 2013 |url=http://artdaily.org/news/62787/Sotheby-s-to-sell-original-receipt-for-Goya-painting-in-Danny-Boyle-s-art-heist-movie-Trance   |accessdate=31 August 2013}})&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been described as "the most beautiful and powerful of Goya's Osuna witch paintings."&lt;ref name="hughes2003"&gt;
{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Robert  |title=Goya |publisher=Harvill |year=2003  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wihUsJGg8sC&amp;pg=PT253&amp;dq=%22witches+in+the+air%22+goya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MAQiUoa3JaXYsASm5oHAAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22witches%20in%20the%20air%22%20goya&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-84343-054-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was sold to the Duke and Duchess of Osuna on 27 June 1798, to decorate their villa [[Parque de El Capricho|La Alameda]], on the outskirts of Madrid. It was then sold in 1896 at the public auction of the Osuna estate to Ramón Ibarra, and again in 1985 to [[Jaime Ortiz-Patino|Jaime Ortiz Patiño]]. Finally, it was acquired by the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]] in 1999, where it remains to this day.&lt;ref name="pradoes"&gt;

At center point are three semi-nude witches wearing penitential ''[[Sanbenito|coroza]]''&lt;ref&gt;
The English-language page for the painting instead identifies the hats as dunce caps. ({{cite web |title=The Witches' Flight |publisher=Museo del Prado |url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-witches-flight/ |accessdate=30 August 2013}})&lt;/ref&gt; 
bearing aloft a writhing nude figure, their mouths close to their victim, as if to [[Cannibalism|devour him]] or [[Vampirism|suck his blood]].&lt;ref&gt;
The Spanish-language page for the painting alternatively suggests that they are blowing air on their victim, as indicated by their swollen cheeks ({{cite web |title=Vuelo de brujas |url=http://www.museodelprado.es/goya-en-el-prado/obras/ficha/goya/vuelo-de-brujas/?tx_gbgonline_pi1%5Bgocollectionids%5D=47-48&amp;tx_gbgonline_pi1%5Bgosort%5D=b}}).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Below, two figures in peasants' garb recoil from the spectacle: one has thrown himself to the ground covering his ears, the other attempts to escape by covering himself with a blanket, making the  [[List of gestures#Fig sign|''figa'' hand gesture]] to [[Apotropaic magic|ward off]] the [[evil eye]]. Finally, a donkey emerges on the right, seemingly oblivious to the rest of the scene.

The general scholarly consensus is that the painting represents a rationalist critique of superstition and ignorance, particularly in religious matters: the witches' ''[[coroza]]s'' are not only emblematic of the violence of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (the upward flames indicate that they have been condemned as unrepentant heretics and will be burned at the stake),&lt;ref name="curbet2002"&gt;

but are also reminiscent of episcopal [[mitre]]s, bearing the characteristic double points. The accusations of religious tribunals are thus reflected back on themselves, whose actions are implicitly equated with superstition and ritualized sacrifice.&lt;ref name="boime1993"&gt;
{{cite book|first=Albert |last=Boime |title=Art in an Age of Bonapartism: 1800-1815 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TN1GznRC3nMC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=%22witches+in+flight%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QEMhUsH8NMjHsATe0YDgAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22witches%20in%20flight%22&amp;f=false|year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-06335-5 |page = 258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The bystanders can then be understood either as appalled but unable to do anything or willfully ignorant and unwilling to intervene.&lt;ref name="boime1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="curbet2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2003"/&gt;

The donkey, finally, is the traditional symbol of ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vuelo de brujas |publisher=Museo del Prado |url=http://www.museodelprado.es/goya-en-el-prado/obras/ficha/goya/vuelo-de-brujas/?tx_gbgonline_pi1%5Bgocollectionids%5D=47-48&amp;tx_gbgonline_pi1%5Bgosort%5D=b  |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
