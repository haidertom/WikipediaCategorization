'''Alexander Forbes''' (1778–1862) was a 19th-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] merchant, explorer, and author. His book ''California: A History of Upper and Lower California'', published in 1839, is perhaps the first full account in [[English language|English]] of [[California]].&lt;ref name="oieahc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oieahc.wm.edu/conferences/11thannual/images.htm | title=Images | work=OIEAHC 11th Annual Conference | publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture | accessdate=2013-04-21 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802042428/http://oieahc.wm.edu/conferences/11thannual/images.htm | archivedate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the brother of distinguished Scottish physician [[John Forbes (physician)|Sir John Forbes]].&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/19th_Century/forbes/forbes_biog.html |title=Agnew RAL.

Forbes grew up in the counties of [[Banffshire]] and [[Aberdeenshire]]. At some point, he emigrated to [[Tepic]], [[Mexico]], where he made his living as a merchant. He is also recorded as having been the British [[consul]] to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Resolution of the Legislature of Michigan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLcTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA1|series=Report no. 16|date=29 January 1850|publisher=State Legislature of Michigan|page=1|chapter=Eustace Barron and William and Alex. Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time here that he wrote his book. One of the remarkable aspects of the book is that Forbes wrote it without ever having visited California at the time.&lt;ref name="oieahc"/&gt;

At the time Forbes was writing, California was a province of [[Mexico]]. Forbes drew upon the accounts of California's [[Franciscan]] Padres to inform his work, as well as other agents, including southern California cattleman and landowner [[Abel Stearns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lapl.org/central/californiana.html | title=Californiana at the Los Angeles Public Library | publisher=Los Angeles Public Library | accessdate=2008-01-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131203856/http://www.lapl.org/central/californiana.html| archivedate= 31 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work contains extensive descriptions of Mexican California, including accounts of California's agriculture and its landscape. Forbes advocated that the [[United Kingdom]] take control of California, and suggested that the territory might be ceded to the UK in return for forgiving Mexico's debt to the [[British government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tshaonline.org/publications/journals/shq/online/v018/n3/article_1.html | title=The Early Sentiment For The Annexation Of California: An Account Of The Growth Of American Interest In California, 1835-1846 Iii | first=Robert Glass | last=Cleland | journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly Online | volume=18 | issue=3 |date=January 1915 | accessdate=2013-04-20 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123015316/http://www.tshaonline.org/publications/journals/shq/online/v018/n3/article_1.html | archivedate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Barron, Forbes &amp; Co., which was composed of Forbes, [[Eustace Barron]] (who served as consul before him), and the British vice-consul to California, [[James Alexander Forbes (1805-1881)|James Alexander Forbes]] (no relation), purchased the [[New Almaden]] [[mercury (element)|quicksilver]] mines from [[Andrés Castillero]], which proved to be extremely profitable. However, another man, [[José de los Reyes Berreyesa]], also lay claim to the mine on the basis that it lay on land given to him in a [[land grant]] by the Mexican governor of Alta California. Furthermore, [[Justo Larias]] also claimed ownership, and the United States government even stepped in to claim that the mine lay on public land. A complex legal case involving Mexican laws and the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "one of the most remarkable civil trials in this or any other country",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Commander of All Lincoln's Armies: A Life of General Henry W. Halleck | page=93 | first=John F. | last=Marszalek | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2004 | isbn=0-674-01493-6 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qPF5znzC8wEC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=forbes+castillero}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[United States v. Andres Castillero]]'' eventually reached the [[United States Supreme Court]] whereupon it was finally
decided in 1862 that, the mine was on the Larias grant, and that the furnaces and improvements of the company below the hill were on the Berreyessa grant. The company bought into these two titles and then sold the entire operation in 1864 to the [[Quicksilver Mining Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of San José and Surroundings: With Biographical Sketches of Early Settlers | first=Frederic | last=Hall | publisher=A.L.

Forbes, however, had moved to [[London]] in 1848 to stay with his brother. They retired to [[Whitchurch-on-Thames]] in 1859 after his brother suffered a series of strokes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; Forbes died in 1862 at the age of 84.

{{Accounting}}

Under the 'Average Cost Method', it is assumed that the cost of inventory is based on the average cost of the goods available for sale during the period.

The average cost is computed by dividing the total cost of goods available for sale by the total units available for sale. This gives a weighted-average unit cost that is applied to the units in the ending inventory. 

There are two commonly used average cost methods: Simple [[Weighted-average cost]] method and [[perpetual weighted-average cost]] method.

==Weighted Average Cost==
'''Weighted Average Cost''' is a method of calculating [[Ending Inventory]] cost.
It is also known as WAVCOs

It takes [[Cost of Goods Available for Sale]] and divides it by the number of units available for sale (number of goods from [[Beginning Inventory]] + [[Purchase]]s/production).  This gives a '''Weighted Average Cost per Unit'''. A physical count is then performed on the ending inventory to determine the number of goods left.  Finally, this quantity is multiplied by Weighted Average Cost per Unit to give an estimate of ending inventory cost. The cost of goods sold valuation is the amount of goods sold times the '''Weighted Average Cost per Unit'''. The sum of these two amounts (less a rounding error) equals the total actual cost of all purchases and beginning inventory.

==Moving-Average Cost==
'''Moving-Average (Unit) Cost''' is a method of calculating [[Ending Inventory]] cost. 

Assume that both [[Beginning Inventory]] and beginning inventory cost are known.  From them the ''Cost per Unit of Beginning Inventory'' can be calculated.  During the year, multiple purchases are made.  Each time, purchase costs are added to beginning inventory cost to get ''Cost of Current Inventory''.  Similarly, the number of units bought is added to beginning inventory to get ''Current Goods Available for Sale''.  After each purchase, Cost of Current Inventory is divided by Current Goods Available for Sale to get ''Current Cost per Unit on Goods''.

Also during the year, multiple [[Sales|sale]]s happen. The Current Goods Available for Sale is deducted by the amount of goods sold, and the Cost of Current Inventory is deducted by the amount of goods sold times the latest (before this sale) Current Cost per Unit on Goods.  This deducted amount is added to [[Cost of Goods Sold]].

At the end of the year, the last Cost per Unit on Goods, along with a physical count, is used to determine ending inventory cost.

'''Bound to Rise: Radical Ideas For The New Corporate World''', the second book by Indian author and communications expert Sunil Robert, is a guide to young entrants to the corporate world. It is a part memoir, and part self-help book advising young executives on how to deal with the high stress and constant pressure of the corporate environment, and find fulfilment. The author delves into his personal experiences in the corporate world, spanning 25 years and covering [[India]], [[UK]] and the [[US]] and uses philosophical metaphors to explain the necessity of accepting change by adjusting our mindsets to embrace change.

The book is split into chapters that follow a style of following the progress of an individual from one role to another, the former emphasizing a ‘reactive’ person and the latter emphasizing a ‘responsive’ one. These shifts are explained through anecdotes, philosophy, observations and narration.

Sunil is a global executive with a career spanning 25 years across India, Europe and North America.

'''Carlos Leôncio (Nhonhô) de Magalhães''' (1875 in [[Araraquara]] – 1931 in [[São Paulo]]) was a Brazilian farmer and businessman. Nhonhô is considered to be one of the [[coffee kings]]&lt;ref&gt;MARTINS, Ana Luiza, História do Café, Editora Contexto, 2008, São Paulo – SP, Brasil.&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the richest Brazilian farmers of the early 20th century. Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães started to work as a farmer during his early life and his name is connected to some of the most important farms of the Western part of the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], among which are Cambuí, Barreiro Rico and Itaquerê. Later on, these farms developed into towns, such as [[Matão]], [[Nova Europa]], [[Santa Ernestina]], [[Gavião Peixoto]] and [[Tabatinga]].

== Family ==

=== Ancestors ===
The [[Magalhães]] (or in English "Magellan") are a family whose origins are in Portugal. Nhonhô's grandparents, Francisco Carlos de Magalhães and Bernarda Rodrigues Monteiro, emigrated from Portugal and settled in [[Niterói]], [[Rio de Janeiro State|Rio de Janeiro]], where they became affluent businessmen. Their eldest son, Carlos Baptista de Magalhães, was educated in two of the most exclusive schools in Brazil at that time, the Colégio do Santuário da Serra do Caraça (in the state of [[Minas Gerais]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santuariodocaraca.com.br/cultura/lista_alunos.php |title=Lista de ex-alunos do Santuário do Caraça |accessdate=1 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503183455/http://www.santuariodocaraca.com.br/cultura/lista_alunos.php |archivedate=3 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Colégio Pedro II]] (in the state of Rio de Janeiro), where he studied with some of the most prominent figures of Brazilian national politics, such as [[Joaquim Nabuco]] and [[Rodrigues Alves]]. However, after Francisco Carlos de Magalhães lost a considerable part of his wealth, Carlos Baptista de Magalhães had to move to Araraquara, São Paulo, in order to start working as a commercial representative.

[[Image:Vista Santuário do Caraça MG.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Colégio do Santuário da Serra do Caraça]]

Once in Araraquara, Carlos Baptista de Magalhães married D. Leôncia de Freitas Magalhães, the daughter of Justino Correia de Freitas and Anna de Arruda, from the traditional Arruda family of Araraquara. Carlos Baptista de Magalhães became a very important land owner, banker, businessman and politician and, in partnership with the family of his wife, founded the Estrada de Ferro Araraquara (Araraquara Railway) in 1895, becoming its first president. He was also a town councilor and led a monarchial uprise in the region, known as Revolução do Sertãozinho (Sertãozinho Revolution). Nonetheless, a few years after he assumed the presidency of the Partido Republicano Paulista - PRP ([[Republican Party of São Paulo]]).

Through his mother's family, Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães is connected to the most traditional families of São Paulo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k-kRAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Revista Genealógica Latina|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1525}}&lt;/ref&gt; among which one can identify the Arrudas, the Laras, the Alvarengas, the Prados, the Taques, the Proenças, the Barros, the Pires, the Cubas and the Moraes de Antas.&lt;ref&gt;TOLEDO, Roberto Pompeu de, A Capital da Solidão: Uma história de São Paulo das origens a 1900, Editora Objetiva, 2003, Rio de Janeiro – RJ, Brasil&lt;/ref&gt; These families, which rank among the first in Brazilian soil, descend from Portuguese gentry and are connected to the Portuguese, French, Aragonese, Castillan and Navarrese royal families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/P/|title=GeneAll, site de genealogias, seção de genealogia portuguesa|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães had two sisters, Maria Dulce de Magalhães (Nicota), married to Valdomiro Pinto Alves, and Maria Elisa de Magalhães (Zilota), married to Sebastião Lebeis. Waldomiro was the son of Antonio Alves Pereira de Almeida and Gertrudes Eufrozina Pinto. Sebastião Lebeis (Rio Claro, 1874 – São Paulo 1936) was the son of Guilherme Lebeis and Escolástica de Arruda Botelho.

=== Lineage ===
Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães married Ernestina Reis de Magalhães (Rio de Janeiro, 1876 – São Paulo, 1968), the daughter of José Monteiro Reis and Adelaide Monteiro Palha, from Rio de Janeiro. They had eight children: Maria José (who died before she was one year old), Carlos (1903 – 1985), Oswaldo (19?? – 1974), Ernestina (1908–2000), Maria Cecilia (1911–1999), Paulo (1913 – 1996), Adelaide (1917) and José Carlos (1921–2002). Carlos Reis de Magalhães, Oswaldo Reis de Magalhães, Paulo Reis de Magalhães and José Carlos Reis de Magalhães were the managers of the Itaquerê Company, which had been founded by Nhonhô Magalhães and concentrated the majority of his estates. Beyond this occupation, Paulo Magalhães was the president of several national and multinational companies, such as [[Alpargatas]], [[Philips]] and [[Rhodia (company)]] and José Carlos de Magalhães became a Brazilian ornithologist, whose researches were made at the Barreiro Rico Farm.

Carlos married Marieta Lion and had two daughters. Oswaldo married Jandira Rondon and didn't have any child. Paulo married Marina Bastos and had five children. Ernestina married Roberto de Paiva Meira and had two children. Maria Cecilia married Antonio Ângelo Maria Duprat, viscount of Duprat, and had three children. Adelaide married Nestor Sacramento Rocha and had two daughters. José Carlos married Cecília Alves and had five children.

In spite of being tightly connected to the countryside, Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães bought a house in the early 1910s, located in Higienópolis (a wealthy neighborhood in São Paulo central area) and moved in with all his family. A few years later he decided to build a new house in the same avenue, but he died in 1931, before seeing the achievement of his last project. He was 56 years old when died of cancer.

== Businesses ==

=== Farms ===
Nhonhô started his professional life as a farm manager, helping his father with the administration of the family properties. When Carlos Leôncio was around twenty years old he  started developing new farms in Matão, in order to sell them afterwards to foreign investors.

==== Cambuí Farm ====
The best investment of Nhonhô's life was the Cambuí (or Cambuhy) farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueim.ufscar.br/publicacoes/CatalogoDoFundoCarlosLeoncioMagalhaes.pdf |title=Site da Unidade Especial de Informação e Memória da Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Catálogo do Fundo Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães |accessdate=1 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232537/http://www.ueim.ufscar.br/publicacoes/CatalogoDoFundoCarlosLeoncioMagalhaes.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he bought a huge portion of land (around 605 square kilometers, or 233.6 square miles), an area in which are located today three towns ([[Matão]], [[Nova Europa]] and [[Gavião Peixoto]]). In this estate, Carlos Leôncio de Magalhães created the Companhia Agrícola e Pastoril d'Oeste de São Paulo - CIAPOSP, sold in 1924 to an English investment group for half a million pounds, or more than ten times what he had paid when he bought the farm. This was the highest value paid for any property in Brazil until then. This English group, called Brazilian Warrant Co, established the Cambuhy Coffee and Cotton Estates Limited.&lt;ref&gt;CASALECCHI, José Ênio, Da Companhia Industrial, Agrícola e Pastoril D`Oeste de São Paulo à Cambuhy Coffee and Cotton Estates, 1976, Araraquara – SP, Brasil.&lt;/ref&gt;

The estate that had been sold to the English investment group was formed by 19 farms (Cambuí, Alabama, Boa Vista, Santa Josefa, Retiro, Palmas, Guanabara, Niterói, Água Sumida, São João, Flórida, Califórnia, Arizona, Contribuição, Mato Grosso, Barreiro, Virgínia, Tamandaré and Pedregulho), which had in total 3 million coffee trees and approximately 15 thousand cows. These farms were connected by 300 kilometers of roads and 70 kilometers of railways with ten railway stations (Toryba, Teixeira Leite, Cambuhy, Uparoba, Gavião Peixoto, Nova Paulicéia, Nova Europa, Matão, Ponte Alta e Santa Josefa). The Cambuí farm had more than 3 thousand employees and produced around 3,5 million kilos of coffee per year.&lt;ref&gt;CASALECCHI, José Ênio, Da Companhia Industrial, Agrícola e Pastoril D`Oeste de São Paulo à Cambuhy Coffee and Cotton Estates, 1976, Araraquara – SP, Brasil.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Itaquerê farm ====
Nhonhô kept a small (but yet considerable) part of the Cambuí farm, where he established the Itaquerê farm. The name of this estate comes from the Itaquerê river, which crosses the farm. The property had 21.5 square miles and it was built to be a model of diversified production, even if coffee continued to be its main output. Carlos Leôncio also built a sugar mill (which was operated by the Companhia Açucareira Itaquerê, today called Usina Santa Fé) and a small hydroelectric power plant. Both plants are still in operation and the power plant still uses all the original machinery from 1928.

The Itaquerê farm was sold by Carlos Leôncio's heirs to the Malzoni family, which changed the name of the property to Santa Fé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usinasantafe.com.br/historico.html|title=Site da Fazenda Santa Fé|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Barreiro Rico Farm ====

Another farm that belonged to Nhonhô was the Barreiro Rico, which was bought in 1926 and which is located in [[Anhembi]], alongside the [[Tietê River]]. This farm of 74.75 square miles produced wood and bred [[nelore]]. The breeding of this type of cattle started in 1935, making the Barreiro Rico one of the first breeding farms still in activity in Brazil. At the beginning Nhonhô himself was the responsible for the management of the farm (from 1926 to 1931), but after that his sons Oswaldo (from 1931 to 1958) and José Carlos (from 1958 to 2001) administrated the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barreirorico.com.br/|title=Site da Fazenda Barreiro Rico|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealand Parliament passed the third and final reading of the Accounting Infrastructure Reform Bill (AIRB) on 30 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.national.org.nz/news/news/media-releases/detail/2014/10/30/bill-to-improve-accounting-and-audit-industries-passes-third-reading | title=Bill to improve accounting and audit industries passes third reading | publisher=New Zealand National Party | date=30 October 2014 | accessdate=25 April 2015 | author=Goldsmith, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Charter and By-laws for Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand were approved and signed by [[Peter Cosgrove]], [[Governor-General of Australia]] on 26 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014G02080 | title=Approval of Supplemental Royal Charter and By Laws of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand | publisher=Commonwealth of Australia | date=17 Dec 2014 | accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal structure of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, was formally implemented on 31 December 2014

==Governance==

A Council is elected and appointed by members regionally. The Council is responsible for appointing the Board and assisting management in ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of Members. 
The Council also advises the Board and management on Member and strategic issues.

The Board is the delegated decision-making body. It operates on a corporate model and has oversight responsibility for the development and approval of long term strategy and performance including key policy issues and oversight of risk.

The Strategic Leadership Team supports the CEO and is responsible for the day-to-day operation.

Regional Councils represent Members in Australia and New Zealand by providing a voice for the Members in their region and advising the Council on member issues.

Every Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Member living in New Zealand is represented by a Local Leadership Team (LLT) in their area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charteredaccountantsanz.com/en/Site-Content/Our-Story/Governance.aspx | title=Governance | publisher=Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand | accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

===Chartered Accountants===
The [[Chartered Accountant]] (CA) designation denotes an accountant qualified to offer the full range of accountancy services privately and to the public.

===Associate Chartered Accountants===

The ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' (ACA) designation is a mid-level qualification.  The designation recognises individuals who may not wish to train to be Chartered Accountants but who want to be recognised for their skills in business and finance. The ACA designation is currently available in New Zealand only.

The designation ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' is not directly comparable to the ''Associate Chartered Accountant'' (ACA) designation offered by the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] , the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]].

===Accounting Technicians===
The Accounting Technician (AT) designation is for individuals employed to oversee and manage financial accounts in roles such as Accounts Manager or Assistant Finance Manager. The AT designation is currently available in New Zealand only.

New Zealand's practice in this respect is not followed in other countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, accounting technicians generally belong to the [http://www.aat.org.uk Association of Accounting Technicians].

===Fellowship===
Fellowships (FCA) are awards granted to Chartered Accountants ANZ members to recognise outstanding achievement in and/or contribution to the profession of accountancy at either a local, national or international level.

==Public practice==
Chartered Accountants may apply for a ''Certificate of Public Practice''. Every member who offers accounting services to the public must be a Chartered Accountant and hold a Certificate of Public Practice (CPP). The requirements for the issuing of this certificate are that (amongst others) a member must have had two years of acceptable practical experience while a member of the College of Chartered Accountants and have attended a course for new practitioners.

'''Christchurch Central City''' is the geographical centre and the heart of [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. It is defined as the area within the four avenues (Bealey Avenue, Fitzgerald Avenue, Moorhouse Avenue and Deans Avenue&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ResidentialDevelopment-OccupiedDwellings-docs.pdf Christchurch City Council definition]&lt;/ref&gt;) and thus includes the densely built up central city, some less dense surrounding areas of residential, educational and industrial usage, and green space including [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|Hagley Park]], the [[Christchurch Botanic Gardens]] and the [[Barbadoes Street Cemetery]].

It suffered heavy damage in the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]] and was devastated in the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. Following this second earthquake, the [[Central City Red Zone]] was set up and, with a gradually shrinking area, remained inaccessible except to authorised contractors until June 2013. However, proposals to relocate the city centre elsewhere, to avoid future damage, were considered both uneconomical (as much of the infrastructure was still mainly intact) and unnecessary, as the rebuilt city centre would be to modern building standards so as to be able to withstand similar quakes and liquefaction in the future.&lt;ref name=STAYS&gt;{{cite news|title=City centre stays despite quake|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10732989|accessdate=11 July 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=18 June 2011|first=Simon|last=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
At the centre of the city is [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]], surrounding the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral, [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|Christ Church]]. The area around this square and within the four avenues of Christchurch is considered the central business district of the city.

The city centre is laid out in a grid pattern, interrupted only by the curvilinear alignment of the [[Avon River (Canterbury)|Avon River]], and the two diagonals High Street and Victoria Street. Christchurch has four pairs of one-way streets. The grid pattern within the outermost one-way streets is very regular, as this is the area that was laid out in the original survey. The surrounding area, i.e. the belt between the outer one-way streets and the avenues, was developed later in a progressive fashion and does not have the regularity of the core area.

Like most of the city, the centre is relatively flat.

== History ==

===European settlement===
[[File:Captain Joseph Thomas, 1840.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1840 portrait of Captain [[Joseph Thomas (surveyor)|Joseph Thomas]], the surveyor of [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] and Christchurch]]
The European settlement of Christchurch was undertaken by the [[Canterbury Association]], which was founded in London in 1848. That year, the Canterbury Association sent out Captain [[Joseph Thomas (surveyor)|Joseph Thomas]], accompanied by surveyors, to select and prepare a site for settlement. Thomas originally placed the principal town of the proposed settlement at the head of [[Lyttelton Harbour]], but when he realised there was insufficient flat land there to meet the Canterbury Association's requirements, he relocated Christchurch to where he had previously placed a town called 'Stratford' at a point on the Avon where those coming up the river first encountered slightly higher, drier ground.&lt;ref name="Context"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ChristchurchCityContextualHistoryOverviewFull-docs.pdf | title = Contextual Historical Overview for Christchurch City| type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back then, the Avon River was navigable as far as 'The Bricks' just upstream of the Barbadoes Street bridge. The site is these days marked by a riverbank cairn. The site got its name when the Deans Brothers in the 1840s had shipped bricks for their [[Riccarton, New Zealand|Riccarton]] homestead up the Avon River, which they unloaded in this location.
[[File:TheBricks.png|thumb|The Bricks on the southern bank of the Avon River. One of the huts is believed to have belonged to Joseph Thomas. The inserts show the First Four Ships that landed the colonists in 1850. Painted by John Dury in 1851.]]

===Survey layout===
[[File:Christchurch Survey 969.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]] commemorating the Christchurch survey]]
Christchurch is one of a group of only four cities in the world that have been carefully planned following the same layout of a central city square, four complimenting city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that embrace the city centre. The first city built with this pattern was [[Philadelphia]], later came [[Oglethorpe Plan|Savannah]] and [[Adelaide]]. The fourth city using this pattern was Christchurch. As such Christchurch holds an important legacy and a strong platform for future development.

Thomas' plan for Christchurch (laid out by the surveyor [[Edward Jollie]] by March 1850) was the 'standard' rectangular grid of colonial settlement (adopted for ease of survey and to facilitate land sales). Thomas did not allow Jollie to include crescents to provide variety, but the Avon River ran eccentrically across the site. Two diagonal streets (High Street/Ferry Road leading to [[Ferrymead]], [[Heathcote Valley|Heathcote]] and [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] and Victoria Street/Papanui Road leading to the [[Papanui]] Bush) also broke the regularity of the grid. At the very centre of the city was a 'Square' (which is actually cross-shaped) intended as a grand centre for the city and the site of the proposed cathedral and grammar school. East and north-west of the Square were two more 'squares' ([[Latimer Square|Latimer]] and [[Cranmer Square]]s, which are actually rectangles) which were placed more or less regularly in relation to the diagonal line of the Avon running in a north-easterly direction across the city to the west and north of the central square.

The grid was laid out originally between Salisbury Street to the north and St Asaph Street to the south and between Barbadoes Street to the east and Rolleston Avenue/Park Terrace to the west. Between Salisbury, Barbadoes and St Asaph Streets and (respectively) the North, East and South Town Belts (these days called Bealey, Fitzgerald and Moorhouse Avenues) were 'town reserves', i.e. land with-held from immediate sale, which was sold off by the Provincial Government later in the 1850s to overcome cash flow problems. The streets of the original grid were mostly projected out to the Town Belts, but the street system is less systematic in the former 'town reserves'. The names chosen for the streets of the inner city almost all commemorate the English colonial origins of the settlement. The names chosen later for the town belts commemorate important personalities of early Christchurch.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; Jollie explains in his diary how the streets got their names:&lt;ref name="Jollie's diary"&gt;{{cite web|title=6. Christchurch: 1849–1851 |url= http://sites.google.com/site/marapito/jollie_06 |publisher=Canterbury Heritage |accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The names of the streets of the three towns I surveyed were taken from Bishoprics and the way it was done was this; as soon as I completed the map I took it to Thomas who putting on his gold spectacles and opening his&lt;!-- there's a noun missing here, and it's also missing in the original --&gt; would read out a Bishop's name to hear if it sounded well. If I agreed with him that it did, I put the name to one of the streets requiring baptism.

Lyttelton being the first born town got the best names for its streets, Sumner being next had the next best and Christchurch being the youngest had to be content with chiefly Irish and Colonial bishoprics as names for its streets. This accounts for, what to anyone not knowing the circumstances, appears strange, viz: that many of the best English Bishoprics are not represented while Irish and Colonial ones are. Sumner in fact died too late for the names there used to be again employed in Christchurch.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original plan from 1850 shows the north-west corner of the 'town reserves' (surrounded by the Avon River, Fitzgerald and Bealey Avenues and Barbadoes Street, with an additional small rectangular area to the west of Barbadoes Street) as the cemetery for the settlement. Individual town sections were shown on the survey plan, the Black Map, and numbered by the surveyors in a logical order, in contrast to the rural sections surrounding Christchurch, which were numbered at the time of and in the order of their purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rural Sections Chosen |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=LT18510301.2.13 |accessdate=16 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Lyttelton Times]] |volume=I |issue=8 |date=1 March 1851 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following streets were those laid out in the 1850 survey (listed east to west, then north to south, then diagonals). Where a street name is one of the original names as devised by surveyors Joseph Thomas and Edward Jollie, this is marked as such.

====Streets running north-south====
[[File:Black Map Christchurch 1850.jpg|thumb|Christchurch Black Map from March 1850]]
* Deans Avenue – the original name for this street was West Belt. In 1905, it got renamed to Rolleston Avenue, but was called West Belt again in 1906. Deans Avenue is named after the Deans family, who farmed at Riccarton from 1843 onwards.&lt;ref name="CSN-C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-C-E.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names C to E|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=7, 8, 24, 107, 137, 173, 218|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harper Avenue – this street was formerly called Park Road and North Park Road. It was so named because it runs alongside Hagley Park. It was renamed Harper Avenue by city council resolution on 18 May 1931 in honour of the retiring chairman of the ''Christchurch Domains Board'' George Harper (1843–1937).&lt;ref name="CSN-F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-F-K.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names F to K|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=19, 25, 68, 85, 154, 194, 199, 303|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rolleston Avenue – this street formerly belonged to Antigua Street. The section between Cambridge Terrace and Armagh Street was renamed in honour of [[William Rolleston]] on 11 January 1903, about one month before his passing. This street was chosen because of his association with Canterbury College (now the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]], which adjoined Antigua Street and also because it was proposed to erect [[Rolleston Statue|his statue]] there.&lt;ref name="CSN-R"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-R-S.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names R to S|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=51, 85, 171|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Park Terrace – this street appears as Mill Road on an 1862 map. Park Terrace, named because it runs adjacent to Hagley Park, first appears in street directories in 1880.&lt;ref name="CSN-L"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-L-Q.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names L to Q|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=13, 32, 75, 92, 177, 180, 271, 286, 309|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cranmer Square (original street name) – Cranmer Square is adjacent to the square of the same name and is named after the martyred [[Oxford]] bishop [[Thomas Cranmer]].&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Montreal Street (original street name) – this street is named after the [[Anglican Diocese of Montreal]] in Canada. The surveyors ran out of English bishoprics to use as street names so moved on to other colonies.&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Durham Street (original street name) – the street was named after the [[Diocese of Durham]]. On 21 October 1985 the council resolved for the two separate sections of Durham Street (between Gloucester Street and Cashel Street, which is part of Cambridge Terrace) to be renamed Durham Street North and South.&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* [[Colombo Street]] (original street name) – this street is named after the colonial Anglican bishopric [[Colombo]] in what at the time was known as [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]].&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Manchester Street (original street name) – this street is named after [[William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester]], who was a member of the Canterbury association in 1848.&lt;!-- When you look at the source, it talks about 1858 and not 1848, i.e. after the Christchurch survey. This 1858 year is a typo and the library will fix this when they next upload the PDFs onto their webserver. Note that the Canterbury Association was wound up in 1853.--&gt;&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Latimer Square (original street name) – the street adjacent to Latimer Square is named after the martyred [[Oxford]] bishop [[Hugh Latimer]].&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Madras Street (original street name) – this street is named after the colonial Anglican bishopric of [[Chennai|Madras]] (now known as Chennai) in [[India]].&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Barbadoes Street (original street name) – this street is named after the Anglican colonial [[Diocese of Barbados]] in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], now known as the Caribbean. The Christchurch spelling of Barbados with an additional 'e' is as per the original survey plan drawn by Edward Jollie.&lt;ref name="CSN-A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-A-B.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names A to B|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=49, 118, 154|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fitzgerald Ave – the original names for this street were East Town Belt and East Belt. The street was renamed by council on 11 January 1904 in honour of [[James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)|James FitzGerald]].&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;
[[File:High, Manchester and Lichfield Streets in Christchurch, 8 May 1923.jpg|thumb|Intersection of High, Manchester and Lichfield Streets, Christchurch, 8 May 1923]]

====Streets running east-west====
* Bealey Avenue – the original name for this street was North Belt and North Town Belt. On 11 January 1904, it got renamed in honour of Canterbury's third [[Superintendent (politics)|Superintendent]] [[Samuel Bealey]], who owned land in this area.&lt;ref name="CSN-A"/&gt;
* Salisbury Street (original street name) – the street is named after the English [[Diocese of Salisbury]].&lt;ref name="CSN-R"/&gt;
* Peterborough Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Anglican Diocese of Peterborough]].&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Kilmore Street (original street name) – the street is named after the Irish [[Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Diocese of Kilmore]].&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;
* Chester Street (original street name) – the street is named after the English Anglican [[Diocese of Chester]]. It appears in 1883 street directories as Chester Street between East Town Belt and Colombo Street, and Chester Street West between Cambridge Terrace and Park Terrace. Chester Street West was renamed Cranmer Terrace for a short time in the 1950s because of the gap in Chester Street between Colombo Street and Cambridge Terrace. It reverted to its earlier name when the residents found that there was confusion with Cranmer Square.&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Armagh Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Diocese of Armagh]].&lt;ref name="CSN-A"/&gt;
* Gloucester Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of Gloucester]].&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;
[[File:View looking west-south-west from the Cathedral Tower, Christchurch.jpg|left|thumb|Worcester Street and Cathedral Square from the ChristChurch Cathedral]]
* Worcester Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester]].&lt;ref name="CSN-T"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-T-Z.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names T to Z|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=58, 84, 170|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hereford Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of Hereford]].
* Cashel Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Bishop of Cashel and Waterford|bishopric of Cashel]].&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Lichfield Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of Lichfield]].&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Tuam Street (original street name) – the street is named after the Irish [[Diocese of Tuam, Killala and Achonry|Diocese of Tuam]].&lt;ref name="CSN-T"/&gt;
* St Asaph Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of St Asaph]] in Wales.&lt;ref name="CSN-R"/&gt;
* Moorhouse Avenue – the original name for this street was South Belt and South Town Belt. On 11 January 1904, it got renamed in honour of Canterbury's second superintendent [[William Sefton Moorhouse]], who had championed the development of [[Lyttelton Line|Christchurch-Lyttelton railway]] and the [[Lyttelton rail tunnel]]. It was thus thought appropriate that the avenue adjacent to the railway be named after him.&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;

====Other streets====
* Cambridge Terrace (original street name) – the street is named after the [[University of Cambridge]] in England. Waterloo Terrace was the name on the first plan of the road along the Avon River from Market Place (now Victoria Square) to past the Foresters' Hall, i.e. from near the Oxford-on-Avon and the [[Plunket Society]] round to near the Centennial Leisure Centre. Avonside Road was the section just south of the Barbadoes Street Cemetery, adjacent to the river bank and the river, across the river from the Avon Loop, east of Barbadoes Street and round to Fitzgerald Avenue.&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Oxford Terrace (original street name) – the street is named after the [[University of Oxford]]. [[John Robert Godley]], considered to be the founder of Christchurch, had studied at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], one of the colleges of the University of Oxford.&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* [[Victoria Street (Christchurch)|Victoria Street]] – this street was originally named Whately Road after [[Richard Whately]], who was a member of the Canterbury Association. It was renamed Victoria Street in 1877 after a petition signed by 61 residents was presented asking that the name be changed. The current street name commemorates [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="CSN-T"/&gt;
* High Street – this street was originally named Sumner Road, as it connected to the village of Sumner. At the time, Sumner was of great importance to Christchurch, as a road over the [[Port Hills]] was to be built connecting [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] with Sumner. The section north of St Asaph Street was renamed High Street.&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;
* Ferry Road – the CBD end of Ferry Road was originally called Sumner Road. The section south of St Asaph Street was renamed Lower High Street, and then Ferry Road.&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;

===Important Canterbury Association members===
The prime movers of the Canterbury Association were [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] and John Robert Godley. Godley, with his family, went out to New Zealand in early 1850 to oversee the preparations for the settlement (surveying, roads, accommodation, etc.) undertaken by Captain Joseph Thomas' team. These preparations were advanced, but incomplete when the first ships of settlers arrived on 16 December 1850, having been halted by Godley shortly after his arrival in April due to the mounting debts of the Association. The ''[[Charlotte-Jane]]'' and ''[[Randolph (ship)|Randolph]]'' arrived in Lyttelton Harbour on the 16th, {{ship||Sir George Seymour|1844 ship|2}} on the 17th, and ''[[Cressy (ship)|Cressy]]'' on the 27th, having set sail from England in September 1850. The settlers on these [[First Four Ships]] were dubbed the ''Canterbury Pilgrims'' by the British press. A further 24 shiploads of Canterbury Association settlers, making a total of approximately 3,500, arrived over the next two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~nzbound/cbyassoc.htm Canterbury Association].&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010/11 earthquakes===
The central city was among the most heavily damaged areas of Christchurch following the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]]. Many building façades collapsed into the streets and authorities cordoned off large areas of the central city following the event. [[Manchester Courts]], the tallest commercial building in Christchurch when it was built in 1905–06 and a Category I heritage building suffered serious structural damage and was the first major building that was demolished, with the demolition finishing just days before the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Demolition for historic high-rise"&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway |first=Glenn |title=Demolition for historic high-rise |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch/4205226/Demolition-for-historic-high-rise |accessdate=7 October 2010 |newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=7 October 2010 |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly six months later on Tuesday 22 February 2011, [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|a second earthquake]] measuring magnitude 6.3 struck the city at 12:51&amp;nbsp;pm. It was located closer to the city,&lt;ref name="GeoNet6.3"&gt;{{Cite web

A large number of heritage buildings have been demolished since the earthquake, and most of the [[List of tallest buildings in Christchurch|city's high rise buildings]], including [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Christchurch|Hotel Grand Chancellor]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers, Christchurch|PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[Clarendon Tower]], and [[Implosion of Radio Network House|Radio Network House]] have been demolished.

Many churches have been demolished following the earthquakes, including [[Durham Street Methodist Church]], [[Oxford Terrace Baptist Church]], [[St Luke's Church, Christchurch]], [[St Paul's Church, Christchurch|St Paul's Church]], and [[St John the Baptist Church, Christchurch|St John the Baptist Church]]. Other churches are badly damaged and their fate is undecided, including the [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]] and the Anglican [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]]. A replacement Anglican cathedral, the [[Cardboard Cathedral]], opened in August 2013 on the site of the former St John the Baptist Church.&lt;ref name=opening&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Ashleigh |title=Emotional moment for bishop at handover of new cathedral &lt;!-- title of online version is "Cardboard cathedral finally unveiled" --&gt; |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8996908/Bishop-keyed-up-at-cardboard-cathedral-handover-ceremony |accessdate=3 August 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=3 August 2013 |page=A3 |location=[[Christchurch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Hagley Park 01.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the central city in July 2012, with many of the earthquake-damaged [[List of tallest buildings in Christchurch|tall building]]s still standing]]

=== Overview ===
The Central City offered well over 450 unique retail businesses and over 130 cafes, restaurants, bars and clubs. It had the largest selection of fashion, food, café and entertainment in the [[South Island]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christchurchcity.org.nz/index.php Central City Business Association website&lt;/ref&gt;

The central city has a number of residential areas, including Inner City East, Inner City West, Avon Loop, Moa Neighbourhood &amp; Victoria. South of Tuam Street, commercial usage and some light industries are present. With over 6,000 full-time equivalent students, the [[Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology]] is the major education provider in the city centre.

Cathedral Square was a popular destination and hosts attractions such as the speakers' corner made famous by the [[Wizard of New Zealand]], Ian Brackenbury Channell, and evangelist [[Ray Comfort]].

A [[Christchurch tramway system|central city heritage tram]] system has been operated since 1995. In 2010, the system was extended to the south to form a figure of eight. The tram system does not fulfil a transport function and is aimed at the tourism market.

In 2010 the Christchurch City Council released "A City For People Action Plan", a program of work through to 2022 to improve public spaces within the central city to entice more inner city residents and visitors. A primary action is to reduce the impact of motorised private vehicles and increase the comfort of pedestrians and cyclists. The plan is based on a report prepared for the council by renowned Danish design firm Gehl Architects.

=== Precincts ===
The central city includes the pedestrianised Cashel and High Streets, known as [[City Mall, Christchurch|City Mall]]. At one end of the mall stands the [[Bridge of Remembrance]]; at the intersection of Cashel and High Streets is the old location of the amphitheatre known as the [[Hack Circle]]; and the portion of High Street up to the junction of Colombo and Hereford Streets forms the remaining part of the mall. The concept of a pedestrian mall originated in 1965 as part of a central city redevelopment study. The project was publicly notified in the 1968 District Scheme, and again in the 1979 review. In 1981, the Christchurch City Council, in collaboration with the Cashel and High Street Businessmen's Associations, adopted a design and authorised implementation. The streets were closed to traffic on 11 January 1982 and the Mall was opened by the former Mayor, Sir [[Hamish Hay]], on 7 August 1982.
[[File:New Zealand Christchurch Bridge of rememberence.jpg|thumb|The [[Bridge of Remembrance]] in Cashel Street]] On 17 December 2009, a revamped City Mall was opened by mayor [[Bob Parker (mayor)|Bob Parker]], incorporating the tourist tram through the mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3173714/Christchurch-mall-revamp-injects-new-life |title=City Mall revamp opened |last=Conway |first=Glenn |date=18 December 2009 |publisher=The Press |page=A3 |accessdate=20 January 2010 |location=Christchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bridge of Remembrance was opened on Armistice Day, 11 November 1924 by the Governor-General, Admiral of the Fleet, Lord Jellicoe, who had previously laid the foundation stone on Anzac Day, 25 April 1923. The road through the bridge was removed and the short stretch between Oxford Terrace and Cambridge Terrace opened as a pedestrian precinct on 25 April 1977 (Anzac Day) by Captain [[Charles Upham]], i.e. this stretch became a pedestrian precinct some five years before the establishment of City Mall.&lt;ref&gt;http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Places/Memorials/BridgeofRemembrance/ Christchurch City Libraries information on the Bridge of Remembrance&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pedestrianised street is [[New Regent Street]], which has building facades in the Spanish Mission style. It became a pedestrian mall as part of the heritage tram loop in 1995. The street survived the earthquake with little damage, and is now functioning with several shops, and appearances by the Wizard of New Zealand.
[[File:Shops in New Regent Street.jpg|left|thumb|Spanish Mission building frontages in New Regent Street]]

Prior to the earthquakes, the [[Christchurch City Council]] was considering turning a section of Oxford Terrace (the section between Cashel Street and Hereford Street, then known as ''[[The Strip (Christchurch)|The Strip]]'') into a part-time pedestrian mall (nightly from 11&amp;nbsp;pm to 5&amp;nbsp;am).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Terrace part-time pedestrian mall proposal|url= http://www1.ccc.govt.nz/council/agendas/2009/july/hagleyferrymead15th/hagleyferrymeadcommunityboardagenda15july2009.pdf |publisher=[[Christchurch City Council]] |accessdate=5 July 2013 |format=PDF |date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since around 2005, two precincts have developed in small central city lanes, known as ''Poplar Lane'' and ''South of Lichfield'' or ''SOL Square''. A large number of bars are accommodated in these two areas, with a very active night life. These areas complement ''The Strip'', a part of Oxford Terrace that started to support outdoor dining during the day and night time entertainment in the 1990s.

The Cultural Precinct [http://www.culturalprecinct.co.nz/] provides a backdrop to a vibrant scene of ever-changing arts, cultural, and heritage attractions within an area of less than one square kilometre. The [[Christchurch Arts Centre|Arts Centre]], the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]], the [[Christchurch Art Gallery]] and the [[Centre of Contemporary Art]] (CoCA) are located in the Cultural Precinct. The majority of the activities are free.

=== Heritage buildings ===
The central city has a large number of registered heritage buildings that are either listed with [[Heritage New Zealand]] or are noted in the Christchurch City Plan. A large number of these buildings have been significantly damaged by the recent earthquakes. Some heritage buildings collapsed during the February earthquake (e.g. the Stone Chamber of the [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings]]&lt;ref name="Press 26 Feb"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sachdeva |first=Sam |title=People first, buildings take a back seat |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=26 February 2011 |author2=Moore, Christopher |location=Christchurch |page=A22}}&lt;/ref&gt;), many have been demolished already (e.g. [[St Elmo Courts]],&lt;ref name="Press demo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Giles|title=Heritage building too damaged to save |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4789954/Heritage-building-too-damaged-to-save |accessdate=21 March 2011 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=21 March 2011 |author2=Keith Lynch |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Press Building, Christchurch|The Press Building]]&lt;ref name="demolition decision"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Keith|title=More than 128 Christchurch buildings face demolition |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/4838607/More-than-128-Christchurch-buildings-face-demolition |accessdate=2 April 2011|newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[St Luke's Church, Christchurch|St Luke's Church]]&lt;ref name="Press St Luke's"&gt;{{cite news|title=St Luke's is being demolished |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/5244018/St-Lukes-is-being-demolished |accessdate=6 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and for many heritage buildings, the fate is as yet unclear (e.g. the [[Peterborough Centre]].&lt;ref name="earthquake repairs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heather|first=Ben|title=Owners vow to save historic edifice|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/5119007/Owners-vow-to-save-historic-edifice |accessdate=18 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[McLean's Mansion]] in Manchester Street, a 53-room dwelling built in 1900 for 78-year-old bachelor [[Allan McLean (philanthropist)|Allan McLean]], is currently threatened with demolition.&lt;ref name="Architectural Heritage"&gt;{{cite web |title=McLeans Mansion |url= http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Publications/ChristchurchCityCouncil/ArchitecturalHeritage/McLeansMansion/McLeansMansion.pdf |publisher=[[Christchurch City Council]] Town Planning Division |accessdate=18 July 2013 |location=[[Christchurch]] |format=PDF |date=June 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Editorial: McLean's Mansion should be saved |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/editorials/8921485/Editorial-McLeans-Mansion-should-be-saved |accessdate=18 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population ===
[[File:Central City Population.jpg|thumb|Comparing extrapolated historic growth in resident population with required growth to reach 30,000 residents by 2026.]]
The central city prior to the 2010-2011 earthquakes had an increasing residential population. The last four [[New Zealand census]]es had the usual resident population on 30 June recorded as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistics NZ |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/StatsMaps/Home/People%20and%20households/2013-census-population-dwelling-map.aspx |publisher=Stats NZ |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christchurch City Council alongside Otakaro Limited is trying to revitalise the central city. The Council aspires to have 30,000 residents living within the Four Avenues by 2026.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ThePress20080816-ourchristchurch.pdf Central city population mentioned in CCC newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greaterchristchurch.org.nz/Strategy/UDSSummary2008.pdf Central city population mentioned in Urban Development Strategy document&lt;/ref&gt; When the historic census population (for 1996, 2001 and 2006) is plotted and extrapolated to 2026, and compared to the required growth to reach a projected population of 30,000 residents by 2026, it becomes clear that this is an ambitious goal. Entire city blocks have been earmarked for residential development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East Frame Pūtahi Whakaterāwhiti |url=https://www.otakaroltd.co.nz/anchor-projects/the-east-frame/ |publisher=Otakaro Limited |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as private developments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fletchers to build 191 inner-city homes for Christchurch |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/your-property/68403229/fletchers-to-build-191-innercity-homes-for-christchurch |publisher=Stuff |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming toward this goal.

=== Economy ===
The central city is an important employment area supporting 26,000 [[full-time equivalent]] (FTE) employees, and with much of the floor area taken up by office space. One of the biggest employers is Christchurch City Council with 800 FTE at the civic offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/docs/demographicandemploymentdata.pdf Employment data&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern part of the central city has traditionally been home to manufacturing, but there has been a decline in this area, with many companies either moving to commercial subdivisions, closing, or relocating overseas.

=== Education ===
Many education providers are located in the city centre. Christchurch Polytechnic with 6000 students is the largest of these. There are numerous language schools, providing a platform for an important market of attracting mainly Asian students to the city.

There are several schools in the central city.
[[File:Christ's College entrance.jpg|thumb|Main entrance of Christ's College]]
* [[Christ's College, Christchurch|Christ's College]] is an independent, [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], secondary, [[Day school|day]] and [[boarding school]] for boys.

* [[Catholic Cathedral College]] is an integrated co-educational secondary school. It was founded in 1987 from the amalgamation of two schools: Sacred Heart College for girls, and Xavier College for boys.

=== Green space ===
[[File:HagleyPark02 gobeirne.jpg|left|thumb|Late afternoon in Hagley Park]]
Hagley Park is, at 165 ha, the largest [[urban open space]] in Christchurch. The park was created in 1855 by the Provincial Government.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/HagleyParkMgtPlan2007_ALL_LR-popularparks.pdf Hagley Park Management Plan&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government's decree at that time, Hagley Park is "reserved forever as a public park, and shall be open for the recreation and enjoyment of the public." Hagley Park is characterised by its trees and broad open spaces. Hagley Park was named after the country estate of [[George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttelton]], who became chairman of the Canterbury Association in March 1850.&lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nzbound/cby.htm Information on Lord Lyttelton&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christchurch Botanic Gardens are botanical gardens founded in 1863,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/parkswalkways/christchurchbotanicgardens/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019082224/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/parkswalkways/christchurchbotanicgardens/index.aspx |archivedate=19 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }} The Christchurch Botanic Gardens&lt;/ref&gt; when on 9 July an [[English oak]] was planted to commemorate the solemnisation of marriage between [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] of [[Denmark]]. The Gardens cover an area of 21 hectares,&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.ccc.govt.nz/webapps/parksaz/P44.asp Council website&lt;/ref&gt; and lie adjacent to the loop of the Avon River next to Hagley Park.

The Barbadoes Street Cemetery is a large green space in the north-east of the central city. It is the city’s oldest cemetery and opened in 1851. It is the final resting place of many of Christchurch’s early leading citizens. The cemetery itself is divided by Barbadoes Street separating the Anglican (Church of England) section, on the eastern side, from the Roman Catholic and Dissenters (others) section on the west.&lt;ref&gt;http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Cemeteries/Barbadoes/ Library information on the Barbadoes Street Cemetery&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery was initially envisaged to be much larger, but with the establishment of suburbs and villages with their own cemeteries, it became clear that less land was needed. The cemetery was subdivided in 1896 and Churchill Street was formed, with the eastern part of the original cemetery thus becoming a residential area.&lt;ref&gt;http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-C-E.pdf Information on Churchill Street&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
[[File:01 Christchurch 178 Brill car.jpg|thumb|right|A Christchurch tram]]
Due to the grid pattern of the roads, the central city has a high number of traffic signals. Four pairs of one-way streets are located only a few hundred metres away from Cathedral Square, making it easy to drive through the city centre. The avenues in the north, east and south surrounding the central city are generally six-lane median divided. Fitzgerald and Bealey Avenues stand out due to the trees in those central medians.

With about 30,000 car parks (both public and private), the central city has one of the highest ratios of car parking and employment of the [[OECD]] countries. As both driving and parking is relatively easy, Christchurch has a high car ownership rate.

Cycling is reasonably popular in central Christchurch, with the second highest rate of commuter cycling in New Zealand (after Nelson). Free covered bike lock-ups are located in six City Council-run car parking buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/gettingaround/cycling/cyclingguide.aspx Information on covered bicycle parking; accessed 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public transport in Christchurch]] is mainly based on buses and supported by taxis. There is a functioning [http://www.tram.co.nz/ tram service] in Christchurch, but as a tourist attraction, its loop is restricted to a circuit of the central city and it does not fulfil a public transport function.

The city council provided the current ''Bus Exchange'' between Lichfield and Cashel Streets in November 2000. A new ''Transport Interchange'' is planned for the block surrounded by Lichfield, Colombo, Tuam and Durham Streets, as the existing Bus Exchange is nearing capacity.

Long distance buses depart mostly from Worcester Street near Cathedral Square. All local buses that go through the central city use the ''Bus Exchange''. It is envisaged that long distance and local services will all use the ''Transport Interchange''. In addition to normal bus services, the central city has a [[zero-fare]] [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] bus service, the ''Shuttle''.

The [[Christchurch railway station (New Zealand)|railway station]] used to be located on the southern boundary of the central city on Moorhouse Avenue, but has been relocated to the suburb of [[Riccarton, New Zealand|Riccarton]].

'''''Cult: Leadership &amp; Business Strategy: Ruthlessly Redefined''''' is a [[management]] book written by "management guru" [[Arindam Chaudhuri]] and strategy professor A. Sandeep. The book was launched by [[Guy Kawasaki]], former Chief Evangelist at [[Apple Inc.]] and current member, Board of Trustees at the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], in December 2011 at an event in [[London]] attended by political and business leaders,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/print/news-business/cult-indian-powerbrands--the-global-superpower-edition-storm-london-113103002210_1.html India Infoline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdailyheadlines.com/1326888490,cult-indian-power-brands-storm-london-planman-marcom.html Business Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kashmirnews.eu/2012/?p=421 ''CULT, Indian Power Brands storm London'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Kashmir News, Dec 20, 2011. Retrieved 2012-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and reached the top 10 business bestsellers list in [[India]].&lt;Ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/the-top-10-business-bestsellers-112110500068_1.html Business Standard Top 10 Business Bestsellers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book deals with lessons for [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] in running [[transnational corporation]]s. The book is divided into two parts. The first part addresses leadership issues that CEOs face while running global corporations. The second part addresses business strategy issues that CEOs of very large corporations have to face.

'''Data dissemination''' is the distribution or transmitting of statistical, or other, data to end users. There are many ways organisations can release data to the public, i.e. electronic format, CD-ROM and paper publications such as PDF files based on aggregated data.
The most popular dissemination method today is the ‘non-proprietary’ open systems using internet protocols. “They are used in data dissemination through various communication infrastructures across any set of interconnected networks.” Data is made available in common [[open formats]].

Some organisations choose to disseminate data using ‘proprietary’ databases in order to protect their sovereignty and copyright of the data. Proprietary data dissemination requires a specific piece of software in order for end users to view the data. The data will not open in common open formats.  The data is first converted into the [[Proprietary format|proprietary data format]], and specifically designed software is provided by the organisation to users.

&lt;big&gt;'''Dissemination formats and standards'''&lt;/big&gt;
Under the [[Special Data Dissemination Standard]], the formats are divided into two categories: "hardcopy" and "electronic" publications

Some examples of Hardcopy publications:

* yearbook 
* panorama of municipalities 
* monthly review
* trends
* pocketbook
* periodical

Some examples of electronic copy publications:
* CD Rom
* Webpage
* PDF
* Downloadable Databases for private use in 3rd party software applications

'''&lt;big&gt;Standards&lt;/big&gt;'''

Standards have been developed in order to provide an internationally accepted statistical methodology for the dissemination of statistical data.  The ‘[[International Organization for Standardization]]’ (ISO) are one such international standard-setting body made up of representatives from various national standards organizations.  They created the [[SDMX]] standard widely used around the world.
SDMX stands for ‘Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange’.  It is commonly used in national and international statistical and economic data sharing systems.  This standard is for the exchange of essential social and economic statistics, for example between European national agencies and [[Eurostat]] and the [[European Central Bank]]. 
SDMX is used for the dissemination of multi-dimensional [[aggregate data|aggregated data]]. 
&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Data Documentation Initiative]] (DDI) was created by the [http://www.ddialliance.org DDI Alliance]. DDI is an open metadata specification and covers the full data life cycle from planning through to dissemination and archiving data. It is most popularly used for social statistics micro data but is not limited to this subject area. 
There are some examples online where these two standards are in use in proprietary data form.  The following portals provide users with access to statistical data online from leading statistical agencies:

'''David Robert Jones''' (born 9 November 1966) is a former CEO of [[Havas]] and [[Havas Worldwide]] (formerly known as [[Euro RSCG Worldwide]]), and cofounder of global youth forum [[One Young World]]. He is author of ''Who Cares Wins: Why Good Business Is Better Business''&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Who-Cares-Wins-business-Financial/dp/0273762532 |title=Who Cares Wins: Why good business is better business (Financial Times Series) (9780273762539): David Jones: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pearson/FT Publishing, November 2011) and the creator of the "Social Business Idea".

==Career==
David Jones was born and educated in North West England and holds business degrees from [[Reutlingen University|Fachhochschule Reutlingen]] and [[Middlesex Business School]]. Fluent in German, French and English, he began his career as an account executive at [[BDH Manchester]] (now [[TBWA]]) before moving to [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] in Paris and then [[Lowe Europe]]. Returning to London, he became the youngest board member at [[AMV BBDO]].

Jones' career with Havas began in 1998, when he was appointed CEO of Euro RSCG Australia at age 32. After launching the network's first digital agency, he became president of global brands for Euro RSCG Worldwide and served as global brand director on [[Reckitt Benckiser]]. In 2004 he was promoted to CEO of Euro RSCG New York and in 2005 he succeeded Jim Heekin as CEO of Euro RSCG Worldwide and also taking on duties as directeur general of Havas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-online.ru/eng/index.php3?id=23806 |title=Euro Rscg Chairman-Ceo Resigns |publisher=Media-online.ru |date=2 August 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Euro RSCG became the first agency to be named Global Agency of the Year by both [[Advertising Age]] and [[Advertising campaign|Campaign]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/global-agency-network-year-euro-rscg/114126/ |title=Global Agency Network of the Year: Euro RSCG &amp;#124; News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/610113/ |title=The Annual 2006: Advertising Network of the Year – Euro RSCG &amp;#124; Advertising news &amp;#124; Campaign |publisher=Campaignlive.co.uk |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Jones added the title of CEO of Havas Worldwide, running all the creative, marketing and design companies throughout the Havas network of 300+ offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/euro-chief-david-jones-oversees-80-havas/134949/ |title=Euro Chief David Jones Now Oversees 80% of Havas &amp;#124; Agency News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007–2010, Jones led the Euro RSCG team advising [[David Cameron]] and the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver |first=James |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2011/mar/14/david-jones-tory-adman-enjoys-going-for-the-jugular |title=David Jones: the Tory ad-man who enjoys going for the jugular &amp;#124; James Silver &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 14 March 2011|accessdate=8 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Jones expanded his position to encompass the entire Havas network, including [[Havas Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/david-jones-named-ceo-havas-group/149283/ |title=David Jones Named CEO of Havas Group &amp;#124; News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named CEO of Havas.

In 2014 Jones left Havas and one year later he raised $350m and launched a new 'brandtech' group under the name "You &amp; Mr. Jones". &lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2016/02/15/new-york-says-shalom-to-israeli-startups/
 Mark Sweney (11 June 2015). "Ex-Havas chief David Jones raises $350m for new 'brandtech' group". The Guardian. Retrieved March 6th 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change leadership==
David Jones is creator of the "Social Business Idea"—a principle and practice that "operates at the intersection of social responsibility and social media" and "aligns the goals of doing well and doing good."&lt;ref name="amazon1"/&gt; He cites the [[Dulux Let's Colour Project]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letscolourproject.com/ |title=Home – Let's Colour Project |publisher=Letscolourproject.com |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Business Ideas are a focus of Jones' book, Who Cares Wins: Why Good Business Is Better Business, scheduled to be published by Pearson/FT Publishing in late 2011.
At [[Mashable]] Connect 2011 and other forums, Jones has advocated using the communication skills of the advertising industry to drive social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/06/01/david-jones-connect-keynote/ |title=5 Key Shifts Happening Right Now in the World of Digital Marketing |publisher=Mashable.com |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told [[Adweek]] "I passionately believe that what our industry actually excels at is using our creativity to change people's behavior. Given the state of the world, I believe that we in the creative industries not only have an opportunity but an obligation to use that talent and our creativity to change people's behavior around some of the bigger issues facing the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chapman |first=Mike |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/beds-are-burning-climate-change-100485 |title='Beds Are Burning' for Climate Change |publisher=Adweek |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Jones co-founded youth forum [[One Young World]], called "arguably the most forward-looking and comprehensive piece of corporate social responsibility ever attempted"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Choueke |first=Mark |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/collaborative-approach-marks-new-age-of-csr/3003613.article |title=Collaborative approach marks new age of CSR &amp;#124; News |publisher=Marketing Week |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Marketing Week]]. In 2011, Jones' work with One Young World was recognised by the [[Clinton Foundation#Clinton Global Initiative .28CGI.29|Clinton Global Initiative.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=One |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/oneyoungworld/5035426813 |title=David Jones receiving Clinton Global Initiative for One Young World &amp;#124; Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In advance of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] in Copenhagen in 2009, Jones was asked by former U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] to create a campaign to communicate the urgent need for action. Jones drove the creation of the TckTckTck Campaign for Climate Justice, an open source campaign that recruited more than 17 million "climate allies" to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcktcktck.org/ |title=The Global Campaign for Climate Action : The Global Campaign for Climate Action |publisher=Tcktcktck.org |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 TckTckTck was short-listed for a [[Webby Award]] for world's best advocacy campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=14 |title=Webby Nominees |publisher=Webbyawards.com |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421181147/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=14 |archivedate=21 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and listed by [[The Guardian]] as one of the Top 50 climate tweeters in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards |first=Rhiannon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/may/11/top-50-twitter-climate-accounts |title=Top 50 Twitter climate accounts to follow &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 11 May 2010|accessdate=8 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Business Idea==
In ''Who Cares Wins'', Jones defines the Social Business Idea as the overlap between what a company is good at ("a genuine and credible role for the brand or business"), and what consumers or customers are looking for ("real issues that consumers care about"). He lists as examples [[M·A·C]]'s Viva Glam cosmetics partnering with [[Lady Gaga]] to raise money and awareness for HIV;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.maccosmetics.com/whats_new/4800/index.tmpl?cm_mmc=Google-_-ENG_ENG%7cVanity%7cProduct%7cPhrase%7cPC-_-M%7cX%7cViva%20Glam%7cX%7cX%7cSPP%7cOK-_-Viva%20Glam |title=MAC Cosmetics: Viva Glam| date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Levi's]] Water&lt;Less jeans line, produced with lower water usage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://store.levi.com/waterless |title=Levi's: Water&lt;Less| date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] "Plan A"  environmental commitment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plana.marksandspencer.com/ |title=Marks &amp; Spencer: Plan A|date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] "Better World";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nikebetterworld.com/ |title=Nike Better World|date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pepsi Refresh Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.refresheverything.com/ |title=Nike Better World|date= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

A '''deadlock provision''', or '''deadlock resolution clause''', is a [[contract]]ual clause or series of clauses in a [[shareholders' agreement]] or other form of [[joint venture]] agreement which determines how disagreements on key issues are to be resolved in relation to the management of the enterprise.

Deadlock provisions vary enormously between different countries and with respect to different types of transactions.  However, characteristically the format of the provision will be as follows:
#Certain "key matters" will be designated as matters upon which deadlocks can arise.  These will usually be fairly fundamental matters relating to the management and control of the business.
#The provisions will then indicate if a "key matter" is raised at a certain number of consecutive meetings (occasionally just one meeting, but more often two or three) of the [[board of directors]] or other management organ of the business, a ''deadlock'' is said to have arisen.
#The two parties may then be asked to summarise their differences in writing, and ordinarily senior personnel on either side will meet to try to find an amicable resolution to the deadlock.  The provisions may require that a [[alternative dispute resolution|mediator]] may or shall be involved.
#If the parties fail to find an amicable solution, then the termination provisions will normally operate.

The main focus of most deadlock provisions are the termination provisions.  The principle underlying them is that a successful business enterprise should not be destroyed solely because the two partners are unable to agree on a core issue; the value of the business as a [[going concern]] should be preserved, and a fair way should be found to allow one party to bow out with fair recompense for giving up their share in the venture.

There are as many different types of termination provisions as the ingenuity of [[lawyer]]s can create.  However, a number of specific types of termination provisions have come to be used fairly regularly in commercial transactions where the parties are of equal standing in the venture, and have acquired characteristically descriptive names.

*'''Russian roulette'''.  A draconian solution to a deadlock, a Russian roulette provision requires one of the two deadlocked parties to serve a notice on the other party, and the serving party will name an all-cash price at which it values a half interest in the business.  The party receiving the notice then has the option to either buy the other party out, or sell out to the other party, at that price.
*'''Texas shoot-out'''.  Another dramatic solution to a deadlock, a Texas shoot-out involves each party sending a sealed all-cash bid to an umpire stating the price at which they are willing to buy out the other party.  The sealed bids are opened together, and the highest sealed bid "wins", and that bidder must then buy (and the "loser" must sell) the other half share in the business.
*'''Mexican shoot-out''' (also called ''''Dutch auction''').  A variation on the Texas shoot-out (and slightly different from the traditional [[Dutch auction]]), the parties send in sealed bids indicating the minimum price that they would be prepared to sell their half share for.  Whichever sealed bid is the higher "wins" and that bidder then buys the "loser's" share at the price indicated in the loser's sealed bid.
*'''Multi-choice procedure'''.  A softer option, when the parties do not wish to commit themselves to a more dramatic termination procedure, the deadlock can often provide for a series of options, one of which the parties must agree on, if the deadlock cannot be resolved.  The benefit of an open textured clause like this is that, when faced with the draconian consequences of the next step, the parties are thought to be better able to compromise.  The downside is that if the parties are truly at loggerheads, it usually requires a third party adjudicator (often an [[arbitrator]]) to impose one of the options upon them.
*'''Cooling-off/Mediation'''.  Not strictly a termination provision at all, many deadlock provisions 'end' by providing that the parties shall mediate until a solution is found (sometimes providing that if they cannot mediate out, the mediator will make a determination of reasonableness, which can then have knock-on effects under the contract).  Whilst sounding like a 'soft' option, such clauses often represent the [[judgment of Solomon]], as if the parties are unable to mediate the dispute out, then usually the enterprise will be dissolved.
*'''Deterrence approach'''.  Often the termination clause in deadlock provisions provides a punitive element for the party initiating the deadlock procedure.  In those clauses, a deadlock is only said to arise when one party serves a notice on the other indicating that a deadlock has arisen (instead of a failure to resolve on a key matter at a certain number of meetings).  The provisions will then provide for the determination of the "fair market value" of a half share in the business, usually by having it valued by an expert or [[auditor]] (or sometimes both in consultation).  Once the valuation is made, the party who served the notice must either (a) buy all the other party's share in the business at 125% of the fair price, or (b) sell its share to the other party at 75% of the fair price.  The downside to such clauses is that deadlocks rarely get resolved, and can lead to the business being paralysed by indecision.

Often the drafting of the deadlock provisions will depend to a great extent upon what the "key issues" that the parties want to ensure consensus upon are.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="933">'''Dunning''' is the process of methodically communicating with customers to ensure the collection of [[accounts receivable]]. Communications progress from gentle reminders to threatening letters and phone calls and more or less intimidating location visits as accounts become more [[overdue]].  Laws in each country regulate the form that dunning can take. It is generally unlawful to harass or threaten [[consumer]]s. It is acceptable to issue firm reminders and to take all allowable collection options.

The word stems from the 17th century verb [[wikt:dun|dun]], meaning to demand payment of a debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dunning Dictionary reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernesto Igel''' (November 27, 1893 – January 24, 1966) was an Austrian entrepreneur and founder of the company Empresa Brasileira de Gáz a Domilicio Ltda, the first Brazilian gas distribution network of fuel for cooking equipment (LPG).&lt;ref name=UOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/1/11/dinheiro/18.html|title=Casa centro negocia participação na Ultralar |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the company changed its name to [[Ultragaz]] S.A.&lt;ref name=UOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/1/11/dinheiro/18.html|title=Casa centro negocia participação na Ultralar |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HistóriadeEmpresas"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://historiadeempresas.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/ultralar-uma-das-pioneiras-no-setor-de-grandes-magazines/|title=Ultralar, uma das pioneiras no setor de grandes magazinas |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Exame&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/melhores-e-maiores/empresas/ficha/ultragaz/2012|title= Maiores empresas do Brasil de 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPEM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ipemsp.wordpress.com/botijao-de-gas/|title= Botijão de Gás como tudo começou |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Ultragaz's growth and the creation of new companies, Ernesto Igel founded [[Ultra - Company|Ultra]], also known as Ultrapar.

==Early life==

Born to a family of merchants in Vienna, Austria, Igel was the eldest of five children. At 15, he got his first job at an import-export company. At 21, he was drafted to the Austrian army to fight in [[World War I]]. He was sent to [[Romania]], where he served as a management assistant.&lt;ref name=RevendadeGLPBlog&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revendadeglp.blogspot.com/2010/07/historia-do-glp-no-brasil.html|title=História do GPL no Brasil |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebah&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebah.com.br/content/ABAAAAgkAAD/distribuicao-glp|title=Distribuição de GLP |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After the war, Igel moved to Brazil in 1920 when he was 26 years old. He then established the company Ernesto Igel &amp; Cia., an importer of tableware, sanitary metals, stoves and heaters for use with pipeline gas. During his trips to Europe, Igel got to work with the then-new gas bottling technology for domestic use.&lt;ref name=TrabalhosFeitos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trabalhosfeitos.com/ensaios/Vista-Tecnica/30885944.html|title=Visita Técnica |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 1937, Igel founded Empresa Brasileira de Gáz a Domicílio Ltda. The following year, in September 1938, the company's IPO set the start of Ultragaz S.A. After that, the company extended its operations and began to conduct business throughout Brazil.&lt;ref name=UOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/1/11/dinheiro/18.html|title=Casa centro negocia participação na Ultralar |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HistóriadeEmpresas"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://historiadeempresas.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/ultralar-uma-das-pioneiras-no-setor-de-grandes-magazines/|title=Ultralar, uma das pioneiras no setor de grandes magazinas |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Exame&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/melhores-e-maiores/empresas/ficha/ultragaz/2012|title= Maiores empresas do Brasil de 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPEM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ipemsp.wordpress.com/botijao-de-gas/|title= Botijão de Gás como tudo começou |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Igel married Margaret Hartman, also Austrian, with whom he had two children, Pery and [[Daisy Igel]]. The businessman headed the administration of their companies until 1959, when he named his son, [[Pery Igel]], as the new head of Ultragaz.&lt;ref name="Sindigás"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sindigas.com.br/Sindigas/Historico.aspx|title=Breve relato sobre o gás LP no Brasil |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MundodasMarcas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mundodasmarcas.blogspot.com/2014_01_19_archive.html|title=Ultragaz |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Chemical Site Promotion Platform (ECSPP)''' was founded in 2005 to promote new investments in [[Europe]]'s [[chemical industry|chemical industrial]] complexes.

==Origins==
The idea of ECSPP was developed at the 2002 [[European Petrochemical Association]] (EPCA) Annual Meeting in [[Berlin]] between Peter Anderton of the [[Port of Rotterdam]] and Neil Kenley of SembCorp Utilities UK Ltd.

One of the conclusions emerging from this discussion was that European chemical sites could benefit from having a forum where information and insights on matters of common interest could be exchanged. In particular, it was felt that Europe needed to be more pro-active in profiling itself as an attractive region for new chemical investment.

==Brainstorming session==
In November 2003, Peter Anderton invited a number of chemical site management organizations to [[Rotterdam]] to take part in a brainstorming session to determine whether there was wider support for setting up such a forum, to be known as European Chemical Site Promotion Platform (ECSPP). There was enthusiastic backing for the idea and it was decided to develop the framework and conditions required to establish ECSPP as a formal organization.

==Steering committee==
A [[steering committee]] was formed to manage this process and in the course of 2004, a [[Business Plan]] was drafted. At a plenary meeting in March 2005, the Business Plan was approved unanimously and the decision was taken to proceed with the formal establishment of ECSPP.

ECSPP was officially launched at a Press Conference held during EPCA's Annual Meeting in September 2005 in [[Vienna]].

The [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] are members of ECSPP.

The '''Industrial Revolution''' was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from [[craft production|hand production methods]] to [[machine]]s, new [[chemical manufacturing]] and [[Puddling (metallurgy)|iron production]] processes, the increasing use of [[steam power]], the development of [[machine tool]]s and the rise of the [[factory system]].

[[Textile]]s were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and [[capital (economics)|capital]] invested. The [[textile industry]] was also the first to use modern production methods.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"&gt;{{cite book|author= David S.

An entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution helped drive [[industrialisation]] in Britain which after 1800 was emulated in Belgium, the United States, and France.&lt;ref name="Kiely"/&gt;  --&gt;

The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth.  Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the [[standard of living]] for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"/&gt;

[[GDP per capita]] was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy,&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution"/&gt; while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita [[economic growth]] in capitalist economies.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution ''Past and Future''"/&gt; Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the [[History of the world|history of humanity]] since the [[domestication]] of animals and plants.&lt;ref name="ReviewOfCambridge"/&gt;

Although the [[structural change]] from agriculture to industry is widely associated with Industrial Revolution, in United Kingdom it was already almost complete by 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Keibek |first=Sebastiaan A.J. |date=2016 |title=The male occupational structure of England and Wales, 1600-1850 |publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and [[social change]]s.&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rehabilitating the Industrial Revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lorenzen"/&gt; [[Eric Hobsbawm]] held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt; while [[T.

[[Textile industry|Mechanized textile production]] spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging [[#Belgium|in Belgium]] and the United States and later textiles in France.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;

An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed and their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, [[Hot blast|hot blast iron smelting]] and new technologies, such as the [[electrical telegraph]], widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth.  Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].  These new innovations included new steel making processes, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories.&lt;ref  name="David S.

==Etymology==
The earliest recorded use of the term "Industrial Revolution" seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy [[Louis-Guillaume Otto]], announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise.&lt;ref name="The industrial revolution in national context: Europe and the USA"/&gt; In his 1976 book ''[[Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society]]'', [[Raymond Williams]] states in the entry for "Industry": "The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in [[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[Robert Owen|Owen]], between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as [[William Blake|Blake]] in the early 1790s and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] at the turn of the [19th] century." The term ''Industrial Revolution'' applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in [[Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui]]'s description in 1837 of ''la révolution industrielle''.&lt;ref&gt;BLANQUI Jérôme-Adolphe, ''Histoire de l'économie politique en Europe depuis les anciens jusqu'à nos jours'', 1837, {{ISBN|978-0-543-94762-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 spoke of "an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society".  However, although Engels wrote in the 1840s, his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to [[Arnold Toynbee]], whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution13"/&gt;

Some historians, such as [[John Clapham (economic historian)|John Clapham]] and [[Nicholas Crafts]], have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term ''revolution'' is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among some historians.

==Important technological developments==
The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations,&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Innovations"/&gt; beginning in the second half of the 18th century.  By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies:
* '''Textiles''' – mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500. The [[power loom]] increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[cotton gin]] increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;  Large gains in productivity also occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen, but they were not as great as in cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;!--[[File:Watt James von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[James Watt]] improved on [[Thomas Newcomen|Newcomen]]'s 1712 steam engine with his [[Watt steam engine]] in 1781]]--&gt;
* '''Steam power''' – the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s increased so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel.  The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|82}}  The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio, making it suitable for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|year-1985|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steam power underwent a rapid expansion after 1800.
* '''Iron making''' – the substitution of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost of [[pig iron]] and [[wrought iron]] production.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|89–93}}  Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1= Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Pres|isbn= 978-0-226-72634-2 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[economies of scale]].  The steam engine began being used to pump water to power blast air in the mid 1750s, enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760.  It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher [[blast furnace]] temperatures.  The [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]] produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the [[finery forge]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969 91"&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. [[Hot blast]] (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.
* '''Invention of machine tools''' – The first [[machine tools]] were invented.  These included the [[screw cutting lathe]], cylinder boring machine and the [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]].   Machine tools made the economical manufacture of [[Interchangeable parts|precision metal parts]] possible, although it took several decades to develop effective techniques.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Textile manufacture===
{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}

====British textile industry statistics====
In 1750 Britain imported 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton, most of which was spun and woven by cottage industry in Lancashire. The work was done by hand in workers' homes or occasionally in shops of master weavers. In 1787 raw cotton consumption was 22 million pounds, most of which was cleaned, carded and spun on machines.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|41–42}} The British textile industry used 52 million pounds of cotton in 1800, which increased to 588 million pounds in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialization and Society|last=Hopkins|first=Eric|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|location=London|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 2.6% in 1760, 17% in 1801 and 22.4% in 1831.  Value added by the British woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801.  Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797.  In 1760 approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800.  In 1781 cotton spun amounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800.  In 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in Britain.  In 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to 7 million over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

Wages in [[Lancashire]], a core region for cottage industry and later factory spinning and weaving, were about six times those in India in 1770, when overall [[productivity]] in Britain was about three times higher than in India.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Cotton====
Parts of India, China, Central America, South America and the Middle-East have a long history of hand manufacturing [[cotton]] textiles, which became a major industry sometime after 1000 AD. In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.  In the 15th century China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. By the 17th century almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing.  Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a [[medium of exchange]].  In India a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers.  Some merchants also owned small weaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  The early Spanish explorers found Native Americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton: sea island cotton (''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'') and upland green seeded cotton ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]''.  Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South Carolina, but did poorly inland.  Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650s. Upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern U.S., but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem solved by the [[cotton gin]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|157}} A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi, USA in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced [[Cotton Boll|boll]]s that were three to four times faster to pick.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Trade and textiles====
[[File:Colonisation 1754.png|thumb|upright=1.25|European colonial empires at the start of the Industrial Revolution, imposed upon modern political boundaries.]]

The [[Age of Discovery]] was followed by a period of [[colonialism]] beginning around the 16th century. Following the discovery of a trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese, the Dutch established the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (abbr. VOC) or [[Dutch East India Company]] and the British founded the [[East India Company]], along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region and between the Indian Ocean region and North Atlantic Europe.  One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles, which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago, where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia and Europe.  By the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India Company's exports.  Indian textiles were in demand in North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the amount of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Pre-mechanized European textile production====
By 1600 Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established; however, they were left alone by the [[guild]]s who did not consider cotton a threat.  Earlier European attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12th century Italy and 15th century southern Germany, but these industries eventually ended when the supply of cotton was cut off.  The [[Moors]] in Spain grew, spun and wove cotton beginning around the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014" /&gt;

British cloth could not compete with Indian cloth because India's labor cost was approximately one-fifth to one-sixth that of Britain's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Bishnupriya|title=Cotton Textiles and the  Great Divergence: Lancashire, India and Shifting Competitive  Advantage, 1600-1850|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf|website=International Institute of Social History|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Warwick|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1700 and 1721 the British government passed [[Calico Acts]] in order to [[Protectionism|protect]] the domestic woollen and linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"/&gt;

The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around [[Lancashire]] that produced [[fustian]], a cloth with flax [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and cotton [[weft]].  Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew.&lt;ref name="Ayers1989"&gt;{{Cite journal

On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the [[putting-out system]].  Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials.  In the off season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving.  Using the [[spinning wheel]], it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver.&lt;ref name="David S.

====Invention of textile machinery====
The [[flying shuttle]], patented in 1733 by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]], with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747, doubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving.  It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, [[Robert Kay (inventor)|Robert]], invented the drop box, which facilitated changing thread colors.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|821–22}}

[[Lewis Paul]] patented the roller [[spinning frame]] and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of [[Birmingham]].  Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in [[Northampton]] with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by [[Daniel Bourn]] in [[Leominster]], but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented [[carding]] machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first [[cotton mill|cotton spinning mill]]. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by [[Richard Arkwright]] in his [[water frame]] and [[Samuel Crompton]] in his [[spinning mule]].
[[File:Spinning jenny.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|Model of the [[spinning jenny]] in a museum in [[Wuppertal]]. Invented by [[James Hargreaves]] in 1764,  the spinning jenny was one of the innovations that started the revolution.]]
In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, [[James Hargreaves]] invented the [[spinning jenny]], which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ray Gehani (1998). "Management of Technology and Operations". p. 63. John Wiley and Sons, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for [[weft]], not [[warp (weaving)|warp]].&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|825–27}}

The [[spinning frame]] or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|827–30}}  For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain.  A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.

[[File:Mule-jenny.jpg|thumb|The only surviving example of a [[spinning mule]] built by the inventor [[Samuel Crompton]].  The mule produced high-quality thread with minimal labour.]]

[[Samuel Crompton]]'s [[spinning mule|Spinning Mule]] was introduced in 1779.  Mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}  Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|832}}

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|Interior of Marshall's [[Temple Works]]]]

Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical [[power loom]] which he patented in 1785.  In 1776 he patented a two-man operated loom which was more conventional.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|834}}  Cartwright built two factories; the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers. Cartwright's loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813.  Horock's loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822 and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts, Hill &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. [[Eli Whitney]] responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive [[cotton gin]].  A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously, working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day, have taken a woman two months to process.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

These advances were capitalised on by [[entrepreneur]]s, of whom the best known is Richard Arkwright. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as [[Thomas Highs]] and [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]]; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the [[cotton mill]] which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power – first horse power and then [[Hydropower|water power]]{{mdash}}which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of [[yarn]] increased greatly. Before long [[Watt steam engine|steam power]] was applied to drive textile machinery. [[Manchester]] acquired the nickname [[Cottonopolis]] during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Mingay (1986). "The Transformation of Britain, 1830–1939". p. 25. Routledge, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand-woven Indian cloth, in part due to the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India, which allowed high thread counts.  However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the industry.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

====Wool====
The earliest European attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton.  Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant but was far less than that of cotton.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name=David_Landes_1999/&gt;

====Silk====
[[File:Silkmill1.jpg|thumb|Lombe's Mill site today, rebuilt as [[Derby Silk Mill]]]]
Arguably the first highly mechanised factory was [[John Lombe]]'s [[Derby Industrial Museum|water-powered silk mill]] at [[Derby]], operational by 1721. Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time is unknown. Although Lombe's factory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition.  In order to promote manufacturing the Crown paid for models of Lombe's machinery which were exhibited in the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=75296|first=Richard L.|last=Hills|title=Cotchett, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=47971|first=K.

===Iron industry===
[[File:Reverberatory furnace diagram.png|thumb|right|The [[reverberatory furnace]] could produce [[cast iron]] using mined coal. The burning coal remained separate from the iron and so did not contaminate the iron with impurities like sulphur and silica. This opened the way to increased iron production.]]

====UK iron production statistics====
Bar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails, wire, hinges, horse shoes, wagon tires, chains, etc. and for structural shapes. A small amount of bar iron was converted into steel.  [[Cast iron]] was used for pots, stoves and other items where its brittleness was tolerable.  Most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron, with substantial losses.  Bar iron was also made by the [[bloomery]] process, which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century.

In  the UK in 1720 there were 20,500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke. In 1750 charcoal iron production was 24,500 and coke iron was 2,500 tons.  In 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14,000 tons while coke iron production was 54,000 tons.  In 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7,800 tons and coke cast iron was 250,000 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

In 1750 the UK imported 31,200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18,800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using  coke.  In 1796 the UK was making 125,000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6,400 tons with charcoal; imports were 38,000 tons and exports were 24,600 tons. In 1806 the UK did not import bar iron but exported 31,500 tons.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

====Iron process innovations====
A major change in the iron industries during the era of the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of [[wood]] and other bio-fuels with coal. For a given amount of heat, coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title= American Iron 1607–1900|last=Gordon|first= Robert B|year=1996 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London|isbn= 978-0-8018-6816-0 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coal was much more abundant than wood, supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F.|year= 1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}}  By 1750 [[coke (fuel)|coke]] had generally replaced charcoal in smelting of copper and lead and was in widespread use in making glass.  In the smelting and refining of iron, coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coal's sulfur content.  Low sulfur coals were known, but they still contained harmful amounts.  Conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|122–125}} A minority of coals are coking.

Another factor limiting the iron industry before the Industrial Revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows.  This limitation was overcome by the steam engine.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;

Use of coal in iron [[smelting]] started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir [[Clement Clerke]] and others from 1678, using coal [[reverberatory furnace]]s known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the [[ore]] and charcoal or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] mixture, [[Redox|reducing]] the [[oxide]] to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to [[lead]] from 1678 and to [[copper]] from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The [[Cupola furnace|foundry cupola]] is a different, and later, innovation.)

By 1709 [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] made progress using coke to fuel his [[blast furnace]]s at [[Coalbrookdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the coke [[pig iron]] he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of [[cast iron]] goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs.

Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce [[wrought iron]] until 1755-56, when Darby's son [[Abraham Darby II]] built furnaces at [[Horsehay]] and [[Ketley]] where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from Coalbrookdale).  These new furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engines]].  The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast.  Abraham Darby III installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768.  The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}

Steam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. In 1757, iron master [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] patented a hydraulic powered [[blowing engine]] for blast furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;

[[James Watt]] had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine.  In 1774 John Wilkinson, who built a cast iron blowing cylinder for his iron works, invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a [[Boulton and Watt]] steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author Simon Winchester dates the start of the Industrial Revolution to 4th May, 1776, the day that John Wilkinson presented James Watt with his precision-made cylinder. (August 19, 2018 - 10:00 ET)[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1808/19/fzgps.01.html Fareed Zakaria - GPS]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;  After Watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782, they were widely applied to blowing, hammering, rolling and slitting.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

The solutions to the sulfur problem were the addition of sufficient limestone to the furnace to force sulfur into the slag and the use of low sulfur coal.  Use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a free-flowing slag. The increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|123–125}}  In addition to lower cost and greater availability, coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials (iron ore, fuel, slag) flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics|last= Rosenberg|first= Nathan |authorlink= |year=1982 |publisher =Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, New York |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David.

As cast iron became cheaper and widely available, it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings.  A famous early example was the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] built in 1778 with cast iron produced by [[Abraham Darby III]].&lt;ref name="Iron bridge"/&gt;  However, most cast iron was converted to [[wrought iron]].

Europe relied on the [[bloomery]] for most of its wrought iron until the large scale production of cast iron.  Conversion of cast iron was done in a [[finery forge]], as it long had been.  An improved refining process known as [[potting and stamping]] was developed, but this was superseded by [[Henry Cort]]'s [[Puddling furnace|puddling]] process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] in 1783 and [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] in 1784.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|91}}  Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost.

[[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  When the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it.  Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  Few puddlers lived to be 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel.  The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a [[trip hammer]].  A different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles and rails.
 
The puddling process was improved in 1818 by Baldwyn Rogers, who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute|url={{Google books|_tijGo0WWHMC|page=PA20|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1879|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1838 [[Joseph Hall (metallurgist)|John Hall]] patented the use of roasted tap cinder (iron silicate) for the furnace bottom, greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom. The tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus, but this was not understood at the time.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;{{rp|166}}  Hall's process also used iron scale or rust, which reacted with carbon in the molten iron. Hall's process, called ''wet puddling'', reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50% to around 8%.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

Puddling became widely used after 1800. Up to that time British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from Sweden and Russia to supplement domestic supplies.  Because of the increased British production, imports began to decline in 1785 and by the 1790s Britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron.

[[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  By using preheated combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ayres|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  This meant that lower quality coal or [[anthracite]] could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics

Shortly before the Industrial Revolution an improvement was made in the production of [[steel]], which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. [[Benjamin Huntsman]] developed his [[crucible steel]] technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the [[cementation process]].

The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire and other hardware items. The development of [[machine tool]]s allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries.

===Steam power===
{{Main|Steam power during the Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[Watt steam engine]]. [[James Watt]] transformed the [[steam engine]] from a  [[reciprocating motion]] that was used for pumping to a [[Rotation|rotating motion]] suited to industrial applications.  Watt and others significantly improved the efficiency of the steam engine.]]

The development of the [[stationary steam engine]] was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, most industrial power was supplied by water and wind.  In Britain by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam.  By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was due to [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. He constructed and patented in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump, that generated about one [[horsepower]] (hp) and was used in numerous water works and in a few mines (hence its "brand name", ''The Miner's Friend''). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower ranges, but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes.  Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century.

The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by [[Thomas Newcomen]] before 1712. A number of Newcomen engines were installed in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a significant amount of capital to build, and produced upwards of {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}}. They were also used to power municipal water supply pumps.  They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread (first) to Hungary in 1722, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s the engineer [[John Smeaton]] built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;

[[File:Newcomens Dampfmaschine aus Meyers 1890.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen's steam-powered atmospheric engine]] was the first practical piston steam engine. Subsequent steam engines were to power the Industrial Revolution.]]

A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by [[Scottish people|Scotsman]] [[James Watt]]. With financial support from his business partner [[English people|Englishman]] [[Matthew Boulton]], he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]], which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber.  The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam.  Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency.  These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton &amp; Watts engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the [[Soho Foundry]] for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.

By 1783 the Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a [[Single- and double-acting cylinders|double-acting]] rotative type, which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful, and by 1800, the firm [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton &amp; Watt]] had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving [[blast furnace]]s, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from {{convert|5|to|10|hp|abbr=on}}.

Until about 1800 the most common pattern of steam engine was the [[beam engine]], built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained rotative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the [[table engine]]. Around the start of the 19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish engineer [[Richard Trevithick]] and the American [[Oliver Evans]] began to construct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail [[locomotive]]s and [[steamboat|steam boats]].

The development of [[machine tool]]s, such as the engine [[lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|planing]], milling and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.

Small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread [[electrification]] in the early 20th century. These included [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]-powered, [[treadle]]-powered and horse-powered workshop and light industrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine tools===
{{Main|Machine tool}}
{{See also|Interchangeable parts}}
[[File:Maudslay screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.png|thumb|[[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s famous early [[screw-cutting lathe]]s of circa 1797 and 1800]]
[[File:Middletown milling machine 1818--001.png|thumb|The Middletown [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson and Simeon North]]

Pre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen – [[millwright]]s built water and windmills, [[carpenter]]s made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time.  As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.  Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts.  Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners.

The demand for metal parts led to the development of several [[machine tool]]s. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms.

Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws and chisels. Consequently, the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum.  Hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The first large precision machine tool was the cylinder [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring machine]] invented by [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] in 1774. It used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. Wilkinson's boring machine differed from earlier [[cantilever]]ed machines used for boring cannon in that the cutting tool was mounted on a beam that ran through the cylinder being bored and was supported outside on both ends.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

The [[Planer (metalworking)|planing machine]], the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] and the [[Shaper|shaping machine]] were developed in the early decades of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[Henry Maudslay]], who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of [[Jan Verbruggen]]. In 1774 [[Jan Verbruggen]] had installed a [[horizontal boring machine]] in Woolwich which was the first industrial size [[Lathe]] in the UK. Maudslay was hired away by [[Joseph Bramah]] for the production of high-security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship.  Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe.  Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw.  Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;{{rp|392–95}}  The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions.  Although it was not entirely Maudslay's idea, he was the first person to build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and change gears.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|31, 36}}

Maudslay left Bramah's employment and set up his own shop. He was engaged to build the machinery for making ships' pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]]. These machines were all-metal and were the first machines for [[mass production]] and making components with a degree of [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]]. The lessons Maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools, and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work, such as [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]], [[Joseph Clement]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;

[[James Fox (engineer)|James Fox]] of [[Derby]] had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century, as did [[Matthew Murray]] of Leeds. Roberts was a maker of high-quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement.

The impact of machine tools during the Industrial Revolution was not that great because other than firearms, threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] is largely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected [[interchangeable parts]] for firearms in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the [[machine industry]] became the largest industrial sector of the U.S. economy, by value added.&lt;ref name="faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu"&gt;Economics 323–2: Economic History of the United States Since 1865 http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jmokyr/Graphs-and-Tables.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
The large-scale production of [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] was an important development during the Industrial Revolution. The first of these was the production of [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] by the [[lead chamber process]] invented by the Englishman [[John Roebuck]] ([[James Watt]]'s first partner) in 1746. He was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger, less expensive chambers made of [[rivet]]ed sheets of [[lead]]. Instead of making a small amount each time, he was able to make around {{convert|100|lb|-1}} in each of the chambers, at least a tenfold increase.

The production of an [[alkali]] on a large scale became an important goal as well, and [[Nicolas Leblanc]] succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the production of [[sodium carbonate]]. The [[Leblanc process]] was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and [[hydrochloric acid]]. The [[sodium sulfate|sodium sulphate]] was heated with [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and [[calcium sulfide|calcium sulphide]]. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic [[sodium carbonate|soda ash]] proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants ([[barilla]]) or from [[kelp]], which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash,&lt;ref name="Clow52"/&gt; and also to [[potash]] ([[potassium carbonate]]) produced from hardwood ashes.

These two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and [[paper]] industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for [[bleach]]ing cloth.

The development of bleaching powder ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) by Scottish chemist [[Charles Tennant]] in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North [[Glasgow]], became the largest chemical plant in the world.

After 1860 the focus on chemical innovation was in [[dye]]stuffs, and Germany took world leadership, building a strong chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;Lion Hirth, ''State, Cartels and Growth: The German Chemical Industry'' (2007) p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Aspiring chemists flocked to German universities in the 1860–1914 era to learn the latest techniques. British scientists by contrast, lacked research universities and did not train advanced students; instead, the practice was to hire German-trained chemists.&lt;ref&gt;Johann P. Murmann, ''Knowledge and competitive advantage:''
the co-evolution of firms, technology, and national institutions ''(2003) pp&amp;nbsp;53–54''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cement===
[[File:Thamestunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[Thames Tunnel]] (opened 1843).&lt;br /&gt;[[Cement]] was used in the world's first underwater tunnel.]]
In 1824 [[Joseph Aspdin]], a British [[bricklayer]] turned builder, patented a chemical process for making [[portland cement]] which was an important advance in the building trades. This process involves [[sintering]] a mixture of [[clay]] and [[limestone]] to about {{convert|1400|°C|0|abbr=on}}, then [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water, sand and [[gravel]] to produce [[concrete]]. Portland cement was used by the famous English engineer [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] several years later when constructing the [[Thames Tunnel]].&lt;ref name="memphis"/&gt; Cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the [[London sewerage system]] a generation later.

===Gas lighting===
{{Main|Gas lighting}}
Another major industry of the later Industrial Revolution was [[gas lighting]]. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this was the work of [[William Murdoch]], an employee of Boulton &amp; Watt, the [[Birmingham]] [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and heavy hydrocarbons), and its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.

===Glass making===
{{Main|Glass production}}
[[File:Crystal Palace interior.jpg|thumb|The Crystal Palace held the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851]]
A new method of producing glass, known as the [[Cylinder blown sheet glass|cylinder process]], was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process was used by the [[Chance Brothers]] to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. [[The Crystal Palace]] is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.

===Paper machine===
{{Main|Paper machine}}
A machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in 1798 by Nicholas Louis Robert who worked for [[Saint-Léger Didot]] family in France. The paper machine is known as a Fourdrinier after the financiers, brothers Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], who were [[stationers]] in London. Although greatly improved and with many variations, the Fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today.

The method of [[continuous production]] demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other [[continuous production]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Industrial technologies that affected farming included the [[seed drill]], the [[British Agricultural Revolution#The Dutch and Rotherham swing (wheel-less) plough|Dutch plough]], which contained iron parts, and the threshing machine.

[[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] invented an improved seed drill in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth.  This was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.  Tull's seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact. Good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation, leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the [[Swing Riots]].

[[Machine tools]] and metalworking techniques developed during the Industrial Revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late 19th century for mass-producing agricultural equipment, such as reapers, binders and combine harvesters.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

===Mining===
[[History of coal mining|Coal mining]] in Britain, particularly in [[South Wales]], started early. Before the steam engine, [[Open-pit mining|pits]] were often shallow [[bell pit]]s following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined by means of an [[adit]] or [[Drift mining|drift mine]] driven into the side of a hill. [[Shaft mining]] was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a [[sough]] (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698 and the [[Newcomen steam engine]] in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of [[John Smeaton]]'s improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.  The [[Cornish engine]], developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the [[Watt steam engine]].

Coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of [[firedamp]] in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the [[safety lamp]] which was invented in 1816 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] and independently by [[George Stephenson]]. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. Firedamp explosions continued, often setting off [[coal dust]] [[explosion]]s, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport during the British Industrial Revolution}}
{{See also| Productivity improving technologies (economic history)#Infrastructures}}

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. [[Wagonway]]s were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century.  Improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed 50% between 1750 and 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coren|first1=Michael J.|title=The speed of Europe's 18th-century sailing ships is revamping history's view of the Industrial Revolution|url=https://qz.com/1193455/the-speed-of-europes-18th-century-sailing-ships-is-revamping-historians-view-of-the-industrial-revolution/|accessdate=31 January 2018|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Revolution improved Britain's transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network, a canal and waterway network, and a railway network. Raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before. Improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly.

====Canals and improved waterways====
{{Main|History of the British canal system}}
[[File:Barton-on-Irwell 11.05.02R.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Bridgewater Canal]], famous because of its commercial success, crossing the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], one of the last canals to be built.]]

Before and during the Industrial Revolution navigation on several British rivers was improved by removing obstructions, straightening curves, widening and deepening and building navigation [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]]s.  Britain had over 1000 miles of navigable rivers and streams by 1750.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Canals and waterways allowed bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland.  This was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that could be drawn in a cart.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grübler"&gt;{{Cite book

Building of canals dates to ancient times.  The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in China, "the world's largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence," parts of which were started between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, is {{convert|1121|mi|0|abbr=out}} long and links [[Hangzhou]] with Beijing.&lt;ref name="Langmead"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Langmead|title=Encyclopedia of Architectural and Engineering Feats|url={{Google books|T5J6GKvGbmMC|page=PA37|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-112-0|page=37|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, canals began to be built in the late 18th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country.  Known for its huge commercial success, the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in [[North West England]], which opened in 1761 and was mostly funded by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]].  From [[Worsley]] to the rapidly growing town of [[Manchester]] its construction cost £168,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|168000|1761|2013|r=-1}}}} {{As of|2013|lc=y}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Timbs|1860|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half.&lt;ref name=Bridgewatercollieries&gt;{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: Bridgewater Collieries | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1985-12-31&amp;fromDate=1785-01-01&amp;currentPageNumber=1&amp;resultsPerPage=10&amp;sortBy=default&amp;offset=0&amp;viewName=&amp;addFilters=&amp;removeFilters=&amp;addCat=&amp;queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&amp;sectionId=1040&amp;currPgSmartSet=1&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08&amp;articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08-001&amp;xmlpath=&amp;pubId=17&amp;totalResults=1638&amp;addRefineFilters=&amp;removeRefineFilters=&amp;addRefineCat=&amp;next_Page=false&amp;prev_Page=false&amp;date_dd_From=1&amp;date_mm_From=01&amp;date_yyyy_From=1785&amp;date_dd_to_range=31&amp;date_mm_to_range=12&amp;date_yyyy_to_range=1985&amp;date_dd_from_precise=1&amp;date_mm_from_precise=01&amp;date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&amp;isDateSearch=false&amp;dateSearchType=range&amp;refineQuerykeywordText= |date=1 December 1913 |accessdate=19 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as [[Canal Mania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kindleberger|1993|pp=192–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; New canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the Bridgewater Canal, the most notable being the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] and the [[Thames and Severn Canal]] which opened in 1774 and 1789 respectively.

By the 1820s a national network was in existence. Canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways. They were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the 1840s on. The last major canal to be built in the United Kingdom was the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], which upon opening in 1894 was the largest [[ship canal]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=1 January 1894: Opening of the Manchester ship canal |quote=Six years in the making, the world's largest navigation canal gives the city direct access to the sea |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/17/guardian190-manchester-ship-canal-opens |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 January 1894 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened Manchester as a [[Port of Manchester|port]]. However it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways, which were quicker and often cheaper.

Britain's canal network, together with its surviving mill buildings, is one of the most enduring features of the early Industrial Revolution to be seen in Britain.

Much of the original British road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes, but from the 1720s (and occasionally earlier) [[Toll road|turnpike]] trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads. Increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the 1750s to the extent that almost every main road in England and Wales was the responsibility of a [[Turnpike trusts|turnpike trust]]. New engineered roads were built by [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]], [[Thomas Telford]] and most notably [[John Loudon McAdam|John McAdam]], with the first '[[macadam]]ised' stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown (1991). "Society and Economy in Modern Britain 1700–1850" p. 136. Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The major turnpikes radiated from London and were the means by which the Royal Mail was able to reach the rest of the country. Heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow, broad wheeled, carts hauled by teams of horses. Lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of [[Packhorse|pack horse]]. Stagecoaches carried the rich, and the less wealthy could pay to ride on [[Un-sprung cart|carriers carts]].

====Railways====

[[File:Opening Liverpool and Manchester Railway.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting the [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] in 1830, the first inter-city railway in the world and which spawned [[Railway Mania]] due to its success.]]

Reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, England.
&lt;blockquote&gt;“A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton.  A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration.  Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together.  A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddled iron]] after 1800, the [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]] for making rails, and the development of the high-pressure steam engine also around 1800.

Wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the 17th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal. These were all horse drawn or relied on gravity, with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline. The first applications of the steam [[locomotive]] were on wagon or plate ways (as they were then often called from the cast-iron plates used). Horse-drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the 19th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs. See: [[Industrial Revolution#Metallurgy|Metallurgy]]

Steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high-pressure steam engines after the expiration of the [[Boulton and Watt]] patent in 1800. High-pressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere, doing away with the condenser and cooling water.  They were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines.  A few of these early locomotives were used in mines.  Steam-hauled public railways began with the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825.

The rapid introduction of railways followed the 1829 [[Rainhill Trials]], which demonstrated [[Robert Stephenson]]'s successful locomotive design and the 1828 development of [[Hot blast]], which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity the [[blast furnace]].

On 15 September 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened, the first inter-city railway in the world and was attended by Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Sussman (2009). "Victorian Technology: Invention, Innovation, and the Rise of the Machine". p. 2. ABC-CLIO, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The railway was engineered by [[Joseph Locke]] and [[George Stephenson]], linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of [[Manchester]] with the port town of [[Liverpool]]. The [[opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening]] was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to [[Railway Mania]].

Construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the 1830s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first Industrial Revolution. After many of the workers had completed the railways, they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities, providing additional workers for the factories.

Other developments included more efficient [[water wheel]]s, based on experiments conducted by the British engineer [[John Smeaton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Social effects==
{{Main|Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution}}

===Factory system===
{{Main|Factory system}}
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most of the workforce was employed in agriculture, either as self-employed farmers as landowners or tenants, or as landless agricultural labourers. It was common for families in various parts of the world to spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing.  Households also spun and wove for market production.  At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution India, China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East produced most of the world's cotton cloth while Europeans produced wool and linen goods.

In Britain by the 16th century the [[putting-out system]], by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as ''cottage industry'', was being practiced.  Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  Merchant capitalist typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the [[Piece work|piece]], and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|pp=57–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early spinning and weaving machinery, such as a [[spinning jenny|40 spindle jenny]] for about six pounds in 1792,  was affordable for cottagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|year-1969|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later machinery such as spinning frames, [[spinning mule]]s and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.

The majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were unmarried women and children, including many orphans.  They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off.  It was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work.  Lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;	Many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.  (See: [[British Agricultural Revolution]], [[Threshing machine]])

The change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by [[Karl Marx]], however, he recognized the increase in productivity made possible by technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Standards of living===
Some economists, such as [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert E. Lucas, Jr.]], say that the real impact of the Industrial Revolution was that "for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth&amp;nbsp;... Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility."&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"/&gt; Others, however, argue that while growth of the economy's overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution, living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries, and that in many ways workers' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=Charles|title=Pessimism Perpetuated: Real Wages and the Standard of Living in Britain during and after the Industrial Revolution|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=September 1998|volume=58|issue=3|pages=625–58|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4123540|accessdate=6 May 2014|doi=10.1017/s0022050700021100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Szreter &amp; Mooney|title=Urbanization, Mortality, and the Standard of Living Debate: New Estimates of the Expectation of Life at Birth in Nineteenth-Century British Cities|journal=The Economic History Review|date=February 1998|volume=51|issue=1|page=104|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.00084|last2=Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the average height of the population declined during the Industrial Revolution, implying that their nutritional status was also decreasing. Real wages were not keeping up with the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küchenhoff |first1=Helmut |date=2012 |title=The Diminution of Physical Stature of the British Male Population in the 18th-Century |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/afc/cliome/v6y2012i1p45-62.html |journal=Cliometrica |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=45–62 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snowdon |first1=Brian |date=April–June 2005 |title=Measures of Progress and Other Tall Stories: From Income to Anthropometrics |url=https://www.worldeconomics.com/Journal/Papers/Measures%20of%20Progress%20and%20Other%20Tall%20Stories.details?ID=209 |journal=World Economics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87–136 |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Industrial Revolution, the [[life expectancy]] of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;

The effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; A series of 1950s essays by [[Henry Phelps Brown]] and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards.&lt;ref name="Woodward81"/&gt; During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.&lt;ref name="Trends in Real Wages in Britain, 1750-1913"/&gt;&lt;ref name="econlib"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hartwell"/&gt;

====Food and nutrition====
{{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including Britain and France, until the late 19th century. Until about 1750, in large part due to malnutrition, life expectancy in France was about 35 years and about 40 years in Britain. The United States population of the time was adequately fed, much taller on average and had life expectancy of 45–50 years although U.S. life expectancy declined by a few years by the mid 19th century. Food consumption per capita also declined during an episode known as the [[Antebellum Puzzle]].&lt;ref name="The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100"/&gt;

Food supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the [[Corn Laws]] (1815-1846).  The Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers.  The Corn Laws were repealed in the early years of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]].

The initial technologies of the Industrial Revolution, such as mechanized textiles, iron and coal, did little, if anything, to lower food prices.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2000"/&gt; In Britain and the Netherlands, food supply increased before the Industrial Revolution due to better agricultural practices; however, population grew too, as noted by [[Thomas Malthus]].&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Housing====
The very rapid growth in population in the 19th century in the cities included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such as Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory  Clark,  "Shelter from the storm: housing and the industrial revolution, 1550–1909." ''Journal of Economic History'' 62#2 (2002): 489–511.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with  large contracting firms.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The speculative builders and developers of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11 (1968): 641–90.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825462 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Powell, ''The British building industry since 1800: An economic history'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;   Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kemp, "Housing landlordism in late nineteenth-century Britain." ''Environment and Planning A'' 14.11 (1982): 1437–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults. [[Cholera]] from polluted water and typhoid were endemic. Unlike rural areas, there were no famines such as devastated Ireland in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Dyos, "The Slums of Victorian London." ''Victorian Studies'' 11.1 (1967): 5–40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825891 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony S. Wohl, ''The eternal slum: housing and social policy in Victorian London'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Daunton, ''House and home in the Victorian city: working-class housing, 1850–1914'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

A large exposé literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions. By far the most famous publication was by one of the founders of the Socialist movement, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described backstreet sections of Manchester and other mill towns, where people lived in crude shanties and shacks, some not completely enclosed, some with dirt floors.  These shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings.  There were no sanitary facilities. Population density was extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;Enid Gauldie, ''Cruel habitations: a history of working-class housing 1780-1918''  (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Not everyone lived in such poor conditions. The Industrial Revolution also created a middle class of businessmen, clerks, foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions.

Conditions improved over the course of the 19th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage, hygiene and home construction. In the introduction of his 1892 edition, Engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved. For example, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] led to the more sanitary [[byelaw terraced house]].

====Sanitation====
In ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844 [[Friedrich Engels]] described how untreated sewage created awful odors and turned the rivers green in industrial cities.

In 1854 [[John Snow]] traced a cholera outbreak in Soho to fecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit.  Snow's findings that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took some years to be accepted, but his work led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems.

====Water supply====
Pre-industrial water supply relied on gravity systems and pumping of water was done by water wheels.  Pipes were typically made of wood.  Steam powered pumps and iron pipes allowed the widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households.&lt;ref name="Hunter_1985"/&gt;

====Increase in literacy====
The invention of the [[paper machine]] and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of [[printing]] supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.

===Clothing and consumer goods===
[[File:BLW Tea and coffee service, Staffordshire.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wedgwood]] tea and coffee service]]
Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils, and in the following decades, stoves for cooking and space heating.  Coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in Europe.  Watches and household clocks became popular consumer items.

Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes in Britain, potter and entrepreneur [[Josiah Wedgwood]], founder of [[Wedgwood]] fine china and porcelain, created goods such as [[tableware]], which was starting to become a common feature on dining tables.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;

===Population increase===
The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=Hudson|first= Pat|year=1992 |publisher =Routledge, Chapman and Hall, Inc.
|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-7131-6531-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Hughes in ''The Fatal Shore'', the [[Demography of England|population of England]] and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;  Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===Urbanization===
The growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive [[urbanisation]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities,&lt;ref name="prb"/&gt; compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).&lt;ref name="prb6"/&gt; Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.&lt;ref name="britannica7"/&gt;

===Impact on women and family life===
Women's historians have debated the effect of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally on the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Amico, ed. ''Reader's guide to women's studies'' (1998) pp 102–4, 306–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Thomas, "Women and capitalism: oppression or emancipation? A review article." ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534–49. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/178999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a pessimistic side, [[Alice Clark]] argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in 16th-century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labour with the husband taking paid labour jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle- and upper-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;  Tilly and Scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of early industrialisation; the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the "family consumer economy," in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas of thrift and hard work characterized middle-class families as the Industrial Revolution swept Europe. These values were displayed in Samuel Smiles' book ''Self-Help'', in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was "voluntary and self-imposed - the results of idleness, thriftlessness, intemperance, and misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thrift|last=Smiles|first=Samuel|publisher=John Murray|year=1875|isbn=|location=London|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour conditions===

====Social structure and working conditions====
In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a [[middle class]] of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life;&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt; however, most workers in textiles, which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;  For workers of the laboring classes, industrial life "was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industry and Empire: From 1750 to the Present Day|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric J.|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=978-1565845619|volume=3|location=Harmondsworth, England|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. [[Pre-industrial society]] was very static and often cruel – [[child labour]], dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="industrial4"/&gt;

====Factories and urbanisation====
{{Main|Factory system}}
[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|left|Manchester, England ("[[Cottonopolis]]"), pictured in 1840, showing the mass of factory chimneys]]

Industrialisation led to the creation of the [[factory]]. The factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas, as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories. Nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of Manchester, nicknamed "[[Cottonopolis]]", and the world's first industrial city.&lt;ref name="Industrial city"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |title=Manchester – the first industrial city |publisher=Entry on Sciencemuseum website |accessdate=17 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309184810/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page84.asp |archivedate=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester experienced a six-times increase in its population between 1771 and 1831. Bradford grew by 50% every ten years between 1811 and 1851 and by 1851 only 50% of the population of Bradford was actually born there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/industrial_revolution_towns.htm|title=Life in Industrial Towns|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, between 1815 and 1939, 20 percent of Europe's population left home, pushed by poverty, a rapidly growing population, and the displacement of peasant farming and artisan manufacturing. They were pulled abroad by the enormous demand for labor overseas, the ready availability of land, and cheap transportation. Still, many did not find a satisfactory life in their new homes, leading 7 million of them to return to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultures in Contact|last=Hoeder|first=Dirk|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=331–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mass migration had large demographic impacts: in 1800, less than one percent of the world population consisted of overseas Europeans and their descendants; by 1930, they represented 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America in the World|last=Guarneri|first=Carl|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration, largely concentrated in the United States.

For much of the 19th century, production was done in small mills, which were typically [[List of watermills in the United Kingdom|water-powered]] and built to serve local needs. Later, each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler.

In other industries, the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was [[Robert Owen]], known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the [[Robert Owen#Philanthropy in New Lanark (1800)|New Lanark mills]], and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the [[Utopian socialism|early socialist movement]].

By 1746 an integrated [[brass mill]] was working at [[Warmley]] near [[Bristol]]. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Matthew Boulton]] (whose [[Soho Manufactory]] was completed in 1766) were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system.

====Child labour====
{{see also|Child labour#The Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:coaltub.png|right|frame|A young "drawer" pulling a coal tub along a mine gallery.&lt;ref name="From Coal Mine Upwards: or Seventy Years of an Eventful Life"/&gt; In Britain laws passed in 1842 and 1844 improved mine working conditions.]]

The Industrial Revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the Industrial Revolution, although ''infant'' mortality rates were reduced markedly.&lt;ref name="Buer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Demographic Transition and Industrial Revolution: A Macroeconomic Investigation"/&gt; There was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work. Employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable; there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine, and since the industrial system was completely new, there were no experienced adult labourers. This made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution between the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.&lt;ref name="galbithink"/&gt;

[[Child labour]] existed before the Industrial Revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible. Many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders,&lt;ref name="victorianweb"/&gt; 10–20% of an adult male's wage.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children as young as four were employed.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Beatings and long hours were common, with some child [[coal mine]]rs and [[hurrying|hurriers]] working from 4 am until 5 pm.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Conditions were dangerous, with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts, while others died from gas explosions.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Many children developed [[lung cancer]] and other diseases and died before the age of 25.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; [[Workhouses]] would sell orphans and abandoned children as "pauper apprentices", working without wages for board and lodging.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters, with some masters [[Shackle|shackling]] them to prevent escape.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed as [[mule scavenger]]s by [[cotton mill]]s would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton, working 14 hours a day, six days a week. Some lost hands or limbs, others were crushed under the machines, and some were decapitated.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Young girls worked at match factories, where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop [[phossy jaw]].&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; Children employed at [[Glassblowing|glassworks]] were regularly burned and blinded, and those working at [[pottery|potteries]] were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt;

Reports were written detailing some of the abuses, particularly in the coal mines&lt;ref name="Testimony Gathered by Ashley's Mines Commission"/&gt; and textile factories,&lt;ref name="The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England"/&gt; and these helped to popularise the children's plight. The public outcry, especially among the upper and middle classes, helped stir change in the young workers' welfare.

Politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted; some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid [[starvation]], and others simply welcomed the cheap labour. In 1833 and 1844, the first general laws against child labour, the [[Factory Acts]], were passed in Britain: Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, children were not permitted to work at night, and the work day of youth under the age of 18 was limited to twelve hours. Factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law, however, their scarcity made enforcement difficult.&lt;ref name="childslaves"/&gt; About ten years later, the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden. Although laws such as these decreased the number of child labourers, child labour remained significantly present in Europe and the United States until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="archives"/&gt;

====Organisation of labour====
{{See also|Trade union#History}}
The Industrial Revolution concentrated labour into mills, factories and mines, thus facilitating the organisation of ''combinations'' or [[trade union]]s to help advance the interests of working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.

The main method the unions used to effect change was [[strike action]]. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the [[Combination Act 1799]] forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after this, unions were still severely restricted. One British newspaper in 1834 described unions as "the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root, under shelter of law, in any country..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tolpuddle Martyrs|last=Evatt|first=Herbert|publisher=Sydney University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0586038321|location=Sydney|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832, the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] extended the vote in Britain but did not grant universal suffrage. That year six men from [[Tolpuddle]] in Dorset founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the 1830s. They refused to work for less than ten shillings a week, although by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to six. In 1834 James Frampton, a local landowner, wrote to the Prime Minister, [[Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], to complain about the union, invoking an obscure law from 1797 prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other, which the members of the Friendly Society had done. James Brine, James Hammett, George Loveless, George's brother James Loveless, George's brother in-law Thomas Standfield, and Thomas's son John Standfield were arrested, found guilty, and transported to Australia. They became known as the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement was the first large-scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice. Its ''Charter'' of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by Parliament without consideration.

Working people also formed [[Friendly society|friendly societies]] and [[Cooperative|co-operative societies]] as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship. Enlightened industrialists, such as [[Robert Owen]] also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class.

Unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike. In 1842, a [[general strike]] involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the Chartist movement which stopped production across Great Britain.&lt;ref name="archive5"/&gt;

Eventually, effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who, after the extensions of the franchise in 1867 and 1885, began to support socialist political parties that later merged to become the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

====Luddites====
{{Main|Luddite}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Luddites smashing a power loom in 1812]]

The rapid industrialisation of the English economy cost many craft workers their jobs. The movement started first with [[lace]] and [[hosiery]] workers near [[Nottingham]] and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation. Many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited (and unskilled) labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver. Many such unemployed workers, weavers, and others, turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery. These attackers became known as Luddites, supposedly followers of [[Ned Ludd]], a folklore figure. The first attacks of the Luddite movement began in 1811. The Luddites rapidly gained popularity, and the British government took drastic measures, using the [[militia]] or [[army]] to protect industry. Those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged, or [[Penal transportation|transported]] for life.

Unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised, such as with agricultural labourers in the 1830s when large parts of southern Britain were affected by the [[Captain Swing]] disturbances. Threshing machines were a particular target, and [[hay]]rick burning was a popular activity. However, the riots led to the first formation of [[trade union]]s, and further pressure for reform.

====Shift in production's center of gravity====
The traditional centers of hand textile production such as India, parts of the Middle East and later China could not withstand the competition from machine-made textiles, which over a period of decades destroyed the hand made textile industries and left millions of people without work, many of whom starved.&lt;ref name="Beckert_2014"/&gt;

The Industrial Revolution also generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world, as measured by the share of manufacturing output.

====Effect on cotton production and expansion of slavery====
Cheap cotton textiles increased the demand for raw cotton; previously, it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown, with little raw cotton available for export. Consequently, prices of raw cotton rose. Some cotton had been grown in the West Indies, particularly in [[Hispaniola]], but Haitian cotton production was halted by the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791. The invention of the cotton gin in 1792 allowed Georgia green seeded cotton to be profitable, leading to the widespread growth of cotton [[plantation]]s in the United States and Brazil. In 1791 world cotton production was estimated to be 490,000,000 pounds with U.S. production accounting to 2,000,000 pounds.  By 1800 U.S. production was 35,000,000 pounds, of which 17,790,000 were exported.  In 1945 the U.S. produced seven-eights of the 1,169,600,000 pounds of world production.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

The Americas, particularly the U.S., had labor shortages and high priced labor, which made [[slavery]] attractive.  America's cotton plantations were highly efficient and profitable, and able to keep up with demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert

===Impact on environment===
[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|Levels of air pollution rose during the Industrial Revolution, sparking the first modern environmental laws to be passed in the mid-19th century.]]
The origins of the [[environmental movement]] lay in the response to increasing levels of [[smoke]] [[pollution]] in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in [[history of coal mining|coal consumption]] gave rise to an unprecedented level of [[air pollution]] in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial [[chemical]] discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.&lt;ref name="Donora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/sloan/cleanair/ |title=History of the Clean Air Act |accessdate=14 February 2006 |first=James R. |last=Fleming |author2=Bethany R. Knorr |publisher=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of Britain's [[Alkali Acts]], passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution ([[gaseous]] [[hydrochloric acid]]) given off by the [[Leblanc process]], used to produce [[soda ash]]. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.

The manufactured gas industry began in British cities in 1812–1820. The technique used produced highly toxic effluent that was dumped into sewers and rivers. The gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits. They usually lost and modified the worst practices. The City of London repeatedly indicted gas companies in the 1820s for polluting the Thames and poisoning its fish. Finally, Parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie  Tomory, "The Environmental History of the Early British Gas Industry, 1812–1830." ''Environmental history'' 17#1 (2012): 29–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The industry reached the US around 1850 causing pollution and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;Joel A. Tarr,  "Toxic Legacy: The Environmental Impact of the Manufactured Gas Industry in the United States." ''Technology and culture'' 55#1 (2014): 107–47. [http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&amp;context=history online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in Britain in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash, and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Brian William Clapp, ''An environmental history of Britain since the industrial revolution'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrialisation beyond the United Kingdom==

===Continental Europe===
The Industrial Revolution on [[Continental Europe]] came a little later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this involved the application of technology developed in Britain in new places. Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the [[Ruhr|Ruhr Valley]] in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as [[Iron and steel industry|iron]]), the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the British technology were adopted.

====Belgium====

[[History of Belgium|Belgium]] was the second country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in continental Europe: [[Wallonia]] (French speaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model successfully. Starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Liège]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories at [[Seraing]] integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.&lt;ref name="publishing"/&gt;

Wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion. Thanks to coal (the French word "houille" was coined in Wallonia),&lt;ref name="language"/&gt; the region geared up to become the 2nd industrial power in the world after Britain. But it is also pointed out by many researchers, with its ''[[Sillon industriel]]'', 'Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], [...] there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making...'.&lt;ref name="ugent"/&gt; Philippe Raxhon wrote about the period after 1830: "It was not propaganda but a reality the Walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after Britain."&lt;ref name="philippe"/&gt; "The sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Walloon was the old cloth making town of [[Ghent]]."&lt;ref name="erih"/&gt; Michel De Coster, Professor at the [[University of Liège|Université de Liège]] wrote also: "The historians and the economists say that Belgium was the second industrial power of the world, in proportion to its population and its territory [...] But this rank is the one of Wallonia where the coal-mines, the blast furnaces, the iron and zinc factories, the wool industry, the glass industry, the weapons industry... were concentrated." &lt;ref name="linguistiques"/&gt;

=====Demographic effects=====
Wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong Socialist party and strong trade-unions in a particular sociological landscape. At the left, the ''Sillon industriel'', which runs from [[Mons]] in the west, to [[Verviers]] in the east (except part of North Flanders, in another period of the industrial revolution, after 1920). Even if Belgium is the second industrial country after Britain, the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different. In 'Breaking stereotypes', Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devious say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one, but with a strong contrast between northern and southern Belgium. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the Early Modern Period, Flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres [...] at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region (Flanders), with an urbanisation degree of more than 30 per cent, remained one of the most urbanised in the world. By comparison, this proportion reached only 17 per cent in Wallonia, barely 10 per cent in most West European countries, 16 per cent in France and 25 per cent in Britain. Nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure, except in [[Ghent]] [...] Also, in [[Wallonia]] the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process, even though the proportion of city-dwellers rose from 17 to 45 per cent between 1831 and 1910. Especially in the [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] valleys, between the [[Borinage]] and [[Liège]], where there was a huge industrial development based on coal-mining and iron-making, urbanisation was fast. During these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants increased from only 21 to more than one hundred, concentrating nearly half of the Walloon population in this region. Nevertheless, industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres, but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal-mine or a factory. Communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than, for instance, the area around Liège where the old town was there to direct migratory flows.&lt;ref name="stereotypes"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====France====
{{main|Economic history of France}}The industrial revolution in France followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries. Notably, most French historians argue France did not go through a clear ''take-off''.&lt;ref name="marczewski" /&gt; Instead, France's economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the 18th and 19th centuries. However, some stages were identified by Maurice Lévy-Leboyer:
* French Revolution and Napoleonic wars (1789–1815),
* industrialisation, along with Britain (1815–1860),
* economic slowdown (1860–1905),
* renewal of the growth after 1905.

====Germany====
{{main|Economic history of Germany}}

Based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany, which was unified in 1871, became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first the production of dyes based on [[aniline]] was critical.&lt;ref name=Haber&gt;{{harvnb|Haber|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's political disunity – with three dozen states – and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain's. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and pulled ahead of France&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815–1914'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{Main|Economic history of Sweden}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}

During the period 1790–1815 Sweden experienced two parallel economic movements: an ''agricultural revolution'' with larger agricultural estates, new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming, and a ''protoindustrialisation'', with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a ''consumption revolution'' starting in the 1820s.

During 1815–1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialised and larger industries. This period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in [[Bergslagen]], textile mills in Sjuhäradsbygden and forestry in [[Norrland]]. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory schooling introduced 1842 (as first country in the world), the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848.

During 1850–1890, Sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export, dominated by crops, wood and steel. Sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and joined the gold standard in 1873.

During 1890–1930, Sweden experienced the second industrial revolution. New industries developed with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, [[papermaking]] and textile.

===Japan===
{{Main|Meiji Restoration|Economic history of Japan}}

The industrial revolution began about 1870 as [[Meiji period]] leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform programme to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan ([[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan]]).

In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the [[Iwakura Mission]] toured Europe and the United States to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The [[Bank of Japan]], founded in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/outline/history/index.htm/|website=Bank of Japan|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west.

Modern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Allen, ''Short Economic History of Modern Japan'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Important American technological contributions during the period of the Industrial Revolution were the [[cotton gin]] and the development of a system for making [[interchangeable parts]], the latter aided by the development of the [[milling (machining)|milling machine]] in the US.  The development of machine tools and the system of interchangeable parts were the basis for the rise of the US as the world's leading industrial nation in the late 19th century.

[[Oliver Evans]] invented an automated flour mill in the mid-1780s that used [[process control|control mechanisms]] and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.  This is considered to be the first modern [[Bulk material handling|materials handling system]] an important advance in the progress toward [[mass production]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

The United States originally used horse-powered machinery for small scale applications such as grain milling, but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the 1790s. As a result, industrialisation was concentrated in [[New England]] and the  [[Northeastern United States]], which has fast-moving rivers. The newer water-powered production lines proved more economical than horse-drawn production. In the late 19th century steam-powered manufacturing overtook water-powered manufacturing, allowing the industry to spread to the Midwest.

[[Thomas Somers]] and the [[Cabot Brothers]] founded the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] in 1787, the first cotton mill in America, the largest cotton mill of its era,&lt;ref name="manufacturers"/&gt; and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future. This mill was designed to use horse power, but the operators quickly learned that the horse-drawn platform was economically unstable, and had economic losses for years. Despite the losses, the Manufactory served as a playground of innovation, both in turning a large amount of cotton, but also developing the water-powered milling structure used in Slater's Mill.&lt;ref name="publication"/&gt;

In 1793, [[Samuel Slater]] (1768–1835) founded the [[Slater Mill]] at [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. He had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in [[Derbyshire]], England, and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for New York in 1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge. After founding Slater's Mill, he went on to own 13 textile mills.&lt;ref name="britannica8"/&gt; [[Daniel Day (manufacturer)|Daniel Day]] established a wool carding mill in the [[Blackstone Valley]] at [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]] in 1809, the third woollen mill established in the US (The first was in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the second at [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].) The [[John Chafee|John H. Chafee]] [[Blackstone Valley|Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor]] retraces the history of "America's Hardest-Working River', the Blackstone. The [[Blackstone River]] and its tributaries, which cover more than {{convert|45|mi|km}} from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], was the birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution. At its peak over 1100 mills operated in this valley, including Slater's mill, and with it the earliest beginnings of America's Industrial and Technological Development.

[[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Merchant Francis Cabot Lowell]] from [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of British factories in 1810. Realising that the [[War of 1812]] had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in America, on his return to the United States, he set up the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]. Lowell and his partners built America's second cotton-to-cloth textile mill at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], second to the [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]]. After his death in 1817, his associates built America's first planned factory town, which they named after him. This enterprise was capitalised in a [[Initial public offering|public stock offering]], one of the first uses of it in the United States. [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], using {{convert|5.6|mi|km}} of canals and 10,000 horsepower delivered by the [[Merrimack River]], is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the American Industrial Revolution. The short-lived utopia-like [[Waltham-Lowell system]] was formed, as a direct response to the poor working conditions in Britain. However, by 1850, especially following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]], the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour.

A major U.S. contribution to industrialization was the development of techniques to make [[interchangeable parts]] from metal.  Precision metal machining techniques were developed by the U.S. Department of War to make interchangeable parts for small firearms.  The development work took place at the Federal Arsenals at Springfield Armory and Harpers Ferry Armory.  Techniques for precision machining using machine tools included using fixtures to hold the parts in proper position, jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy.  The [[milling machine]], a fundamental machine tool, is believed to have been invented by [[Eli Whitney]], who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program.  Another important invention was the Blanchard lathe, invented by [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]].  The Blanchard lathe, or pattern tracing lathe, was actually a shaper that could produce copies of wooden gun stocks.  The use of machinery and the techniques for producing standardized and interchangeable parts became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]].&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Precision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that mechanized the shoe industry.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1989"&gt;{{cite book

The industrialisation of the watch industry started 1854 also in Waltham, Massachusetts, at the [[Waltham Watch Company]], with the development of machine tools, gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches.

==Second Industrial Revolution==
{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Hartmann Maschinenhalle 1868 (01).jpg|thumb|[[Sächsische Maschinenfabrik]] in [[Chemnitz]], Germany, 1868]]
&lt;!--The industries created by the original innovations of the Industrial Revolution were mature and their markets saturated by the late 1830s, resulting in an economic downturn at that time, followed by a long period of slow growth.--&gt;    
[[Steel]] is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass-production, which are said to characterise a "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of [[steel]] was not invented until the 1860s, when [[Henry Bessemer|Sir Henry Bessemer]] invented a new furnace which could convert molten [[pig iron]] into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men, Machines and Modern Times"/&gt;  Bessemer steel was being displaced by the [[open hearth furnace]] near the end of the 19th century.

This Second Industrial Revolution gradually grew to include chemicals, mainly the [[chemical industry|chemical industries]], [[petroleum]] (refining and distribution), and, in the 20th century, the [[automotive industry]], and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from Britain to the United States and Germany.

The increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation.

A new revolution began with electricity and [[electrification]] in the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industries]]. The introduction of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation in the [[Alps]] enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal-deprived northern Italy, beginning in the 1890s.

By the 1890s, industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests, as companies like [[U.S. Steel]], [[General Electric]], [[Standard Oil]] and [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] joined the railroad and ship companies on the world's [[stock market]]s.

==Causes==
[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Regional [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita changed very little for most of human history before the Industrial Revolution.]]
The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate, with some historians believing the Industrial Revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of [[feudalism]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] after the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.  The [[Enclosure]] movement and the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] made food production more efficient and less labour-intensive, forcing the farmers who could no longer be self-sufficient in agriculture into [[cottage industry]], for example [[weaving]], and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed [[factory|factories]].&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England"/&gt; The [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] of the 17th century with the accompanying development of international trade, creation of [[financial market]]s and accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] are also cited as factors, as is the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;   A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=13–16|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the Industrial Revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine.&lt;ref name="industrial10"/&gt; However, recent research into the Marketing Era has challenged the traditional, supply-oriented interpretation of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="association"/&gt;

[[Lewis Mumford]] has proposed that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the [[Early Middle Ages]], much earlier than most estimates.&lt;ref name="Technics &amp; Civilization"/&gt; He explains that the model for standardised [[mass production]] was the [[printing press]] and that "the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock". He also cites the [[Monasticism|monastic]] emphasis on order and time-keeping, as well as the fact that [[medieval]] cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine.

The presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the Industrial Revolution, particularly explaining why it occurred in Britain. In other nations, such as France, markets were split up by local regions, which often imposed tolls and [[tariff]]s on goods traded among them.&lt;ref name="google11"/&gt; Internal tariffs were abolished by [[Henry VIII of England]], they survived in Russia until 1753, 1789 in France and 1839 in Spain.

Governments' grant of limited [[monopoly|monopolies]] to inventors under a developing [[patent]] system (the [[Statute of Monopolies]] in 1623) is considered an influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine, the key enabling technology. In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors.&lt;ref name="industrialisation"/&gt; Watt's monopoly prevented other inventors, such as [[Richard Trevithick]], [[William Murdoch]],  or [[Jonathan Hornblower]], whom Boulton and Watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.&lt;ref name="dklevine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mott-smith"/&gt;

One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly China, [[Indian subcontinent|India]], and the Middle East (which pioneered in shipbuilding, textile production, water mills, and much more in the period between 750 and 1100&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic Progress|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0195074772|location=New York|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at other times like in [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]&lt;ref name="j-bradford-delong"/&gt; or the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="historyguide"/&gt; A recent account argued that Europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedom-loving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early Indo-European invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Uniqueness of Western Civilization|last=Duchesne|first=Ricardo|publisher=Brill|year=2011|isbn=978-9004232761|location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians, however, have challenged this explanation as being not only Eurocentric, but also ignoring historical context. In fact, before the Industrial Revolution, "there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vries|first=Pier|date=2001|title=Are Coal and Colonies Really Crucial?|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These historians have suggested a number of other factors, including education, technological changes&lt;ref name="google12"/&gt; (see [[scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]] in Europe), "modern" government, "modern" work attitudes, ecology, and culture.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution – Causes"/&gt;

China was the world's most technologically advanced country for many centuries; however, China stagnated economically and technologically and was surpassed by Western Europe before the Age of Exploration, by which time China banned imports and denied entry to foreigners. China was also a totalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern estimates of per capita income in Western Europe in the late 18th century are of roughly 1,500 dollars in [[purchasing power parity]] (and Britain had a [[per capita income]] of nearly 2,000 dollars&lt;ref name="iisg"/&gt;) whereas China, by comparison, had only 450 dollars.

Historians such as [[David Landes]] and [[Max Weber]] credit the different belief systems in Asia and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= David S. Landes|date=1969|title= The Unbound Prometheus|publisher= Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-09418-4|pages=20–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The religion and beliefs of Europe were largely products of [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christianity]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thought. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Han Fei]]zi ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]), [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] ([[Taoism]]), and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] ([[Buddhism]]), resulting in very different worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Merson|1990|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include the considerable distance of China's coal deposits, though large, from its cities as well as the then unnavigable [[Yellow River]] that connects these deposits to the sea.&lt;ref name="professor"/&gt;

Regarding India, the Marxist historian [[Rajani Palme Dutt]] said: "The capital to finance the Industrial Revolution in India instead went into financing the Industrial Revolution in Britain."&lt;ref name="india_resource"/&gt; In contrast to China, India was split up into many competing kingdoms after the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], with the major ones in its aftermath including the [[Maratha]]s, [[Sikh]]s, [[Bengal Subah]], and [[Kingdom of Mysore]]. In addition, the economy was highly dependent on two sectors – agriculture of subsistence and cotton, and there appears to have been little technical innovation. It is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the British take over.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Economic historian [[Joel Mokyr]] has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India by providing "an insurance against economic and technological stagnation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia|last=Jones|first=Eric|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; China had both a printing press and movable type, and India had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

In addition, Europe's monarchs desperately needed revenue, pushing them into alliances with their merchant classes. Small groups of merchants were granted monopolies and tax-collecting responsibilities in exchange for payments to the state.

===Causes in Britain===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|upright=1.35|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies.]]

Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled [[entrepreneur]]s to pioneer the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Nation, the State, and the First Industrial Revolution," ''Journal of British Studies'' (April 2011) 50#2 pp.&amp;nbsp;307–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Key factors fostering this environment were: (1) The period of peace and stability which followed the unification of England and Scotland; (2) no trade barriers between England and Scotland; (3) the rule of law (enforcing property rights and respecting the sanctity of contracts); (4) a straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of joint-stock companies (corporations); (5) absence of tolls, which had largely disappeared from Britain by the 15th century, but were an extreme burden on goods elsewhere in the world, and (6) a free market (capitalism).&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;
{{Quote box|width=24%|align=left|quote="An unprecedented explosion of new ideas, and new technological inventions, transformed our use of energy, creating an increasingly industrial and urbanised country. Roads, railways and canals were built. Great cities appeared. Scores of factories and mills sprang up. Our landscape would never be the same again. It was a revolution that transformed not only the country, but the world itself." |source = – British historian [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] on the BBC's ''Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here''.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the Industrial Revolution Happened Here|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pz9d6|publisher=BBC|date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Geographical and natural resource advantages of Great Britain were the fact that it had extensive coastlines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality coal in Europe.&lt;ref name="David S. Landes 1969"/&gt;{{rp|332}}

There were two main values that really drove the Industrial Revolution in Britain. These values were self-interest and an [[entrepreneurial]] spirit. Because of these interests, many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a [[consumer]] revolution.&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt; These advancements also greatly benefitted the British society as a whole. Countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in Britain and use them as an example to begin their own Industrial Revolutions.&lt;ref name="Kiely"&gt;Kiely, Ray (November 2011). "Industrialization and Development: A Comparative Analysis". UGL Press Limited: 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the start of the Industrial Revolution also concerns the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas [[British Empire#Colonization|colonies]] or that profits from the British [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="Was slavery the engine of economic growth? Digital History"/&gt; Even though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of Britain's industrial output.&lt;ref name="The Industrial Revolution by Pat Hudson, pg. 198"/&gt;
[[File:William Bell Scott - Iron and Coal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[William Bell Scott]] ''Iron and Coal'', 1855–60]]

Instead, the greater [[liberalisation]] of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed Britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies, particularly China and Russia. Britain emerged from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as the only European nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse, and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size (European merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the [[Royal Navy]]&lt;ref name="manufacturing"/&gt;). Britain's extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods. The conflict resulted in most British warfare being conducted overseas, reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of Europe. This was further aided by Britain's geographical position – an island separated from the rest of mainland Europe.

Another theory is that Britain was able to succeed in the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed. It had a dense population for its small geographical size. [[Enclosure]] of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available. There was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the [[Northern England|North of England]], the [[English Midlands]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]]. Local supplies of coal, iron, lead, copper, tin, limestone and water power, resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry. Also, the damp, mild weather conditions of the North West of England provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton, providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry.

The stable political situation in Britain from around 1688 following the [[Glorious Revolution]], and British society's greater receptiveness to change (compared with other European countries) can also be said to be factors favouring the Industrial Revolution. Peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the Enclosure movement, and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="dictatorship"/&gt; (This point is also made in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''[[The Servile State]]''.)

The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote about capitalism and religious tolerance in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733), noting why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. "Take a view of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange in London]], a place more venerable than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan [Muslim], and the Christian transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's word. If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians.

Britain's population grew 280% 1550–1820, while the rest of Western Europe grew 50–80%. Seventy percent of European urbanisation happened in Britain 1750–1800. By 1800, only the Netherlands was more urbanised than Britain. This was only possible because coal, coke, imported cotton, brick and slate had replaced wood, charcoal, flax, peat and thatch. The latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not. Yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse's work was mechanised. A workhorse needs {{convert|3|to|5|acres|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy.

In 1700, 5/6 of coal mined worldwide was in Britain, while the Netherlands had none; so despite having Europe's best transport, most urbanised, well paid, literate people and lowest taxes, it failed to industrialise. In the 18th century, it was the only European country whose cities and population shrank. Without coal, Britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the 1830s.&lt;ref name="continuity"/&gt;

Economic historian [[Robert C. Allen|Robert Allen]] has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-01|title=Explaining the first Industrial Revolution: two views|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/15/1/153/512087/Explaining-the-first-Industrial-Revolution-two|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=15|issue=1|pages=153–168|doi=10.1017/S1361491610000201|issn=1361-4916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, two 2018 studies in ''[[The Economic History Review]]'' showed that wages were not particularly high in the British [[Spinning wheel|spinning]] sector or the construction sector, casting doubt on Allen's explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Jane|last2=Schneider|first2=Benjamin|date=2018-05-23|title=Spinning the industrial revolution|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|doi=10.1111/ehr.12693|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Judy Z.|date=2017-05-13|title='Real' wages?

===Transfer of knowledge===
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]] (ca. 1766). Informal philosophical societies spread scientific advances]]
Knowledge of innovation was spread by several means. Workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached. A common method was for someone to make a study tour, gathering information where he could. During the whole of the Industrial Revolution and for the century before, all European countries and America engaged in study-touring; some nations, like Sweden and France, even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy. In other countries, notably Britain and America, this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods. Study tours were common then, as now, as was the keeping of travel diaries. Records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods.

Another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies, like the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], in which members met to discuss 'natural philosophy' (''i.e.'' science) and often its application to manufacturing. The Lunar Society flourished from 1765 to 1809, and it has been said of them, "They were, if you like, the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions, the Industrial Revolution".&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; Other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions. For example, the London-based [[Royal Society of Arts]] published an illustrated volume of new inventions, as well as papers about them in its annual ''Transactions''.

There were publications describing technology. [[Encyclopedia|Encyclopaedias]] such as [[John Harris (writer)|Harris]]'s ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704) and [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1802–1819) contain much of value. ''Cyclopaedia'' contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the Industrial Revolution, very well illustrated by fine engravings. Foreign printed sources such as the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]'' and Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates.

Periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the 18th century, and many regularly included notice of the latest patents. Foreign periodicals, such as the ''Annales des Mines'', published accounts of travels made by French engineers who observed British methods on study tours.

====Protestant work ethic====
{{Main|Protestant work ethic}}
Another theory is that the British advance was due to the presence of an [[entrepreneur]]ial class which believed in progress, technology and hard work.&lt;ref name="Capital and Innovation: How Britain Became the First Industrial Nation"/&gt; The existence of this class is often linked to the [[Protestant work ethic]] (see [[Max Weber]]) and the particular status of the [[Baptists]] and the dissenting Protestant sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] that had flourished with the [[English Civil War]]. Reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law, which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in Britain in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the [[Government debt|national debt]] by the [[Bank of England]], contributed to the capacity for, and interest in, private financial investment in industrial ventures.

[[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices, as well as education at England's [[Oxbridge|only two universities]] at the time (although dissenters were still free to study at Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|four universities]]). When the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] became mandatory due to the [[Test Act]], they thereupon became active in banking, manufacturing and education. The [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], in particular, were very involved in education, by running Dissenting Academies, where, in contrast to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Eton and Harrow, much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences – areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies.

Historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important, along with the nature of the national economies involved. While members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government, they were considered fellow Protestants, to a limited extent, by many in the [[middle class]], such as traditional financiers or other businessmen. Given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital, the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.

==Opposition from Romanticism==
{{Main|Romanticism}}
During the Industrial Revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed, associated with the Romantic movement.  Romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialization, urbanization and the wretchedness of the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Löwy and Robert Sayre, eds., ''Romanticism against the Tide of Modernity'' (Duke University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Its major exponents in English included the artist and poet [[William Blake]] and poets [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. The movement stressed the importance of "nature" in art and language, in contrast to "monstrous" machines and factories; the "Dark satanic mills" of Blake's poem "[[And did those feet in ancient time]]". [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two-edged. French Romanticism likewise was highly critical of industry.&lt;ref&gt;AJ George, ''The development of French romanticism: the impact of the industrial revolution on literature'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="manufacturing"&gt;The Royal Navy itself may have contributed to Britain's industrial growth. Among the first complex industrial manufacturing processes to arise in Britain were those that produced material for British warships. For instance, the average warship of the period used roughly 1000 pulley fittings. With a fleet as large as the Royal Navy, and with these fittings needing to be replaced every 4 to 5 years, this created a great demand which encouraged industrial expansion. The industrial manufacture of rope can also be seen as a similar factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">'''John Brunton'''  (1837&amp;ndash;1917) was a Scottish manufacturer and philanthropist. The [[Brunton Theatre]] in [[Musselburgh]] is named after his family.

Owner of a large wireworks he was the creator of lenticular line, used for aircraft production. Originally called '''Bruntonised wire''', due to inadequate patenting the creation was taken over by the [[Royal Aircraft Factory]] in 1912 and this streamlined (non-circular) wire was thereafter called '''RAF wire'''.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Stephencdickson/sandbox&amp;action=edit&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:The Brunton family grave, Inveresk.jpg|thumb|The Brunton family grave, Inveresk]]
He was born in [[East Lothian]] in 1837 and spent most of his life in [[Musselburgh]].

In 1870 W. N. Brunton (either his father or older brother) opened "W. N. Brunton" a metalworks in [[Musselburgh]] known as the Seamill. It was one of the first British manufacturers to employ a high number of female workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Bruntons&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 John opened the Brunton Wire Works in Musselburgh. The company made specialist wires such as [[piano wire]]. In 1888 they began making wire rope (mainly for shipping or dock use).

In 1909 he first created streamlined galvanised aircraft wire and offered it to the War Office. The War Office was impressed but effectively stole his idea, patenting it as "RAF Wire". However, they returned to Bruntons as the only factory capable of actually making the wire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastlothianatwar.co.uk/ELAW/Wartime_Industries.html&lt;/ref&gt; The wires were originally made in [[Duraluminum]] but quickly changed to the more reliable steel.

Over and above aircraft wires, Brunton's wartime work included 100,000 rifle rods, field telephone wires, anti-submarine nets and bomb-proof nets for buildings.After the war the decline in need for wire brought diversification, with the company branching into [[spark plug]]s and cinema projectors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crossandcockade.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 they took over the rival company George Elliot &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Bruntons&lt;/ref&gt;

John Brunton died in 1937. He is buried in [[Inveresk]] cemetery with his wife, who died in 1899. His name is written on the reverse of the large red granite monument and is only visible from the northern cemetery. The monument includes a stone bench on its south side.

His company still exists in the form of '''Brunton Aero Products''' on Inveresk Road in Musselburgh, and continues to supply specialist wires for aircraft use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bruntons.co.uk/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruntons also supplied the hawsers for the [[Queen Mary (ship)|Queen Mary]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastlothianatwar.co.uk/ELAW/Wartime_Industries.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

The company was taken over by his son John Dixon Brunton (1872-1951). The latter left the family fortune of £700,000 to the town of Musselburgh, with which the Brunton Theatre was built.

[[Image:Leopold Park.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Leopold Park is a major feature of the area, and retains some of its architectural heritage. The Paul-Henri Spaak building of the [[Espace Léopold]], now housing the European Parliament can be seen in the background.]]

The '''Leopold Quarter''' ({{lang-fr|Quartier Léopold}}, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: {{Audio|Nl-Leopoldswijk.ogg|''Leopoldswijk''}}) is a [[Quarter (country subdivision)|quarter]] of [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Today the term is sometimes confused with [[Brussels_and_the_European_Union#Quarter|European Quarter]], as the area has come to be dominated by the institutions of the European Union and organisations dealing with them, although the two terms are not in fact the same, with the Leopold Quarter being a smaller more specific area. The Leopold Quarter was traditionally the area immediately south of the [[Small ring (Brussels)|inner ring road]], between the Porte de Namur and Porte de Louvain. Today it lies roughly between the ring road and [[Leopold Park]], and Rue Joseph II/Jozef II Straat and Rue du Trone/Troonstraat.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 30&lt;/ref&gt; The district was created in 1837, named after [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], and covers the areas of the [[List of municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region|municipalities]] of the [[City of Brussels]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Ixelles]] and [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bBFwIGv2qMEC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=leopold+quarter+belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v6WDTZDdII_ksQP9qLzsAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=leopold%20quarter%20belgium&amp;f=false  ''The West European City'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The area was initially designed and built soon after [[Belgian revolution|Belgian independence]] in the 1830s and 40s and was a prestigious residential area for the elite of the new Belgian capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JHFWj687-6IC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=medieval+brussels+leopold+quarter&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2KmDTe6oHI-asAPd3bXpAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20brussels%20leopold%20quarter&amp;f=false  ''The Globalized City'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It remained the most prestigious residential address in the capital until the early 20th century when many of its former residents began to relocate to Brussels' newly developing suburbs.&lt;ref name=Demey&gt;{{cite book|last=Demey|first=Thierry|title=Brussels, capital of Europe|year=2007|publisher=Badeaux|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at that time, but accelerating rapidly only after the 1950s it became more and more a business/institutional area and is today dominated by facilities  of the European Union.

The quarter contains the [[European Parliament]] (with its building known as the [[Espace Léopold]]) and other [[European Union]] offices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-imH3j7niwgC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=european+parliament+building+brussels&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jKeDTbThG5OssAO977DwAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=european%20parliament%20building%20brussels&amp;f=false  ''Brussels and Europe'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a major financial district of Brussels. The [[Brussels-Luxembourg Station]] was formerly known as the Leopold Quarter station before undergoing major rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GKQsdi0Va2EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''Travel Brussels, Belgium'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Place du Luxembourg Panorama 889.jpg|thumb|500px|center|The [[Place du Luxembourg]], with what remains of the old [[Gare du Quartier Léopold]] building centre, and the European Parliament behind. Place du Luxembourg retains some of the more traditional architectural elements of the Quartier Leopold, while the parliamentary complex dominates the now largely institutional area.]]

The area south of the walls of Brussels was largely rural until the 19th century. In the last years of [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian rule]] there were plans mooted to build a new residential district outside of the crowded city walls in the area that became the Leopold Quarter. When the walls were torn down in the wake of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] a plan was adopted to make the area formerly occupied by the walls into a boulevard, which is today the [[Small ring (Brussels)|inner ring road of Brussels]]. In the wake of the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830, the new members of the Belgian upper class hoped to create a new prestigious residential area in the capital. An official plan for the quarter was drawn up by [[Tilman-Francois Suys]] in 1838. The area was designed to emanate from the [[Brussels Park]] located behind the palace. The area was laid out on a grid in a traditional classical pattern. The Leopold Quarter was quickly developed and already had 500 residents by 1847. By 1853 the population had reached 3,212, most property owners or [[landed gentry]] with domestic staff.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other typical residents included civil servants, military officers, members of liberal professions, embassy staff, and representatives of foreign companies.

A railway station called ''Gare du Quartier Léopold'' was built, along with a large square at the end of Rue de Luxembourg, between 1854–55. The station is today known as [[Brussels-Luxembourg Station]], while the square is still known as [[Luxembourg Square]]. They had not been included in Suys' original plans, as the railroad was a new development in the 1830s in Belgium. Designed by [[Gustave Saintenoy]], the station and the railway came to be a defining feature of the area's geography. In those days the outer edge of the area was defined by the [[Maalbeek]] river valley, but in the 1850s plans were drawn up to build a bridge across it to connect [[Rue de la Loi]] to the new military parade ground on the Linthout Plateau (today [[Parc du Cinquantenaire]]).&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eggevoorde Estate had dominated the Maalbeek Valley since the Middle Ages, but portions had been sold off in the intervening centuries. In 1851 a portion was sold off in exchange for shares in the Zoological and Horticultural Society, and the area became what is today the [[Leopold Park]]. The park was intended to be a home for scientific and leisure activities. Horticultural gardens and a zoo were created along with a community hall, reading room, and a cafe restaurant. However, the zoo was poorly managed and the management company went bankrupt in 1876. The horticultural gardens on the other hand were quite successfully managed by Jean Linden, and they became a commercial and scientific success story until 1898 when it was sold. Brussels bought the old Zoological gardens and it was converted into a public recreational park containing a variety of diversions, including the eventual Natural History Museum. In 1884 [[Ernest Solvay]] and Paul Héger, professors at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] began a project to create an expanded university campus in the park. Several of the university's new institutes were created in the park, and stand to this day, including the original site of the [[Solvay Institute of Sociology]].

The population of the area peaked around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930 the population had declined by 30%. Railway connections and then the rise in car ownership and allowed the wealthy residents to live further from the city in more open suburbs. The increasingly old fashioned mansions in the area, which were generally designed for use by families with the help of domestic servants became increasingly difficult to maintain. Property developers began to build apartments in the area in the 1920s and increasingly in the 1930s beginning a gradual change in its architectural character.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 428.&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly at first, companies began to purchase unused mansions and adapt them to their use. Then after the [[Second World War]] several Insurance companies and colonial organizations began a trend toward demolishing the 19th century mansions and townhouses, and building new modern office blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; With changes to the road infrastructure of the inner ring road for the [[1958 World's Fair]] the area became even more attractive to companies, located between the administrative centre of Brussels and the residential suburbs further out. With the growing economy, and then the arrival of the European Institutions in the late 1950s, the area became a major target for property developers building office space for institutional and corporate use. Brussels had no development plan, and did not enforce existing legal restrictions, so most remaining residents left during this time as it had become completely transformed from a formerly quiet residential area into a congested centre of transport and business.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RdlL East.jpg|right|thumb|The area is today dominated by medium rise office blocks dating from the last 50 years.]]

In 1987 the old Leopold brewery was torn down in anticipation of the construction of what would become [[Espace Léopold]], which was unofficially intended to house the [[European Parliament]]. Political and legal wrangling had continually delayed a final conclusion regarding the unofficial seat for the parliament. However, as Brussels hoped to keep all of the official institutions in Europe, provision was made for the construction of a suitable facility. (See : [[Brussels and the European Union]]) The construction of the massive facility changed the face of the area again, putting the above ground railway tracks of the Leopold Quarter train station below ground and renaming it as the Brussels-Luxembourg station.

==Territory-era (1940s-1980s)==
This section lists notable professional wrestling promoters during the "[[History of professional wrestling in the United States#Television era (1950s to 1970s)|Golden Age of Professional Wrestling]]" following the creation of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) in 1948. While most promoters operated [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories|specific wrestling "territories"]] as members of the NWA, a number of so-called "outlaw" promotions were also prominent during this period.

*&lt;span style="background:#FF0000;"&gt;Dark Red&lt;/span&gt; indicates founding members of the National Wrestling Alliance.
*&lt;span style="background:#fdc;"&gt;Light Red&lt;/span&gt; indicates members of the National Wrestling Alliance.
*&lt;span style="background:#bfb;"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt; indicates territory-era promoters who are still active.

He founded and directed the Center's Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/researcher/dr-manfred-gerstenfeld/|title=Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld - Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|website=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Manfred Gerstenfeld was born in [[Vienna]], grew up in [[Amsterdam]] where he obtained a master's degree in [[organic chemistry]] at [[Amsterdam University]]. He also studied  economics at what is nowadays Erasmus university in Rotterdam. He has a high school teaching degree in Jewish studies from the Dutch Jewish seminary. In 1999 he obtained a Ph.D. in [[environmental studies]] at Amsterdam University. In 1964 he moved to [[Paris]] where he became Europe's first financial analyst specializing in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. He moved to [[Israel]] in 1968.  There he became the managing director of an economic consultancy firm partly owned by Israel's then-largest bank Bank leumi. He was  an academic reserve officer in the Israeli Army ([[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]). Gerstenfeld was a board member of one of Israel's largest companies, the [[Israel Corporation]]  and several other Israeli companies.

In the opinion of [[Ha'aretz]] journalist [[Anshel Pfeffer]], writing in 2013, Gerstenfeld 'is without doubt the greatest authority on anti-Semitism today.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Anshel Pfeffer]],  [https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-how-to-be-a-limmud-snob-1.5302403?=&amp;ts=_1517402553757  'How to Be a Limmud Snob: A Guide to Navigating the Ultimate Jewish Conference,'] [[Haaretz]] 22  December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Isi Leibler]], the former chairman of the Governing Board of the [[World Jewish Congress]], wrote in the [[Jerusalem Post]] in 2015: "Gerstenfeld would today...be considered the most qualified analyst of contemporary anti-Semitism with a focus on anti-Israelism." Gerstenfeld was an editor of ''The Jewish Political Studies Review'', co-publisher of the ''Jerusalem Letter/Viewpoints, Post-Holocaust and [[Anti-Semitism]] and Changing Jewish Communities'' and a member of the council of the Foundation for Research of Dutch Jewry, of which he was formerly the vice-chairman. He was chairman of the Board of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], a [[Jerusalem]] based [[think tank]], from 2000 until 2012, where he headed the Institute for Jewish Global Affairs. He is the 2012 recipient of the [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] of the [[Journal for the Study of Antisemitism]].  In 2015, he received the International Leadership Award from [[the Simon Wiesenthal Center]].

Gerstenfeld is controversial in [[Norway]], after claiming that "Norway is a nation of anti-semites" and that "Norwegians are a barbaric and unintelligent people", and accusing [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald]], [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince Haakon]], former Foreign Minister and now Labour leader [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] and former Prime Minister and now NATO Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]] of being "anti-semites". Gerstenfeld has published books about his views on Norway and written several newspaper articles that have been controversial.&lt;ref name="dagbladet5540894"&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/03/30/nyheter/utenriks/israel/5540894/ Israelsk avis: Kristin Halvorsen sa «Død over jødene!»], ''[[Dagbladet]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/03/01/nyheter/antisemittisme/tv_2/5096280/ - Nordmenn er et barbarisk og uintelligent folkeferd], ''[[Dagbladet]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Norway's largest newspaper and main [[newspaper of record]], the conservative daily ''[[Aftenposten]]'', has described Gerstenfeld in an editorial as a [[far-right]] extremist and fanatic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/leder/Falskt-bilde-239803b.html Falsk bilde], ''[[Aftenposten]]'', 22 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Imre Hercz, a Norwegian doctor and well-known member of Norway's Jewish community, has condemned Gerstenfeld's "propaganda war against Norway".&lt;ref name="dagbladet5540894" /&gt; According to expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [[Hilde Henriksen Waage]], Gerstenfeld is a central figure in a smear campaign against Norway on the Israeli far-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/urix/jerusalem-post-fjernet-artikkel-1.6548928|title=Jerusalem Post fjernet artikkel|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Odd-Bjørn Fure]], Norway's main anti-semitism expert and founding director of the [[Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities (Norway)|Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities]], has said that Gerstenfeld "is not worth arguing against. I prefer to deal with serious people. We do not take this person seriously."&lt;ref&gt;"Frykter for undersøkelsens troverdighet". ''[[Norge idag]]''. 25 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marketing Research Association''' ('''MRA''') was a [[501(c)(6)]] [[non-profit]], membership trade association, incorporated in New York state. Members were companies that specialized in, or had departments that specialized in, [[market research]], consumer opinion and related marketing intelligence. Individuals who were marketing research practitioners could also become members. 

Located in [[Washington D.C.]] the Marketing Research Association was founded in 1957.  The MRA's chief product was membership. It was also active in advocating industry positions on legislative and regulatory issues. In January, 2017, the Marketing Research Association merged with [[Council of American Survey Research Organizations|CASRO]] to form the Insights Association.

==Membership==
Membership principally included access to a common [[code of conduct]] and set of [[best practices]]; industry-related news briefs and publications, including its trade-oriented magazine, Alert; invitation to MRA's annual conference and to meetings of its regional chapters; access to market research videos, online training seminars, papers and directories; access to professional certification; legislative updates; governmental advocacy; and access to an online jobs board. Annual membership dues are dependent on the applicant's company size and relationship to the marketing research industry. Some membership-only products are sold separately (i.e., not included in the annual membership fee). The organization said it has approximately 3,000 members.

==Conferences==
MRA held three annual conferences, the Corporate Researchers Conference CRC St. Louis, The Insights &amp; Strategies Conference ISC San Diego and The CEO Summit Napa Valley.

==Governmental Affairs==
MRA's Governmental Affairs section monitored statutory and legislative issues that affected market researchers, such as consumer [[information privacy|data privacy]] legislation and court rulings in each of the 50 United States and in other countries, including [[social media]] legislation, legal issues pertaining to [[consumer privacy]] for medical care and prescriptions (such as [[HIPAA]]-related rulings), [[anti-spam]] legislation, telephone surveys, political polling, and similar issues. On topics such as the [[Telephone Consumer Protection Act]] (TCPA) of 1991, the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s (FTC) and [[Department of Commerce]]'s support of rules restricting access to consumer data, and various Congressional consumer privacy acts, the MRA publicly advocated (i.e., lobbies legislators and other governmental officials to adopt) positions that support the organization's goals. Opposition to these positions generally cames from [[consumer rights]] organizations and their lobbyists.

==Professional Education==
The [[University of Georgia]]'s online course, "Principles of Marketing Research," is based on an MRA-developed curriculum entitled "Market Research Core Body of Knowledge." Scholarships for this course were provided annually by the MRA to one or more qualifying applicants. The Marketing Research Association also offered a Professional Researcher Certificate (PRC) administered through the organization's website. Both of these programs were open to members at additional cost.

==Board of directors==
The MRA Board of Directors included Jill Donahue, Chairman of the Board; Debby Schlesinger-Hellman, PRC, Immediate Past Chairman; Ted Donnelly, Ph.D., PRC, Vice Chair, Vaughn Mordecai, PRC, Treasurer; Dan Womack, PRC, Secretary; and David W. Almy, Chief Executive Officer. The Board also included six Directors at Large: Scott Baker, PRC, Janet Baldi, Jim Bryson, Jerry Haselmayer, Jeffrey Henning, PRC and Elizabeth Merrick.

The '''social means of production''' are capital goods and assets that require organized collective labor effort, as opposed to individual effort, to operate on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Selected Political Writings|author=Karl Kautsky|publisher=978-0333283844|year=1983|page=9|quote= "Here we encounter a further characteristic of the modern wage proletarian. He works not with individual but with social means of production, means of production so extensive that they can be operated only by a society of workers, not by the individual worker."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership and organization of the social means of production is a key factor in categorizing and defining different types of [[economic system]]s.

The means of production includes two broad categories of objects: ''[[instruments of labor]]'' (tools, [[factories]], [[infrastructure]], ''etc.'') and ''[[subjects of labor]]'' ([[natural resource]]s and [[raw material]]s). People operate on the subjects of labor using the instruments of labor to create a product; or stated another way, labor acting on the means of production creates a good.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Evans, ''Karl Marx'', London, England, 1975. Part II, Chap. 2, sect. a; p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[agrarian society]] the principal means of production is the soil and the shovel. In an [[industrial society]] the means of production become social means of production and include factories and mines. In a [[knowledge economy]], computers and networks are means of production. In a broad sense, the "means of production" also includes the "means of [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]]" such as stores, the internet and railroads ([[Infrastructural capital]]).&lt;ref&gt;Flower, B. O. ''The Arena'', Volume 37. The Arena Pub. Co, originally from Princeton University. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marxian analysis ==
The analysis of the technological sophistication of the means of production and how they are owned is a central component in the [[Marxist]] theoretical framework of historical materialism and in [[Marxian economics]].

In Marx's work and subsequent developments in Marxist theory, the process of [[socioeconomic]] evolution is based on the premise of [[technological improvements]] in the means of production. As the level of technology improves with respect to productive capabilities, existing forms of [[Social relations of production|social relations]] become superfluous and unnecessary, creating contradictions between the level of technology in the means of production on the one hand and the [[organization of society]] and its [[economy]] on the other. These contradictions manifest themselves in the form of [[class conflicts]], which develop to a point where the existing mode of production becomes unsustainable, either collapsing or being overthrown in a [[social revolution]]. The contradictions are resolved by the emergence of a new mode of production based on a different set of [[social relations]] including, most notably, different patterns of ownership for the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/o.htm#mode-production Mode of Production]. Marxism.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of the means of production and control over the [[surplus product]] generated by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different [[modes of production]]. Capitalism is defined as private ownership and control over the means of production, where the surplus product becomes a source of [[unearned income]] for its owners. By contrast, [[socialism]] is defined as [[social ownership]] of the means of production so that the surplus product accrues to [[society]] at large.

=== Determinant of class ===
Marx's theory of class defines classes in their relation to their ownership and control of the means of production. In a capitalist society, the [[bourgeoisie]], or the capitalist class, is the class that owns the means of production and derives a passive income from their operation. In contrast, the [[proletariat]], or [[working class]], comprises the majority of the population that lacks access to the means of production and are therefore induced to sell their [[labor power]] for a wage or salary to gain access to necessities, goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ishiyama, Breuning |first= John, Marijke|title= 21st Century Political Science: A Reference Handbook |publisher= SAGE Publications, Inc |date= October 22, 2010|isbn= |page = |quote= For Marx, class was defined by an individual’s relationship to the means of production...Class is determined by the extent to which people own most, some, or little of the means of production, or by their relationship to the means of production. It is generally conflict over control or access to the means of production that drives history. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the question of why classes exist in [[human societies]] in the first place, Karl Marx offered a [[Marx's theory of history|historical]] and scientific explanation that it was the [[cultural practice]] of ownership of the means of production that gives rise to them. This explanation differs dramatically from other explanations based on "differences in ability" between individuals or on religious or political affiliations giving rise to [[castes]]. This explanation is consistent with the bulk of Marxist theory in which Politics and [[Marxism and religion|Religion]] are seen as mere outgrowths ([[base and superstructure|superstructures]]) of the basic underlying economic reality of a people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marx2mao.com/M&amp;E/SUS80.html Frederick Engels: Socialism: Utopian and Scientific Chapter III Historical Materialism] Marx2mao.com.  p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related terms ==
[[Factors of production]] are defined by German [[economist]] [[Karl Marx]] in his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'' as labor, [[subjects of labor]], and instruments of labor: the term is equivalent to means of production plus labor. The factors of production are often listed in economic writings derived from the [[classical economics|classical school]] as "land, labour and capital". Marx sometimes used the term "productive forces" equivalently with "factors of production;" in ''Kapital'', he uses "factors of production", in his famous Preface to the ''[[Critique of Political Economy]]'', he uses "productive forces" (that may depend on the translation).

[[relations of production|Production relations]] (German: ''Produktionsverhältnis'') are the relations humans enter into with each other in using the means of production to produce. Examples of such relations are [[employer]]/employee, buyer/seller, the technical division of labour in a factory, and property relations.

[[Mode of production]] (German: ''Produktionsweise'') means the dominant way in which production is organised in society. For instance, "[[capitalism]]" is the name for the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist ''mode of production'']] in which the means of production are [[Private property|owned privately]] by a small [[Social class|class]] (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who profits off the labor of the [[working class]] (the [[proletariat]]). [[Communism]] is a mode of production in which the means of production are not owned by anyone, but [[Common ownership|shared in common]], without class based [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].

[[Image:Foods.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The term “natural” is applied to many foods, but does not have a consistent meaning.]]

'''Natural foods''' and '''all natural foods''' are widely used terms in [[food labeling]] and marketing with a variety of definitions, most of which are vague. The term is often assumed to imply foods that are not processed and whose ingredients are all [[natural product]]s (in the chemist's sense of that term), thus conveying an [[appeal to nature]]. But the lack of standards in most jurisdictions means that the term assures nothing. In some countries, the term "natural" is defined and enforced. In others, such as the [[United States]], it is not enforced.

==Diverse definitions==
“Natural foods” are often assumed to be foods that are not [[Food processing|processed]], or do not contain any [[food additive]]s, or do not contain particular additives such as [[hormone]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, [[sweeteners]], [[food colors]], or [[Flavouring|flavorings]] that were not originally in the food.&lt;ref&gt;Ikerd, John. [http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-New%20Food%20Movement.htm The New American Food Economy.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, many people (63%) when surveyed showed a preference for products labeled "natural" compared to the unmarked counterparts, based on the common belief (86% of polled consumers) that the term "natural" indicated that the food does not contain any artificial ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, A. (2014). "Natural" Foods: Inherently Confusing. Journal of Corporation Law, 39(3), 657-674. http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/99055404/natural-foods-inherently-confusing&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are variously used and misused on labels and in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch4ae.shtml|title=Guide to Food Labeling and Advertising, Chapter 4|publisher=[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]’s ''[[Codex Alimentarius]]'' does not recognize the term “natural” but does have a standard for [[organic food]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/web/standard_list.do?lang=en|title=List of standards|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamentally, almost all foodstuffs are derived from the natural products of plants and animals&lt;ref&gt;Food processing: a century of change, R. W. Welch and P. C. Mitchell (2000) ''British Medical Bulletin'', 56 (No 1) 1-17, http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/56/1/1-a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition by process and by product==

===United Kingdom===
[[Image:Blue smarties.JPG|thumb|UK blue [[Smarties]], old(Top) and new(Bottom). Blue Smarties were re-introduced by [[Nestlé]] in the UK in February 2008, using a "natural" blue dye derived from the [[cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] [[Spirulina (genus)|spirulina]] rather than synthetic blue dye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7238247.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Seaweed allows Smarties comeback |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Food Standards Agency]] has published criteria for the use of several terms in food labeling. The [[guidance document|guidance]], in general, restricts the use of natural to foods that have "ingredients produced by nature, not the work of man or interfered with by man." [[Natural flavorings]] are explicitly defined by separate laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/markcritguidance.pdf|title=Criteria for use of the terms Fresh, Pure, Natural Etc. in food labeling|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different standards for various types of food, such as [[dairy products]].  It also gives standards for some food processing techniques, such as [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] or [[pasteurization]].  The standard explicitly rules out "foods derived from novel processes, GM or cloning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/markcritguidance.pdf|title=Criteria for use of the terms Fresh, Pure, Natural Etc. in food labeling|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition by process only==

===Canada===

The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] restricts the use of "natural" to foods that have not been significantly altered by processing and gives examples of processes that do or do not significantly alter food.  This includes two specific additional requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch4ae.shtml|title=Guide to Food Labeling and Advertising, Chapter 4|publisher=[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A natural food or ingredient of a food is not expected to contain, or to ever have contained, an added [[vitamin]], [[Dietary element|mineral nutrient]], artificial flavouring agent or food additive.
*A natural food or ingredient of a food does not have any constituent or fraction thereof removed or significantly changed, except the removal of water.

===Israel===

In Israel, natural ingredients are defined as part of the Labelling of Prepacked Food Standard (Israeli Standard SI 1145, which is legally binding).

The standard offers a list of 33 processes which are allowed in natural ingredients, all of which are physical treatments and not chemical modifications. These include blending, cleaning, [[Food extrusion|extrusion]], freezing, drying, etc.

A specific ingredient can be called "natural" if it didn't go through any processing except for the listed ones. The whole food can be called "natural" if the food is not a blend of foods (even if they are all natural), has no added ingredients, and underwent only the specified processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Food%20and%20Agricultural%20Import%20Regulations%20and%20Standards%20-%20Narrative_Tel%20Aviv_Israel_7-26-2010.pdf|title=Food and Agricultural Import Regulations and Standards|publisher=US Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==No definition==

===United States===

In the [[United States]], there are laws/regulations and agencies to protect the consumer when purchasing food products, specifically dedicated to the packaging and labeling. Some laws and organizations include the [[Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990|Nutrition and Labeling Education Act]], the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], and the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS).

FSIS is a subsection of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), which is tasked with the responsibility of "ensuring that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged."&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, A. (2014). "Natural" Foods: Inherently Confusing. ''Journal of Corporation Law'', 39(3), 657-674. http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/99055404/natural-foods-inherently-confusing&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA partnered with the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to develop and issue regulations in appropriate usage of "natural" labels; yet, the FDA does not have specific rules for “natural" labeling. It advised on their website "the agency has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances."&lt;ref&gt;FDA Basics, [http://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/transparency/basics/ucm214868.htm What is the meaning of 'natural' on the labeling of food]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the FDA has not developed any rules or regulations on the defining features of what qualifies a product as "natural." The FDA does reference a definition of "natural" in their informal policy (Ref. 53) that defines "natural" as "nothing artificial or synthetic (including colors regardless of source) is included in, or has been added to, the product that would not normally be expected to be there."&lt;ref&gt;Food Labeling: Nutrient Content Claims, General Principles, Petitions, Definition of Terms, 56 Fed. Reg. 60,421, 60,466 (Nov. 27, 1991) (codified at 21 C.F.R. pts. 5, 101, and 105), available athttp://foodrisk.org/default/assets/File/NLEA-Proposed-60421-60478.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] prohibits labeling that is false or misleading. The USDA's [[Agricultural Marketing Service]] has a standard for [[organic food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop|publisher=AMS|title=National Organic Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2005, the USDA had a section governing "natural claims" in its Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7c48be3e-e516-4ccf-a2d5-b95a128f04ae/Labeling_Policy_Book_082005.pdf?MOD=AJPERES] USDA Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=USDA Meat and Poultry Labeling Terms |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/meat-and-poultry-labeling-terms/meat-and-poultry-labeling-terms/!ut/p/a1/jVJhb5swEP0r9AN8IzYlrdJJaEJMUZutSaNqK-HLZOAAV4CZfQS1v34c1bakStcaGZ_93ume35klLGZJK_ayFChVK2raJ5c_-ZZfelcRX22uvCW_Wf_Ybr5GEV_cX4yE3X8Ia_-D-W-MkL-Xv_pAgXN9G92WLOkEVq5sC8XiEtAVrRlAGxYXSuWuEQXgk1uIDF1TAeAfoBYp1LItWdyAoKzc7VRfo376C7kIujHvEx5YciyXe-N3s_bv59ertc8389eEE36-EN42bHSkrFU6NW8Xtqm_GK-uoQANetbr8bhC7D7Z3ObDMMxKpcoaZplqbD6in40I0NEZBo_Or0DqUrTyeXoNxvbOOSr6Q2t6DRTRjWkVLcpUKuwz2hUawDGq1xkEA6ROlgdzZw95wKOo3C4fwy_OWCogHbbnh2PKkibJKYw0s97kYhS2nw47KrzslEZRU0QMWlF1Mpuiw_5B3meTXAIOuvyad9Bngk55VSmDLD726BTPgNBZ1Qkt6A0cWWahsl7Mssgp659NFnnEuuZ7_PwtvObyrnlY4MUuPDv7DYq_KP0!/#14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the USDA's regulatory jurisdiction applies only to meat, poultry, and egg products.

Because there are few regulations governing the labeling of "natural" foods, manufacturers can include ingredients that may not be considered natural by some consumers.

The poultry industry has been criticized by the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] for labeling chicken meat "all natural" after it has been injected with saline solution up to 25% of its weight. There is no legal recourse to prevent this labeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cspinet.org/new/201002241.html Salt-Water-Soaked Chicken Not at all Natural, Says CSPI] CSPI, February 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are few legal U.S. definitions for natural foods, there are unofficial or informal definitions, none of which is applied uniformly to foods labeled "natural".

'''Product certification''' or '''product qualification''' is the process of certifying that a certain product has passed [[performance test (assessment)|performance test]]s and [[quality assurance]] tests, and meets qualification criteria stipulated in [[contract]]s, [[regulation]]s, or [[specification]]s (typically called "certification schemes" in the product certification industry).

Most product certification bodies (or product certifiers) are [[accreditation|accredited]] to ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996,&lt;ref name=Guide65&gt;ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996&lt;/ref&gt; an international standard for ensuring competence in those organizations performing product certifications.  The organizations that perform this accreditation are called Accreditation Bodies, and they themselves are assessed by international peers against the [[Accreditation|ISO 17011 standard]].&lt;ref name=ISO17011&gt;ISO/IEC 17011:2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Accreditation bodies that participate in the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) Multilateral Agreement (MLA)&lt;ref name="IAF_MLA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaf.nu//articles/IAF_MLA/14|title=IAF MLA|first=|last=elva|date=23 November 2016|work=iaf.nu}}&lt;/ref&gt; also ensure that these accredited Product Certifiers meet additional requirements set forth in "IAF GD5:2006 - IAF Guidance on the Application of ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaf.nu/articles/Guidance_Documents/31|title=IAF Guidance Documents|first=|last=elva|date=5 October 2015|work=iaf.nu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of some certification schemes include the Safety Equipment Institute for protective headgear, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) Telecommunication Certification Body (TCB) program for radio communication devices, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Energy Star]] program, the [[IECEE|International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment]] Product Safety Certification Body Scheme (IEECE CB Scheme), MAS (Materials Analytical Services) Certified Green IEQ program, and the [[Greenguard Environmental Institute]] Indoor Air Quality program. Certification schemes are typically written to include both the performance test methods that the product must be tested to, as well as the criteria that the product must meet to become Certified.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC Guide 28:2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Certifications (and the certificates that document their existence) are often called "certs" in the everyday jargon of various industries.

Also [http://automationkingz.com/worldwide-electrical-certifications/ Electrical certifications] are very important for professionals. If you are pursuing any degree/diploma in electrical or Automation domain. Here are [http://automationkingz.com/worldwide-electrical-certifications/ Worldwide Accepted Electrical Certifications and Standards list].

==Certification process==
A product might be [[verification and validation|verified]] to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number.  This does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for any particular use.  The person or group of persons who own the certification scheme (i.e., engineers, trade unions, building code writers, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications, choose the correct ones, set qualification limits, and enforce compliance with those limits.  The end users of the product have the responsibility to use the item correctly. Products must be [[listing and approval use and compliance|used in accordance]] with their listing for certification to be effective.

Product certification is often required in sensitive industry and marketplace areas where a failure could have serious consequences, such as negatively affecting the health and welfare of the people or person using that product.  For example, certification is stringent in [[aerospace]] applications, since the demands for low weight tend to lead to high stress on components, requiring appropriate [[metallurgy]] and accuracy in [[manufacturing]].  Other sensitive product area examples include [[food]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[healthcare]] products, [[dangerous goods]], and products that have [[Radio Frequency|RF emissions]] such as computers and cellular telephones.

The process for certification of a product is generally summed up in four steps:

* Application (including testing of the product)
* Evaluation (does the test data indicate that the product meets qualification criteria)
* Decision (does a second review of the product application concur with the Evaluation)
* Surveillance (does the product in the marketplace continue to meet qualification criteria)

In many instances, prior to applying for certification, a product supplier will send a product to a testing laboratory (some certification schemes require the product to be sent out for testing by the product certifier instead).  When the product to be certified is received at the testing laboratory, it is tested in accordance with the laboratory's internal procedures and with the methods listed in the test standards specified by the certification scheme.  The resulting data collected by the testing laboratory, and is then forwarded either back to the manufacturer, or directly to the product certifier.

The product certifier then reviews the product supplier's application information, including the testing data.&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt;  If the certifier's evaluation&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; concludes that the test data shows that the product meets all required criteria as listed in the certification scheme, and the decision maker(s) of the product certifier concur with the evaluation,&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; then the product is deemed "certified" and is listed in a directory that the Product certifier is required to keep.&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt;  ISO Guide 65 requires&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; that the final decision to grant or not grant certification be made only by a person or group of persons not involved in the evaluation of the product.

Products often need periodic recertification, also known as surveillance.  This requirement is typically identified within the certification scheme that the product is certified to.  Certification bodies may require product suppliers to perform some sort of surveillance activity,&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; such as pulling sample products from the marketplace for testing,&lt;ref&gt;EPA ENERGY STAR Program, Conditions and Criteria for Recognition of Certification Bodies, Section 3 [http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/downloads/mou/Conditions_and_Criteria_for_Recognition_of_Certification_Bodies.pdf?e51d-6631]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FCC&gt;FCC Telecommunication Certification Body (TCB) Program Roles and Responsibilities, Section 23 [http://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/kdb/forms/FTSSearchResultPage.cfm?id=44683&amp;switch=P]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to maintain their "listed" or "certified" status. Other examples of Surveillance activities include surprise audits of the manufacturing plant, supervision of the manufacturing and/or testing process,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbscheme.com%2FOperational_documents%2Fiecee_documents%2Fod-2029_ed.1.2.pdf&amp;ei=THp0T57mNKPi0QHhh7z_Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnKM9PGjZtqtjbGiH07czo8kHR7g&amp;sig2=9VHI5qC5Dd9ppx0XghqzIA IECEE OD-2029-Ed.1.2]&lt;/ref&gt; or a simple paperwork submittal from the supplier to the product certifier to ensure that the certified product has not changed. Other causes for recertification may include complaints issued against the product's functionality, which would require removal from the marketplace, and expiration of the original certification. These lists of examples are by no means all inclusive.

Some certification schemes, or the product certifiers that operate those Schemes, may require that the product supplier operate a [[Quality Management System]] registered to [[ISO 9000]], or that the testing be performed by a laboratory [[accredited]] to [[ISO 17025]].&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 17025:2005&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to set these requirements is most often made by the person or group which owns the Certification Scheme.

==Certification marks and listings of certified products==
{{main|Certification mark|certification listing}}
Certified products are typically endorsed with a [[certification mark]] provided by the product certifier. Issuance of a certification mark is at the discretion of the individual product certifier. ISO Guide 65 does not require the product certifier to offer a certification mark in the event that a certificate is offered.  When certification marks are issued and used on products, they are usually easy to see and enable users to track down the [[certification listing]]s to determine the criteria that the product meets, and whether or not the listing is still active.

An active [[certification listing]] must minimally include indication of&lt;ref name=Guide65 /&gt; the following information:
* The specific product or type of product certified
* The qualification standard that the product is judged to meet
* The date of certification (and if applicable, its expiration)

Product certifiers may choose to include much more information than that listed above, but ISO Guide 65 specifies the bare minimum which must be made available regarding the certification status of a product.

These listings are typically used by an Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), such as a municipal building inspector, fire prevention officer, or electrical inspector, to compare the product's use or installation with the intent of the rating by testing. In order to comply with the code, the product listing must be "active", as products and companies can become "de-listed" due to re-testing showing that a product no longer meets qualification criteria, or a business decision by the manufacturer.

The widespread availability of the Internet has led to a new kind of certification for websites. Website certifications exist to certify the website's [[privacy policy]], [[security]] of their [[financial transaction]]s, suitability for [[minor (law)|minors]], among many other acceptability characteristics.  In [[broadcast engineering]], [[transmitter]]s and [[radio antenna]]s often must by certified by the country's [[broadcasting authority]].  In the United States, this certification was once called "type acceptance" by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and applied to most services except [[amateur radio]] due to its inherent [[amateur radio homebrew|homebrew]] nature.  Today the FCC requires&lt;ref name=FCC /&gt; all testing of transmitters and antennas to be performed in a laboratory accredited to ISO 17025, with that laboratory being part of the overall organization that houses the Product Certification Body (TCB).

==Accreditation bodies==
The [[International Accreditation Forum]] (IAF) has a listing of all recognized Accreditation Bodies whose accreditations to the ISO Guide 65 standard are deemed equivalent. From the IAF MLA informational page:&lt;ref name="IAF_MLA"/&gt;

:"IAF is encouraging more of its members to join the MLA as soon as they have passed a rigorous evaluation process to ensure that their accreditation programs are of world standard.  The consequence of joining the IAF MLA is that conformity assessment certificates issued, within the scope of the IAF MLA, by conformity assessment bodies accredited by any one of the members of the IAF MLA will be recognised in the world wide IAF program."

Most countries only have a single Accreditation Body representing their economy in the IAF MLA.  The two exceptions are the United States with [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), American National Standards Institute - American Society for Quality National Accreditation Board (ANAB, a subdivision of ANSI), American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), and International Accreditation Service (IAS) as signatory members, and United Accreditation Foundation as Full Member of IAF (International Accreditation Forum) Europe with Germany's [[Technischer Überwachungsverein]] (TÜV), and Korea which is represented by Korea Accreditation Board (KAB) and Korean Accreditation System (KAS).  These listings are current as of March 2012, but will likely change in the future as more Accreditation Bodies undergo the required peer evaluations in order to become signatory members of the MLA.

Each Accreditation Body is required to keep a listing of those organizations it accredits, as well as a Scope of Accreditation which details the activities that the organizations can perform, whether that be testing, inspection, or product certification.&lt;ref name=ISO17011 /&gt;

Accreditation Bodies routinely [[audit]]&lt;ref name=ISO17011 /&gt; the Product Certifiers whom they have accredited in order to determine if the performance or actions of the organization have changed and do not meet the requirements of the Accreditation Body and the International Standards they are to conform to.

Its not mandatory for each Accreditation Bodies to be member of IAF or to join IAF in any manner, there have been several accreditation Board like AB-CAB, ESMA, NACI etc.

==European Economic Area== 
Within the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), the majority of products are required to be ‘[[CE_marking|CE Marked]]’ and will have the letter CE on them. It shows that the manufacturer or importer has checked that these products meet EU safety, health or environmental requirements; is an indicator of a product’s compliance with EU legislation and allows the free movement of products within the European market.

By placing the CE marking on a product, a manufacturer or importer is declaring, on his sole responsibility, conformity with all of the legal requirements to achieve CE marking. The manufacturer is thus ensuring validity for that product to be sold throughout the EEA. This also applies to products made in third countries which are sold in the EEA and Turkey.

If you are a manufacturer it is your responsibility to:

* carry out the conformity assessment (including any testing, if required)
* set up the technical file
* issue the EC Declaration of Conformity (DoC)
* place CE marking on a product

If you are a distributor you must check the presence of both the CE marking and the necessary supporting documentation.

If you are importing a product that is from a third country you have to check that the manufacturer outside the EU has undertaken the necessary steps. You must check that the documentation is available.
The Europa website gives details various product categories and the relevant EU directives to which products must conform.

==International applications==
{{original research|section|date=August 2015}}
North America's nuclear industry is exempt from mandatory certification{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.  This has allowed situations leading to large amounts of remedial work, especially for [[fireproofing]] of electrical circuits ([[circuit integrity]]) between nuclear reactor and control rooms in the U.S.  In this case, submitors were permitted to dictate not only their test procedures, but also to construct test specimens in their own facilities, prior to fire tests on the part of laboratories.  The primary example of this situation is the [[Thermo-Lag scandal]], which came about as a result of disclosures by [[whistleblower]] [[Gerald W. Brown]] to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] as well as watchdog groups, members of US Congress, and the press.

In Germany, the accredited testing organizations routinely audit manufacturing locations and submit quality control test results to DIBt. While the German laboratories do not possess process standards, their methodology can uncover changes in the nature and quality of ingredients, as DIBt establishes very clear tolerances for performance{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

Where product certification is optional, one must rely on the [[ethics]] of the manufacturer{{whom|date=August 2015}} that the item being sold is identical to the item that was tested, and that the item that was tested was in fact installed the way the test report reads. The test report by itself also does not afford its bona fide interpretation in terms of the tolerances that a certification listing would provide.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''Roberto Nicastro''', an Italian businessman and banker, he has been the Chairman of the "Good Banks" and was the Group General Manager of Unicredit; in the past he worked with McKinsey &amp; Co and Salomon Brothers. He is also involved in postgraduate education advisories and charitable activities.

==Early years==

He was born in [[Trento]], on December 9, 1964 where he has lived up to senior age.&lt;ref name="tsm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsm.tn.it/interne/roberto_nicastro,_l_ex_mc_kinsey_partito_da_trento_materiali.ashx?id=8429&amp;idd=3306|title=dicono di noi - Roberto Nicastro, l'ex Mc Kinsey partito da Trento|accessdate=11 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then moved to Milano, where he earned a Major in Business Administration at the [[Bocconi University]] in 1989, under Professor [[:it:Claudio Dematté|Claudio Dematté]]'s tutorship.

==Career==

In 1989 he joined the M&amp;A department of [[Salomon Brothers]] in London.

In 1991 he became a strategic consultant in Milan with [[McKinsey &amp; Co]], where he had been involved in consumer goods, financial services and banking regulation projects in Italy and in Brazil.

Roberto Nicastro joined [[UniCredit]] in May 1997, as Head of Strategy, Planning and Control of then [[:it:Credito Italiano|Credito Italiano]]. In the early years at Unicredit he developed the footprint of the Unicredit Group in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] through the acquisition and following restructuring/integration of [[Bank Pekao]] (Poland), [[Zagrebačka banka]] (Croatia-Bosnia), [[Bulbank]] (Bulgaria), [[Koçbank]] (50%, Turkey), [[Živnostenská banka]] (Czech republic), [[Demir Bank]] (Romania), Polnobanka (Slovakia).

The '''Sustainability Accounting Standards Board''' was founded in 2011 to develop and disseminate [[sustainability accounting]] [[Generally accepted accounting principles|standards]]. While the [[FASB]] has for the past forty years developed the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|accounting principles]] currently used in [[financial reporting]] in the United States, other [[Social and environmental accounting|social and environmental measures]] are now understood to be of relevance. The SASB aims to integrate its standards into the [[Form 10-K]] which must be filed by [[public companies]] with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]; in this sense it differs from initiatives such as the [[Global Reporting Initiative|GRI]], by working within the current system of [[financial regulation]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/78e36030-b93f-11e1-b4d6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz22rFwi7UQ |title=US companies urged to put natural capital in accounts |author=Scott, Mike |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=24 June 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general principle is, in [[Peter Drucker]]'s phrase, "what gets measured gets managed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ede977b0-b896-11e1-82c8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz22rFwi7UQ |title=Calls for corporate disclosure of social impact |author=Crooks, Ed |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=17 June 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SASB appointed in 2014 former NYC Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] as Chair and former SEC Chair [[Mary Schapiro]] as Vice Chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wenzel|first1=Else|title=Finance powerhouses Michael Bloomberg and Mary Schapiro to lead SASB|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/05/01/sasb-taps-star-power-mike-bloomberg-and-former-sec-chair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry specific==
The SASB aims to meet the need for [[Industry classification|industry-specific]] reporting standards, to ease comparison and [[benchmarking]].&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JACF"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/JACF-Sector-Materiality.pdf |title=The Need for Sector-Specific Materiality and Sustainability Reporting Standards |author=Eccles, Robert G.

==SASB IAG Members==
Investors increasingly acknowledge that environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can impact a company’s ability to manage risk and deliver financial performance over the long-term. As such, many investors use ESG information to develop a comprehensive view of company performance and to help evaluate a company’s long-term value. Investors can play an important role in enhancing disclosure effectiveness by expecting companies to disclose performance on material ESG factors and by participating in the development of disclosure standards. Accordingly, SASB has created an Investor Advisory Group (IAG). The IAG comprises leading asset owners and asset managers who are committed to improving the quality and comparability of sustainability-related disclosure to investors, and represent a combined total of more than $21 trillion USD assets under management (AUM).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The following entities have agreed to become founding members of SASB's IAG as of March 2018:&lt;br&gt;

{{Accounting}}
'''U.S. tax accounting''' refers to [[accounting]] for [[tax]] purposes in the [[United States]]. Unlike most countries, the United States has a comprehensive set of accounting principles for tax purposes, prescribed by tax law, which are separate and distinct from [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]]. 

== Basic rules ==

The [[Internal Revenue Code]] governs the application of tax accounting.  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=446&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000446----000-.html Section 446] sets the basic rules for tax accounting. Tax accounting under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=446&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000446----000-.html section 446(a)] emphasizes consistency for a tax accounting method with references to the applied financial accounting to determine the proper method. The taxpayer must choose a tax accounting method using the taxpayer's financial accounting method as a reference point.

==Types of tax accounting methods==
{{Main|Comparison of Cash Method and Accrual Method of accounting}}
Proper accounting methods are described in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=446&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000446----000-.html section 446(c)(1) to (4)] which permits [[Accounting methods#Cash basis|cash]], [[Accounting methods#Accrual basis|accrual]], and other methods approved by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) including combinations.

After choosing a tax accounting method, under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=446&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000446----000-.html section 446(b)] the IRS has wide discretion to re-compute the taxable income of the taxpayer by changing the accounting method to be used by the taxpayer in order to clearly reflect the taxpayer's income.

If the taxpayer engages in more than one business, the taxpayer may use a different method for each business according to [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=446&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000446----000-.html section 446(d)].

==Tax accounting method changes==
If the taxpayer wants to change an tax accounting method, section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code requires the taxpayer to obtain the consent of the Internal Revenue Service. There are two kinds of changes: obtaining a letter of approval from the IRS, and obtaining a series of more routine changes, each of which is an automatic change. To get the automatic change, the taxpayer must fill out a form and return it to the IRS.

The taxpayer can adopt another method if the taxpayer files a tax return using that method for two consecutive years. This is different from changing a tax accounting method under the release of the IRS because, in the case of adopting another method, the IRS may assess fines and reallocate taxable income. If the taxpayer wants to return to the previous method, the taxpayer must ask for permission from the IRS, following the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=446&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000446----000-.html 446(e)] procedure. 

If the taxpayer fails to request a change of method of accounting then, according to [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=446&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000446----000-.html section 446(f)], the taxpayer does so at his or her own peril by exposure to penalties.

== Comparison with other countries ==
In many other countries, the profit for tax purposes is the accounting [[profit (accounting)|profit]] defined by GAAP (coined the term "book profit" by the 18th century scholar Sean Freidel{{fact|date=December 2010}}), with such additional adjustments to book profit as are prescribed by tax law. In other words, GAAP determines the taxable profits, except where a tax rule determines otherwise. Such adjustments typically include [[depreciation]] and expenses which for policy reasons are not deductible for tax purposes, such as entertaining costs and fines.

But the U.S. is not the only jurisdiction in which there is a wide divergence between tax and financial accounting. Hugh Ault and Brian Arnold, in their book "Comparative Income Taxation," have observed that in The Netherlands, where financial accounting is known as "commercial accounting," there is a substantial divergence between those and the tax books.  

"[D]ifferences between tax and commercial accounting rules arise where the tax instrument is employed to pursue economic, social and cultural purposes," write Ault and Arnold.

'''''The Atlas of Economic Complexity''''' is a 2011 economics book by [[Ricardo Hausmann]], [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]], Sebastián Bustos, Michele Coscia, Sarah Chung, Juan Jimenez, Alexander Simoes and Muhammed A. Yıldırım. A revised 2014 edition is published by the [[MIT Press]].&lt;ref name="Hausmann 2013 p.

The book attempts to measure the amount of productive knowledge that each country holds, by visualizing the differences between national economies. The book's originality is to go beyond standard statistics by making use of “complexity statistics” of 128 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/3fc2975c-4703-11e1-bc5f-00144feabdc0.html|title='The tricky business of measuring growth'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book concludes with hints "at how difficult and complex it may be for government planners to kick-start a new industry — while showing that there are new industries that will struggle to get started without help.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/15/magazine/art-of-economic-complexity.html?_r=0|title='The art of economic complexity'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is accompanied by an [http://atlas.media.mit.edu/ online website] which hosts interactive visualizations featured in the book.

The Atlas was a collaboration between the [[Center for International Development at Harvard University]] and the Macro Connections group at the [[MIT Media Lab]].

==Online Visualizations==

The visualizations presented in the Atlas where created in [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]] (OEC), a data visualizations engine created by Alex Simoes and [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] in the Macro Connections group at the MIT Media Lab. The Observatory of Economic Complexity was launched in 2011. In 2013, Harvard's Center for International Development released a version of the OEC entitled the [http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/ Atlas online]. The Harvard version also builds on the original code base developed by Alex Simoes at the MIT Media Lab.

The data are from the following data sources, cleaned and made compatible:

* 1962–2000: The Center for International Data from Robert Feenstra
* 2001–2011: UN COMTRADE

'''The Power of Unreasonable People: How Social Entrepreneurs Create Markets That Change the World''' is a 2008 non-fiction book written by [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] and [[Pamela Hartigan]] and published by [[Harvard Business School Publishing]]. The title of the book is based on a quote from Irish playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]]: "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man." The book focuses on two groups of "unreasonable people": [[Social entrepreneurship|social entrepreneurs]] and environmental entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Unreasonable People|last=Elkington|first=John|last2=Hartigan|first2=Pamela|publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing|year=2008|isbn=|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

== Sections ==
The book is divided into three sections:&lt;ref name=power/&gt;{{rp|toc}}

=== Building Innovative Enterprises ===
The first section of the book discusses in depth the process of creating successful business models and tapping financial resources.&lt;ref name=power/&gt; Examples discussed include [[Barefoot College]], [[Aravind Eye Hospital]], and [[Whole Foods Market]]. The authors also briefly cover different methods of obtaining finances.&lt;ref name=power/&gt;{{rp|29-82}}

=== Creating the Markets of the Future ===
The second section of the book discusses some of the steps necessary to create successful markets. It discusses the identification of market opportunities and raising expectations. Poverty is also discussed, specifically why many of the new social businesses and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] are focusing on the [[bottom of the pyramid]] markets.&lt;ref name=power/&gt;{{rp|85-133}}

=== Creating Sustainable and Scalable Change ===
The third section of the book focuses on leadership and sustainable and scalable change. The chapter topics include democratizing technology, changing the system, and scaling solutions.&lt;ref name=power/&gt;{{rp|137-195}}

== Reception ==
In a ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]'' article, Rick Aubry writes, "Pamela Hartigan and John Elkington have written an essential book for anyone interested in understanding the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship. Their comprehensive and thoughtful book offers a great single source for understanding the amazing variety of social entrepreneurs throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aubrey|first1=Rick|title=Review: The Power of Unreasonable People|url=http://ssir.org/book_reviews/entry/the_power_of_unreasonable_people|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=Stanford Social Innovation Review|issue=Spring 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14896">'''Turnaround management''' is a process dedicated to corporate renewal. It uses analysis and planning to save troubled companies and returns them to solvency, and to identify the reasons for failing performance  in the market, and rectify them. Turnaround management involves management review, root failure causes analysis, and [[SWOT analysis]] to determine why the company is failing. Once gdg
analysis is completed, a long term strategic plan and restructuring plan are created. These plans may or may not involve a bankruptcy filing. Once approved, turnaround professionals begin to implement the plan, continually reviewing its progress and make changes to the plan as needed to ensure the company returns to solvency.

==Turnaround Managers==
Turnaround Managers are also called Turnaround Practitioners , and often are interim managers who only stay as long as it takes to achieve the turnaround. Assignments can take anything from 3 to 24 months depending on the size of the organization and the complexity of the job. Turnaround management does not only apply to distressed companies, it in fact can help in any situation where direction, strategy or a general change of the ways of working needs to be implemented. Therefore turnaround management is closely related to change management,  transformation management and post-merger-integration management. High growth situation for example are one typical scenario where turnaround experts also help. More and more turnaround managers are becoming a one-stop-shop and provide help with corporate funding (working closely with banks and the Private Equity community) and with professional services firms (such as lawyers and insolvency practitioners) to have access to a full range of services that are typically needed in a turnaround process. Most turnaround managers are freelancers and work on day rates. The job often involves frequent travel. Others work for large corporations and have permanent positions.

==Stages==
Stages in repositioning of an organization:
# The evaluation and assessment stage
# The acute needs stage
# The restructuring stage
# The stabilization stage
# The revitalization stage

The first stage is delineated as '''onset of decline (1)'''. Factors that cause this circumstance are new innovations by competitors or a downturn in demand, which leads to a loss of market share and revenue. But also stable companies may find themselves in this stage, because of maladministration or the production of goods that are not interesting for customers. In public organisations are external shocks, like political or economical, reasons that could cause a destabilization of a performance. 
 
Sometimes an onset of decline can be temporary and through a '''corrective action and recovery (2)''' been fixed. 

The '''reposition situation (3)''' is the point in the process, where the minimally accepted performance is long-lasting below its limits. In empirical studies a performance of turnaround is measured through financial success indicators. These measures ignore other performance indicators such as impact on environment, welfare of staff, and corporate social responsibility. The organizational leaders need to decide, if a strategy change should happen or the current strategy be kept, which could lead on the other hand to a company takeover or an insolvency. In the public sector performances are characterized by multiple aims that are political contested and constructed. Nevertheless, are different criteria of performances used by different stakeholders and even if its use results in the same criteria, it is likely that different weights apply to them. So if a public organization is situated in a turnaround situation, it is subject to the dimensions of a performance (e.g. equity, efficiency, effectiveness) as well as its approach of their relative importance. This political point of view suggests that a miscarriage in a public service may happen when key stakeholders are ongoing dissatisfied by a performance and therefore the existence of an organisation might be unclear. In the public sector success and failure is judged by the higher bodies that bestow financial, legal, or other different resources on service providers.
   
If decision maker choose to take a new course, because of the realization that actions are required to prevent an ongoing decline, they need at first to '''search for new strategies (4)'''. Question that need to be asked here are, if the search for a reposition strategy should be participative and decentralized or secretive and centralized or intuitive and incremental or analytic and rational. Here, the selection must be made quickly, since a second turnaround may not be possible after a new or existing poor performance. This means, that a compressed strategy process is necessary and therefore an extensive participation and analysis may be precluded. The same applies to the public sector, because the public authorities are highly visible and politically under pressure to rapidly implement a recovery plan. 

Is the fifth stage reached, the '''selection of a new strategy (5a)''' has been made by the company. Especially researcher typically concentrates on this one of the reposition process. Most of them focus on the structure and its impact on the performance of the strategy that was implemented. It is even stated by the scientist, that a commercial success is again possible after a failing of the company. But different risk-averse groups, like suppliers, customers or staff may be against a change or are sceptical about the implementation of the strategy. These circumstances could result in a blockade of the realization. Also the conclusion is conceivable, that '''no escape strategy is found (5b)''', as a result that some targets can’t be achieved. In the public sector it is difficult to find a recoverable strategy, which therefore could lead to a permanent failure. The case may also be, that though a recovery plan is technically feasible, it might not be political executable. 

The '''implication of the new strategy (6)''' ensues in the following sixth stage. It is a necessary determinant of organizational success and has to be a fundamental element of a valid turnaround model. Nevertheless, it is important to note, that no empirical study sets a certain turnaround strategy. 

The outcomes of the turnaround strategies can result in three different ways. First of all a '''terminal decline (7a)''' may occur. This is possible for situations, where a bad strategy was chosen or a good strategy might have been implemented poorly. Another conceivable outcome is a '''continued failure (7b)'''. Here is the restructuring plan failed, but dominant members within the company and the environment still believe that a repositioning is possible. If that’s the case, they need to restart at stage four and look for a new strategy. Does an outcome of the new strategy turns out to be good, a '''turnaround (7c)''' is called successful. This is achieved, when its appropriate benchmark reaches the level of commercial success, like it was the case before the onset of decline. This is commonly measured in a timeframe between two and four year.

==Techniques==

There are different techniques that can be applied to cause a repositioning. The four main techniques are known as Retrenchment, Repositioning, Replacement and Renewal:

===Retrenchment===

The Retrenchment strategy of the turnaround management describes wide-ranging short-term actions, to reduce financial losses, to stabilize the company and to work against the problems, that caused the poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, K./ Harvey, G./ Hyde, P./ Pandit, N. (2004): Organizational Failure and Turnaround: Lessons for Public Services from the For-Profit Sector, in Public Money &amp; Management, Vol. 24, No. 4 (August, 2004), pp. 201–208. (p. 204)&lt;/ref&gt;
The essential content of the Retrenchment strategy is therefore to reduce scope and the size of a business through Shrinking Selective Strategy. This can be done by selling assets, abandoning difficult markets, stopping unprofitable production lines, downsizing and outsourcing. These procedures are used to generate resources, with the intention to utilize those for more productive activities, and prevent financial losses. Retrenchment is therefore all about an efficient orientation and a refocus on the core business.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, G. A./ Meier, K. (2009): Environmental Change, Human Resources and Organizational Turnaround, in: Journal of Management Studies, Vol. 46, No. 5 (July, 2009), pp. 835–863. (p. 843)&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite that many companies are inhibited to perform cutbacks, some of them manage to overcome the resistance. As a result they are able get a better market position in spite of the reductions they made&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, D. K./ Pearce II, J. A. (1992): Retrenchment und Recovery, in: Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 13, No. 4 (May, 1992), pp. 287–309. (p.290)&lt;/ref&gt; and increase productivity and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Barker III, V. L./ Duhaime, I. M. (1997): Change in the Turnaround Process: Theory and Empirical Evidence, in: Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), pp. 13–38. (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;  Most practitioners even mention, that a successful turnaround without a planned retrenchment is rarely feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, G. A. (2006): Strategies for Public Service Turnaround: Lessons from the Private Sector?, in: Administration &amp; Society, Vol. 38, No. 3 (July 2006), pp. 365–388. (p. 378)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repositioning===

The repositioning strategy, also known as "entrepreneurial strategy", attempts to generate revenue with new innovations and change in product portfolio and [[Positioning (marketing)|market position]]. This includes development of new products, entering new markets, exploring alternative sources of revenue and modifying the image or the mission of a company.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, G. A./ Meier, K. (2009): Environmental Change, Human Resources and Organizational Turnaround, in: Journal of Management Studies, Vol. 46, No. 5 (July, 2009), pp. 835–863. (p. 844)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement===

Replacement is a strategy, where top managers or the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are replaced by new ones. This turnaround strategy is used, because it is theorized that new managers bring recovery and a strategic change, as a result of their different experience and backgrounds from their previous work.&lt;ref&gt;Barker III, V. L./ Duhaime, I. M. (1997): Change in the Turnaround Process: Theory and Empirical Evidence, in: Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), pp. 13–38. (p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt;  
It is also indispensable to be aware, that new CEO’s can cause problems, which are obstructive to achieve a turnaround. For an example, if they change effective organized routines or introduce new administrative overheads and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, G. A./ Meier, K. (2009): Environmental Change, Human Resources and Organizational Turnaround, in: Journal of Management Studies, Vol. 46, No. 5 (July, 2009), pp. 835–863. (p. 842)&lt;/ref&gt;
Replacement is especially qualified for situations with opinionated CEO’s, which are not able to think impartial about certain problems. Instead they rely on their past experience for running the business or belittle the situation as short-termed. The established leaders fail therefore to recognize that a change in the business strategy is necessary to keep the company viable. There are also situations, where CEO’s do notice that a current strategy isn’t successful as it should be. But this hasn’t to imply, that they are capable or even qualified enough to accomplish a turnaround.&lt;ref&gt;Castrogiovanni, G. J./ Baliga, B. R./ Kidwell Jr., R. E. (1992): Curing Sick Businesses: Changing CEOs in Turnaround Efforts, in: The Executive, Vol. 6, No. 3 (Aug. 1992), pp. 26–41. (pp. 28)&lt;/ref&gt;
Is a company against a Replacement of a leader, could this end in a situation, where the declining process will be continued. As result qualified employees resign, the organisation discredits and the resources left will run out as time goes by.&lt;ref&gt;Barker III, V. L./ Duhaime, I. M. (1997): Change in the Turnaround Process: Theory and Empirical Evidence, in: Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), pp. 13–38. (p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewal===

With a Renewal a company pursues long-term actions, which are supposed to end in a successful managerial performance. The first step here is to analyze the existing structures within the organization. This examination may end with a closure of some divisions, a development of new markets/ projects or an expansion in other business areas.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, K./ Harvey, G./ Hyde, P./ Pandit, N. (2004): Organizational Failure and Turnaround: Lessons for Public Services from the For-Profit Sector, in Public Money &amp; Management, Vol. 24, No. 4 (August, 2004), pp. 201–208. (p. 204)&lt;/ref&gt; A Renewal may also lead to consequences within a company, like the removal of efficient routines or resources. On the other hand are innovative core competencies implemented, which conclude in an increase of knowledge and a stabilization of the company value.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz-Navarro, J. (1998): Turnaround and Renewal in a Spanish Shipyard, in: Long Range Planning, Vol. 31, No. 1 (1998), pp. 51–59. (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurdles or challenges==
Three critical hurdles or challenges that management faces in any repositioning program:
# '''Design''': What type of restructuring is appropriate for dealing with the specific challenge, problem, or opportunity that the company faces?
# '''Execution''': How should the restructuring process be managed and the many barriers to restructuring overcome so that as much value is created as possible?&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, A &amp; Raisch, S. (2013): “Corporate turnarounds: The duality of retrenchment and recovery”, Journal of Management Studies, Vol. 50, Issue 7, pp. 1216-1243&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Marketing''': How should the restructuring be explained and portrayed to investors so that value created inside the company is fully credited to its stock price?

==Professional organizations==
There are a number of professional industry associations that provide advice, literature and contacts to turn around professionals and academics.
Some are:

* [[Turnaround Management Society]] (International / Focus on Europe)
* [[Institute for Turnaround]] (England)
* [[Turnaround Management Association]] (International)
* [[Institut für die Standardisierung von Unternehmenssanierungen]] (Germany)
* [[Asia Turnaround and Transformation Association ATTA]] (Asia - China focus)

The UTZ Certified label is featured on more than 10,000 different product packages in over 116 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://utzcertified.org/en/newsroom/utz-in-the-news/26584617-2013-bringing-good-practice-to-scale | title = 2013: bringing good practice to scale | publisher = UTZ Certified | date = 18 April 2014 | location = Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, UTZ Certified is the largest program for sustainable farming of coffee and cocoa in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2014/ssi_2014.pdf | title = The State of Sustainability Initiatives [SSI] Review, 2014: Standards and the Green Economy | first = Jason | last = Potts | first2 = Matthew | last2 = Lynch | first3 = Ann | last3 = Wilkings | first4 = Gabriel | last4 = Huppé | first5 = Maxine | last5 = Cunningham | first6 = Vivek | last6 = Voora | year = 2014 | publisher = [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] | location = Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada | isbn = 978-1-894784-45-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UTZ Certified program covers good [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices, farm management and the environment.

==History==
UTZ was launched in 2002 as Utz Kapeh, meaning ‘Good Coffee’ in the [[List of Mayan languages|Mayan]] language [[K'iche' language|Quiché]]. It was founded by Nick Bocklandt, a Belgian-Guatemalan coffee grower, and Ward de Groote, a Dutch coffee roaster, with the goal of implementing sustainability on a large scale in the worldwide market. Solidaridad (www.solidaridadnetwork.org) was another co-initiator of UTZ Certified and assisted UTZ in becoming a global standard through financial support and field implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://utzcertified.org/en/aboututzcertified/the-story-of-utz | title = The Story of UTZ | publisher = UTZ Certified | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2007, the Utz Kapeh Foundation officially changed its name and logo to UTZ Certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://www.utzcertified.org/en/component/content/archive?year=2007&amp;month=3 | title = Utz Kapeh proudly presents its new face: UTZ Certified 'Good inside'  | date = 7 March 2007 | publisher = UTZ Certified}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
;Coffee
UTZ Certified is the largest sustainability program in the world for [[coffee]]. In 2012, 9% of the coffee produced in the world was UTZ certified (716,000 MT(Metric Ton = 1000&amp;nbsp;kg), out of global production of 8,200,000 MT&lt;ref&gt;''SSI Review'', p 176.&lt;/ref&gt;).

;Cocoa
On 10 October 2007, the Cocoa Program was launched. UTZ Certified cooperated with [[Ahold]], [[Cargill]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] [[Benelux]], [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]], [[Nestlé]] and [[ECOM]] to set up a new certification and traceability system for sustainable cocoa. [[Solidaridad]] and [[Oxfam Novib]] also supported the initiative from the beginning. 
In 2009 the first UTZ Certified cocoa products reached the market. 
As of 2014,  UTZ Certified is the largest sustainability program for cocoa in the world. By now, over 336,300 cocoa farmers from 16 countries are UTZ Certified. In 2012, 13% of the cocoa produced in the world was UTZ Certified (535,000 MT, out of global production of 2,889,000MT&lt;ref&gt;''SSI Review'', p 146.&lt;/ref&gt;).

;Tea
The UTZ Certified program for [[tea]] and [[rooibos]] was launched in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://utzcertified.org/en/products/tea | title = Tea | publisher = UTZ Certified | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hazelnuts
UTZ Certified is currently running a pilot project in Turkey to explore the possibilities for sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://utzcertified.org/en/newsroom/utz-in-the-news/26584616-utz-certified-launches-sustainable-hazelnuts-farming-initiative-in-turkey | title = UTZ Certified launches sustainable hazelnuts farming initiative in Turkey | location = Amsterdam | date = 16 April 2014 | publisher = UTZ Certified}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code of Conduct==

===Summary of the Code of Conduct===
The UTZ certification program is based on the UTZ Certified Code of Conduct:&lt;ref name="code of conduct 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://utzcertified-trainingcenter.com/home/index.php/en/code-of-conduct | title = A NEW CODE OF CONDUCT. THAT’S BETTER | publisher = UTZ Certified | year = 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140911100729/https://utzcertified-trainingcenter.com/home/index.php/en/code-of-conduct | archivedate = 2014-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of social and environmental criteria for responsible growing practices and efficient farm management. Coffee, cocoa and tea producers who are UTZ certified comply with this code. The Code of Conduct version 2014&lt;ref name="code of conduct 2014"/&gt; is based on the international [[List of International Labour Organization Conventions|ILO Conventions]] and the expertise of many different stakeholders, including the farmers who use it. The Code has been developed in a broad [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] process and therefore widely accepted.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}
A core code is applicable to all farmers, and there are also additional requirements in product specific modules for coffee, cocoa and tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://utzcertified.org/en/newsroom/utz-in-the-news/26584628-utzs-new-code-of-conduct-is-more-robust-and-flexible | title =  UTZ’s new code of conduct is more robust and flexible, Simpler structure will enable more farmers to join the program | location = Amsterdam | date = 15 May 2014 | publisher = UTZ Certified}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The certification system is based on a model of [[Continual improvement process|continuous improvement]]. Producers have to comply with core safety and quality standards from year one. Additional control points are added in the following years.

===Common Categories in the Code of Conduct===
The criteria of the UTZ Certified Code of Conduct fall into four categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://utzcertified.org/attachments/article/2172/CoC-Summary.pdf | title = The UTZ Certified Code of Conduct: Summary | language = | accessdate = 14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chain of Custody===
To enhance the guarantee that a consumer product with an UTZ Certified logo does indeed credibly link to an UTZ certified producer, the UTZ Certified program contains Chain of Custody requirements. This is a set of chain-wide administrative, logistical and technical requirements for traceability. These requirements include criteria for separation of UTZ Certified products and conventional/non-UTZ Certified products, and keeping records of direct suppliers and buyers.

===Traceability===
UTZ certified coffee, cocoa and tea is traceable through the supply chain, as UTZ uses a web-based traceability system.

When an UTZ certified producer sells their products (e.g. coffee, cocoa, tea) to a registered UTZ Certified buyer, the product is announced in the UTZ Certified web-based system. By doing so the seller announces when they are shipping what amount to whom. The buyer then gets notified and needs to confirm this in the traceability system. UTZ Certified assigns a unique tracking number to this lot. At the end of the supply chain, the end product manufacturer uses the unique tracking number to know their product credibly links to a certified source. Some brands use this unique tracking system to make the product traceable for their consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://utzcertified.org/en/aboututzcertified/traceandtraceability | title = Trade &amp; Traceability | publisher = UTZ Certified | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traceability Services====
Traceability services
UTZ Certified has developed, implemented and is currently managing the traceability system for the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]]. This system was launched in December 2008.

===Certification===
Independent, third party auditors make annual inspections to ensure coffee producers comply with the Code of Conduct.&lt;ref name="code of conduct 2014"/&gt;

;Certification Body
A [[Certification body]] (CB) is an independent, third-party certifier. When approved by UTZ Certified, these organizations conduct annual certification inspections of coffee, cocoa and tea producers to determine whether they comply with the UTZ Certified Code of Conduct&lt;ref name="code of conduct 2014"/&gt; and Chain of Custody requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.utzcertified.org/index.php?pageID=159 | title = Trade and Traceability: Traceability of UTZ CERTIFIED coffee from grower to roaster makes the UTZ CERTIFIED program unique | publisher = UTZ Certified | year = 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080213224946/http://www.utzcertified.org/index.php?pageID=159 | archivedate = 13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Trained Agronomists
An UTZ Certified trained [[agronomist]] is a technical consultant specifically trained in assisting producers to comply with the UTZ Certified Code of Conduct.&lt;ref name="code of conduct 2014"/&gt; Trained agronomists can advise on practical implementation of elements of the Code and give directions on improvement of efficiency in farm management.

==Impact==
In 2014, UTZ Certified published its first impact report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://utzcertified.org/en/newsroom/utz-in-the-news/26582896-utz-presents-impact-report-2014 | title =  UTZ presents Impact Report 2014 | location = Amsterdam | date = 21 January 2014 | publisher = UTZ Certified}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought together 24 external studies and data collected by UTZ Certified. It demonstrated that UTZ Certified cocoa, coffee and tea farms generate higher yields and better quality crops than conventional farms, and being trained in the UTZ Code of Conduct helps farmers to improve their knowledge and adopt sustainable farming practices.

==Pricing==
Coffee, cocoa and tea with an UTZ certification has added value in the sense that it assures buyers that it has been produced according to an internationally recognized standard for responsible production, i.e. according to the UTZ Certified Code of Conduct.
The price for UTZ certified coffee is determined in the negotiation process between buyer and seller. UTZ Certified does not interfere in price negotiations. In contrast to [[Fair Trade]], no minimum purchase price is set. Instead, the focus on good agricultural practices in the UTZ program is intended to enable farmers to increase the quantity and quality of their yield, and thus to increase their income.

==Criticism==
UTZ Certified certification, like the [[Rainforest Alliance]] coffee certification program, has been criticized because it offers producers no minimum or guaranteed price for their crop. Some consider UTZ certified producer organizations to be vulnerable to the volatility of the coffee market.&lt;ref name="The Observer 2006"&gt;{{cite news | work = The Observer | date = 29 January 2006 | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/story/0,,1694445,00.html | title = Is Global Business Hijacking the Fairtrade bandwagon? | first = Andrew | last = Purvis | accessdate = 27 October 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905011505/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/story/0,,1694445,00.html | archivedate = 5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The price difference and the fact companies do not pay any marketing costs for logo use, makes the UTZ Certified label considerably cheaper than [[Fairtrade]] for companies and farmers interested in tapping the ethical market.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Michael Conroy, an independent consultant on certification for sustainable development, criticized UTZ Certified in his 2007 book ''Branded!'': "the environmental standards of UTZ Certified are far weaker than those of either Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Branded!: How the 'Certification Revolution' is Transforming Global Corporations | first = Michael E. | last = Conroy | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-86571-579-0 | publisher = New Society Publisher | location = Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; UTZ Certified's standards for example, explicitly announces that [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] coffee plants, though not at present available, would be allowable so long as farmers obey local regulations on their use. Any kind of chemical fertilizer may be used as long as an external, technically qualified advisor has determined the quantity of fertilizer to be used. No chemical [[pesticide]]s or fungicides banned in the [[European Union]], the U.S. or [[Japan]] may be used, but any that are acceptable in those three markets are acceptable on coffee farms if they are applied "according to the label".&lt;ref name="Conroy, Michael 2007 p252"&gt;Conroy, ''Branded!'', p 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, German magazine "Ökotest" published an article labeling UTZ Certified, among others, as unfair, due to a lack of pre-financing and guaranteed minimum purchase prices.&lt;ref name="Ökotest 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | work = Ökotest | date = 27 July 2012 | url = http://www.oekotest.de/cgi/index.cgi?artnr=100951;bernr=01;seite=01;co= | title = Fairer Handel - Unfaire Geschäfte |trans-title= Fair trade - Unfair Businesses | accessdate = 4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response UTZ Certified stated that the foundation does not consider its standards fair trade, nor that it claims that they are, while maintaining that its standards contribute positively to sustainable development of tropical farming communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = https://www.utzcertified.org/en/newsroom/utz-in-the-news/26582670-2012-08-07-15-30-40 | title = Joint response to Ökotest article | author = 4C Association | author2 = Rainforest Alliance/SAN | author3 = UTZ Certified | publisher = UTZ Certified | date = 2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7796">[[File:William Duffus Hunt May 1931.jpg|thumb|Sir William Hunt 1931]]
Sir '''William Duffus Hunt''' [[Knight Bachelor|Kt]] (2 December 1867&amp;ndash;18 September 1939) was a leading New Zealand businessman of the first half of the twentieth century. With his partner [[James Armour Johnstone]] he built one of Australasia's leading stock and station agencies, [[Wright Stephenson|Wright Stephenson &amp; Co]].

==Family==
New Zealand-born of [[Gloucestershire]] wool-growing stock Hunt was the only son and eldest child of John Hunt, a farmer and early settler at [[Peria, Northland|Oruru]], [[Northland Region|Northland]], and his wife Maria Frances,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Maria Frances Duffus was a descendent of Josiah Paul Tippetts of [[Tetbury]] Gloucestershire. Josiah Paul Tippetts changed his surname to Paul (his mother's maiden name) becoming Josiah Paul Paul after inheriting [[Highgrove House|Highgrove]] from his Uncle John Paul.  Maria Frances's line of descent was Josiah Paul Paul (Tippetts) - son Robert Clark Paul (Tippetts) - daughter Maria Harriet Paul married John Duffus from Jamaica on 26 April 1830 in Tetbury&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Jamaica]]-born [[Etonian]] Rev John Duffus M A, vicar of St Andrew, [[Mangonui]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecommunityarchive.org.nz/node/68012/description The Community Archive] accessed 20 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born on 2 December 1867 in Oruru, Northland, [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"&gt;{{DNZB|title=William Duffus Hunt|first= William F.|last= Hunt|id=3h44|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W D Hunt married twice. At Gore on 20 December 1894 he married Ismene Helena Stanley. Ismene had a daughter and a son before she died in May 1900. Two years later, 15 May 1902, Hunt married Jessie Belstead Edwards in Adelaide South Australia. There was just one child of the second marriage, a second son.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

==Career==
;Recruit
William Hunt joined stock and station agency [[Wright Stephenson]] proper in 1891. His ability was recognised by Johnstone much earlier when he was employed by them for just two months at shearing time on Wright Stephenson-managed Blackstone Hill station in the [[Central Otago|Maniatoto]]. Though only 17 he was kept on at the station as a permanent shepherd  and soon took over the bookkeeping of the station and then its management. When Blackstone Hill station was subdivided in 1891 23 year old Hunt organised the muster and auction of the tens of thousands of sheep on the property. He was also required to act as auctioneer in the absence of George Stephenson of Wright Stephenson. J A Johnstone who had personally clerked the sale was so impressed he offered Hunt a position on the staff of Wright Stephenson &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=ACC&gt;''A Century's Challenge'', J C Irving and L A T Bell, Hutcheson Bowman, Wellington, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
;Gore
The same year the partners in Wright Stephenson decided it was time to open their first branch. They chose [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]] on the banks of the [[Mataura]] river and sent William Hunt to organise it though within three years times had become so hard it was deemed prudent to close Gore and confine operations to [[Otago]]. In spite of their difficulties Hunt's well chosen Gore customers all settled their accounts in full. In 1896 the government resumed borrowing overseas making advances to settlers on freeholds and long term leaseholds at moderate interest rates and the farming outlook improved. Gore was re-opened and another branch opened at Invercargill, Hunt being made responsible for all [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland province]]. Johnstone remained in Otago.&lt;ref name=ACC/&gt;
;Control of Wright Stephenson
When the founding partners withdrew from the firm with the turn of the century Johnstone and Hunt acquired the major holdings of the shares in the firm. As the rabbit pest was brought under control their customers began to prosper once more and Wright Stephenson was incorporated as a public company in 1906. The initial directors were J A Johnstone (chairman) Hunt and P L Wright, Johnstone and Hunt were joint managing directors. In early 1907 Johnstone's health failed and he took 12 months leave to recuperate. Over that time W D Hunt acted as Chairman as well as sole managing director and when Johnstone returned to work he resumed the joint managing directorship but he acknowledged William Hunt's achievements and Hunt stayed Chairman of Directors.&lt;ref name=ACC/&gt; Hunt managed to visit every one of his firm's branches each year.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

;Wellington
Wright Stephenson's activities spread across New Zealand and into all farming areas. Rapidly becoming a major national business they merged with Wellington's [[Alexander Turnbull (bibliophile)|W &amp; G Turnbull and Co]] and [[James Gunson|W Gunson and Co]] in Auckland.  It became clear a central location was necessary and in 1917 the Head office left Dunedin for Wellington. In 1920 the Abraham and Williams business covering [[Manawatu District|Manawatu]]-[[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]] and adjacent districts came under their expanding umbrella. The sale of new motor vehicles and their servicing was added as were the provision of all farm requirements including bulk groceries and home appliances. It seemed that everything might be supplied until staunch lifetime [[Prohibition#New Zealand|prohibitionist]] Hunt felt obliged to draw the line at the last commodity they might sell. Wright Stephenson stocked no alcohol of any kind.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

After the end of World War I a new [[Stud (animal)|stud]] department for all pedigree livestock soon extended to importing and exporting. An annual sale of [[thoroughbred]] yearlings was established in 1927 which brought buyers from all over the world.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

==Activities away from Wright Stephenson==
;Meat Board 1922 and Dairy Board 1923
W D Hunt was the Stock and Station Agency industry representative on both the [[New Zealand Meat Producers Board]] and the [[New Zealand Wool Board]]. The business of each board was central to his core business marketing farm produce.
;Directorships included
* [[AMP Society]] New Zealand branch, there was always a close association between the firms
* [[New Zealand Insurance]]
;Commissions and other boards
* 1912 Public Service Commission
* 1917 National Efficiency Board
* 1924 Royal Commission on taxation
* 1930 chairman Committee on Unemployment
and in 1932 he was awarded a knighthood for public services&lt;ref&gt;King's Birthday Honours. ''The Times'', Friday, Jun 03, 1932; pg. 19; Issue 46150&lt;/ref&gt;
;Private life
Until he moved his family to [[Wellington]] in 1917 he lived in [[Invercargill]] where he ran stud [[Holstein (cattle)|Friesians]] and stud [[Romney (sheep)|Romneys]]. On making the move he gave their Invercargill home to the [[Plunket Society]], he was chairman of Plunket's specialist manufacturing operation. He was a keen deer stalker and fly fisherman.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

==Death==
Before the outbreak of war in 1939 he travelled from London to Wellington by air and contracted [[meningitis]] during the flight. A few months later, 18 September 1939, he died in Wellington aged 71. Hunt was survived by his second wife and a son from each marriage.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hunt"/&gt;

His obituary in Wellington's Evening Post described him as devoid of ostentation and readily approachable.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary. ''Evening Post'', Volume CXXVIII, Issue 68, 18 September 1939, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;
