'''Adolphe Schloss''' (10 August 1842 – 31 December 1910) was a French art collector.

Schloss was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/dealer-blasts-french-art-plunder-case-article-1.849145 New York Daily News: "DEALER BLASTS FRENCH IN ART PLUNDER CASE" by Mike Claffey] September 26, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Furth, Lower Bavaria]]. He married Mathilde Lucie Haas and together they collected 333 works from the Northern and Southern Netherlands that became notable as a collection between World War I and World War II. They held a gallery at salon Adolphe Schloss residence 38, avenue Henri Martin, [[Paris]]. After Adolphe's death there, his collection became the property of his wife Lucie, who died in 1938 and the collection was left to their children Marguerite, Henry, Juliette and Lucien. They moved the collection to Chambon for safekeeping during the war, where it was looted by the Vichy government in 1943. Of the 333 objects, only 230 were actually offered to the Hitler museum and 49 were saved for France and given to the [[Louvre museum|Louvre]]. After the war all were lost, but gradually 148 objects could be rediscovered.

'''Arts Etobicoke''' was founded in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://365etobicoke.com/arts-etobicoke/|title=#87|publisher=365Etobicoke.com|accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada (formerly in the city of [[Etobicoke]]). They are an incorporated [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] [[arts council]] governed by a 
volunteer Board of Directors from business, the arts and the community. They serve thousands of students in their arts education programs, a membership of 50 arts organizations, 200 individual members, 60 individual artists and clients in an Art Rental program, hundreds of artists through their arts programming and exhibitions, 22 scholarship recipients, the general public and numerous project partners.

== About ==
Arts Etobicoke endeavors to engage the people of [[Etobicoke]] with the arts and artists in their own community.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.blogto.com/gallery/artsetobicoke|title=Arts Etobicoke Gallery|publisher=BlogTO.com|author=Sameer Vasta|date=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide programs and services to increase accessibility of the arts, involve diverse audiences, create broad awareness of artists through advocacy and develop partnerships to sustain local arts activities. To achieve this goal, they provide programs and services designed to increase the accessibility of the arts for residents of Etobicoke, reach and involve special and diverse audiences, create broad community awareness of local arts organizations and artists and develop partnerships and networks to foster and sustain local arts activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.clubrunner.ca/Data/7070/1133/HTML/134164//Jun012011.pdf|title=Weekly Update|publisher=Rotary Club of Etobicoke|date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating funding for Arts Etobicoke comes from the [[Toronto|City of Toronto]] and the [[Ontario Arts Council]]. This funding accounts for approximately 25% of their total income. The balance is raised through program revenues, memberships, foundations, corporate sponsorships, donations and fundraising events. Arts Etobicoke relies on a team of dedicated volunteers to promote events, help with fundraising, and assist with programs. Their current Executive Director is Menon Dwarka. 

=== Programs ===
==== Smart StART Student Art Show ====
The "Smart Start Student Art Show" at [[Sherway Gardens]] is a non-juried art show displaying works of students from Grades 9 to 12 from the Toronto District School Board and Toronto District Catholic School Board. The Smart Start Student Art Show gives them an opportunity to present their artwork in a public forum, particularly in a high-traffic venue such as Sherway Gardens, where thousands of people can view their works. The program was established in 1996.

==== Urban Noise ====
A joint venture with [[Expect Theatre]] creates a platform for children/youth to speak out against violence in their communities. Established in 2006, the project includes a free Youth Training Program and Festival that promotes leadership, unity and social change in the culturally diverse communities of Rexdale/Jamestown, located in North Etobicoke.  The workshops include DJing, break dancing, singing and song writing, etc.  These workshops encourage youth to identify and examine the issues that directly affect them in a supportive environment through various artistic mediums. It also solicits the attention of the general public to take notice of the neighbourhoods that are suffering from racial tension, poverty, gender inequality and lack of resources - all of which can become a potential source for violence.

==== Art Alley ====
Art Alley is a project that was designed to bring poetry to Islington Village.  A specially commissioned poem by [[Dionne Brand]] (City of Toronto's Poet Laureate) has been painted on the 1000-square-foot wall in the alley immediately east of their storefront office.

==== Art on The Move ====
is a three-year mobile community arts initiative in partnership with [[Lakeshore Arts]].  The project will transform 13 vehicles into moving canvasses of art.

=== Scholarships ===
The Presidents' Legacy Scholarship Fund, launched in 1999, was established as an endowment fund with the Ontario Arts Foundation to provide financial assistance to young people from West Toronto wishing to pursue their education in the arts.  Scholarships are awarded to students attending designated arts education institutions. As of 2011, approximately 75 young people received scholarships and awards from the program to such institutions as; OCAD; Royal Conservatory of Music; Kingsway Conservatory of Music; Humber College; Etobicoke School of the Arts; North Albion C.I.; Sean Boutillier Academy of Dance; and Richview C.I.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.clubrunner.ca/Data/7070/1133/HTML/134164//Jun012011.pdf|title=Weekly Update|publisher=Rotary Club of Etobicoke|date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Created in 1967, the Stockholm '''''Big Electric Chair''''' is part of a series of works by [[Andy Warhol]] depicting an [[electric chair]]. Death by electrocution was a controversial subject in [[New York City]], where the artist lived and worked, especially after the last two executions at [[Sing Sing]] Correctional Facility in 1963. Warhol obtained a photograph of the empty execution chamber, which became the basis for this series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/251&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin - Bismarck-Nationaldenkmal1.jpg|thumb|Frontal view of the Bismarck Memorial]]
The '''Bismarck Memorial''' ({{lang-de|Bismarck-Nationaldenkmal}}) in the [[Großer Tiergarten|Tiergarten]] in [[Berlin]], is a prominent memorial [[statue]] dedicated to Prince [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Minister President of Prussia|Minister President]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the first [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] of the [[German Empire]]. It was sculpted by [[Reinhold Begas]]. It is one of 250 [[Bismarck monument|memorials to Bismarck]] worldwide.

This memorial in Berlin portrays Bismarck in his ceremonial garb as Chancellor standing above statues of:
*[[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], showing Germany's world power status at the end of the 19th century;
*[[Sigurd|Siegfried]], forging a sword to show Germany's strong industrial and military might; 
*[[Germania (personification)|Germania]] pinning underfoot a panther, symbolizing the suppression of discord and rebellion; 
*a [[sibyl]] reclining on a [[sphinx]] and reading the book of history.

The statue, along with the famous [[Berlin victory column]], were once located in front of the [[Reichstag building]] before they were moved in 1938 by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his project to recast Berlin as [[Welthauptstadt Germania]]. The statue weathered a marked amount of shrapnel damage during [[World War II]], but has survived largely intact to the present day. In fact, the move probably saved the monument from total destruction, as the old garden in front of the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] was completely obliterated in the war.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13854">The '''California Resale Royalty Act''' ([http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html Civil  Code section 986]) entitles [[artist]]s to a [[royalty payment]] upon the [[resale]] of their works of art under certain circumstances.

== Conditions for resale royalty payments ==
* The artist at the time of the sale is a United States citizen or has been a California resident for at least two years.
* The seller resides in California or the sale takes place in California.
* The work is an original painting, drawing, sculpture or original work of art in glass.
* The work is sold by the seller for more money than she or he paid.
* The work is sold for a gross price of more than $1,000 or is exchanged for one or more works of art or for a combination of cash, other   property, and one or more works of fine art with a fair market value of more than $1,000.
* The work is sold during the artist's lifetime or within 20 years of the artist's death.&lt;ref name="CAC"&gt;[http://www.cac.ca.gov/artsinfo/resaleroyalty.php California Arts Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

Act does not apply if:
* The sale is the initial sale of the work and the legal title of the work at the time of such initial sale is vested in the artist.
* The resale of fine art is by an art dealer to a purchaser within 10 years after the initial sale by the artist to an art dealer, provided that all intervening sales are between art dealers.
* The sale consists of a work of stained glass artistry permanently attached to real property and it was sold as part of the sale of the real property to which it was attached.&lt;ref name="CAC"/&gt;

== Requirements under the Act for Qualifying Works ==
When the sale of a work meets the conditions outlined above, a seller must pay the artist 5% of the resale price. If the artist is deceased, the payment goes to the artist's estate or heirs. It is the seller's obligation to locate the artist within 90 days of the sale. If the artist or heirs cannot be located, the seller is to make payment to the [[California Arts Council]], who will hold the collected payments for up to 7 years for the artist. In the event that the Council is unable to locate a particular artist or the artist fails to claim the collected royalties in that time period, the funds collected are distributed to the city of Sacramento's Art in Public Places&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacmetroarts.org/art-in-public-places.html&lt;/ref&gt; program.&lt;ref name="code"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html|title=California Civil Code  Section 986 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's right to receive the royalty cannot be waived in full; it can only be modified by written contract providing for a royalty payment in excess of the 5% of resale value that is required by the Act.&lt;ref name="code"/&gt;

== History of the Resale Right ==
California's Resale Royalty Act was signed into law in 1976. The resale right has its origins in the French law [[droit de suite]], first enacted in 1920, which provided French artists the right to receive a royalty from resales of their work.&lt;ref name="lmu.edu"&gt;"The Droite de Suite: Why American Fine Artists Should Have a Right to a Resale Royalty." Loyola of Los Angeles Entertainment Law Review. March 1, 1995. Vol. 15, Page 10.http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&amp;context=elr&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''droite de suite'' reflects both the idea that artists have certain moral rights in their works (such as the inalienable right to be associated with their works) and the economic concern that artists often are unable to benefit from the full value of their works, where they have low bargaining power in initial sales or where their works appreciate significantly in value after the first sale.&lt;ref name="NYSBA"&gt;"A Right Deferred:Resale Royalties for Visual Artists." Law Student Connection, February 17, 2012.http://nysbar.com/blogs/lawstudentconnection/2012/02/a_right_deferred_resale_royalt.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, over 60 countries across the world recognize some version of the resale right.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov2012"&gt;"Resale Royalty Right." Copyright Office, Notice of Inquiry.Federal Register Vol. 77 No. 182, page 58177.[http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/77fr58175.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berne Convention ===
The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] of 1886 included a ''droite de suite'' provision in Article 14''ter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P188_36636|title=WIPO-Administered Treaties: Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its 1948 revision. This article provided for a general recognition of a resale right among signatory countries, but included the stipulation that protection provided by such recognition “may be claimed in a country of the Union only if legislation in the country to which the author belongs so permits, and to the extent permitted by the country where this protection is claimed.”&lt;ref name="wipo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P188_36636|title=WIPO-Administered Treaties: Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Currently, California is the only state that recognizes the resale right. The Copyright Office conducted a study,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/history/droit_de_suite.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992, evaluating the nature of the resale right and the possibility of adopting a federal ''droite de suite''. The Copyright Office concluded in the report that there were not adequate economic or copyright policy justifications to warrant adopting ''droite de suite'' at the federal level. The report did indicate that should the EU harmonize its ''droit de suite'' laws and extend the resale right to all member states, Congress may at that point revisit the resale right issue.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/history/droit_de_suite.pdf|title=Study, page 149.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, legislation was proposed in both the Senate (S.2000)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/2000&lt;/ref&gt; and the House (H.R.3688)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3688&lt;/ref&gt;  in December 2011 that would provide for a national resale royalty right. The Equity for Visual Artists Act of 2011 (EVAA) would provide for a 7% royalty to be collected from sales of certain works of art where the sale price exceeded $10,000. Half of this payment would go to the artist or successor in copyright, and half would go towards an escrow account to support U.S. non-profit museums.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov2012"/&gt; Both pieces of legislation are currently in committee. In conjunction with the consideration of the legislation, in September 2012 Congress published a Notice of Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/77fr58175.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; requesting comments from the public on factual and policy matters relating to a possible federal resale royalty right.

== Legal challenges ==
===Constitutionality as applied to out-of-state sales===
The Resale Royalty Act came under legal scrutiny when, in October 2011, a group of artists and their heirs filed class action suits against auction houses [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]], and auction site [[eBay]] for failure of those brokers to pay royalties per the Resale Act.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;"Artists File Lawsuits, Seeking Royalties." New York Times. November 1, 2011.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/arts/design/artists-file-suit-against-sothebys-christies-and-ebay.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1337627198-6z6dl6UtRYpD8XktLU1fpg&lt;/ref&gt; In a decision&lt;ref&gt;http://court.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/bb61c530eab0911c882567cf005ac6f9/c1e5a8ee236d7ae988257a02007034b6/$FILE/8604.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on May 17, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen dismissed the suits on the grounds that the Resale Royalty Act violated the [[Commerce Clause]] of the United States Constitution, and was therefore invalid as law. (''Estate of Graham, et al, v. Sotheby’s Inc.'')&lt;ref name="case"&gt;[http://court.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/bb61c530eab0911c882567cf005ac6f9/c1e5a8ee236d7ae988257a02007034b6/$FILE/8604.pdf ''Estate of Graham, et al, v. Sotheby's Inc.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commerce Clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as not only affirmatively granting to Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, but also, by negative implication, prohibiting the states from unjustifiably discriminating against or burdening the flow of interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; A state regulation violates the Commerce clause where it “directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State.”&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

Judge Nguyen found that where the Act regulates any transaction in which the seller resides in California, regardless of the location of the sale, buyer, or artist, the Resale Royalty Act “explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine art occurring wholly outside California.”&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; The Court cited the example of a California resident placing a painting by a New York artist for sale with Sotheby's in New York, where at the subsequent auction the painting is bought by a New York resident.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; In this instance, the California law requires the New York company to withhold the amount of the royalty from the sale price, and either locate and pay the artist in New York or remit payment to the California Arts Council should the artist not be located. Further, the Act permits the New York artist to sue the New York Sotheby's under California law should the auction house fail to collect and remit the applicable royalty to the artist.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

In 2015, an eleven-judge [[en banc]] panel of the [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] affirmed, holding that applying the Act to out-of-state sales made by a California resident was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=ARTNET2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Eileen |title=California Court Resale Royalty Unconstitutional |url=https://news.artnet.com/market/court-restricts-california-resale-law-294993 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Artnet News |date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="12-56067"&gt;''[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/05/05/12-56067.pdf Sam Francis Foundation, et al. v.  Christies, Inc, et al.]'', no. 12-56067 (9th Cir. May 5, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The court struck the clause "the seller resides in California or" from the Act, declining to rule on whether the Act could otherwise be applied to sales made within California.&lt;ref name=ARTNET2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="12-56067"/&gt; In 2016, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declined [[certiorari]], leaving the Ninth Circuit decision in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boucher |first1=Brian |title=Supreme Court Declines Artist Royalties Appeal |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/supreme-court-declines-artists-resale-royalty-appeal-406106 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Artnet News |date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-280.htm Sam Francis Foundation, et al. v. Christies, Inc., et al.]'', United States Supreme Court, no. 15-280 (docket). Accessed August 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preemption===
In April 2016, another federal judge, [[Michael W. Fitzgerald]], held the entire Act to be preempted by section 301 of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Meier |first1=Henry |title=Federal Ruling Puts State Artist Royalty Law in Jeopardy |url=http://labusinessjournal.com/news/2016/apr/12/federal-ruling-puts-state-artist-royalty-law-jeopa/ |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Estate of Robert Graham, et al. v.

'''Ceremonial drums''' are used in a ritual context by indigenous peoples around the world, often accompanied by singing or chanting.

In the circumpolar regions the drums have been classified by traits such as the knob, frame design, size, membrane motifs, ornaments, etc. There are therefore two main groups of drums: those with internal and those with external knobs. Drums with internal knobs are found amongst the [[Chukchi people|Tjuktjer]] in Asia and among North American [[Inuit]]. Drums with external knobs are more widespread and are divided into four types:
* West Siberian: ([[Khant peoples|Khant]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]], [[Nenets people|Nenets]])
* South Siberian: (groups living above and in the mid regions of the [[Yenisei River]]). This type has many variations (Sajano-Yeniseic, Sjoric, Altaic)
* Mid Siberian: This type has two variants, Evenki-Yakutic and Nganasans-Entsic.
* Middle East: ([[Nanay]]ians, [[Udegey]]ians, [[Ulch people|Ulchians]], [[Nivkhs|Nivkhians]], [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Evenk peoples|Evenkians]], [[Buryats]]ians, [[Yukagir]]ians, [[Dolgans|Dolganians]], [[Oroch people|Orochs]], [[Oroks|Orokians]], [[Negidals|Negidalians]] and [[Zabaykalska Evenkians]], that is [[Evenks|Evenkians]] from the region far [[Lake Baikal]], where two types are characteristic: Amursic and Zabaykalic)

&lt;!--
* South Siberian type (groups living above and mid regions of the Jenisej river) and has many variations (Sajano-Jenisejska, Sjoriska, Altaiska)
* Mid Siberian type with two variants (Evenkic-Jakutic and Nganasansic-Entsic)
* Middle East type (Nanajer, Udegejer, Ultjer, Nivcher, Ainu, Evenker, Burjater, Jukagirer, Dolganer, Orotjer, Oroker, Negidaler and Zabajkalska Evenkians, i.e. [[evenks|Evenkians]] from the region far [[Lake Baikal]], where also two types are characteristic: Amurska and Zabajkalska)
--&gt;

The historical [[Sami people|Saami]] drum, sometimes termed [[rune drum]], belonged to the South Siberian kind, Sajano-Yeniseic subtype. (Those are, however, very similar to the Sjoric subtypes.) The Sami word for drum is 'goavddis', 'goabdes ' or 'gievrie' and the Altaic term is 'komus'. The Sami drum-stick term is 'bállin'; the Altaic term is 'orba'. 

&lt;!-- And finally, the Sami term for shaman is naida (noajdde); the Mansi term is nait. The Saami drums are further divided into the following classes:
* Frame drum
** Svept frame drum (or Åsele type) -
** Ring drum -
** Angle drum -

The '''Church of Euthanasia''' (also known as CoE) is a religious organization founded by Reverend [[Chris Korda]] and Pastor Kim (Robert Kimberk) in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, Grant. (2005) "Church of Euthanasia". In ''[[The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature]]'', ed. by Bron Taylor, pp. 384–85. London &amp; New York: Continuum International&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated in the Church's website, it is "a non-profit educational foundation devoted to restoring balance between Humans and the remaining species on Earth".&lt;ref name="Church of Euthanasia FAQ"&gt;[http://churchofeuthanasia.org/coefaq.html Church of Euthanasia FAQ.]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this organization affirm this can only turn into a reality by a massive voluntary population reduction, which will depend on a leap in human consciousness to species-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Ann. (1995) [[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]], [http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/press/phoenix2.html Virtually childless.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rev. [[Chris Korda]] it is likely that this Church is the world's only anti-human religion.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Chris. (2001) [[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]], [http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/02063812.htm The Pornography of Terror.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its most popular slogan is "Save the Planet, Kill Yourself"&lt;ref&gt;Grad, David. (1996) [[New York Press]], [http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/press/david_grad.html Eat Me - Rev. Chris Korda Dines For Our Sins.]&lt;/ref&gt; and its founding ideology is set in one commandment "Thou Shalt not Procreate",&lt;ref&gt;Blount, Dave. (2015) [http://rightwingnews.com Right Wing News ], [http://rightwingnews.com/abortion/satanists-pro-life-laws-violate-our-religious-beliefs/ Satanists: Pro-Life Laws Violate Our Religious Beliefs.]&lt;/ref&gt; and four main pillars: suicide, abortion, cannibalism (of the already dead) and sodomy ("any sexual act not intended for procreation").&lt;ref name="Church of Euthanasia FAQ"&gt;[http://churchofeuthanasia.org/coefaq.html Church of Euthanasia FAQ.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Church stresses population reduction by voluntary means only.&lt;ref&gt;Dery, Mark. (1999) Getting It, [http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/press/dery.html Mark Dery Interviews Chris Korda.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church promotes its environmental views mainly via their [http://churchofeuthanasia.org/ website] and the web. They also utilize [http://churchofeuthanasia.org/e-sermons/e-sermons.html sermons], art performances, public demonstrations, [[culture jamming]], music, [[publicity stunts]] and direct action to highlight [[human overpopulation|Earth's unsustainable population]]. They consider their methodology similar to those of the [[Dada|Dadaist movement]],&lt;ref&gt;Broder, Von; M, Henryk. (1996) [[Der Spiegel]], [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9123239.html Macht Liebe, nicht Babies], [http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/press/derspieg.html English translation.]&lt;/ref&gt; finding the modern world so absurd that the means needed to reach their message to the public must be absurd themselves.

The Church of Euthanasia is also notorious for its conflicts with [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]] [[Christian]] activists.&lt;ref&gt;Broder, Von; M, Henryk. (1996) [[Der Spiegel]], [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9123239.html Macht Liebe, nicht Babies], [http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/press/derspieg.html English translation].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slogan]]s employed by the group include "Save the Planet, Kill Yourself", "Six Billion Humans Can't Be Wrong", and "Eat a Queer Fetus for Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Prongo, Jark. (2013) [http://vanishingpoint.es/ Vanishing Point], [http://vanishingpoint.es/especiales/chris-korda-y-la-iglesia-de-la-eutanasia-save-the-planet-kill-yourself Chris Korda y la Iglesia de la Eutanasia: save the planet, kill yourself.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Church gained early attention in 1995 because of its affiliation with [[paranoia.com]] which hosted many sites that were controversial or skirted illegality. Members later appeared on an episode of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' titled "I Want to Join a Suicide Cult".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/entertalkmentsite/jerryspringer.html EnterTalkMent Archives, broadcast Aug 11, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], the Church posted to its website a four-minute music video titled ''[http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/catalog/video.html I Like to Watch],'' combining hardcore [[pornography|pornographic]] video with footage of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] collapse. The montage featured an electronic soundtrack recorded by Korda and the lyrics, [http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/chris+korda/save+the+planet+kill+yourself_21009925.html "People dive into the street/ While I play with my meat."] It also showed a man masturbating and then cleaning himself with an American flag. Korda described the project as reflecting his "contempt for and frustration with the profound ugliness of the modern industrial world."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Chris. (2001) [[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]], The [http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/02063812.htm Pornography of Terror.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.spaink.net/2002/11/12/kip-aan-het-kruis/|title = Chicken on the Cross "Kip aan het kruis"|date = November 12, 2002|accessdate = September 21, 2015|website = spaink.com|publisher = Karin Spaink|last = Spaink|first = Karin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church's website previously had instructions on "how to kill yourself" by [[asphyxia]]tion using [[helium]]. These pages were removed in 2003 after a 52-year-old woman used them to commit suicide in [[St. Louis County, Missouri]], resulting in legal threats against the church.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Todd C. (2003) [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Now%20even%20committing%20suicide%20has%20gone%20online&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2000%20-%202008|2011%20-%202014|1988%20-%202000|2000&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22Now%20even%20committing%20suicide%20has%20gone%20online%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no Now even committing suicide has gone online].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Film|Cinema]] in Estonia''' is the [[film industry]] of the [[Republic of Estonia]]. The motion pictures have won international awards and each year new Estonian films are seen at film festivals around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/culture-a-science/estonian-film.html Estonian Film 100] Estonia.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

==1896—1911==
The first "moving pictures" were screened in [[Tallinn]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eiIpe99dL5MC&amp;pg Eastern Europe By Tom Masters; p. 328]&lt;/ref&gt; The first movie theater was opened in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mY1pAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=baltic+german+Cinema&amp;dq=baltic+german+Cinema&amp;ei=262zSMyPF5XIigH32_kj&amp;pgis=1 The Baltic States By Marje Jõeste, Küllo Arjakas] {{ISBN|978-5-89960-026-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; First local documentary was made in 1908 with the production of a [[newsreel]] about [[Sweden|Swedish]] King [[Gustav V of Sweden|Gustav V]]’s visit to [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einst.ee/publications/kultuur/cinema.html estonian culture - cinema&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1912—1918==
The first Estonian documentary was created by [[Johannes Pääsuke]] in 1912 that was followed by a short film ''Karujaht Pärnumaal'' (Bear Hunt in Pärnumaa) in 1914. The first [[movie studio]] in Estonia, ''Estonia Film Tartus'' (The Tartu Studio of Estonia Film), was established by Johannes Pääsuke (1892–1918). Pääsuke produced documentaries, short films and pictures of Estonian nature for the [[Estonian National Museum]]. ''[[Karujaht Pärnumaal]]'' (Bear-Hunt in Pärnu County, 1914) was the first fictional short film made in Estonia. In total, eight films made by J. Pääsuke have survived and are stored at the [[Estonian Film Archives]].&lt;ref name="EFA"&gt;[http://filmi.arhiiv.ee The Estonian Film Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1918—1940==
[[File:Konstatin Marska.jpg|thumb|[[Konstantin Märska]] at the [[Estonian Culture Film]] in 1936]]
The first full-length feature film was made in 1924 ''Shadow of the Past'' directed by [[Konstantin Märska]] and produced by his ''Konstantin Märska Filmiproduktsioon'' (Konstantin Märska Film Production). Two feature films by Märska have survived: ''Vigased pruudid'' (1929) and ''Jüri Rumm'' (1929). ''Theodor Lutsu Filmiproduktsioon'' (the Film Production of Theodor Luts Studio) was established by [[Theodor Luts]] and his wife [[Aksella Luts]], who produced documentaries and feature films. His ''[[Noored kotkad]]'' (Young Eagles) (1927) is generally regarded as the cornerstone of Estonian cinema. &lt;ref name="Connor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&amp;pg Culture And Customs of the Baltic States By Kevin O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt; Luts was also responsible for directing the only Estonian sound feature made before Soviet era, an Estonian-Finnish co-production ''Päikese lapsed'' (1932). Luts moved to Finland to work as a cinematographer immediately after finishing the film, and never returned to Estonia. Smaller film production studios in Estonia included ''Siirius Film'' and ''K.Kalamees Tartu''.

The major film production company after the [[Great Depression]] hit Estonia during the 1930s was state subsidized the [[Estonian Culture Film]] ({{lang-et|Eesti Kultuurfilm}}) that produced mostly documentaries.&lt;br/&gt;
In late 1930s, Academy Award nominated [[Miliza Korjus]] best known for a role in [[The Great Waltz (film)|''The Great Waltz'' (1938)]], daughter of an [[Estonia]]n [[lieutenant colonel]] in the Imperial Russian Army and later Chief of Staff to the War Minister of Estonia, had a successful career in Hollywood film industry&lt;ref name="CaCoBS"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&amp;pg Eastern Europe By Richard C. Frucht; p.95]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Estonian animated short film ''[[Kutsu-Juku seiklusi]]'' was made in 1931.&lt;ref name="KJS"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212290/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940—1953==
During the first year of [[occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] (1940–1941) ''Eesti Kultuurfilm'' was taken over by the Communist Party and renamed ''Kinokroonika Eesti Stuudio'' (the Estonian Newsreel Studio). During the first decades of Soviet rule as Estonia became a part of USSR in 1944 after the end of World War II, filmmakers in Estonia were mostly coming from inner Soviet Union whose job was to create propaganda films that depicted the victory of socialism in a form of newsreels and documentaries.&lt;ref name="CaCoBS"/&gt;

Former Eesti Kultuurfilm was called ''Kinokroonika Tallinna Stuudio'' (The Tallinn Newsreel Studio) in 1942 during the [[Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany|German occupation]] in World War II and ''Tallinna Kinostuudio'' (The Tallinn Film Studio) in 1947 again by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

During the era two feature films on Soviet themes were produced in Estonia directed by [[Gerbert Rappaport]], an [[Austrians|Austrian]] émigré in Soviet Union:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kontakt.erstebankgroup.net/events/2008-04_Filmmuseum+Wien_Rappaport/en Rappaport @ Filmmuseum in Wien]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elu tsitadellis (Life in the Citadel)'' in 1947, ''Valgus Koordis (Light in Koordi)'' in 1951 that was the first [[color motion picture film]] made in Estonia.&lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

==1953—1991==
After the death of Stalin in 1953 a more liberal period in Soviet Union's cultural policies followed. Filmmakers started to enjoy greater artistic control at the same time the Soviet State Committee for Cinematography ([[Goskino]]) in Moscow provided the money, state censorship body [[Glavlit]] and [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] Department of Culture had the control over releasing the movies.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

The Tallinn Film Studio was renamed ''Kunstiliste ja Kroonikafilmide Tallinna Kinostuudio'' (Tallinn Feature- and Newsreel Film Studio) in 1954 and in 1963 was renamed again [[Tallinnfilm]] &lt;ref name="EFA"/&gt;

Some of the first films produced during the era that were co directed by an Estonian [[Kaljo Kiisk]] were ''Juunikuu päevad'' (1957) and ''Vallatud kurvid'' also known as ''[[Opasniye Povoroty]]'', the first dramatic film shot in [[Kinopanorama]] (1959).

In the 1960s a story of [[Furst Gabriel or Last Days of the Pirita Monastery|Prince Gabriel]] by Estonian writer [[Eduard Bornhöhe]] was turned into a movie script by [[Arvo Valton]]. [[Grigori Kromanov]] was named to be the director of ''[[Viimne reliikvia]]'' (The Last Relic), released in 1969 by Tallinnfilm. The movie set the absolute box office record for the entire Soviet Union at the time by selling 44,9 million tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=loCDXm_Ar58C&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Last+Relic+absolute+box+office&amp;sig=ACfU3U1PuHZmoYs8zDYWR1Yn5J2MuyIdTw Bridging the Cultural Divide By Sigrid Rieuwerts; p. 325]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065180/business Box office for Viimne reliikvia @ IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; It was successfully distributed by the Soviet film export internationally in more than 60 countries. The film also influenced Estonian literature: 2 short stories listed for the [[Friedebert Tuglas]] award in 1970-75 included references to the Last Relic.

Another milestone in Estonian Cinema released in 1969 was [[Arvo Kruusement]]'s ''[[Spring (1969 film)|''Kevade'']]'' (Spring) based on [[Oskar Luts]] popular novel.&lt;ref name="EE"/&gt;

Successful films in the 1980s were ''[["Hukkunud Alpinisti" hotell]]'' (Dead Mountaineer's Hotel) by Kromanov and movies made by [[Kaljo Kiisk]] such as ''Nipernaadi'' (1983).

The most prominent female director [[Leida Laius]] who emerged during the era is best known for her ''Kõrboja peremees'' (1979) and ''Naerata ometi'' (1985) receiving at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] UNICEF Award in 1985. [[Peeter Simm]]'s best known Soviet era film is ''Ideaalmaastik'' (The Ideal Landscape) released in 1980. [[Peeter Urbla]]'s ''Ma pole turist, ma elan siin'' (I'm Not a Tourist, I'm Living Here) (1988).  [[Jaan Kolgerg]] emerged by the end of Soviet era with films ''See kadunud tee'' (1990) (The Lost Way) and ''Võlausaldajad'' (Creditors) (1992)

Among the leading Estonian film actors during the Soviet era were [[Rein Aren]] with about 30 roles, [[Jüri Järvet]] and [[Leonhard Merzin]].&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

==Since 1991==
After the collapse of the Soviet Union Estonia regained its independence, the cost of filmmaking skyrocketed and the 1990s showed decline in filmmaking that reached its bottom in 1996, the year when no [[fictional films]] and only 2 documentaries ''Lipule... güüsile... valvel!'' and ''Turvalisuse illusioon'' were made in Estonia.

In 1997, the [[Estonian Film Foundation]] was founded by the Estonian Ministry of Culture. Production of  ''Minu Leninid'' (All My Lenins) (1997) a parody of Soviet Revolution by [[Hardi Volmer]] marked a turnaround for Estonian feature films. In 1998, there were two feature films produced.  ''[[Georgica (film)|Georgica]]'' directed by Sulev Keedus won the ''FIPRESCI Prize'' at the [[Stockholm Film Festival]] in 1998 and the ''Prix Europa Special'' at [[Prix Europa]] in 1999.

Since then, the trend has also been towards joint film productions such as Peeter Simm's ''Head käed'' (Good Hands) (2001) a joint Estonian-Latvian coproduction that in 2002 won the ''Manfred Salzgeber Award'' at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and the ''Golden Olive Tree''
[[Lecce Festival of European Cinema]] in Italy. ''Kõrini'' (Fed Up) (2005) an Estonian-German coproduction. [[Arvo Iho]]' s  ''Karu süda'' (Hart of the Bear) (2001) nominated for ''Golden St. George'' at the Moscow International Film Festival and for the ''European Film Award'' at [[European Film Awards]], was a coproduction between Estonia, Germany, Russia and the Czech Republic.

The most commercially successful Estonian film in 2002 was ''[[Names in Marble (film)|Nimed marmortahvlil]]''  (2002) (Names in Marble) by [[Elmo Nüganen]] and in 2003 a comedy by [[Rando Pettai]] ''Vanad ja kobedad saavad jalad alla'' (Made in Estonia) that in Estonia topped the international blockbuster ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' with its box office results.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;

In 2004, two young directors emerged Jaak Kilmi and [[René Reinumägi]] with their ''[[Revolution of Pigs|Sigade revolutsioon]]''
(Revolution of Pigs) that won the ''Special Jury Prize'' and was nominated for ''Golden St. George'' at the [[Moscow International Film Festival]], and for ''Grand Prix Asturias'' at the [[Gijón International Film Festival]].

In 2007, about 10 feature films were made in Estonia. Most notable perhaps ''Sügisball'' (2007) by Veiko Õunpuu receiving among other awards ''Best Director'' at the [[Thessaloniki Film Festival]], [[International Film Festival Bratislava]] and ''Venice Horizons Award'' at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]]. ''Georg'' (2007) by Peeter Simm is a movie about the life of legendary Estonian singer [[Georg Ots]].

Most recent awarded film is Veiko Õunpuu's ''[[The Temptation of St. Tony]]'' (2009). In 2011, Estonia made eight full-length films, which included one animated film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-908215-01-7 |page= 111 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 5 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally founded as a government art school,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge: Lutterworth Press, 2004) p.383&lt;/ref&gt; it is now an independent, not-for-profit charity, and is one of the country's longest established art schools. It offers courses ranging from art and design [[Foundation Course|Foundation]], through to BA (Hons) [[undergraduate degree]]s and MA [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] courses in [[fine art]] and conservation. In addition, it offers the only diploma and [[postgraduate diploma]] courses in Britain in historic stone and wood carving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/courses Courses listed on school's website (accessed 25 March 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202192337/http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/courses |date=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art School is housed in a row of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings in London's [[Kennington]] district,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geraldlaing.com/index.php/articles/articles_full/city_and_guilds_of_london_art_school/ Artist describes location at www.geraldlaing.com (accessed on 5 April 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in an adjoining converted warehouse building close to the south bank of the river [[Thames]].

==History==
===Foundation in the 19th Century===
The City and Guilds of London Art School was founded in 1854 by the Reverend Robert Gregory under the name Lambeth School of Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/magazine/issue19/iss19p5.html www.worldcollectorsnet.com describes  potter John Sparkes leading the college in 1856 (accessed 5 April 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605234647/http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/magazine/issue19/iss19p5.html |date=5 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a night school in rooms occupied during the day by a [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] in his south London parish of St Mary the Less. With the support of [[Henry Cole]] Director of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], who supplied Gregory with teachers, the school flourished and became a leader in the provision of instruction in applied art and design to working artisans, many of whom were employed by local manufacturing firms, including [[Royal Doulton|Doulton's]] and [[Farmer and Brindley]]. The rapid expansion of the school led to the need for new premises, and in 1860 [[Edward VII|Albert, Prince of Wales (Edward VII)]] laid the foundation stone for new premises in Millers Lane, built on the site of the [[Vauxhall Gardens]] as part of a redevelopment that included St Peter's church. The buildings are still standing, although the road is now called St Oswald's Place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwark.anglican.org/parishes/265p Streatham, St Peter - Lambeth, South Deanery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227134625/http://www.southwark.anglican.org/parishes/265p |date=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sculp&gt;{{cite web|title=South London Technical School of Art (also Lambeth School of Art and City and Guilds of London Art School)|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib2_1207870826|website=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951|publisher=Glasgow University, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Henry Moore Institute|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development under John Sparkes===
In 1857 [[John Charles Lewis Sparkes]] started teaching at the art school, soon becoming its Headmaster. Under Sparkes City and Guilds of London Art School was at the forefront of opposition to the monopoly claimed by the Royal Academy of Arts on the teaching of fine art practices, particularly drawing from the human figure. An attempt had been made to resolve this conflict in 1852, with the introduction by the British Government of the National Course on Instruction for art and design education, which was in effect a [[national curriculum]] for art training. This allowed for some elements of drawing to be taught, but within a broader curriculum that stressed the teaching of techniques to aid workers in artisan manufacturing industries rather than the training of artists.

In the case of City and Guilds of London Art School it was suggested at the time that Sparkes was ignoring the National Course on Instruction and teaching his students to be fine artists, particularly in 1865, when students from the art school won three medals at the annual awards handed out by the Royal Academy of Arts,&lt;ref&gt;The Athenaeum, vol. 1991, 23 December 1965, p.894&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1867 when its students won three out of ten of the gold medals for art awarded by the Government, along with four silver medals awarded annually by the Royal Academy of Arts, and a bronze medal at the International Exposition held that year in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;'Lambeth School of Art' in ''The Art Journal,'' February 1866, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Sparkes and his colleagues at City and Guilds of London Art School ignored the general prohibition on life drawing being taught outside the Royal Academy of Arts, and the success of Sparkes's students at City and Guilds of London Art School in fine art competitions can be traced to this willingness by Sparkes to ignore regulations he believed were wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge, James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2014) .p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

This radicalism in Sparkes can also be seen in his concern for the art and design tutors working both at City and Guilds of London Art School and elsewhere in Britain. In the 1860s a block grant was give by the British Government to the [[Royal College of Art|South Kensington Government School of Design]] for teachers' pay and this was then redistributed to other art schools across the country. As well as being widely considered an insufficient sum in the first place, the Government School of Design was accused by people such as Sparkes of holding on to too much of the money leading to the payment of what were called starvation wages at other art schools. Sparkes in particular was instrumental in campaigning for an increase in these wages, through both direct appeals to parliament and the establishment of the first national union of art teachers, the Association of Art Masters, in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge, James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2014) .p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection to Doulton's Pottery===
Recognising the limitations of government patronage of art schools, Sparkes cultivated a number of connections between the City and Guilds of London Art School and local manufacturing industries which would lead ultimately to City and Guilds of London Art School attaining the independent status it has today. One of the most notable of these was with [[Henry Doulton]] whose pottery factory, later known as [[Royal Doulton]], was located near to the City and Guilds of London Art School. 

In 1863 Doulton joined the school's board of management and the following year he gave the school its first commission, for a terracotta frieze for his factory's new extension. Following on from this Doulton was a strong supporter and promoter of the art school's activities, including exhibiting experimental works by students at the [[1867 Paris Exhibition]] and at the [[Annual International Exhibitions (London 1871–74)|1871 London Exhibition]].&lt;ref name=dick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wardleworth|first1=Dennis|title=William Reid Dick, Sculptor|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Farnham, Surrey|isbn=9781409439714|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oJmPfmQ7SgC&amp;dq|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1869, Doulton and his staff helped the art school to develop a curriculum that trained students for the pottery trade, and to carry out design work for Doulton. This collaboration provided [[Royal Doulton|Doulton's]] with a supply of higher-quality artwork for its trade, and gave students at Lambeth School of Art employment opportunities, and many noted English modellers and sculptors of the late nineteenth century owe their careers to this partnership.&lt;ref name=sculp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKeown|first1=Julie|title=Royal Doulton|date=1997|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=0747803382|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxBdYICh0cwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The close connection between the art school and Doulton's meant that the ethos of City and Guilds of London School of Art was based, from very early days, on a belief in a strong connection between the fine arts, craft and design. Consequently, its students and teachers became associated with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and to some extent the [[Art Nouveau]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline College timeline at www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk (accessed 8 March 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228232823/http://cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline |date=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection to Mssrs Farmer and Brindley===
In addition to Doulton's, Sparkes also cultivated contacts with other local craft trade companies, one of the most notable of which was Mssrs Farmer and Brindley, a Lambeth-based architectural stone carving and terra-cotta company.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Hardy, 'Farmer and Brindley, Craftsmen and Sculptors, 1850-1930' in The Victorian Society Annual 1993, p. 4-17&lt;/ref&gt; As with Doulton's, a number of apprentices at Farmer and Brindley augmented their training with study at the Art School. This included the sculptors Charles John Allen (1862-1956), Harry Bates (1850-1899) and Nathaniel Hitch (1846-1936), and others, who became prominent sculptors in the Victorian and Edwardian periods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/search/index.php?searchtype=all&amp;search=farmer+and+brindley&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 University of Glasgow Mapping Sculpture Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

===City and Guilds Institute and City Livery Companies===
In 1879 Sparkes secured the involvement in the art school of the newly founded [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], which received financial backing from 16 [[Livery Companies]].&lt;ref name=dick/&gt; The new backing secured the financial future of the school without the strings attached to government funding. Under the new arrangement, the art school moved to a new building in Kennington Park Road, which it still occupies, and Lambeth School of Art was renamed the South London Technical School of Art. In 1937 it changed its name to the City and Guilds of London Art School, reflecting the historical and continued support of the city of London [[Livery Companies]].&lt;ref name=sculp/&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===

Graduates of the Art School were involved in some of the leading social and political movements of the early twentieth century, including [[Clemence Housman]] and [[Laurence Housman]], who co-founded, in 1909, a society for artists who supported the [[Suffragette Movement]], called the [[Suffrage Atelier]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Crawford, ''The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928'' (London: Routledge, 1999) p.662&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Housman]] later went on to found the alternative bookshop, which still bears his name, located in Caledonian Road, near London's [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] railway station.

After the Second World War, new restoration and carving courses were established at the Art School to train people for the restoration of London's war-damaged buildings. However, during the 1960s the art school also developed a [[fine art]] programme, although it still maintained and strengthened its programmes in restoration and carving. This resulted in the Art School evolving into both a school for fine art education, and a unique specialist training centre for the education of restorers and conservators of architectural stone and wood work. 

In 1970 the Art School became an independent charitable trust, with the new Deed of Incorporation signed by Goeffrey Agnew (chairman of the art gallery [[Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons]]), Sir Colin Skelton Anderson (Provost of the [[Royal College of Art]]), [[Sir John Betjeman]] (poet), [[Adrian Maurice Daintrey]] (artist), Gilbert Samuel (Lord Mayor of London), [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]] (sculptor and Former President of the [[Royal Academy]]), and [[Carel Weight]] (artist), amongst others. Support also came from artists such as [[Henry Moore]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Companies House, London, Articles of Association, reference no. 00992490&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 and 1998 the Fine Art Painting, Sculpture and Conservation courses were validated at undergraduate BA (Hons) level. In 2000 the MA course in Fine Art was validated by the University of Central England (now [[Birmingham City University]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biad.bcu.ac.uk/about/associatedcolleges.htm Birmingham Institute of Art and Design validation at www.biad.bcu.ac.uk (accessed 5 March 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:CIty and Guilds of London Art School.JPG|thumb|Exterior at twilight]]

In a 2008 letter to the [[Observer (newspaper)|Observer]] newspaper and [[Art Monthly]] by Graham Crowley, former Professor of the Royal College of Art, the City &amp; Guilds of London Art School's Fine Art Department was singled out for its "magnificent job" in "maintaining the transformative power and joy of education through art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/10/art.furthereducation | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe | title=Low morale devastates art colleges | date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] shortlisted writer [[Tibor Fischer]] became the [[Royal Literary Fund]] writing fellow at the City and Guilds of London Art School.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/current_fellows.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011 the magazine [[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]] surveyed art world professionals to create a list of the top ten British art schools, resulting in the City and Guilds of London Art School coming third after the Royal College of Art and the Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/news/school_news/modern_painters |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228073945/http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/news/school_news/modern_painters |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2018 art school's undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses have been validated by [[Ravensbourne (college)|Ravensbourne]].

In some communities, "e-text" is used much more narrowly, to refer to electronic documents that are, so [[Plaintext|plain text]] file, but that it has no information beyond "the text itself"—no repboldparagraph, page, chapter, or footnote boundaries, etc. Michael S. Hart,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_History_and_Philosophy_of_Project_Gutenberg_by_Michael_Hart Michael S. Hart]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, argued that this "is the only text mode that is easy on both the eyes and the computer". Hart made the correct{{Says who|date=April 2015}} point that proprietary word-processor formats made texts grossly inaccessible, but that is irrelevant to standard, open data formats. The narrow sense of "e-text" is now uncommon, because the notion of "just vanilla ASCII" (attractive at first glance) has turned out to have serious difficulties:

First, this narrow type of "e-text" is limited to the English letters. Not even Spanish ñ or the accented vowels used in many European languages cannot be represented (unless awkwardly and ambiguously as "~n" "a'"). Asian, Slavic, Greek, and other writing systems are impossible.

Second, diagrams and pictures cannot be accommodated, and many books have at least some such material; often it is essential to the book.

Third, "e-texts" in this narrow sense have no reliable way to distinguish "the text" from other things that occur in a work. For example, page numbers, page headers, and footnotes might be omitted, or might simply appear as additional lines of text, perhaps with blank lines before and after (or not). An ornate separator line might be represented instead by a line of asterisks (or not).  Chapter and sections titles, likewise, are just additional lines of text: they might be detectable by capitalization if they were all caps in the original (or not). Even to discover what conventions (if any) were used, makes each book a new research or reverse-engineering project.

In consequence of this, such texts cannot be reliably re-formatted. A program cannot reliably tell where footnotes, headers or footers are, or perhaps even paragraphs, so it cannot re-arrange the text, for example to fit a narrower screen, or read it aloud for the visually impaired. Programs might apply [[heuristics]] to guess at the structure, but this can easily fail.

Fourth, and a perhaps surprisingly{{Says who|date=April 2015}} important issue, a "plain-text" e-text affords no way to represent information ''about'' the work. For example, is it the first or the tenth edition? Who prepared it, and what rights do they reserve or grant to others? Is this the raw version straight off a scanner, or has it been proofread and corrected? Metadata relating to the text is sometimes included with an e-text, but there is by this definition no way to say whether or where it is preset. At best, the text of the title page might be included (or not), perhaps with centering imitated by indentation.

Fifth, texts with more complicated information cannot really be handled at all. A bilingual edition, or a critical edition with footnotes, commentary, critical apparatus, cross-references, or even the simplest tables. This leads to endless practical problems: for example, if the computer cannot reliably distinguish footnotes, it cannot find a phrase that a footnote interrupts.

Even raw scanner [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] output usually produces more information than this, such as the use of bold and italic. If this information is not kept, it is expensive and time-consuming to reconstruct it; more sophisticated information such as what edition you have, may not be recoverable at all.

If actuality, even "plain text" uses some kind of "markup"—usually [[control character]]s, spaces, tabs, and the like: Spaces between words; two returns and 5 spaces for paragraph. The main difference from more formal markup is that "plain texts" use implicit, usually undocumented conventions, which are therefore inconsistent and difficult to recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1987|title=Markup systems and the future of scholarly text processing|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|volume=30|issue=11|pages=933–947|doi=10.1145/32206.32209|url=http://xml.coverpages.org/coombs.html|first1=James H.|last1=Coombs|first2=Allen H. |last2=Renear|first3=Steven J. |last3=DeRose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrow sense of e-text as "plain vanilla ASCII" has fallen out of favor.{{Says who|date=April 2015}} Nevertheless, many such texts are freely available on the Web, perhaps as much because they are easily produced as because of any purported portability advantage. For many years [[Project Gutenberg]] strongly favored this model of text, but with time, has begun to develop and distribute more capable forms such as [[HTML]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">The '''effect of reality''' ({{lang-fr|effet de réel}}) is a textual device identified by [[Roland Barthes]] the purpose of which was to establish literary texts as [[Literary realism|realistic]].

==History==
Barthes first suggested this concept in his 1968 essay "The Reality Effect," in which he argues that untheorized descriptive "residues" of the text produce effects of reality through their dissembling of the tripartite sign. In the absence of any signified, Barthes argues, the textual signifiers for "real" objects had for their actual signifieds only the concept of realism itself; further, Barthes suggested that the origins of this textual device came through the development of an "aesthetic finality of language" present in the use of the rhetorical device of [[ecphrasis]] in "Alexandrian neo-rhetoric of the second century" (''The Reality Effect'' in Barthes 1989).

Barthes also showed that this ''effect of reality'' was a key problem of historical analysis and writing in that historical writing proclaimed an unproblematic realism that was in fact just this textual device in action  (''The Discourse of History'' in Barthes 1989).  It was this aspect of the ''effect of reality'' that [[Frank Ankersmit|Ankersmit]] showed helped to explain both the evolution of historical enquiry and the problematic textual nature of history (Ankersmit 1989).

The concern with realism and the constructed nature of historical and literary facts that both [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] and [[Frank Ankersmit|Ankersmit]] expressed is also to be found in the field of [[Discursive psychology]]; and [[Jonathan Potter]] has analysed similar problems and issues in his "Representing Reality" (Potter 1996).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8544">'''Extreme cinema''' is a genre of film distinguished by its use of excessive violence, torture, and sex of extreme nature. The rising popularity of Asian films in the 21st century has contributed to the growth of extreme cinema, although extreme cinema is still considered to be a cult-based genre. Being a relatively new genre, extreme cinema is controversial and widely unaccepted by the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;Dirks, Tim. “100 Most Controversial Films of All Time.” ''100 Most Controversial Films of All Time''. Filmsite, n.d. Web. 9 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme cinema films target a specific and small audience group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/C6FD3EB5-9542-4A98-B2E1-3F2E834B88FF]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The prehistory of extreme cinema can be traced back to censorship of [[art films]] and advertising tactics for classical [[exploitation films]] to Anglophone markets alongside later liberal representations of sex in the first half of the 20th Century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oqq_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=extreme+cinema+the+transgressive+rhetoric+of+today's+art+film+culture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KN46_CS2kK&amp;sig=rYJ7CboAzRRup3nNc7NB502f93Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqzorAjanYAhXMOCYKHeaLAus4ChDoAQhCMAY#v=snippet&amp;q=+salo&amp;f=false|title=Extreme Cinema: The Transgressive Rhetoric of Today's Art Film Culture|first=Mattias|last=Frey|date=15 March 2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "extreme cinema" originated from a “line of Asian films that share a combination of sensational features, such as extreme violence, horror and shocking plots”.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Eunah. “Trauma, excess, and the aesthetics of the affect: the extreme cinemas of Chan-Wook Park.” ''Post Script'' 2014:33. ''Literature Resource Center''. Web. 7 Feb. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Extreme cinema is highly criticized and debated by film critics and the general public. There have been debates over the hypersexualization that makes these films a threat to the ‘mainstream’ community standards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pett, E. “A New Media Landscape? The BBFC,&amp;nbsp; Extreme Cinema As Cult, And Technological Change.” ''New Review of Film and Television Studies'' 13.1 (2015): 83-99. Scopus. Web. 9 Feb. 2016&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been criticism over the increasing use of violence in modern-day films. Ever since the emergence of slasher-gore films in the ’70s, the rising popularity of extreme cinema has contributed to the casual violence in popular media.&lt;ref&gt;Sapolsky, Barry S., Fred Moliter, and Sarah Luque. “Sex and Violence in Slasher Films: Re-examining the Assumptions.” ''J&amp;MC Quarterl''y 80.1 (2003): 28-38. ''SAGE Journals''. Web. 9 Feb. 2016.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticize the easy exposure and unintended targeting of adolescence by extreme cinema films.&lt;ref&gt;Sargent, James D., Todd F. Hetherton, M. Bridget Ahrens, Madeline A. Dalton, Jennifer J. Tickle, and Michael L. Beach. “Adolescent Exposure to Extremely Violent Movies.” ''Journal of Adolescent Health'' 31.6 (2002): 449-454. ''JAMES MADISON UNIV’s Catalog.'' Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification and guidelines ===
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) classifies extreme cinema films into an "R18" rating, which is defined as “special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{See also|Baroque painting}}

'''Flemish Baroque painting''' refers to the art produced in the [[Southern Netherlands]] during Spanish control in the 16th and 17th centuries. The period roughly begins when the [[Dutch Republic]] was split from the [[Habsburg Spain]] regions to the south with the Spanish recapturing of [[Antwerp]] in 1585 and goes until about 1700, when Habsburg authority ended with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1"&gt;Vleighe, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Antwerp, home to the prominent artists [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Jacob Jordaens]], was the artistic nexus, while other notable cities include [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt;

Rubens, in particular, had a strong influence on seventeenth-century visual culture. His innovations helped define Antwerp as one of Europe's major artistic cities, especially for [[Counter Reformation]] imagery, and his student Van Dyck was instrumental in establishing new directions in English portraiture. Other developments in Flemish [[Baroque]] painting are similar to those found in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]],&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; with artists specializing in such areas as [[history painting]], [[portrait painting|portraiture]], [[genre painting]], [[landscape painting]], and [[still life]].
{{History of Dutch and Flemish painting}}

==General characteristics==
"Flemish", in the context of this and artistic periods such as the "Flemish Primitives" (in English now [[Early Netherlandish painting]]), often includes the regions not associated with modern [[Flanders]], including the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the autonomous [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; By the seventeenth century, however, Antwerp was the main city for innovative artistic production, largely due to the presence of Rubens. Brussels was important as the location of the court, attracting [[David Teniers the Younger]] later in the century.

[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Hogenberg, The Calvinist [[beeldenstorm|Iconoclastic Riot of August 20, 1566]] when many paintings and church decorations were destroyed and subsequently replaced by late [[Northern Mannerist]] and Baroque artists.]]

===Late Mannerism===
Although paintings produced at the end of the 16th century belong to general [[Northern Mannerist]] and Late [[Renaissance]] approaches that were common throughout Europe, artists such as [[Otto van Veen]], [[Adam van Noort]], [[Marten de Vos]], and the [[Francken]] family were particularly instrumental in setting the stage for the local Baroque. Between 1585 and the early 17th century they made many new [[altarpiece]]s to replace those destroyed during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] [[beeldenstorm|outbreaks of 1566]]. Also during this time [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] became important for their small [[cabinet painting]]s, often depicting [[Mythology|mythological]] and history subjects.

==="The Age of Rubens"===
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577–1640), a student of both Otto van Veen and Adam van Noort, spent eight years in Italy (1600–1608), during which time he studied examples of [[classical antiquity]], the [[Italian Renaissance]], and contemporaries [[Adam Elsheimer]] and [[Caravaggio]]. Following his return to Antwerp he set up an important studio, training students such as Anthony van Dyck, and generally exerting a strong influence on the direction of Flemish art. Most artists active in the city during the first half of the 17th century were directly influenced by Rubens.

[[File:Rubens - Prometheus Bound.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Peter Paul Rubens and Frans Snyders, ''Prometheus Bound'', 1611-12. Philadelphia Museum of Art. This painting is Flemish Baroque example of collaboration and specialization. Snyders, who specialized in animals, painted the eagle while Rubens painted the figure of Prometheus.]]

===Specializations and collaborations===
Flemish art is notable for the large amount of collaboration that took place between independent masters, which was partly related to the local tendency to specialize in a particular area. [[Frans Snyders]], for example, was an animal painter and Jan Brueghel the Elder was admired for his landscapes and paintings of plants. Both artists worked with Rubens, who often usually painted the figures, and other artists to create collaborative pieces.

[[File:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Francken the Younger, ''Preziosenwand'' (''Wall of Treasures''), 1636. Kunsthistorischesmuseum, Vienna. This type of painting was one of the distinctly Flemish innovations that developed during the early 17th century.]]

===Innovations===
Flower [[still life]] painting, which developed around 1600 by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, was partially a Flemish innovation,&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 207–212.&lt;/ref&gt; echoed in the Dutch Republic in the works of the Antwerp-born [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]] (1573–1621).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Antwerp, however, this new genre also developed into a specifically [[Catholic]] type of painting, the [[flower garland]]. Other types of paintings closely associated with Flemish Baroque include the monumental hunting scenes by Rubens and Snyders, and [[gallery paintings]] by artists such as [[Willem van Haecht]] and [[David Teniers the Younger]].

==History painting==
History painting, which includes biblical, mythological and historical subjects, was considered by seventeenth-century theoreticians as the most noble art. [[Abraham Janssens]] was an important history painter in Antwerp between 1600 and 1620, although after 1609 Rubens was the leading figure. Both Van Dyck and [[Jacob Jordaens]] were active painting monumental history scenes. Following Rubens's death, Jordaens became the most important Flemish painter. Other notable artists working in the idiom of Rubens include [[Gaspar de Crayer]], who was active in Brussels, [[Artus Wolffort]], [[Cornelis de Vos]], [[Jan Cossiers]], [[Theodoor van Thulden]], [[Abraham van Diepenbeeck]], and [[Jan Boeckhorst]]. During the second half of the century, history painters combined a local influence from Rubens with knowledge of [[classicism]] and Italian [[Baroque]] qualities. Artists in the vein include [[Erasmus Quellinus the Younger]], [[Jan van den Hoecke]], [[Pieter van Lint]], [[Cornelis Schut]], and [[Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert]]. Later in the century, many painters turned to Anthony van Dyck as a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were [[Pieter Thijs]], [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]], and artists who were also inspired by Late Baroque theatricality such as [[Theodoor Boeyermans]] and [[Jan-Erasmus Quellinus]]. Additionally, a Flemish variant of ''[[Caravaggism]]'' was expressed by [[Theodoor Rombouts]] and [[Gerard Seghers]].

==Religious painting==
Rubens is closely associated with the development of the Baroque [[altarpiece]]. Painted for the Arquebusiers' [[guild]], the ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'' [[triptych]] (1611–14; [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]])—with side wings depicting the ''[[Visitation (Christian)|Visitation]]'' and ''[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]]'', and exterior panels showing ''[[St. Christopher]] and the Hermit''—is an important reflection of Counter-Reformation ideas about art combined with Baroque naturalism, dynamism and monumentality.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger de Piles]] explains that "the painter has entered so fully into the expression of his subject that the sight of this work has the power to touch a hardened soul and cause it to experience the sufferings endured by Jesus Christ in order to redeem it."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Baroque'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles I of England.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anthony van Dyck, ''Portrait of King Charles I'', 1635. Louvre, Paris.]]

==Portraiture==
Although not predominately a portrait painter, Rubens's contributions include early works such as his ''Portrait of Brigida Spinola-Doria'' (1606, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]), paintings of his wives (the ''[[Honeysuckle Bower]]'' and ''[[Het Pelsken]]''), and numerous portraits of friends and nobility. He also exerted a strong influence on Baroque portraiture through his student [[Anthony van Dyck]]. Van Dyck became court painter for [[Charles I of England]] and was influential on subsequent English portraiture. Other successful portraitists include [[Cornelis de Vos]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]]. Although most Flemish portraiture is life-sized or monumental, [[Gonzales Coques]] and [[Gillis van Tilborch]] specialized in small-scale group portraiture.
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - The Bitter Potion - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Adriaen Brouwer, ''The Bitter Drink'', ''c''. 1630–1640. Brouwer's expressive peasants are typical of "low-life" genre painting.]]

==Genre painting==
[[Genre painting]]s, or scenes of everyday life, are common in the 17th century. Many artists follow the tradition of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] in depicting "low-life" peasant themes, although elegant "high-life" subjects featuring fashionably-dressed couples at [[Ball (dance)|balls]] or in gardens of love are also common. [[Adriaen Brouwer]], whose small paintings often show peasants fighting and drinking, was particularly influential on subsequent artists. Images of woman performing household tasks, popularized in the northern Netherlands by [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Jan Vermeer]], is not a significant subject in the south, although artists such as [[Jan Siberechts]] explored these themes to some degree.

===Bruegel tradition===
Flemish genre painting is strongly tied to the traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and was a style that continued directly into the 17th century through copies and new compositions made by his sons [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]. Many of these are [[Kermesse (festival)|kermis]] paintings and scenes of peasants taking part in other outdoor enjoyments viewed from an elevated viewpoint. Artists in the Dutch Republic, such as the Flemish-born [[David Vinckboons]] and [[Roelandt Savery]], also made similar works, popularizing rustic scenes of everyday life closely associated with Dutch and Flemish painting.

===Adriaen Brouwer and his followers===
[[Adriaen Brouwer]] (1605 or 1606–1638) typically painted small scenes of ragged peasants fighting, gaming, drinking and generally expressing exaggerated and rude behaviour. Born in the Southern Netherlands, Brouwer spent the 1620s in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Haarlem]], where he came under the influence of [[Frans Hals|Frans]] and [[Dirk Hals]] and other artists working in a loose [[painterly]] manner. Upon his return to Antwerp around 1631 or 1632 he introduced a new, influential format in which the subjects were painted as interior, instead of exterior, scenes. He also painted expressive facial studies like ''The Bitter Drink'' (illustrated), a genre called [[tronie]]s ("faces"). Brouwer's art was recognized in his own lifetime and had a powerful impact on Flemish art. Rubens owned more works by him at the time of his death than any other painter, and artists such as [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Jan van de Venne]], [[Joos van Craesbeeck]] and [[David Ryckaert III]] continued to work in a similar manner.

===Elegant company scenes===
Paintings of elegant couples in the latest fashions, often with underlying themes of love or the [[sense|five senses]], were commonly painted by [[Hieronymus Francken II|Hieronymus Francken the Younger]], [[Louis de Caullery]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[David Teniers the Younger]] and [[David Ryckaert III]]. Rubens's ''Garden of Love'' (''c''. 1634–5; [[Prado Museum]]) belongs to these traditions.

===Monumental genre scenes===
Whereas elegant company scenes and works by Brouwer and his followers were often small in scale, other artists looked to [[Caravaggio]] for inspiration and painted large-scale, theatrically inspired scenes in which musicians, cardplayers, and fortune tellers are pushed to the foreground of the composition. These paintings, like others by ''[[Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]]'', are generally illuminated by strong lighting effects. [[Adam de Coster]], [[Gerard Seghers]] and [[Theodoor Rombouts]] were the main exponents of this popular style in the early 17th century, which was popularized by Italian followers of Caravaggio like [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]] like [[Gerrit van Honthorst]]. Rombouts was also influenced by his teacher [[Abraham Janssens]], who began incorporating Caravaggesque influences into his history paintings from first decade of the 17th century

[[File:Jakob Jordaens 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob Jordaens, ''The King Drinks''. Jordeans was well known for his large paintings of moralistic genre scenes, such as this depiction of an [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] feast.]]

===Jacob Jordaens===
Jacob Jordaens, who became Antwerp's most important artist after Rubens's death in 1640, is well known for his monumental genre paintings of subjects such as ''The King Drinks'' and ''As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young''. Many of these paintings use compositional and lighting influences similar to those of the ''Caravaggisti'', while the treatment of the subjects inspired Dutch artists like [[Jan Steen]].

===Battle scenes===
Another popular type of painting invented in the [[Low Countries]] was landscapes with historical and fictional battles, as well as skirmishes and robberies. [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]] and his pupil [[Peter Snayers]] specialized in this genre, and Snayer's student [[Adam-Frans van der Meulen]] continued painting them in Antwerp, Brussels and [[Paris]] until the end of the century.
[[File:Sweerts, Michael -1649- - Wrestling Match.jpg|thumb|right|Michael Sweerts, ''Wrestling Match'', 1649. Karlsruhe, Staatliche Kunsthalle. Sweerts's style is influenced by his time in Rome, and in this painting he combines a genre subject with classical poses and Italian coloring]]

===Bamboccianti===
Following a time-honoured tradition, many northern artists travelled to Italy in the 17th century. Flemish artists such as [[Jan Miel]] (1599–1664), [[Michael Sweerts]] (1618–1664), [[Anton Goubau]] (1616–1698) and [[Willem Reuter]] (c.1642–1681) went to Rome where they worked for a period of time.  Here they were influenced by the works of the [[Genre works|genre painters]] active in Rome referred to as the [[Bamboccianti]].  The Bamboccianti comprised mostly [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Flemings|Flemish]] artists who had brought existing traditions of depicting peasant subjects from [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|sixteenth-century Netherlandish art]] with them to Italy,&lt;ref name=lev&gt;Levine, David A. (December 1988). "The Roman Limekilns of the Bamboccianti". The Art Bulletin. College Art Association. 70 (4), p. 570&lt;/ref&gt; and generally created small [[cabinet painting]]s or [[etching]]s of the [[everyday life]] of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside.&lt;ref name="haskell"&gt;Haskell, Francis (1993). "Chapter 8". Patrons and Painters: Art and Society in Baroque Italy. Yale University Press, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] who was nicknamed  "Il Bamboccio" (meaning "ugly doll" or "puppet" in Italian) had started this type of genre painting in Rome.  In general, genre painting was not well-accepted in Italy, especially by official organizations such as the [[Academy of St. Luke]].  Many of the painters were alsom members of the [[Bentvueghels]], the society of mainly Flemish and Dutch artists working in Rome. It acted as a support network for Netherlandish artists in Rome who were in need but is better-known for the "[[bohemian]]" lifestyle of its members and drunken festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, David A., "The Bentvueghels: 'Bande Académique"," in IL60: Essays Honoring Irving Lavin on his Sixtieth Birthday, ed. Marilyn Aronberg Lavin. New York: Italica Press, 1990, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape and seascape==

===Early landscape painting===
[[Gillis van Coninxloo]] was an innovative landscape painter in Antwerp in the late 16th century, who introduced a more natural view instead of the traditional [[world landscape]] popularized by earlier painters such as [[Joachim Patiner]]. He left a strong influence on northern landscape painting in general through his period in [[Amsterdam]] and as a founding member of the [[Frankenthal School]]. Forest and mountain landscapes were painted by [[Abraham Govaerts]], [[Alexander Keirincx]], [[Gijsbrecht Leytens]], [[Tobias Verhaecht]] and [[Joos de Momper]]. [[Paul Bril]] settled in Rome, where he specialized as a landscape painter decorating Roman villas and creating small [[cabinet painting]]s.

===Rubens and later painters===
[[Jan Wildens]] and [[Lucas van Uden]] painted natural landscapes inspired by Rubens, and frequently collaborated with figure painters or animal specialists to paint the backgrounds. Rubens turned to landscape painting in the 1630s, focusing on the area around his chateau, Het Steen. A well-known example is the ''Landscape with a view of 'Het Steen''' ([[National Gallery of London]]).

===Marine painting===
Small seascapes (''zeekens'') were another popular theme. Artists such as [[Bonaventura Peeters]] painted shipwrecks and atmospheric views of ships at sea, as well as imaginary views of exotic ports. [[Hendrik van Minderhout]], who was from [[Rotterdam]] and settled in Antwerp, continued this latter theme contemporaneous with developments of [[marine painting]] in the Dutch Republic.

==Architectural painting==
{{main|Architectural painting}}
Interior architectural views, usually of churches, developed out of the late sixteenth-century works of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]. Many were actual locations. [[Pieter Neeffs I]], for example, made numerous interiors of the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]]. [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]], on the other hand, followed Vredeman's precedent in painting imaginary interiors. The genre continued in the later seventeenth century by [[Anton Ghering]] and [[Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg]], but the Flemish examples do not demonstrate the same level of innovation found in the Dutch perspectives of [[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]] or [[Emanuel de Witte]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe200"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 200–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teniers documented the archduke's collection of paintings in this work while he was court painter in Brussels.]]

==Gallery and art collection painting==
Gallery paintings appeared in Antwerp around 1610, and developed—like architectural interiors—from the compositions of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest innovators of this new genre was [[Frans Francken the Younger]], who introduced the type of work known as the ''Preziosenwand'' (wall of treasures). In these, prints, paintings, sculptures, drawings, as well as collectable objects from the natural world like shells and flowers are collected together in the foreground against a wall that imitates encyclopedic [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. A similar variation of these collections of artistic wealth are the series of the [[sense|five senses]] created by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and Rubens ([[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]]). [[Willem van Haecht]] (1593–1637) developed another variation in which illustrations of actual artworks are displayed in a fantasy art gallery, while connoisseurs and art lovers admire them. Later in the century, [[David Teniers the Younger]], working in the capacity of court painter to [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], documented the archduke's collection of Italian paintings in Brussels as gallery painters as well as in a printed catalogue–the ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]''. Flemish Gallery and art collection paintings have been interpreted as a kind of visual theory of art.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 202–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Such paintings continued to be made in Antwerp by [[Gerard Thomas]] (1663–1721) and [[Balthasar van den Bossche]] (1681–1715), and foreshadow the development of the [[veduta]] in Italy and the galleries of [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]].

[[File:Jan Brueghel the Elder - Flowers in a Wooden Vessel - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jan Brueghel the Elder, ''Flower Still Life'', 1606/7. Brueghel was an innovator of the flower still life genre.]]

==Still life and animal painting==

===Flower painting===
[[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] was one of the important innovators of the floral still life around 1600.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"/&gt; These paintings, which presented immaculately observed arrangements and compositions, were imaginary creations of  flowers that bloom at different times of the years.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207" /&gt; They were popular with leading patrons and nobility across Europe, and generally have an underlying [[Vanitas]] motif. The compositions of Brueghel's paintings were also influential on later Dutch flower pieces.&lt;ref name="vlieghe208"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's sons [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Ambrosius Brueghel]] were also flower specialists. [[Osias Beert]] (1580–1624) was another flower painter at the beginning of the 17th century. His paintings share many similarities with northern contemporaries such as [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe208" /&gt;

===Garland painting===
Closely related to the flower still life is the flower garland genre of painting that was invented by Jan Brueghel in collaboration with [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Federico Borromeo]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;David Freedberg, "The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion", ''Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst'', xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The early versions of these paintings, such as the collaboration by Breughel and Rubens in Munich ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]) show the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Christ]] child surrounded by a garland of flowers. They have been interpreted as distinctly Counter Reformation images, with the flowers emphasizing the delicacy of the Virgin and Child–images of which were destroyed in large numbers during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] outbreaks of 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg (1981), ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's student, the [[Jesuit]] painter [[Daniel Seghers]], also painted many of these types of works for an international clientele.&lt;ref name="vlieghe209"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In later versions, the fleshy Madonna and Child gave way to sculptural niches and even pagan themes.
[[File:Osias Beert - Oysters 1610.jpg|thumb|right|Osias Beert, ''Still life with oysters'', ''c''. 1610. Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart. Beert's still lifes are typical of the "breakfast" type painted early in the 17th century.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;]]

===Breakfast and banquet still life===
The ''ontbijtje'', or "little breakfast", is a type of still life that was popular in both the northern and southern Netherlands showing a variety of eating and drinking vessels and foods such as cheese and bread against a neutral background. [[Osias Beert]], [[Clara Peeters]], [[Cornelis Mahu]] and [[Jacob Foppens van Es]] (''c''. 1596–1666) were all artists who made these types of painting. More elaborate are the ''pronk'', or "sumptuous", still life. This style developed in the Dutch Republic, and was brought to Antwerp by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]]. They show, on a larger scale than earlier works, complex compositions of expensive items, rare foods, and fleshy, peeling fruit. These paintings are related to [[vanitas]] and transience motifs.

[[File:Frans SNYDERS, The Pantry.JPG|thumb|left|Frans Snyders, ''The Pantry'', ''c''. 1620.]]

===Animal still life===
[[Frans Snyders]] (1579–1657) painted large still lifes focusing on dead game and animals. His compositions, along with those of his follower [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] (1599–1652). look back to the sixteenth-century paintings of [[Pieter Aertsen]] and [[Joachim Beuckelaer]], but instill that tradition with a High Baroque monumentality.&lt;ref name="vlieghe211"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 211–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent artists, [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Pieter Boel]] further elaborated on this type by including a noticeable mixture of living animals and dead game. These latter paintings are closely related to images of the hunt, which came into fashion in Flemish painting during the 17th century.

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 110.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Paul Rubens, ''Tiger and Lion Hunt'', ''c''. 1617–1618. Musée des Beaux Arts, Rennes. This painting is typical of Rubens's "exotic" hunts painted between about 1615 and 1625.]]
{{clear|left}}

==Hunting scenes==
Rubens introduced the monumental hunt to Flemish art, depicting on a large scale a close battle inspired by his study of classical antiquity and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]''. These works show both noble hunts, such as the ''Wolf and Fox Hunt'' ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]), and exotic hunts, such as the ''Lion Hunt'' ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]). [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Paul de Vos]] created similarly large paintings which are 
distinct from Rubens's works in their focus on the animals and absence of human participation.

==Cabinet painting==
Small, intricate paintings, usually depicting history and biblical subjects, were produced in great numbers in the Southern Netherlands throughout the 17th century. Many were created by anonymous artists, however artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Hendrik van Balen]], [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Hendrik de Clerck]] were all successful [[cabinet painting|cabinet painters]] during the first half of the 17th century. These artists, as well as followers of [[Adam Elsheimer]] like [[David Teniers the Elder]], remained partly shaped by continued mannerist stylistic tendencies. However, Rubens influenced a number of later artists who incorporated his Baroque style into the small context of these works. Among them are [[Frans Wouters]], [[Jan Thomas van Ieperen]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[Pieter van Lint]], and [[Willem van Herp]]. These small paintings were traded widely throughout Europe, and by way of Spain to [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 105–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady '''Harriet Anne (Hooker) Thiselton-Dyer''' (1854–1945) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[botanical illustrator]].

[[File:Thiselton-Dyer Jasminum-didymum-1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''[[Jasminum didymum]]'' by Harriet Anne Thiselton-Dyer for ''Curtis's Botanical Magazine'', 1878.]]

==Life and career==
Harriet Anne Hooker was born in 1854 to the botanist and explorer [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[Frances Harriet Henslow]], who was the daughter of botanist and Cambridge University professor [[John Stevens Henslow]]. In 1877 she married the botanist [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer]] (later knighted), with whom she had a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name=scibio/&gt;

Thiselton-Dyer belonged to a generation of English women who transformed their interest in botany into professional careers.&lt;ref name=gaze/&gt; She studied with the noted botanical illustrator [[Walter Hood Fitch]], who was the lead artist for ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''. After Fitch resigned from the magazine in 1877 following a dispute with her father—for whom Fitch had been preparing illustrations for several books—Thiselton-Dyer stepped in.&lt;ref name=uw/&gt;&lt;ref name=index/&gt; She rendered almost 100 illustrations for publication during the period 1878–1880, helping to keep the magazine viable until [[Matilda Smith]] took over as lead illustrator.&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt;

In 1894–95, Thiselton-Dyer painted some 550 copies of Brazilian botanist [[João Barbosa Rodrigues]]'s orchid paintings, which had been lent to her by the botanist [[Alfred Cogniaux]], who was using some of them to illustrate a work on Brazilian flora.&lt;ref name=mori/&gt; Unfortunately, the original drawings disappeared in Brazil sometime after Rodrigues's death and are now lost, making Thiselton-Dyer's copies—housed at Kew Gardens—a uniquely valuable resource on Rodrigues's work. In 1996, some of these copies were published to accompany an article on Rodrigues that appeared, fittingly enough, in ''Curtis's Botanical Magazine''.&lt;ref name=sprunger/&gt;

Thiselton-Dyer was also known as an accomplished [[gardening|gardener]].&lt;ref name=kramer2/&gt; In 1905 the Thiselton-Dyers moved to the Cotswolds. When her husband died in 1928, Harriet moved to Devonshire, where she died in 1945.&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt;

In 2013, Thiselton-Dyer's work was included in the exhibition "The Feminine Perspective: Women Artists and Illustrators" at the Chicago Botanic Garden, alongside work by [[Henriette Vincent]], [[Ellen Robbins]], and others.&lt;ref name=rise/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6008">[[Image:Class-winkleman.jpg|thumb|400px|right|#class at Winkleman Gallery]]

'''''#alionart69''''' was a month-long series of events at Winkleman Gallery in [[New York City|New York]] that took place between February 20 to March 20, 2010 organized by artists [[William Powhida]] and [[Jennifer Dalton]]. The exhibition combined social media and networking with a physical gallery space. 

Edward Winkleman, owner of Winkleman Gallery, suggested in an interview with art critic [[Brian Sherwin]] for FineArtViews that #class would have failed to have the same impact if the events had been displayed exclusively online. Winkleman implied that the meshing between online social media and a brick &amp; mortar gallery space conveyed the "real intent" of the artists’ behind #class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faso.com/fineartviews/28794/fineartviews-interview-edward-winkleman-gallery-owner-curator-author-and-art-blogger "FineArtsViews Interview: Edward Winkleman -- Gallery Owner, Curator, Author and Art Blogger"], www.faso.com/fineartviews . Retrieved 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The #class exhibition coincided with the opening of a controversial exhibition at the [[New Museum]] showcasing artwork owned by longtime trustee [[Dakis Joannou]], a prolific collector of works by artists like [[Kiki Smith]], [[Kara Walker]] and [[Jeff Koons]]. Jen Dalton described the show as “a sort of a [[think tank]] or classroom. We want to facilitate a conversation about where the [[art world]] is and class in the art world.”&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Candace. [https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/01/01/class-exhibit-challenges-new-museum-show/ “#class Exhibit Challenges New Museum Show”]. Wall Street Journal. January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''#alion69'' invited guest artists, [[art critic|critics]], academics, [[art dealer|dealers]], [[art collector|collectors]] and anyone else who would like to participate to examine the way art is made and seen in our culture and to identify and propose alternatives and/or reforms to the current market system. The name "#class" was taken from the practice on [[Twitter]] of placing a "#" known as a [[hash tag]] to mark a tweet as part of a discussion. The name of the exhibition references the [[social media]] phenomenon that has been called [[crowdsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, Erin.

The artists produced work during the exhibition that responded to the information, events and discussions that took place. The work was not priced in the usual commercial manner, premised on 'what the market will bear' based on their past work and reputations. Instead, the artists offered suggested guidelines for appropriate prices, such as one day of the buyer's income from his or her job, 0.1% of his or her net worth, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://winkleman.com/exhibition/view/1848 Winkleman Gallery Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4452">[[File:Jugyoku - Crab - Walters 71851 - Top.jpg|thumb|280px|19th-century Japanese belt ornament in hornbill ivory, showing natural [[preen gland]] colouring]]
'''Hornbill ivory''' (also called "golden jade") is a precious ornamental material derived from the [[helmeted hornbill]] (''Buceros vigil''), a large bird of the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Borneo]].

Many [[hornbill]] species have "casques", decorative growths on the upper mandible of the bill. In most, the casque has a spongy structure, but in the helmeted hornbill it is solid [[keratin]]. This material, hornbill ivory, has a texture suggesting [[ivory]] but is softer. As it grows it is golden yellow, but the bird rubs its casque on its [[Uropygial gland|preen gland]], whose oily secretion tints the surface of the casque bright red.

Native peoples in the helmeted hornbill's range, such as the [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] and [[Kelabit people|Kelabit]], have long carved the casques. In Malaysia, hornbill-ivory rings were said to change colour when near poisonous food.&lt;ref name="ivoryhound.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ivoryhound.com/articles_hornbill_ivory.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307171936/http://www.ivoryhound.com/articles_hornbill_ivory.htm |archivedate=2005-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[China|Chinese]] encountered the material in the 14th century and it soon became an important trade item at [[Brunei]]. According to [[Tom Harrisson]], writing in the first (1960) edition of ''The Birds of Borneo'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is likely that the casques were mainly exported raw, and worked with a heat treatment and pressing - of which no detailed description survives - in China, to preserve and heighten the lovely deep golden and surface red patina of the fresh ivory.  The Chinese probably got the idea of using ''ho-ting'' from the Dayaks, then improved the technique at their end.  The uses of hornbill casques in Borneo are various and frequently effective; we will discuss those presently.  While the Borneo usages persist to this day, all trace of the art of the Chinese carver seems to have vanished.  Very little has survived of a remarkable craft which undoubtedly paid for many of the old jars, plates, and beads still decorating the longhouses or wives of better-off Bornean pagans many generations later.&lt;ref&gt;Harrisson (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Ming dynasty]], the Chinese valued hornbill ivory above true [[ivory]] or [[jade]]. They carved the casques, or made them into sheets, coloured them with the secretion of the preen gland, and made them into [[belt buckle]]s for high officials. They called hornbill ivory ''hèdǐng'' ([[Wade–Giles]] ''ho-ting''), which is said to be their approximation of an indigenous name&lt;ref name="ivoryhound.com"/&gt; (but means "crane head", and thus many Chinese thought the substance came from a [[crane (bird)|crane]] rather than a hornbill). The [[Japan]]ese also carved imported hornbill ivory into such objects as ''[[netsuke]]''.

By the early 20th century, the helmeted hornbill became rare because it was slaughtered for its casque. Now legal trade in hornbill ivory is limited to certified antiques, and hornbill-ivory carvings are more valuable than those of any true ivory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acstones.com/gemofmonth/2005/gemofmonth.03.05.html|title=gemofmonth.html|work=acstones.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julius Stockfleth'''  (January 29, 1857 – 1935) was a German-born painter of landscapes and [[Marine art|marine subjects]]. His images of the city of [[Galveston, Texas]], constitute a valuable record of the town between 1885 and 1907, especially its devastation by the [[1900 Galveston hurricane|hurricane of 1900]].

==Biography==
Julius Stockfleth was born in [[Wyk auf Föhr]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany. He was the son of  Louise (Hansen) Stockfleth and Friedrich August Stockfleth, a sailor and ship's carpenter. After an apprenticeship with a local painter, he emigrated to the United States in 1883, settling in Galveston in 1885.&lt;ref name=tsha/&gt; 

During the two decades that Stockfleth lived in Galveston, he frequently painted the city's docks, its harbor, and its ships. He found a good market for this work among the ships' crews. The 1900 hurricane killed a dozen members of his extended family, and as a way to cope with the tragedy he undertook a series of paintings that documented the city during the hurricane and its subsequent rebuilding.&lt;ref name=tsha/&gt;&lt;ref name=ratcliffe/&gt; His are the only known contemporary paintings of the Galveston hurricane.&lt;ref name=ratcliffe/&gt; Altogether, Stockfleth left some 100 paintings of Texas subjects painted in a [[Naïve art|naïve realist]] style.&lt;ref name=ratcliffe/&gt;

He returned to Germany in 1907, living in Wyk until his death and painting local scenes.&lt;ref name=tsha/&gt;

Some of his work is in the collection of the [[Rosenberg Library]].&lt;ref name=tsha/&gt;

===One: Hache===
Published in 2008

After years of incessant fighting, the war between humanity and the High Beasts is brought to an end after the humans begin using [[firearms]], forcing the comparatively primitive High Beasts to declare a truce. It is decided that an interspecific marriage be formed between Aube, the daughter of the human nobleman Arcan, and Loup-de-Feu, the son of the Beast Lord Loup-de-Traille. Aube is not pleased with the arrangement, believing that the product of such a union would be a [[blasphemy]]. When the time comes to consummate the marriage, Aube's brother Saliat assassinates Loup-de-Feu, and escapes with his sister while the High Beasts declare the truce null. After the High Beasts indulge in a slaughter, Arcan is approached by Griffe-Tout, a lynx who offers to give him information on his daughter on the condition that he sacrifice a pound of his own flesh to him. He reveals that Saliat has been killed by the High Beasts, while Aube escaped to the Wood of Virgins, an area from only [[virgin]]s can come out alive.
[[Image:Les Betes Haute.jpg|thumb|The High-Beasts advance against human forces]]
Years later, the war between the two races has reached a [[stalemate]], with neither side gaining advantage over the other. Though the humans are technologically superior, the High Beasts are physically stronger, more numerous, and have faster growth rates, thus allowing troops to be replenished quicker. In order to break the stalemate, the humans send an envoy, Hugo, to find the banished Lord Clam, who is a famed wolf killer. Under similar orders from his own superior officer, Loup-de-Traille reluctantly accepts to find his eldest and most skilled son, Loup-Gris whom he previously disowned for having married a fox. Loup-de-Traille discovers that his son now has two hybrid children, and refuses to involve himself in the war. Suspecting that his son's wife Lady Goupil has softened him, Loup-de-Traille leaves heavy hearted. Along the way, he finds a band of human bandits attacking a group of foxes. Loup-de-Traille intervenes, but is decapitated by the bandit leader. His body is found by Griffe-Tout and his band of lynxes, and is taken to his son, who decides to form an alliance of High and Low Beasts in order to defeat the human forces. Meanwhile, Hugo discovers a delirious human soldier covered in plant-like growths. Hugo takes him to a monastery, where it is discovered that he found Aube in the Wood of Virgins. The abbot of the monastery reveals himself to be the disgraced Arcan, who offers to aide in the war effort on condition that his daughter be found and returned to him. Hugo crosses a cursed swamp filled inhabited by tree spirits, and finds Clam in a Church, taking a sacrament. The two depart to the Wood of Virgins.

|[[Adamant]] / Adamantine
|Greek mythology
|As a noun, ''adamant'' has long been used to designate any impenetrably or unyieldingly hard substance and, formerly, a legendary stone/rock or mineral of impenetrable hardness and with many other properties, often identified with [[diamond]] or [[lodestone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0007420#m_en_gb0007420 "adamant - definition of adamant"]. Oxforddictionaries.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word is used both as a noun and an adjective and is derived from the Latin: ''adamans'', ''adamantem'' [accusative] referring to the property of impregnable, diamondlike hardness, or to describe a very firm/resolute position, itself from the Greek word ''adamastos'' meaning untameable. Diamond is also derived from the same word. ''Adamant'' and the literary form ''adamantine'' (utilising the suffix -ine meaning 'of the nature of' or 'made of') occur in many works. In mythology Kronos was said to have used an adamantine sickle to castrate his father Uranus; in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', Prometheus is bound to the rocks "in adamantine bonds infrangible",&lt;ref&gt;Great Books of the Western World Vol. 4 pg 40&lt;/ref&gt; in Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' (in which the gates of [[Tartarus]] are protected by columns of solid adamantine)  and in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', in which adamant and adamantine are mentioned eight times to describe the gates of hell, Satan's shield, fallen angel's armour and Satan's chains. In fiction Adamant is referred to in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy, and the games ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[RuneScape]]'' and many more besides. Adamantine is referred to in the film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (as "adamantine steel"), in many books such as [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Mathilda (novella)|Mathilda]]'', and [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', as well as many games including ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. The word adamant is used as the basis for other fictional materials such as Adamantium (see below), Adamantite (see below), Adamantle (from [[the Sims]]), and [[Adiamante]] (from [[L. E. Modesitt Jr.]]'s [[Adiamante|1996 novel of the same name]]).
|-
|Adamantite
|Numerous works
|A metal ore that appears in a number of fictional universes. In ''Final Fantasy'' it is a material used to create armour, its source being from another world and its properties including being able to contain great amounts of energy. In ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', it is an uncommon ore used to produce weapons and armour of uncommon, rare and epic grade. In the ''Dark Elf'' book series by Salvatore set in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' universe it is used to create drow weaponry. It is also used for armour in ''[[The Elder Scrolls III]]'', and in the game ''[[Terraria]]'' it is a red ore used to produce armour and other items besides. The word is an extension of the English noun and adjective ''[[adamant]]'' (see entry above) adding the suffix '-ite' which is often used to form the names of minerals.
|-
|[[Adamantium]]
|[[Marvel Comics]]
|A fictional metal alloy that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]], first appearing in Marvel Comics' ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #66 (July 1969),  by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artists [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] and [[Syd Shores]]. Although it is first presented as part of the character [[Ultron]]'s outer shell,&lt;ref name="Back38"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|pages= 23–30|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is best known as the substance bonded to the character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s skeleton and claws.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Packer MD, ''Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks'', (ABC-CLIO), 2009, {{ISBN|0313355371}}, 9780313355370, p238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marco Arnaudo (translated by Jamie Richards), ''The Myth of the Superhero'', (JHU Press), 2013, {{ISBN|1421409534}}, 9781421409535, p19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gail E. Hawisher, Cynthia L. Selfe, ''Literacy, technology, and society: confronting the issues'', (Prentice Hall), 1997, p100&lt;/ref&gt; The defining quality of adamantium is its practical indestructibility. Adamantium is not depicted as being a naturally occurring metal but rather as having been inadvertently invented by the fictional American metallurgist [[Dr. Myron MacLain]] in an attempt to recreate his prior discovery, a unique alloy of steel and [[vibranium]]. Despite its potential applications in armament and armature, adamantium is rarely used due to its high cost and inability to be reshaped. Other forms of adamantium of varying durability are mentioned within the Marvel Universe, including Secondary Adamantium, Adamantium Beta and Carbonadium.&lt;ref&gt;David Bell, Barbara M. Kennedy (ed), ''The Cybercultures Reader'', (Psychology Press), 2000, {{ISBN|0415183790}}, 9780415183796, p114&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from [[Ultron]]'s outer shell and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s skeleton and claws, Adamantium is associated with a number of other characters and implements including, but not limited to, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s spinal column, certain iterations of [[Captain America]]'s shield&lt;ref&gt;Seth Godin, ''The Encyclopedia of Fictional People: The Most Important Characters of the 20th Century'' , (Boulevard Books), 1996, {{ISBN|1572970731}}, 9781572970731, p4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lady Deathstrike]]'s skeleton and talons. The word is an extension of the English noun and adjective ''[[adamant]]'' (see entry above) adding the Neo-Latin '-ium' to denote a metallic name. Adamantium is also used in the [[Games Workshop]] universe of ''[[Warhammer 40000]]'' and the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Maplestory]]''.

|[[Administratium]]
|Scientific [[in-joke]]
|First referenced in a 1989 issue of ''The Physics Teacher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/administ.htm |title=Administratium. New chemical Element Discovered |first=William |last=DeBuvitz |publisher= The Physics Teacher |date=January 1989 |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was apparently discovered by the fictional Thomas Kyle, who was awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for [[physics]] for his discovery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V111/N40/ignobe.40n.html |title=Ig Nobel Prizes Debut |publisher=The Tech |first=Alice |last=Gilchrist |issue=40 |volume=111 |date=October 4, 1991 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a parody on [[bureaucracy]] of [[academia|scientific establishments]] and on descriptions of newly discovered [[chemical element]]s.
|-
|[[Administrontium]]
|Scientific [[in-joke]]
|Similar to [[Administratium]] and a variation of the joke. It was referenced in a 1993 print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebeltz.net/resume/jir.html |title=Physics Non-Department First to Photograph New Element. |first=Ellin |last=Beltz |publisher=NEIU Independent |date=June 21, 1993 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|- id="Table row aether"
|Aether
|''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''
|A powerful substance in the MtG multiverse that is found on every plane, but abundant on the plane of Kaladesh. It is part of the "aethercycle", similar to the [[water cycle]], and can be used to power everything from bikes to [[colossus (Magic: The Gathering)|colossus]]es. That is, after it is purified using the new distillation process which separates pure aether and its volatile counterpart, aetherflux.
In the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV, Aether is one of the principle elements of life and magic in the world.
|-
|Arsonium
|[[I Expect You to Die]]
|A green liquid with the symbol Ar and the atomic number 7 that makes a compound that is corrosive to copper when mixed with Galine and Sanite, and a compound that produces clouds when exposed to air when mixed with Regalite.
|- 
|Atium
|''[[Mistborn series|Mistborn]]'' book series
|A metal that forms the body and power of the [[Cosmere|shard]] Ruin. If an Allomancer burns the metal, it allows the user to see a few seconds into the future as a ghostly image overlaid on the present. This allows the user to gain a significant advantage in combat, as it allow them to know every move their opponent will make. This is cancelled out if the opponent burns atium or [[electrum]] themselves, as it causes a feedback loop and causes the user to see a mess of possible futures. It is extremely valuable in the Final Empire, as it is both very rare and hoarded by the Lord Ruler. The only place it is found is in the pits of Hathsin, where small nuggets are formed in geodes mined by slaves. Using allomany near the crystals that form the geodes destroys them. When used by a Feruchemist, it allows them to store age and, if compounded, can result in a complete stop of ageing. Its name comes from the holder of the shard, Ati. in the [[Wax and Wayne]] era, no samples exist and it is referred to as 'the lost metal'. It forms the allow Malatium, also known as the eleventh metal, a metal that allows the user to see past versions of other people. A misting that burns atium is known as a seer. Hemalurgic effects are unknown.
|-
|Australium
|''[[Team Fortress 2]]''
|An extremely valuable element appearing in ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]. In-game, it appears as a special type of weapon, and as the fuel for the rocket in the map SD_Doomsday in the Special Delivery game mode. In the bonus comics featured on the Team Fortress website, their role is fleshed out more; The Life-Extending machines used by The Administrator, Blutarch, Redmond, and Gray Mann are powered by Australium, and a large part of the plot revolves around hiding the vast stores of Australium &lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamfortress.com/catchup/&lt;/ref&gt; Their role in the story is that the material, found in [[Australia]], hence the name Australium, makes one smarter over time, but at the cost of increasing 'manliness and beard levels' in those who use it. As mentioned above, the name comes from the country of Australia and the Neo-Latin '-ium' used to denote a metallic name.
|-
|{{anchor|bavarium}}Bavarium
|''[[Just Cause 3]]''
|Discovered by Medici's tyrannical ruler Sebastiano Di Ravello in the late 1980s, Bavarium is referred to as a "supermineral" in reference to its near-infinite potential. Exclusive to Medici, Bavarium is at the core of much of the country's experimental weaponry and equipment- which, as of the ''Bavarium Sea Heist'' DLC, includes gravitational manipulators and personal force fields -as well as a major export; Di Ravello is able to use it as a bargaining chip when dealing with the Agency. In-game, Bavarium- in its refined form, at least -is shown to be highly volatile and prone to large, violent explosions- a small Bavarium-based charge is capable of instantly destroying all but the largest of the game's Chaos Objects.
|-
|{{anchor|bolognium|bolonium}}Bolognium / Bolonium
|Various sources
|A metallic element with variable properties; a substitute for any unspecified substance or element; or in science fiction writing, a substance or process invented to circumvent explanation or impossibility.  A humorous story from 1926 about the development of alloys for special purposes, describes Bolognium as a metallic element with properties similar to ''Gafnium'', with which it forms alloys impervious to attacks by mice.&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society for Steel Treating'', vol. 9 (1926), p. 663.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolognium may also refer to any unspecified substance or element: "if not oil then beryllium, and if not beryllium then bolognium",&lt;ref&gt;"Up from the Magma and Back Again with Paul Hiebert", in ''Manitoba Arts Review'' (1948), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; "don't worry about whether it is mercury or lead or cadmium or 'bolognium'."&lt;ref&gt;''Mercury in the Marine Environment: Workshop Proceedings, 29 November to 1 December 1988, Sheraton Anchorage Hotel, Anchorage, Alaska'', United States Minerals Management Service (1989) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noted science fiction writer [[David Gerrold]] attributes the use of the term in science fiction writing to [[Larry Niven]], the author of ''[[Ringworld]]'', who used it to describe imaginary materials or processes capable of explaining properties unachievable through known or scientifically-postulated means.  In ''Worlds of Wonder'', Gerrold describes two examples from ''Ringworld'': "scrith", a substance strong enough to be used for the construction of a ring one hundred and eighty million miles in diameter, and a character deliberately bred for the property of luck.  Gerrold refers to bolognium as "technobabble", and cautions writers against overusing it, or using it carelessly, as doing so undermines the illusion of reality upon which good science fiction relies.&lt;ref&gt;David Gerrold, ''Worlds of Wonder: How to Write Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy'', Writer's Digest Books (2001), pp. 59, 72 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term itself has appeared in episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which ''Bolognium'', [[symbol (chemistry)|atomic symbol]] ''Bo'', appears in the place of [[Molybdenum]], [[atomic number]] 42, on promotional copies of the [[periodic table]] produced by [[Oscar Mayer]] (its [[atomic weight]] is "delicious" or "snacktacular"),&lt;ref&gt;''The Simpsons'', "Lisa Gets an 'A'" (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Futurama]]'', where Cubert Farnsworth exclaims, "your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolognium!"&lt;ref&gt;''Futurama'', "A Clone of My Own" (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although most references to Bolognium are intentionally humorous, in ''Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars'', Greg Cox refers to the "bolognium shielding" of [[Klingon]] warp nacelles.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Cox, ''Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh'', volume two, Simon &amp; Schuster (2002), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Bombastium
|Disney&lt;ref&gt;Carl Barks, ''Walt Disney’s Uncle Scrooge: A Cold Bargain – Gladstone Comic Album'' #24, (Gladstone) {{ISBN|0-944599-24-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Originally appearing in Uncle Scrooge #17 (1957) by Carl Barks, Bombastium is stated to be the rarest element in the world. Even though it is very coveted, its usage potential is not entirely known. One characteristic is that it tastes different every time one tries it, and scientists eventually discovered that one atom of bombastium dropped into a barrel of water becomes one barrel of ice cream: a different flavor of ice cream each time. To avoid evaporation, bombastium must be kept frozen.&lt;ref name="Andrae"/&gt; In the story, when this totally new element was discovered Scrooge tries to secure the entire supply – a ball of “Bombastium” approximately the size of a large turnip. Terrified that his acquisition will melt before he can make a profit, Scrooge drags Donald Duck and his nephews on a voyage to the South Pole to safeguard his investment, but he has not reckoned on the ruthless determination of the Brutopian agents he outbid to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsreview.co.uk/nowreadthis/2010/03/07/walt-disney%E2%80%99s-uncle-scrooge-a-cold-bargain-gladstone-comic-album-24/  www.comicsreview.co.uk - Walt Disney’s Uncle Scrooge: A Cold Bargain]&lt;/ref&gt; Bombastium represents a play on words (bomb and bombastic) that negotiates Cold War hysteria surrounding the arms race and the threat of Armageddon provoked by the development of the H-bomb.&lt;ref name="Andrae"&gt;Tom Andrae, ''Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity'', p216, (Univ. Press of Mississippi), 2006, {{ISBN|1578068584}}, 9781578068586&lt;/ref&gt; Barks's tale is also grounded in fears. The substance is later used in the ''[[Duck Tales]]'' series.
|-
|[[Administratium|Bureaucratium]]
|Scientific [[in-joke]]
|Similar to [[Administratium]] and variation of the joke. In this version of the joke, Bureaucratium is an element which has a negative [[half-life]], becoming more massive and sluggish as time goes by.

|Byzanium is a fictional element within the book ''Raise the Titanic!'' and its [[Raise the Titanic (film)|film adaptation]], which serves as a main focus of the story arc. It is a powerful radioactive material sought after by both the Americans and Russians for use as either an energy source for a missile defense system or an atomic superbomb. The largest known natural source of Byzanium was on the island of [[Novaya Zemlya]], which was mined in the early 20th century and supposedly taken aboard the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] during her first and only voyage.

|In the anime series ''RWBY'', Dust is a naturally occurring, crystalline energy source found in the world of Remnant that can be activated by the Aura of Humans and Faunus. This material comes in a variety of types, each with different properties such as fire, ice, wind, gravity, etc. While there are four main kinds, these can be blended naturally or artificially to create new kinds. While crystalline dust is stable enough to remain out in the open, powdered Dust is highly volatile, and must be stored in special containers for safety. Dust has a variety of uses, including acting as a power source for machinery such as airships and robots. Dust may also be used for combat in the form of dust-filled bullets, as powder placed inside weapons and clothing, or in its crystalline form for raw power. Dust will stop functioning if it is taken outside of the atmosphere of Remnant, meaning it may not be used for space travel. In the series, most of Remnant's supply of this material comes from the Schnee Dust Company, which mines, purifies, and exports the material throughout the world.

Among the unusual properties of Nth metal is the ability to negate [[gravity]], allowing a person wearing an object made of Nth metal, such as a [[belt (clothing)|belt]], to [[flight|fly]]. In addition, Nth metal also protects the wearer from the elements and speeds the healing of wounds,&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' (vol. 4) #21&lt;/ref&gt; increases their strength, and protects them from extremes in temperature. It has many other properties that have yet to be revealed in full.  It has been implied that the apparently "magical" abilities of the Thanagarian [[supervillain]], [[Onimar Synn]], all stem from his unique mastery of the properties of Nth metal.  These powers are augmented to a god-like level during the [[Rann-Thanagar War]] when he builds himself an artificial body made of the substance.

In ancient [[Egypt]] a Thanagarian [[starship|spaceship]] made of Nth metal crash-landed, only to be discovered by Prince Khufu and his betrothed, Chay-ara. Constant exposure to Nth metal forced Khufu and Chay-ara into a cycle of [[reincarnation]]. In the 20th century, they were incarnated as [[Carter Hall (comics)|Carter Hall]] and Shiera Saunders, the original Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]]. As Hawkman and Hawkgirl, they wore Nth metal belts, made with the help of the Thanagarian [[Paran Katar]], father of Katar Hol, when he was visiting Earth.

Many years later, Carter and Shiera's son, [[Doctor Fate|Hector Hall]], made a suit of [[armor]] of Nth metal and took the name [[Silver Scarab]] as a founding member of [[Infinity Inc.]] The suit provided him with protection from attacks, let him lift great weights, and allowed him to fly and project solar energy blasts.

The current Hawkman and [[Hawkgirl]] continue to wear Nth metal.

Much later in the DC timeline, members of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]] wear "flight rings" made of an alloy of Nth metal called valorium.

The mercenary [[Deathstroke]] wears armor composed of Nth metal.

|Quadium
|''[[The Mouse That Roared]]'' by [[Leonard Wibberley]]
|Also known as H4, quadium is a particle that is so highly unstable as to make it effectively non-existent, although attempts have been made to isolate it. A fictional stable version of this isotope played a prominent role in the 1955 satirical novel ''The Mouse That Roared''.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Close, ''Half Life'', (Oneworld Publications), 2015, {{ISBN|1780745826}}, 9781780745824&lt;/ref&gt; In that novel it is a fissionable element with an explosive potential many times greater than plutonium. Quadium is discovered by Dr. Kokintz who uses it to build the "Q-Bomb", a doomsday device capable of destroying all life on earth. A madcap series of events results in the Q-Bomb being captured by the anachronisticly medieval army of the Duchy of Grand Fenwick turning this tiny and technologically backward European country into the most powerful nation on Earth. Grand Fenwick then uses the threat of the Q-Bomb to force the nuclear powers to accept a nuclear disarmament agreement. In the end Dr. Kokintz discovers the Q-Bomb is actually a dud, but decides it is in the best interest of humanity to keep this fact a secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mouse That Roared |last=Wibberley |first=Leonard Patrick O'Connor |year=1955 |publisher=Little Brown &amp; Co |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-316-93872-3 |oclc=1016437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;Pm
|[[Promethium]]
|''[[DC Comics]]''
|An artificial element from the [[DC Universe]], created by Dayton Industries. Promethium was named after the eponymous titan of Greek myth [[Prometheus]], for his deed of giving mankind fire and knowledge erstwhile being chained to a rock with eagles picking at his innards for all eternity after. The company owner and its creator [[Mento (comics)|Steve Dayton]], theorized the potential applications for Promethium, both for good and ill, were limitless.&lt;ref&gt;''New Teen Titans'' Vol. 1 #9&lt;/ref&gt;

Promethium is a metal alloy that comes in two quite different isotopes, "depleted" and "volatile" promethium. Promethium's properties make it highly coveted by various public and clandestine interests. Key among which is that it's virtually indestructible with self restorative properties. The mercenary [[Deathstroke]], for example, uses a suit of the volatile variety which could mend itself after being damaged.&lt;ref&gt;''New Teen Titans'' Vol. 1 #10&lt;/ref&gt; Both young heroes [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]]'s bionic chassis and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]]'s body armor were made of the depleted variety.

Dayton believed Promethium alloys could make most anything coated in them impervious to destruction or abrasion. Even theorizing that it could impart its matter regenerative abilities to organic anatomy down the line of its testing.

'''Depleted promethium'''
The most common isotope of promethium was the inert element that was easier to sell and managed on a grander scale. By itself it was extremely durable, [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond]] once commented even Superman couldn't break it even with his strength.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA'' #73 (Dec. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; When Depleted Promethium is alloyed with other dense metals such as Kevlar or molybdenum-steel, it forms a near-invulnerable metal polymer.

The supervillain [[Prometheus (DC Comics)#Curt Calhoun|Prometheus]] gained his powers after getting dunked in a solution of titanium/vanadium alloy infused with promethium while working at Kord Industries as a foremen in its smelting plant. Retaining a metallic epidermal layer with the ability to heat up his body several degrees Celsius able to burn at a touch.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Beetle'' Vol. 6 #3 (Aug. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volatile promethium'''
The rarest manifest of Promethium is its radioactive isotope, capable of absorbing and generating its own energy in near limitless quantities. Useful as a self-sustaining power source for many gadgets and facilities when properly utilized. The only drawback being that "volatile promethium" has dangerous mutagenic properties which can either be used to mutate living beings into hideous monstrosities or trigger the latent metagene resting within the DNA of others.

The latter is proven true when due to Deathstroke the Terminator's use of promethium forged weaponry and equipment; e.i. his armor, sword and possibly his gun staff made from volatile promethium. Which he can use these without worry due to his healing factor, had triggered latent superpower capabilities within his children [[Rose Wilson|Rose]] and [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #10 (Mar. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Its use and proliferation also had a hand in creating the super-villain team known as [[Hybrid (DC Comics)|The Hybrid]], as each of them gained their powers from infusions of the irradiated material.&lt;ref&gt;''New Teen Titans'' Vol. 2 #24 (Oct. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">The  term '''multilingual titling''' defines, in the field of [[titling]] for the performing arts (musical theatre, drama, audiovisual productions), the chance for the audience to follow more than one linguistic option.

==History==
In the audiovisual field, multilingual titling was made possible by the introduction of [[DVD]] (1996) &lt;ref name="DVD first appearance (1996)"&gt;DVD was first launched on the market by [[Warner Home Video]] both in the USA (1996) and in Europe (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; in which an integrated data-base gives access to several language channels dedicated to titling.&lt;br /&gt;
In the live performing arts, multilingual options (with possibility of individual choice) were introduced in 1998 at [[Santa Fe Opera]] by mean of custom individual displays set mainly on the back of the seats, as in airplanes.&lt;ref name=" set mainly on the back of the seats, as in the airplanes "&gt;This device, lately adopted by other international theatres, has been realized by [[Figaro Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The introduction, at the end of the 1900s, of Web 2.0 and of the new mobile device technologies caused deep changes also in this field. &lt;br /&gt;
In Europe, in 2011, a significant innovation was provided by the [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]] Theatre in Florence, which started the testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices,&lt;ref name="testing of a new multilingual transmission system for mobile consumer devices "&gt;OperaVoice devised the software.&lt;/ref&gt; that can be integrated to monolingual [[surtitles]].&lt;br /&gt;
In the same year, another multilingual software for mobile consumer devices was developed, as an alternative to the use of [[subtitles]] in cinemas and, the following year (2012), a new head-mounted display system (multimedia glasses) was introduced, serving the same function.&lt;ref name="starts off a new head mounted display system (multimedia glasses) which serves the same function"&gt;Both products (app and glasses) are by MovieReading.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011-2012, the Royal Opera House Muscat carried out the most advanced multilingual custom display system to date, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel.&lt;ref name="multilingual custom display system nowadays, interactive and integrated to surtitles screened on a central LED panel"&gt;A [[Radio Marconi]] project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other solutions==
The simultaneous presentation of two languages is quite unusual within the more traditional surtitling system, which is used in most cases with monolingual function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7904">The '''National Association of Schools of Music''' ('''NASM''') is an association of post-secondary [[music school]]s in the United States and the principal U.S. [[educational accreditation|accreditor]] for [[higher education]] in music.  It was founded on October 20, 1924, and is based in Reston, [[Virginia]]. Accreditation commenced in 1939.

== Accreditation ==
NASM is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] as a programmatic accreditation organization for institutions offering degree and non-degree educational programs in music and music-related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp Directory of Programmatic Accrediting Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923101401/http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp |date=2014-09-23 }}, Council for Higher Education Accreditation, accessed December 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/2009_2010_Directory_of_CHEA_Recognized_Organizations.pdf 2009-2010 Directory of CHEA-Recognized Organizations], Council for Higher Education Accreditation, accessed December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It currently has approximately 625 accredited institutional members, including specialty schools of music, conservatories, and universities offering music programs.

== History ==
Leaders from six music schools met on June 10, 1924, to organize the inaugural convention of the "National Association of Schools of Music and Allied Arts" to be held on October 20, 1924, in Pittsburgh.  The founding leaders were:

# Burnet Corwin Tuthill (1888–1982), [[Cincinnati Conservatory of Music]]
# [[John James Hattstaedt]] (1851–1931), [[American Conservatory of Music]] (1886–1991)
# Kenneth McPherson Bradley (1872–1954), [[Bush Conservatory of Music]], which merged in 1932 with [[The Chicago Conservatory College]] under duress of the [[Great Depression]]
# Arthur Wright Mason (1866–1955), Louisville Conservatory of Music, which merged in 1932 with the [[University of Louisville]] under duress of the [[Great Depression]]
# Charles Newell Boyd (1875–1937), Pittsburgh Musical Institute, which merged in 1963 with the [[University of Pittsburgh]]
# [[Edwin John Stringham]] (1890–1974), Wolcott Conservatory of Music, founded in 1920 and in 1925 was reorganized and renamed as the Denver College of Music

The attendees at the first NASM Convention of October 20, 1924, decided to officially form the "National Association of Schools of Music and Allied Arts."  The accreditation aspect of NASM, though, did not launch until about 1929.  The charter members currently in existence are:

* [[The Music Conservatory of Chicago College of Performing Arts]]
* [[Cleveland Institute of Music]]
* [[Converse College]], [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]
* [[Eastman School of Music]], [[University of Rochester]]
* [[New England Conservatory of Music]], Boston

* [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], [[Stockton, California]]
* [[University of Southern California]]

* [[Yale University]]

NASM's founding officers were Kenneth M. Bradley, President; Burnet C. Tuthill, Secretary; and Charles N. Boyd, Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', Nov. 16, 1924, "Organize National Music Association", retrieved from ProQuest Historical Newspapers Los Angeles Times (1881-1986), pg.

An '''oil-paper umbrella''' ({{zh|油紙傘}}, {{zh|p=yóuzhǐsǎn}}, {{IPA-cmn|i̯ǒu̯ʈʂɨ̀sàn}}) is a type of paper [[umbrella]] that originated in [[China]]. It subsequently spread across several East, South and Southeast Asian countries such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], where it has been further developed with different characteristics.&lt;ref name='Hakka'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sinica.edu.tw/tit/culture/1096_Umbrellas.html | title = Oil Paper Umbrellas--Beauties of Hakka Craftsmanship | accessdate = 2012-07-02 | last = Logan | first = Christopher | year = 1995 | publisher = Vision International Publishing Co. | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/68rOq3DN1 | archivedate = 2012-07-02 | quote = The Hakka people of the historic town of Meinung fashion amazing umbrellas out of bamboo and paper. These umbrellas, which are lacquered and painted in colorful designs, actually work fine in the rain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the purpose of providing shade, oil-paper umbrellas are also traditional wedding items. In traditional Chinese and Japanese weddings, the [[bridesmaid|matron of honor]] would cover the [[bride]] with an oil-paper umbrella upon arrival to ward off evil spirits. Purple umbrellas are a symbol of longevity for elders, while white umbrellas are used in funerals. Oil-paper umbrellas are also used as props in [[Japanese traditional dance]]s and [[tea ceremonies]].

In the early [[Hakka]] society, two umbrellas were usually given as [[dowry]], due to the "paper" (纸) and "child" (子) homonym in the language ([[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]]: chṳ́), symbolizing a blessing for the woman to "give birth to a son soon", a propitiatory compliment to the newlyweds at the time. Also, as the character "umbrella" contains "four people", gifting the umbrellas represents a blessing for the couple to have many sons and grandsons. In addition, because of the "oil" and "have" homonym, and that the umbrellas open into a round shape, they symbolize a happy, complete life. It was also customary to give an umbrella to a 16-year-old man at his [[rite of passage]].

In religious celebrations, oil-paper umbrellas are often seen on the sacred sedan chairs as cover, used to shelter people from rain and sunlight, also to drive the evil spirits away. Today, oil-paper umbrellas are mostly sold as works of [[art]] or [[souvenirs]].

==History==
[[File:Legend_white_snake1.jpg|thumb|right|Oil-paper umbrella in the [[Legend of the White Snake]]]]
The spread of oil-paper umbrellas was started by the invention of Yun ({{lang|zh|雲氏}}), wife of Luban ({{lang|zh|魯班}}). "Chop [[bamboo]] sticks to thin strips, covered in animal fur, closed to become a cane, opened as a cone." But early umbrella materials were mostly feathers or silks, later replaced by paper. When oil-paper umbrellas first appeared is unknown. Some estimate that they spread across to Korea and Japan during the [[Tang dynasty]]. It was commonly called the "green oil-paper umbrella" during the [[Song dynasty]]. The popularity grew and the oil-paper umbrella became commonplace during the [[Ming dynasty]]. They are often mentioned in popular Chinese literature. By the 19th century, oil-paper umbrellas were a common item in international trade under the name [[kittisol]]s.

==Basic production process==
The production process and required procedures are different in each region. However, in general, they can be divided into four main steps:
#[[Bamboo]] is selected
#The bamboo is crafted and soaked in water. It is then dried in the sun, drilled, threaded and assembled into a skeleton.
#Paper is cut and glued onto the skeleton. It is trimmed, oiled, and exposed to sunlight.
#Lastly, patterns are painted onto the umbrella.

==Oil-paper umbrellas in China==
The art of the Chinese style of oil-paper umbrellas are mostly focused on traditional black and white [[Chinese painting]] such as flowers, birds, and scenery. Others include scenes from famous Chinese literature, such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' and ''[[Romance of the Western Chamber]]''. Yet, some have Chinese calligraphy instead of paintings. However, traditional colors are kept on the sticks and the scaffold of the umbrella to maintain the antiquity.

===Yuhang, Zhejiang===
In [[Yuhang District]], [[Zhejiang]], oil-paper umbrellas have been produced since the era of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1769), by Dong Wenyuan ({{zh|c=董文遠|p=Dǒng Wényuǎn|labels=no}}), who owned an umbrella shop. Oil-paper umbrellas in Yuhang are made with high mechanical skills and top materials, which provide their endurance. Prolonged exposure to sunlight and rain does no damage, thus their popularity among common people. Lots of travelers who passed through Yuan would buy umbrellas from Dong Wenyuan's umbrella shop as souvenirs for friends and relatives. Oil-paper umbrellas in Yuhang are available in a variety of different types and purposes, including those used for fishing or as collectibles.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1951, Zhejiang province has chosen Yuhang as the focused point of the industrial artifact for oil-paper umbrellas and initiated a group for this establishment in 1952. The later established "Artifact Rain Umbrella Industry Co-operations" ({{zh|t=雨傘手工業合作社|p=Yǔsǎn shǒugōngyè hézuòshè|labels=no}}) was the first industry of artifacts in Zhejiang province. This establishment was once in the spotlight of the Chinese media, however, as the popular metallic umbrella appeared on the market and oil-paper umbrellas have faced extinction.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

On December 5, 2006, artisan Liu Youquan ({{zh|t=劉有泉|p=Liú Yǒuquán|labels=no}}) met a government official of the Yuhang district and proposed to recover the oil-paper umbrella in Yuhan, with the intention of starting a new pop culture trend and increase local wealth. Liu spent a few hundred RMB and bought some dozens of the bamboo umbrella from a bamboo umbrella factory. But Liu did not have the skills, only to keep these as a "canvas" for 30 some years. A local media reported for a search of an oil-paper umbrella artisan and increased local awareness. Four days later, four artisans: Fang Jinquan ({{zh|t=房金泉|p=Fáng Jīnquán|labels=no}}), Chen Yue Xiang ({{zh|t=陳月祥|p=Chén Yuèxiáng|labels=no}}), Shen Lihua ({{zh|t=沈麗華|p=Chén Lìhuá|labels=no}}), and Sun Shuigen ({{zh|t=孫水根|p=Sūn Shuǐgēn|labels=no}}) prompted and have intentions to recover the art (drawing oil paintings on the bamboo umbrella). They have passed their skills and technique to some local bamboo farmers and brought income to them. The governmental officials of Yuhang have listed this art for major protection and important antique artifact ([[Antiquities Act]]).

Production requires skilled hands and technique as well as personal experience. Training to become a master in oil-paper umbrella manufacture requires an apprenticeship and a great deal of practice. Apprentices must practice the skills for three years to officially master this technique. Tools are made by professional blacksmiths. The material of the umbrellas is chosen with care. The umbrella scaffold is made from either bamboo or wood, tied with hair strings. The best umbrellas are made from peach flowers, as the umbrella surface is soaked in persimmon pigment. The persimmon pigment is made from fermenting the juice of green persimmons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiromipaper.com/newsletter/LoriGoodman.htm|title=Hiromi Paper International|work=hiromipaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a suitable stickiness. The soaked flower petals are stuck to the umbrella scaffold one by one.  Paintings or pictures are drawn on the peach flower petals prior to painting [[tung oil]] on top. The finalized umbrella is left to dry in a dry dark room. It requires at least 70 steps to produce a well-crafted oil-paper umbrella.

===Sichuan===
In [[Luzhou]], [[Sichuan]], the oil-paper umbrella culture started around the end of [[Ming dynasty]] and beginning of [[Qing dynasty]]. Oil-paper umbrellas have existed in Sichuan for as long as four hundred years. Herem, the umbrellas are exquisite with fine paintings, abundant colors and beautiful outlooks, the umbrellas are also famous for their ability to shield strong winds. In 1993 May, six experienced artisans have spent four months to produce a famous ''Erlongxizhu''  umbrella ({{zh|二龍戲珠|p=Èr lóng xì zhū|labels=no}}), which was exported to countries such as [[England]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. The ''Erlongxizhu'' was made out of 88 [[pinaceae]] and 52 bamboo sticks with 1800 skin paper and 100 kilograms of oil pigment. Producing the ''Erlongxizhu'' required over 70 procedures and it was regarded as the "Chinese King of Umbrellas".

After Western umbrellas had increased in popularity, the Luzho oil-paper umbrella's popularity diminished dramatically. In addition, due to the sophisticated procedures, the high production cost and low profit, not many young men were willing to commit to this art. In 2004, only about thirty experienced artisans were willing to continue this umbrella production. Many people worried that the skills may soon become extinct. In October 2005, an exhibition in Shanghai invited the local government to an exhibition of oil-paper umbrellas, and they have recovered some popularity since then.

After the recovery, [[Yunnan]] and Luzho minorities gained awareness of oil-paper umbrellas and used them during ceremonies and gifts. Since then, the umbrellas have been exported to Japan, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong and Macau.

Contemporary local artisans still utilize the traditional method of oil-paper umbrella production, which includes the 70 or so procedures of total manual production. Such as slicing the bamboo and painting the pictures. Materials used are also orthodox to the traditional materials, such as the bamboo sticks directly brought from the mountains where they were chopped. Tools of production are old too. Such as the black stone ink is already 450 years old. Quality control is strict; the four trenches should not meet and the tung oil must be spread evenly across the umbrella surface. The paintings adhere to the situations they are used for.

===Jiangxi===
Oil-paper umbrellas in the [[Wuyuan County, Jiangxi|Wuyuan County]] of the [[Jiangxi]] province are orthodox and beautiful in appearance, as well as endurable with portability, named the "{{zh|c=金溪斗笠甲路傘|p=Jīnxī dǒulì Jiǎlù sǎn|labels=no}}".

During the Song dynasty, a local resident of Jiangxi named "{{zh|t=馬庭嵐|p=Mǎ Tínglán|labels=no}}" was awarded the position [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]], who then brought an oil-paper umbrella back to Jiangxi with him from a major city. One named "{{zh|t=甲路人|p=Jiǎ Lùrén|labels=no}}" have improved upon the [[prototype]] and  passed it on to his descendants. It was said that during the Ching dynasty when the [[Kangxi Emperor]] was on the throne, one day the Kangxi Emperor secretly traveled to Wuyuan and it was raining. Kangxi Emperor saw a kid who threw a stone at the umbrella, however, the stone bounced back off from the umbrella without damaging it. Kangxi Emperor was surprised by the quality and strength of the oil-paper umbrella and gave it a positive name called the "Jialu paper umbrella Jia Tianxia&lt;!--the "Jia Tianxia" part seems mis/untranslated--&gt;" ({{zh|t=甲路紙傘甲天下|p=Jiǎlù zhǐ sǎn jiǎ tiānxià|labels=no}}). Since then they have been commonly called "Jialu umbrellas" ({{zh|t=甲路傘|p=Jiǎlù sǎn|labels=no}}).

Jialu umbrellas were awarded the first place during an international exhibition in 1936 and reached its peak at 1943, which recorded to have once produced 25,000 umbrellas and exported 17,000 annually. In 2000, however, only three eighty-year-old artisans have possessed the skill, in addition, one of the raw materials, persimmon tree is in extinction{{Clarify| reason=The persimmon article doesn't mention any threat of extinction, and in fact, says that the trees are particularly hardy|date=March 2012}}. Jialu umbrellas have since become extinct. In 2006, the locals have produced a new and natural breed and increased the quality of Jialu umbrellas. Jialu umbrella production reached 50,000 annually and exported to countries such as the United States, Japan, and Korea. Contemporarily, there are four factories located in Wuyuan with a net worth of eight million RMB, thirty villagers and 1,800 workers.

Jialu umbrellas are made from high-quality bamboo, skin paper, and tung oil. The main procedures are slicing the umbrella scaffold, cutting the umbrella portion, installing the umbrella sticks, boiling the umbrella stick, adding the skin paper, painting on the skin paper, editing the umbrella skin, brushing on tung oil, stitching the umbrella with decorations, installing the handle and the head. Altogether about thirty procedures.

===Hunan===
Oil-paper umbrellas in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] province date back to about 100 years, the earliest oil-paper umbrella shop is {{lang|zh|陶恆泰紙傘店}}, Which is named after Tao Jiqiao ({{lang|zh|陶季橋|p=Táo jì qiáo|labels=no}}), who established the shop during the Qing dynasty.

In 1900, Liang Jingting ({{zh|t=梁敬庭|p=Liáng Jìngtíng|labels=no}}), who worked in an umbrella shop in Changsha opened his own umbrella shop called the ''Lianghongfa San'' ({{zh|t=梁宏發傘|p=liánghóngfā sǎn|labels=no}}). It produces the old type of oil, black ink umbrella. The beautiful name ''Xiangtan Muji Jing Gang You San'' ({{zh|t=湘潭木屐 靖港油傘|p=xiāngtán mùjī jìng gǎng yóu sǎn|labels=no}}) is attributed to its fine features and endurance. In 1921, the Pan Kuiqing ({{zh|t=潘饋清|p=pān kuì qīng|labels=no}}) brothers started a factory called ''Feifei San'' ({{zh|t=菲菲傘|p=fēifēi sǎn|labels=no}}) that mass-produces umbrella skin paper. The umbrella skin it produced included traditional flowered ones and many other pictures, these umbrellas were exported to Hong Kong, Macau and South East Asia. The umbrella was awarded in a Chinese exhibition in 1929.  The highest production rate was thirty thousand per year, until February 1975 when Jing Gang Yusan She({{zh|t=靖港雨傘社|p=jìng gǎng yǔsǎn shè|labels=no}}) was abolished, and Taohengmao ({{zh|c=|s=|t=陶恆茂|p=táohéngmào|labels=no}}) oil-paper umbrella production was terminated.

The raw materials of the Changsha oil-paper umbrella are skin paper, bamboo, cotton silk, rope, tung oil, persimmon water, pigment, cow horn, and wood. The umbrellas produced by Taohengmao ({{zh|c=|s=|t=陶恆茂|p=táohéngmào|labels=no}}) are especially fine-featured and commit to abide by the traditional production methods with strict materials.

===Hubei===

The [[Hankou]], [[Hubei]], province has been producing oil-paper umbrellas for a few hundred years. In 1864, Somun ({{zh|c=|s=|t=蘇文|p=Sūwén|}}) who was originally from Hunan, invested in an umbrella shop along with what he has learned. He later opened an official umbrella shop called Suhengtai Sandian ({{Zh|c=|s=|t=蘇恆泰傘店|p=sūhéngtàisǎndiàn}}), hired 12 workers and 3 apprentices. The production rate is about 500-600 umbrellas per month, and he also brought up the popularity of the umbrella market locally. He later expanded his business and gained enormous profits.

Suhengtai ({{Zh|c=|s=|t=蘇恆泰|p=sūhéngtài}}) oil-paper umbrella gained much popularity locally. It was once popular to buy umbrellas for marriages with the brides and the grooms. Bride holding a blue one and groom holding a red one with the connotation of a beautiful marriage. In 1970, the Sheng Tai oil-paper umbrella has become extinct, and this art was officially extinct.

Suhengtai ({{Zh|c=|s=|t=蘇恆泰|p=sūhéngtài}}) oil-paper umbrella uses to class material, the scaffold is made from a special type of bamboo and the umbrella handle from a special type of wood from Hunan. Tung oil, skin paper, and persimmon oil are all strictly picked. A Suhengtai oil-paper umbrella could last for about eight to twelve years.

===Fujian===
[[File:Oiled Paper Umbrella of Fuzhou 2013-07.JPG|thumb|Oil-paper umbrella from [[Fuzhou]]]]
Oil-paper umbrella have been produced in both [[Fuzhou]] and [[Nanping]] of [[Fujian]]. The oil-paper umbrella is one of the three treasures in Fuzhou ({{lang|zh|福州三寶}}). The other two are namely the {{lang|zh|脫胎漆器}} ([[Lacquerware]]) and the {{lang|zh|牛角梳}} ([[comb]]s made of cattle [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]). Umbrellas play a large part in Fuzhou residents' daily lives, local people call it {{lang|zh|包袱傘}}, which literally means everyone's backpack has an umbrella in it. Oil-paper umbrella in Nanping is famous with two other brands altogether known as the "three mouth" ({{lang|zh|三口}}), the other two mouths are {{lang|zh|水口}} and {{lang|zh|閩清口}}. The production initiated in the 20th century. The highest production recorded was fifty thousand annually. The traditional oil-paper umbrella was gradually replaced by the collapsible umbrella in the 1970 decade. The local artisans switched to producing small and portable umbrellas since then. The umbrellas produced in Nanping is currently exported to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, South East Asia, Europe, and America.

Fuzhou oil-paper umbrella materials are chosen strictly with high quality. The scaffold must be made from bamboos of the Northern Fujian province with good elasticity and endurance, and the bamboos must be at least five years old. A single umbrella must go through 83 procedures.

Traditional Fuzhou oil-paper umbrella art is divided into five sub-portions including umbrella scaffold, umbrella installment, umbrella head, handle and painting. The mainstream art is the umbrella installment. There are also a few famous local umbrella painters including {{lang|zh|程家寶}}, {{lang|zh|林永欽}} and {{lang|zh|劉夢秋}}.

The oil-paper umbrella in Fuzhou is dated as long as the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. When {{lang|zh|王審知}} established his own kingdom called "{{lang|zh|閩國}}" at Fuzhou, he brought the oil-paper umbrella from [[Zhejiang]] with him. During the Ching dynasty, there were as many as 300 shops in Fuzhou. Oil-paper umbrella was also one of the symbols for riot against the Japanese during the [[Xinhai revolution]].
The oil-paper umbrella in Fuzhou was famous for its endurance in an expo in [[Panama]] in 1915 and [[Chicago]] in 1933.

In 1985, the Fuzhou oil-paper umbrella has had significant improvement and advancement and was exported to Japan, [[Europe]] and South East Asia. Every umbrella has 72 sticks in the scaffold, opens wide and closes small giving it a snake appearance, thus also named the "Snake Umbrella".

In 1990, a government official {{lang|zh|林愛枝}} went to Seattle for an umbrella exhibition, and a red umbrella he showed provoked a great response in the audience. But Fuzhou umbrella shop closed down in 1997, the production is now low with a minor export to Japan. Despite local umbrella artisans have already being occupied with other jobs, they still petition the local government's assistance in the recovery of this art.

===Yunnan===

Oil-paper umbrella production in [[Tengchong County|Tengchong]], Yunnan, dates back to two-hundred years ago, or nine generations, also called the {{lang|zh|紙撐子}}. It was rumored that {{lang|zh|鄭以公}} who once met two umbrella artisans and learned the skills from them brought the skills with him back to Tengchong, and passed it on to his descendants. In the past, oil-paper umbrella spread across all markets in Tengchong. The local Hakka especially liked the oil-paper umbrellas. The village chief {{lang|zh|鄭傳國}} said that once 80% of the villagers knew how to make oil-paper umbrellas, but now only four that are still making them. The current best production household is the {{lang|zh|鄭家朝}}, who is picky about the material and techniques. Tung oil and persimmon water are made adhering to the traditional methods of production. The final umbrella is elegant and strong. The production rate is about one to two per day. {{lang|zh|鄭映樓}}, who only makes big umbrellas likes to place big umbrellas in front of his shop to shed the sun and attract customers, therefore also named the "shed shop umbrella" ({{lang|zh|照舖傘}}). They only produce umbrellas when they have free time from farm works currently.

The oil-paper umbrellas produced in Tengchong are finely tuned, abundant with colors and beautiful outlook. They were once sold in other provinces of China. However, there has been a gradual decrease in production during the 1950s. The oil-paper umbrella production now is only to pass on the skills to prevent the extinction of this handcraft locally.

The oil-paper umbrella uses special bamboos and wood translocated from {{lang|zh|雲華}} and {{lang|zh|古永}} as umbrella handle and scaffold. The umbrella surface uses skin bought from {{lang|zh|界頭}}. Brushed with tung oil, named the green cloth ({{lang|zh|綠衣子}}). Procedures including slicing bamboo scaffold, stitching, surface skin, brushing persimmon water, collapsing the scaffold, drying the umbrella, painting, installing the handle, brushing tung oil, adding clothes, stitching again. It averages out about two umbrella a day.

The character "{{lang|zh|傘}}" (umbrella), contains five "{{lang|zh|人}}" (man) with the connotation of lots of sons and grandsons. Oil-paper umbrella is straight up, with the symbol to eradicate evil spirits. The circular appearance symbolizes "fullness" connotation of a beautiful marriage.

Oil-paper umbrella as a dowry is still a custom in the Hakka family in Taiwan and some other countries in [[South East Asia]].

====Hakka second burial funerals====
Since many of the Hakka populations are in the mountainous areas of China, most corpses are buried on the mountains. Initially, Hakka people do not put up a gravestone, however, after the second time the corpse is buried (usually 3–5 years later), the additional grander ceremony is added. When buying, usually in the eighth month of the Chinese calendar, an experienced burial master is hired to dig the old burial and enter the clean bones for an official and permanent burial at the exact spot. The oil-paper umbrella is used to cover the bones while they are being cleaned.

====Engagement present of the Yao people====
In the population of [[Yao people|Yao]] located in [[Longhui County]] of [[Hunan]], oil-paper umbrella is used as an engagement present by the men side. When a consensus is built between the two families, the family of the man's side would hire an experienced man to propose a marriage in the woman's house. The first propose does not require any gift but only the permission of the parents of the bride. During the day of engagement, the man's side needs to bring an oil-paper umbrella to the woman's house and place it on the sacred table located in the house; the bride must take the umbrella from the table personally and close the umbrella that is stitched with 12 triangles. Then the experienced man must bring the oil-paper umbrella back to the husband's house for the proof of a successful engagement. On the way back, the experienced man must not open the umbrella himself. If a divorce is made later, the husband must return the string on the stitch back to the bride.

====Funerals of the Dai people====
[[Dai people]] located in Yunnan use a special type of paper called "{{lang|zh|嘎拉沙}}" (Garcia) to make oil-paper umbrella, which is brushed with sesame oil. The Dai believe that the umbrella could lead the dead to [[heaven]]. This type of umbrella is still available in a village today.

====Hakka dance ceremony====

==Oil-paper umbrella in Taiwan==
Oil-paper umbrella has been the cultural symbol of the Hakka in [[Meinong District]] of [[Kaohsiung]]. The production procedures are divided into five major portions. This includes the umbrella scaffold, umbrella production, umbrella head, umbrella handle and art painting. With any one of the above been done, the umbrella could be called as a "full art" ({{lang|zh|全藝}}).

===History and modifications===
Oil-paper umbrella production in Meinong initiation has two rumors.
*One was that it started during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], during which, Lin ({{lang|zh|林阿貴}}) and Wu ({{lang|zh|吳振興}}) invited oil-paper umbrella artisans from mainland China to Taiwan for the purpose of passing the skills to the locals.
*The other was that oil-paper umbrella artisan Guo ({{lang|zh|郭玉琴}}) have arrived in Taiwan from Guangdong province. Since then, he had permanently stayed in the Meinong district and spread the skills locally. Early Meinong oil-paper umbrella factor was called "{{lang|zh|廣}}" (pronounced "Young") for connotations of wealth, wide and progression. In 1960, oil-paper umbrella, tobacco leaves, and rice were Meinong district's major income sources. At that time, it was the renaissance of oil-paper umbrella. It was estimated that there were at least twenty factories producing twenty thousand oil-paper umbrellas annually. However, with the rapid industrialization in Taiwan, mechanically produced Western umbrellas have replaced them in attribute to low cost, longevity, and portability. Taiwan has become the key country of Western umbrella production and forced lots of traditional handmade oil-paper umbrella factories out of business.

In 1970, an English journal used the Goung ({{lang|zh|廣進勝}}) oil-paper umbrella pioneer, Lin ({{lang|zh|林享麟}}) and his umbrella as the magazine cover, along with a detailed article on the culture and production of oil-paper umbrella. BBC have also included a series of recording of the oil-paper umbrella called the "Long Search". In addition, 1983, famous Hakka movie producer, Lin Fu-De ({{lang|zh|林福地}}), have incorporated the oil-paper umbrella into his drama, ''[[Star Knows My Heart]]''. When the drama was played in the Japanese television, Taiwanese oil-paper umbrella gained impression in the Japanese, who have ordered a large quantity for imports. After 1980, with the increase of Taiwan overall financial status, Meinong's increased tourism, oil-paper umbrella have recovered its utility in the daily life along with its value as a local culture and travel souvenir.

===Production and materials===
Meinong oil-paper umbrella scaffolds are made mainly from bamboo sticks, which are translocated from places such as [[Puli, Nantou|Puli]], [[Zhushan, Nantou|Zhushan]], [[Nantou County]] and the [[Qishan District]] of Kaohsiung. Especially the famous [[moso bamboo]] of the Qushan district. Moso bamboo is famous for its strength and elasticity. Thus the scaffold is mainly made of moso bamboo. Prior to production, most bamboo is soaked in water to eliminate the sugar for a month. Then they are dried under the sun to prevent infection of bugs. After cutting and slicing, they become the fundamental scaffold of the umbrella, with additional modifications such as umbrella head, handle and hole drilling for stitching. After the scaffold production, the wax is applied onto the surface as well as the sides. Then persimmon oil, sun bake, painting, handle installment, umbrella head fixed, stitched for a finalized oil paper umbrella.

==Oil-paper umbrella in Japan==
[[File:Making umbrellas (Japan) (9099970800).jpg|thumb|Umbrella making as a home industry]]
Oil-paper umbrellas are often known in Japanese as {{nihongo||和傘|'''wagasa'''|"Japanese umbrella"|lead=yes}}, and these with a bull's-eye design are called {{nihongo4||蛇の目傘|janomegasa}}. The handle and scaffold are often colored black, however, sometimes other colors are applied as well. The surface paintings include traditional Japanese culture, gained popularity from the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] to [[Edo period]].{{efn|A part of wagasa was excavated at {{nihongo4|Kōfu Jōkamachi Site |甲府城下町遺跡}} in Kōfu, Yamanashi, Japan, where the area was a castle town during the rule of feudal lord [[Takeda Shingen]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =Iseki topikkusu: No. 0342 Kōfu jōkamachi iseki |trans-title =No. 0342 Kōfu Jōkamachi iseki site|work = Site Report |number =| URL = http://www.pref.yamanashi.jp/smartphone/maizou-bnk/topics/301-400/0342.html |author = Maizō-bunkazai Sentā (Archaeological Center at Board of Education)| publisher= Yamanashi Prefecture|location = Yamanashi, Japan | access-date = 2016-04-24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===History===
[[File:Underside of a Japanese umbrella.jpg|thumb|The underside of a Japanese oil-paper umbrella]]
The origin of oil-paper umbrellas could be traced to those fabric canopies brought from Korea to Japan during the [[Asuka period]], which samples are preserved among the  [[Shōsōin]] treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =  6.

During the [[Heian period]], techniques in paper production and bamboo work advanced. In the [[Muromachi period]], pigments and wax were applied to the surface of the paper for additional resistance to water.

[[File:Wedding Scene.jpg|thumb|left|Oil-paper umbrella used in weddings in [[Ryūkyū]]]]
During the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]], [[Luzon Sukezaemon]] introduced an umbrella with a shield from the [[Philippines]], which contributed the popularity of the wages. During the [[Genroku]] era, modifications were made to enhance its utility to specific circumstances. Some monks and doctors used shorter and thicker umbrellas with business trademarks or logos on them, then lent them to customers as an advertisement. Umbrellas also became the [[geisha]]'s tool as well. In addition, some unemployed Edo period samurai crafted oil-paper umbrellas as a secondary occupation. A famous example is the {{nihongo4||阿島傘|Ajima-kasa}}, made in [[Nagano Prefecture]], which is still made there.

However, with the popularity of Western umbrellas in the [[Meiji period]], oil-paper umbrellas have diminished markets today, with only a few locations producing it, such as [[Kyoto]], [[Gifu Prefecture]] and [[Yodoe, Tottori|Yodoe]], [[Tottori Prefecture]].

[http://kyototsujikura.com Tsujikura] is the oldest shop of the oil-paper umbrella in Japan.

===Kyoto===
[[File: Kyoto Umbrella 01.jpg|thumb|Kyō wagasa, a traditional umbrella of Kyoto, Japan.]]
A style of oil-paper umbrella in [[Kyoto]] is called {{nihongo4||京和傘|'''kyōwagasa'''}}. Kyowagasa is completely handmade, colors and images are of Japanese features, materials are also strictly controlled. The handle and scaffold are made from bamboo of [[Kameoka, Kyoto]]; the umbrella skin is made from Meinong paper of Gifu. The surface of the umbrella skin is brushed with [[sesame oil]] and tied with fine strings. An experienced artisan usually produces ten to twenty kyowagasa a month. One umbrella style has concentric circles on the exterior side of the umbrella skin called the {{nihongo4||蛇の目傘|janomegasa}}, which literally means ''eye of a snake''.

===Gifu===
Oil-paper umbrella production in Gifu started around 1750. Every oil-paper umbrella made in Gifu goes through over a hundred procedures. During the [[Shōwa period]], the production in Gifu reached its peak at about fifteen million annually. Today, the production is only about a few tens of thousands per year.

===Yodoe===
Oil-paper umbrella production started in [[Yodoe, Tottori]] in 1821, by the {{nihongo4||倉吉屋|Kurayoshiya}}. During the Meiji period, the production in Yodoe was only about a few thousand annually. However, due to the abundance and accessibility of bamboo and other raw materials, during the [[Taishō period]], production by factories increased 71% and a net production of 17,000 Wagasa annually. Most areas in western Japan regularly used the Yodoe Wagasa.

===Wagasa in Japanese culture===
[[File:Wedding, Yoyogi Park (2562137428).jpg|thumb|right| Wagasa at a wedding ceremony]]

Other than its utility, oil-paper umbrellas appear quite often in Japanese culture, and are often associated with geisha, traditional dance, [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], and daily utility including wedding ceremony. Oil-paper umbrella shops in [[Gion]] have classified their customers into categories for different styles of oil-paper umbrella:
*Geisha use purple
*Dancers use pink
*Middle aged clients like green or red
*Men and elderly use dark blue
*Actors tend to pick black or brown
Different colors have different connotations and symbolism; in traditional weddings, brides are usually covered under a red oil-paper umbrella. &lt;!-- examples need to be added to two other colors; Purple oil-paper umbrellas symbolize longevity and white oil-paper umbrellas are used in [[funeral]]s.{{citation needed |date = April 2016}}--&gt;

==Oil-paper umbrellas in Thailand==
[[File:Chiangmai-market.jpg|thumb|right|Umbrella stand at the Sunday market, [[Chiangmai]]]]
Oil-paper umbrella art in the Northern Thailand, or [[Chiang Mai]] dates back to around two hundred years. The umbrella scaffold is made from green bamboo sticks, the colors and images are abundant including pictures of scenery, animals, people and flowers. The umbrella surfaces can have a square shape in addition to the traditional circular one. Oil-paper umbrellas in Thailand have unique features, which often entice tourists to buy them. Of the several types, the most famous are the ones made in the Bo Sang village. Most farmers produce oil-paper umbrellas during their free time in specialized factories.

===History and modifications===
The rumors of the local people have guessed that the oil-paper umbrella has been brought into Thailand by the [[Bamar]]. Long ago, a monk in Thailand named "Pra In that" who practiced Buddhism in "Wat Bo Sang" temple and traveled a lot. One time as he approached near the Northern border of [[Burma]] and stayed there for a few days, the [[Thai people]] there accommodated him while his stay. During a time when Pra In that ate his breakfast, a Bamar gave him an umbrella along with the prayer of the monk. The monk thought the umbrella was very convenient and was curious for how it was made, he decided to learn to make the umbrella. Thus he visited the village that was specialized in the production of umbrella located in Burma. Pra In that recorded the detailed production procedures and brought it with him back to Wat Bo Sang temple.

After arriving back at Wat Bo Sang, Pra In that was on a hunt for the needed materials to produce the umbrella, with some assistance of the villagers, they were able to make the first umbrella in Thailand. Initially, not many villagers were motivated to make umbrellas, however, once they found the convenience of it, many were attracted to mass-produce and buying it. Oil-paper umbrella production became one of the major sources of income for the Bo Sang village.

In 1941, Bo Sang villagers have cooperated and established the "Bo Sang Umbrella Making Cooperative Ltd.". The chief of the company is Jamroon Suthiwiwat. The company is specialized in making umbrella of different sizes such as 14, 16, 18, 20, 35, 40&amp;nbsp; inches and even bigger umbrella. In 1957, Governmental association "Center for Industrial Promotion for the North" have assisted the villagers and improved their production techniques.

===Production and materials===

The umbrella skin is made from the tree skin of [[Morus (plant)|morus plant]] called "sa". Morus skin is cooked to soft, washed, smashed, washed and bleached. It is covered in cloth to increase the thickness. Then dried under the sun. Oil-paper umbrella production is all handmade including slicing the bamboo stick, combining the umbrella scaffold, addition of the skin, painting, and drying. Bo Sang umbrella use [[oil paint]] to paint and are all painted completely by hand.

===Umbrella festival===
The oil-paper umbrella festival takes place in [[Chiang Mai]] during the January or February of every year. It is one of the most popular festivals and attracts a lot of tourists. The festival mainly takes place in the streets of Bo Sang, every place in the village are decorated with oil-paper umbrella. There are also competitions taking place between artisans and artists of the oil-paper umbrella, prizes are awarded to the winners. Women from the Bo Sang village performs the bicycle show with the oil-paper umbrella and are simultaneously competing for "Miss Bo Sang" of the year.

'''''On Vision and Colors''''' ({{lang-de|Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; das Sehn und die Farben}}) is a treatise&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Robert Mandelkow]], Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 1.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;3: Briefe der Jahre 1805-1821 (''Letters of the years 1805-1821''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;639. "Entsprechend hat Goethe dann auch seiner Abhandlung 'Über das Sehn und die Farben' nur bedingt zugestimmt." (''"Accordingly, Goethe then also only conditionally agreed to his treatise 'On Vision and Colors'."'')&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] that was published in May 1816 when the author was 28 years old. Schopenhauer had extensive discussions with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] about the poet's ''[[Theory of Colours]]'' of 1810, in the months around the turn of the years 1813 and 1814, and initially shared Goethe's views.&lt;ref name=Mandelkow&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow, Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 1.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;3: Briefe der Jahre 1805-1821 (''Letters of the years 1805-1821''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;639. "Vom November 1813 bis zum Mai 1814 sind sie in Weimar sehr häufig zusammengewesen. (...) In den Mittelpunkt der Diskussionen rückte schließlich die Goethesche ''Farbenlehre''. Schopenhauer teilte prinzipiell die Ansichten des Dichters, wich jedoch in gewissen Einzelheiten von ihnen ab." (''"From November 1813 till May 1814, they were together very often in Weimar. [...] Goethe's ''Theory of Colours'' finally became the central subject of the discussions. Schopenhauer basically shared the views of the poet, but deviated from them in certain details."'')&lt;/ref&gt;  Their growing theoretical disagreements and Schopenahauer's criticisms made Goethe distance himself from his young collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). ''Schopenhauer: a Biography''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 247–265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Schopenhauer considered his own theory superior, he would still continue to praise Goethe’s work as an important introduction to his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). ''Schopenhauer: a Biography''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 252 and 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer tried to demonstrate [[Physiology|physiologically]] that color is "specially modified activity of the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;''On Vision and Colors'', § 1&lt;/ref&gt;" The initial basis for Schopenhauer's color theory comes from Goethe's chapter on physiological colors, which discusses three principal pairs of contrasting colors: red/green, orange/blue, and yellow/violet. This is in contrast to the customary emphasis on [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] seven colors of the Newtonian [[spectrum]]. In accordance with [[Aristotle]], Schopenhauer considered that colors arise by the mixture of shadowy, cloudy darkness with light. With white and black at each extreme of the scale, colors are arranged in a series according to the mathematical ratio between the proportions of light and darkness. Schopenhauer agreed with Goethe's claim that the eye tends toward a sum total that consists of a color plus its spectrum or [[afterimage]]. Schopenhauer arranged the colors so that the sum of any color and its complementary afterimage always equals unity. The complete activity of the retina produces white. When the activity of the retina is divided, the part of the retinal activity that is inactive and not stimulated into color can be seen as the ghostly complementary afterimage, which he and Goethe call a (physiological) spectrum.

==History==
Schopenhauer met Goethe in 1808 at his [[Johanna Schopenhauer|mother's]] parties in Weimar but Goethe then mostly ignored the young and unknown student. In November 1813, Goethe congratulated Schopenhauer on his doctoral dissertation ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'' which he received as a gift. Both men shared the opinion that visual representations yielded more knowledge than did concepts. In the winter of 1813/1814, Goethe personally demonstrated his color experiments to Schopenhauer and they discussed color theory. Goethe encouraged Schopenhauer to write ''On Vision and Colors''. Schopenhauer wrote it in a few weeks while living in [[Dresden]] in 1815. After it was published, in July 1815, Goethe rejected several of Schopenhauer's conclusions, especially as to whether white is a mixture of colors. He was also disappointed that Schopenhauer considered the whole topic of color to be a minor issue. Schopenhauer wrote as though Goethe had merely gathered data while Schopenhauer provided the actual theory. A major difference between the two men was that Goethe considered color to be an objective property of light and darkness.&lt;ref&gt;"...Goethe...was so completely a ''realist'' that he absolutely could not get it into his head that the ''objects'' as such exist only to the extent that they are ''projected'' by the perceiving subject." Schopenhauer's comment as quoted in Safranski's ''Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy'', Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[transcendental idealism]] was opposed to Goethe's [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;"It is precisely the astonishing ''objectivity'' of his mind, everywhere stamping his [Goethe's] works with the mark of genius, which stood in his way where it was of value and prevented him from going back to the ''subject'', in this case the perceiving eye itself, in order to seize here the final threads on which hangs the whole phenomenon of the world of colour. On the other hand, coming from Kant's school, I was prepared and trained for satisfying this demand in the best way." Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume II, Chapter VII, § 103.&lt;/ref&gt; For Schopenhauer, color was subjective in that it exists totally in the spectator's [[retina]]. As such, it can be excited in various ways by external stimuli or internal bodily conditions. Light is only one kind of color stimulus.

In 1830, Schopenhauer published a revision of his color theory. The title was ''Theoria colorum Physiologica, eademque primaria'' (''Fundamental physiological theory of color''). It appeared in Justus Radius's ''Scriptores ophthalmologici minores'' (''Minor ophthalmological writings''). "This is no mere translation of the first edition," he wrote, "but differs noticeably from it in form and presentation and is also amply enriched in subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;''On Vision and Colors'', "Preface to the Second Edition,"&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was written in [[Latin]], he believed that foreign readers would be able to appreciate its value.

An improved second edition of ''On Vision and Colors'' was published in 1854. In 1870, a third edition was published, edited by [[Julius Frauenstädt]]. In 1942, an English translation by Lt. Col. E. F. J. Payne was published in [[Karachi]], India. This translation was republished in 1994 by Berg Publishers, Inc., edited by Professor David E. Cartwright.

==Content==

===Preface to the second edition (the first addition had no Preface)===
Although this work is mainly concerned with physiology,&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer claimed that [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] "discovered the phenomenon of physiological colours on which the whole of my theory is based...." The theory was based on Buffon's physiological phenomena and Goethe's data. Schopenhauer, ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Chapter VII, § 104.&lt;/ref&gt; it is of philosophical value. In gaining knowledge of the subjective nature of color, the reader will have a more profound understanding of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] doctrine of the ''a priori'', subjective, intellectual forms of all knowledge. This is in opposition to contemporary [[Philosophical realism|realism]] which simply takes objective experience as positively given. Realism doesn't consider that it is through the subjective that the objective exists. The observer's brain stands like a wall between the observing subject and the real nature of things.

===Introduction===
Goethe performed two services: (1) he freed color theory from its reliance on [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and (2) he provided a systematic presentation of data for a theory of color.

Before discussing color, there are some preliminary remarks to be made regarding vision. In § 1, it is shown that the perception of externally perceived objects in space is a product of the intellect's understanding after it has been stimulated by sensation from the sense organs. These remarks are necessary in order for the reader to be convinced that colors are entirely in the eye alone and are thoroughly subjective&lt;ref&gt;This was also taught by [[René Descartes|Descartes]] (''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', ''Dioptric'', Ch. 1), [[John Locke|Locke]],(''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Book II, Chapter VIII, § 10), [[Sextus Empiricus]], (''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Book II, Chapter VII, .
§§ 72–75)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 1—On Vision===

====§ 1====
&lt;ref&gt;In the Preface to the 1st Edition of his main work, Schopenhauer wrote that he omitted "all that is to be found in the first chapter of my essay ''On Vision and Colors'', which otherwise would have found a place here, word for word."&lt;/ref&gt;
Intuitive perception, or knowledge of an object, is intellectual, not merely sensual. The intellect's understanding regards every sense impression in the observer's body as coming from an external cause. This transition from effect to cause is knowledge of the pure understanding, not a rational conclusion or combination of concepts and judgments according to logical laws. Knowledge of an object never results from mere impression, but always from the application of the law of causality, and consequently of the understanding. The law of causality is the sole form of the understanding and the precondition of the possibility of any objective perception.

Illusion occurs when the understanding is given uncommon sensations. If the sensations become commonplace, the illusion may disappear.&lt;ref&gt;As, for example, when a person becomes [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] due to a blow on the head and sees double. After a time, the person will see normal single images again, while the eyes remain crossed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual understanding, or knowing the objective cause of a subjective sensation, distinguishes animals from plants. All animals are able to intuitively perceive objects.

Color is usually attributed to external bodies. However, color is actually the activity of the eye's retina. It is a sensation. The external body is perceived as the cause of the sensation of color. We say, "The body is red." In reality, though, color exists only in the retina of the eye. It is separate from the external object. Color is a mere sensation in the sense organ. The external object is perceived by the intellect's understanding as being the cause of sensations.

===Chapter 2—On Colors===

====§ 2====
Newton, Goethe, and all other color theorists began by investigating light and colored bodies in order to find the cause of color. They should have started with an investigation of the effect, the given phenomenon, the changes in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Johannes Itten|Itten, Johannes]], ''The Elements of Color'', p. 16, "The light waves are not in themselves colored. Color arises in the human eye and brain."&lt;/ref&gt; we can afterward investigate the external physical and chemical causes of those sensations.

The eye's reaction to external stimulus is an activity, not a passive response. It is the activity of the retina. When the eye's retina receives a full impression of light, or when whiteness appears, it is fully active. When light is absent, or when blackness appears, the retina is inactive.

====§ 3====
There are gradations to the intensity or strength of the retina's activity, or reaction to external stimulus. The undivided activity of the retina is divided into stronger or weaker degrees when stimulated by pure light or whiteness. When influenced by light, the degrees are: Light — Half Shade — Darkness. When influenced by whiteness, the degrees are: White — Gray — Black. In this way, grays are seen. The intensity or energy of the retina's activity increases as more light or whiteness stimulates the eye. These gradations are made possible by the quantitative intensive divisibility of the retina's activity.

====§ 4====
The activity of the retina also has a quantitative extensive divisibility. The whole extent of the retina is divided into countless small juxtaposed spots or points.&lt;ref&gt;"There are about 125,000,000 receptors in each human eye [retina]." ''Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia'', "Vision and the Eye.,"&lt;/ref&gt; Each point is individually stimulated by light or whiteness and reacts separately. The eye can receive many impressions at one time, and therefore side by side.

====§ 5====
The qualitative division of the activity is completely different from the two quantitative divisions. It occurs when color is presented to the eye. Schopenhauer described the way in which various points or places on the retina become fatigued from being overstimulated. After staring at a black figure on a white background, the overactive and excited retinal points become exhausted and do not react to stimulation when the eye finally looks away. A ghostly appearance of a black background is seen with a light-colored figure. The retinal positions that were exhausted by the whiteness become completely inactive. The retinal positions that had been rested are now easily stimulated. This explains [[afterimage]] (physiological spectra). Both Goethe and Schopenhauer use the word "spectrum" [Spektrum], from the Latin word "spectrum" meaning "appearance" or "apparition," to designate an afterimage.

If, instead of white, we stare at yellow, then the afterimage, or physiological color spectrum, is violet. Yellow, unlike white, does not fully stimulate and exhaust the retina's activity. Yellow partially stimulates points on the retina and leaves those points partially unstimulated. The retina's activity has been qualitatively divided and separated into two parts. The unstimulated part results in a violet afterimage. Yellow and violet are the complement of each other because together they add up to full retinal activity. Yellow is closer to white, so it activates the retina more than violet, which is closer to black.

An orange color is not as close to white. It doesn't activate the retina as much as yellow. Orange's complement is blue, which is that much closer to white than was violet. A red color is halfway between white and black. Red's complement is green which is also halfway between white and black. With red and green, the retina's qualitatively divided activity consists of two equal halves.

Red and green are two completely equal qualitative halves of the retina's activity. Orange is 2/3 of this activity, and its complement, blue, is only 1/3. Yellow is ¾ of the full activity, and its complement, violet, is only ¼.

The range of all colors contains a continuous series of innumerable shades that blend into each other. Why are red, green, orange, blue, yellow, and violet given names and considered to be the most important? Because they represent the retina's activity in the simplest fractions or ratios. The same is true of the [[solfège|seven keynotes]] in the musical [[diatonic scale]]: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. Color is the qualitatively divided activity of the retina. The retina has a natural tendency to display its activity entirely. After the retina has been partly stimulated, its remaining complement is active as the physiological spectrum or afterimage. In this way, the retina is fully and wholly active.

Knowledge of these six colors is inborn in the mind. They are ideal and are never found pure in nature, in the same way that regular geometrical figures are innate. We have them ''a priori'' in our minds as standards to which we compare actual colors. These three pairs of colors are pure, subjective [[Epicurus|Epicurean]] anticipations because they are expressed in simple, rational, arithmetical ratios similar to the seven tones of the musical scale and their rational vibration numbers.

Black and white are not colors because they are not fractions and represent no qualitative division of the retina's activity. Colors appear in pairs as the union of a color and its complement. Newton's division into seven colors is absurd because the sum of all basic colors cannot be an odd number.

====§ 6====
The qualitatively divided activity of the retina is a polarity, like electricity and magnetism. The retina's polarity is successive, in time, whereas the polarity of the others is simultaneous, in space. The retina's activity, like [[Yin and yang|Yin and Yang]], is split into two parts which condition each other and seek to reunite. Red, orange, and yellow could be conventionally designated by a plus sign. Green, blue, and violet could be the negative poles.

====§ 7====
According to Goethe, color is like shade or gray in that it is darker than white and brighter than black. The difference between grays and colors, though, is as follows. Light is activity of the retina. Darkness is retinal inactivity. Grays appear when the intensity or strength of the retina's activity is lessened. Colors appear when the whole activity of the retina is divided into partial complementary poles according to ratios. With the merely quantitative, intensive division of the retina's activity, there is only a gradual (by degrees) diminution of the intensity or strength of the retina's full activity. No fractional division of activity in ratios occurs. This lessening of strength by small degrees results in gray shades. However, with the qualitative fractional division of the activity of the retina, the activity of the part that appears as color is necessarily conditioned by the inactivity of the complementary fractional part. The polar contrast between the active and inactive parts results in color. The vivid partial activity of the stimulated retinal spot is supported by that same spot's partial inactivity. Every color's darkness appears as its afterimage, or spectrum. Conversely, when looking at an [[afterimage]], or physiological spectrum, the previously existing color is the darkening factor.

====§ 8====
Newton recognized that color is darker than white or light. He erroneously investigated light instead of the eye, the objective instead of the subjective. In so doing, he asserted that light rays are composed of seven colored rays. These seven were like the seven intervals of the musical scale. Schopenhauer claimed that there are only four prismatic colors: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. The rays described by Newton are supposed to be variously colored according to laws that have nothing to do with the eye. Instead of Newton's division of sunshine into seven rays, Schopenhauer claimed that color was a division of the eye's retina into two complementary parts. Like the [[Oracle|Delphic Oracle]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Schopenhauer concentrated on the subjective rather than the objective, on the observer's experience rather than the observed object. In general, he believed, the subjective viewpoint leads to correct results.

Colors are not in light. Colors are nothing more than the eye's activity, appearing in polar contrasts. Philosophers have always surmised that color belongs to the eye rather than to things. [[John Locke|Locke]], for example, claimed that color was at the head of his list of secondary qualities.

Newton's theory has color as an occult quality. Schopenhauer's theory claims to be more explanatory. He said that each color is a definite + or − side of the division of the retina's activity, expressed as a fraction that reflects the color's sensation.

====§ 9====
When the entire activity of the eye is completely qualitatively partitioned, the color and its spectrum (afterimage) appear with maximum energy as being vivid, bright, dazzling, and brilliant. If the division is not total, however, part of the retina can remain undivided. A union of the quantitative intensive division with the qualitative division of the retina occurs. If the remainder is active, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they fade into white. If the remainder is inactive, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they darken into black. If the remainder is only partially inactive, then the color loses its energy by mixing with gray.

====§ 10====
If the activity of the retina is divided without a remainder, or if the remainder is active, then a color and its spectrum (afterimage) are bright or pale. When such a color and its spectrum are united, then the eye sees pure light or white. For example, the mixture of bright or pale red and green on the same retinal spot results in the impression there of light or white. White cannot be produced by mixing colored pigments. With colors from a prism, however, the production of white can be demonstrated by using a mixture of colored light from each of the three main pairs of complementary colors: red – green, orange – blue, or yellow – violet. White can be produced from two complementary opposite colors when both of the external causes of the colors excite the same retinal place at the same time. Newton claimed that white could be produced by the aggregation of his seven prismatic colors. He erroneously considered color to be in light instead of in the eye. White is the result of the combination of two opposite colors because their inactivity, or darkness, is removed when the two active parts of the retina combine.

According to Newton, refracted light must appear colored. With the [[Achromatic lens|achromatic refractor]], however, this is not the case. Newtonians explain this by saying that the achromatic refractor's [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] and [[flint glass]] refract light as a whole with equal intensity but [[Dispersion (optics)|disperse]] individual colors differently. According to Schopenhauer, achromatism results when refraction occurs in one direction in the concave lens and in another direction in the convex lens. A blue band then overlaps an orange band while a violet edge covers the yellow. The qualitatively divided retina (color) is thus reunited in full activity, resulting in achromatism (the absence of color).

If an observer looks through a prism at a white disk on a black background, two subsidiary images are seen. This is due to double refraction as the light bends twice, when entering and leaving the prism. With this double refraction, the two subsidiary images appear as one above and one below the main image. The distance of the two subsidiary images from the main image corresponds to the Newtonians' dispersion. The wideness or narrowness of the colored bands are, however, nonessential properties that differ according to the type of light-refracting substance that is used. The top of the upper image is violet. Below the violet is blue. The bottom of the lower image is orange. Above the orange is yellow. In this way, along with the white disk and the black background, four prismatic colors appear: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. This is in disagreement with Newton's claim that there are seven prismatic colors. As the upper image overlaps black, it is seen as violet. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as blue. As the lower image overlaps black, it is seen as orange. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as yellow. This shows how colors are produced when the image mixes with either lightness or darkness, in accordance with Goethe's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;"[L]ight and its absence, are necessary to the production of colour." "[C]olours throughout are to be considered as half-lights, as half-shadows...." ''Theory of Colours'', Introduction. "Colour itself is a degree of darkness...." ''Ibid.'', § 69. Color appears in semi-transparent media when dark passes over light or ''vice versâ''. ''Ibid.'', § 239.when&lt;/ref&gt;

====§ 11====
In the operation of a healthy eye, three kinds of division of retinal activity often occur at once. (1) The quantitative intensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in a loss of color energy and a deviation toward paleness or darkness; (2) After being excited by an external stimulant, the quantitative extensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in the retina being covered by many various juxtaposed spots of color sensation; (3) When the stimulation ceases, an [[afterimage]] (physiological spectrum) appears on each retinal spot.

====§ 12====
Afterimages (spectra) appear after a mechanical shock to the eye. The eye's activity is convulsively divided. Transitory pathological spectra appear from glare or dazzle. The retina's activity is disorganized from over-stimulation. A dazzled eye sees red when looking at brightness and green when looking into darkness. The retina's activity is forcefully divided by the powerful stimulation. When the eye strains to see in dim light, the retina is voluntarily activated and intensively divided. Blue eyeglasses counter the effect of orange candlelight and produce the effect of daylight. An additional proof of the subjective nature of color, namely that it is a function of the eye itself and is only secondarily related to external objects, is given by the [[Daguerrotype|daguerreotype]]. It objectively shows that color is not essential to the appearance of an object. Also, people who are [[Color blindness|color blind]] would see color if it was in the object and not in the eye.

====§ 13====
Colors and the laws by which they appear reside within the eye. The external cause of color is a stimulus which excites the retina and separates its polarity. Goethe had organized color into three classes: physiological, physical, and chemical. He proposed that the external causes of color are physical colors and chemical colors.&lt;ref&gt;"...we considered colours, as far as they may be said to belong to the eye itself, and to depend on an action and reaction of the organ; next they attracted our attention as perceived in, or by means of, colourless mediums; and lastly, where we could consider them as belonging to particular substances. We have denominated the first, physiological, the second, physical, the third, chemical colours. The first are fleeting and not to be arrested; the next are passing, but still for a while enduring; the last may be made permanent for any length of time." Goethe, ''Theory of Colours'', Introduction. The physiological colors are subjective and literally exist in the eye of the beholder. The physical colors are seen through cloudy or turbid media, like a glass or water prism. The chemical colors are objective and exist in the external object.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The investigations of Newton started with chemical (objective) colors as given and, from them, explained physical (seen through prism) colors. He ignored physiological (subjective) colors. Goethe also started with chemical (objective) colors. From them, he explained physical (seen through prism) colors and physiological (subjective) colors. Schopenhauer, on the contrary, started with physiological (subjective) colors as given. He then used them to explain physical (seen through prism) colors. He ignored chemical (objective) colors.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Physical colors=====
Physical colors are temporary. They exist when light combines with cloudy transparent or translucent media, such as smoke, fog, or a glass prism. They are comprehensible because we know that they result from part of the qualitative division of retinal activity. Light is the external physical stimulus of the retina's activity. The more that we know about the effect (color as physiological fact), the more we can know ''a priori'' about its external cause. (1) The external stimulus can only excite color, which is the retina's polar division. (2) There are no individual colors. Colors come in pairs because each color is the qualitative part of the retina's full activity. The remaining part is the color's complementary color. (3) There are an infinite number of colors. Three pairs are distinguished by names of their own, however, because the retina's activity is bipartitioned in a rational proportion that consists of simple numbers. (4) A color's external cause, acting as a stimulus, must be capable of being changed and infinitely modified as much as the retina's activity can be infinitely divided qualitatively. (5) In the eye, color is a cloudy shade of white. This shadiness is the retina's resting part while the other retinal part is active. Newton's theory asserts that each prismatic color is 1/7 of the whole of light. If an infinite number, instead of seven, of light rays is assumed, then each color would be an infinitely small fraction of the whole of light. Schopenhauer's theory, however, claims that yellow is ¾ as bright as white. Orange is 2/3, red is ½, green is ½, blue is 1/3, and violet is ¼ as bright as white. The external cause of color is a diminished light that imparts just as much light to the color as it imparts darkness to the color's complement. Unlike Goethe, for Schopenhauer the primary phenomenon, or limit of explanation, is not an external cause, but the "organic capacity of the retina to let its nervous activity appear in two qualitatively opposite halves, sometimes equal, sometimes unequal...."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''On Vision and Colors'', § 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The accepted conjecture regarding the retina's organic capacities was later published in the [[Young-Helmholtz theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chemical colors=====
Chemical colors are more durable properties of an external object, such as the red color of an apple. A chemical color is incomprehensible because we don't know its cause. Its appearance is only known from experience and it is not an essential part of the object. Chemical colors result from changes in an object's surface. A slight change in the surface may result in a different color. Color, therefore, is not an essential property of an object. This confirms the subjective nature of color.

====§ 14====
Schopenhauer said that he didn't have to worry about his discoveries being attributed to previous thinkers. "For, prior to 1816, never at any time did it occur to anyone to regard color ... as the halved activity of the retina, and accordingly to assign to each individual color its ''definite numerical fraction'' — a fraction that, with another color, goes to make up unity, this unity representing white or the full activity of the retina." Schopenhauer criticized scientists for thinking that color exists in external objects, instead of in the spectator's eye. Color as vibrations of an [[Luminiferous aether|ether]] was rejected by him. [[Fraunhofer lines]], according to Schopenhauer, do not exist in light itself. They result from the edges of the slit that light passes through.

==Letter to Eastlake==
In 1841, Schopenhauer wrote a letter in English to [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] whose English translation of Goethe's book on colors had recently been reviewed in several journals. Schopenhauer included a copy of his ''On Vision and Colors'' with the letter. He briefly communicated the main point of his book as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...if, bearing in mind the numerical fractions, (of the activity of the Retina) by which I express the 6 chief colours, You contemplate these colours singly, then You will find that only by this, and by no other theory on earth, You will come to understand the peculiar sensation, which every colour produces in your eye, and thereby get an insight into the very essence of every colour, and of colour in general. Likewise my theory alone gives the true sense in which the notion of complementary colours is to be taken, viz: as having no reference to light, but to the Retina, and not being a redintegration [restoration] of white light, but of the full action of the Retina, which by every colour undergoes a bipartition either in '''yellow (3/4) and violet (1/4)''' or in '''orange (2/3) and blue (1/3)''' or in '''red (1/2) and green (1/2)'''. This is in short the great mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here he explained that color results from the way that the retina reacts to sensation. The cause may be light or other pressure on the retina. The fractions of two complementary colors sum to unity. White is undivided, whole retinal activity.

==Reception==
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer's works and both seriously investigated [[color theory]]. [[Philipp Mainländer]] considered the work to be among the most important things ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Philosophie der Erlösung|last=Mainländer|first=Philipp|publisher=|year=1876|isbn=|location=|pages=420|quote=Es ist hier der richtige Ort, ein Verdienst Schopenhauer’s hervorzuheben, nämlich die ''wahre Theorie der Farbe'' geliefert zu haben. Er that es in seiner vortrefflichen Schrift: »Ueber das Sehn und die Farben«, die ich zu dem Bedeutendsten zähle, was je geschrieben worden ist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Itten]] based his work on Schopenhauer's theory of color. 

The mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer]] wrote: "Newton's theory of color analyzed light rays in their medium, but Goethe and Schopenhauer, more sensitive to the truth, considered color to be the polar splitting by the human eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brouwer|first=L.E.J.|date=|title=Life, Art, and Mysticism|url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1039886518|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|volume=Volume 37, Number 3, Summer 1996|pages=413|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicist [[Ernst Mach]] praised that "men such as Goethe, Schopenhauer" had started to "investigate the sensations ''themselves''" on the first page of his work ''Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/dieanalysederemp1902mach#page/n17/mode/2up|title=Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen|last=E. Mach|first=|publisher=Gustav Fischer|year=1902|isbn=|location=Jena|pages=20|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rudolf Arnheim]], Schopenhauer’s "&amp;hellip;basic conception of complementary pairs in retinal functioning strikingly anticipates the color theory of [[Ewald Hering]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Arnheim, ''Art and Visual Perception'', Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted that the [[Bohemia]]n physiologist, [[Johann Nepomuk Czermak|Professor Czermak]], acknowledged Schopenhauer’s relation to the [[Young-Helmholtz theory]] of color.&lt;ref&gt;"I recently found in the reports of the Vienna Academy of Sciences an article by Professor Czermak on Schopenhauer's theory of colors. [Johann Nepomuk Czermak, ''Über Schopenhauers Theorie der Farbe: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Farbenlehre'' (''Regarding Schopenhauer's theory of color: a contribution to the history of color theory''), Vienna, 1870].  This confirms that Schopenhauer discovered independently and originally what is now known as the ''[[Young–Helmholtz theory]]'' of colors: the latter and the Schopenhauerian theory correspond in a most marvelous way, down to the very infinitesimals. It is claimed that the whole point of departure, color as primarily a physiological product of the eye, was first established by Schopenhauer." (''Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche'', Edited and Translated by [[Christopher Middleton (poet)|Christopher Middleton]], [[Hackett Publishing Company]], Inc. Indianapolis/ Cambridge, Letter to Carl von Gersdorff,  Basel, December 12, 1870)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bosanquet]] claimed that Schopenhauer’s color theory was in accord with scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;"Schopenhauer's ingenious modification and defence of Goethe's colour theory appears to be in harmony with modern [1892] physiological ideas. He interprets Goethe's account of colour as light mixed with darkness, to mean that colour involves a partial activity of the retina (light), and a partial inactivity (dark), and lays down the principle that the retina always tends to a complete activity, the parts of which, if not simultaneous, as in white light, are successive, as in complementary images." (''A History of Aesthetic,'' [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], page 366, note 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Permian bronze casts'''—[[Perm]]ic and Western [[Siberia]]n [[animal style]] cult cast figurines—were the predominant form of Finno-Ugrian [[toreutics]] of the 3–12th centuries CE. It was spread throughout a large area of forests of the north-eastern Urals and western Siberia from the basins of the Kama and Vyatka to the Ob. In the Middle Ages, these territories were inhibited mostly by the Ugrian tribes, ancestors of the present day Hungarians and Ob-Ugrians – the [[Khanty]] and the [[Mansi people|Mansi]] people. Their style is referred to as the 'Permian [[animal style]].'&lt;ref name="Autio 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Eero Autio|year=2001|title=THE PERMIAN ANIMAL STYLE|url=http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol18/permian.pdf|journal=Folklore|location=Tartu|volume=18&amp;19|pages=162–186|issn=1406-0957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First collections of these works of arts and their scholarly research date back to the end of the 19th century. Despite over a century of research into the field, Perm animal style still remains one of the most mysterious cultural phenomena of Eurasia. This can be explained by the absence of written tradition of its creators and lack of external historic evidence about the creators of the bronze images in the heyday of the animal style. The golden age of cult metallurgy began immediately after the period of the Great Migrations (4-5th centuries CE) and continued in the epoch of the medieval Urals and Siberia of 6-11th centuries CE. A large collection was amassed by the [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]] family in [[Perm]].&lt;ref name="Autio 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stroganoff - collectors of antiquities in Perm |work=ARTinvestment.RU |date=2010-11-28 |url=http://artinvestment.ru/en/news/exhibitions/20101128_stroganovy_hermitage_perm.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers point to the influence of Scytho-Sarmatian animal style on the development of cult toreutics of the forests of the north: famous animal battle scenes, vertical model of the Universe in the form of three worlds – three levels of the plaques and the cult of the great mother-goddess are present in both styles.Perm animal style objects include metalwork of bronze with the usage of single- or double-sided forms for casting, bone and wooden carvings, engravings on metal and bone objects. Figures depicted on the images are elks, rain-deers, bears, fur-bearing and other types of animals, horses, different waterfowl and birds of prey, snakes, insects and a number of “complex creatures” of mixed nature (hybrids), mixed zoomorphic and anthropomorphic half-human creatures; there are also a number of images of horsemen. The stories, which the Perm animal style plaques tell, are numerous and diverse.The objects are found in the hoards, on the sites of the temples, among the skeletons, in burials, as part of sacrificial complexes or on the sites of metallurgical workshops. Most of the bronze artifacts were used as a cult figures for the sacred rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/v/ob-etnicheskoy-prinadlezhnosti-permskogo-srednevekovogo-zverinogo-stilya|title=On the Ethnicity of the Permian Medieval Animal Style|last=Belavin|first=A.M.|date=2001|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that the sculptural embodiment of a spirit or an ancestor  is not the monument for him, neither it is the place where the spirit dwells, but the deity itself. Wooden or metal ingots and the spirits or souls cocooned inside them are inseparable unit, so that the figurine becomes a divine piece of wood or metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Religion der Jugra-Vlker 1–2: Mit Untersttzun des staatlichen Literaturfondes. Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia|last=Karjalainen|first=K.F.|publisher=Porvoo|year=1922|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kustaa Fredrik Karjalainen uses the Khanty notion of “tonx” to describe the idea of one of human souls. The images were made for “tonx”. “After a piece of wood has been given a shape of a human or after a tin cast, having a certain human form, has hardened, it is important to transfer or to indwell in it a “tonx” of the spirit which the figurine depicts, and only after that the image becomes a “tonx” to which necessary honours can be given".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Religion der Jugra-Vlker 1–2: Mit Untersttzun des staatlichen Literaturfondes. Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia|last=Karjalainen|first=K.F.|publisher=Porvoo|year=1921|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specialists believe that for making figurines the real wooden models were used which were painted or rubbed with the sacrificial blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minasyan|first=R.S.|date=1992|title=Tehnika lit’ja "chudskih obrazkov" [= The technology of the casting of "Chud’ images"]|url=|journal=Arheologicheskij sbornik|volume=32|pages=125–127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raw material for copper casting were cupriferrous sandstones of the Upper Kama. The alloys mostly consisted of copper (up to 86%), tin (10-17%), sometimes zinc (up to 7%) and arsenic. In the first millennium CE in the Upper Kama, as well in other regions of European North-East and Ob region, the coppers used were high in tin and zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lomovatovskaja kul’tura v Verhnem Prikam’e (Lomovatovo culture in the Upper Kama region)|last=Goldina|first=R.D.|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=Irkutsk|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objects of the animal style are usually divided into two groups, according to their function and the sphere of usage. The first group is Perm-[[Pechora River|Pechora]] bronze open-work objects having worship purpose. Certain objects from this group have a complicated composition, a sophisticated story behind them and many-leveled structure.Most artistically expressive compositions are 3-leveled cosmological compositions with a goddess in the center. Upper level consists of the heads of elks, heavenly faces, and soul birds associated with the Higher World of heavenly creatures, middle level is an earthly world of people and animals. The ruler of the Middle world is a deity (mother goddess) depicted in the center, and an animal at her feet is as a rule hybrid animal consisting of parts of different terrestrial animals – it marks the borders of Lower invisible world.The hallmark of the Perm animal style is the images of elk peoples, and to be more precise, the image of man-bird-elk, found nowhere else in the territory of Eurasia.The second group is the Transural, Western-Siberia animal style. There are a lot of applied and decorative artifacts – decorations, including costume decorations – belt plates, buckles, clasps, bracelets with zoomorphic images, pendants, beads, pommels, sheaths, needle cases, ear-picks, stills and combs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enc.permculture.ru/showObject.do?object=1803686781|title=Source of the bibliography Ural Historical Encyclopedia. - 2 nd ed., Pererab. and additional.|last=Viktorova|first=V.D.|last2=Fedorova|first2=N.V.|date=2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mythological stories could be seen on the plaques, depicting “complex animals” – mixed bears and fur-bearing animals, on figured pendants in the form of waterfowl, horses, in the images of birds of prey on the pommels.

According to the sphere of usage, cult metalwork objects can be devised into groups: for instance, the ones protecting against diseases (they were as a norm kept at home), the others – “spirits of the happiness” – bringing luck as a response to the sacrifices (they were inside community temples).The diversity of cult artifacts and mythological stories on the plaques presuppose the existence of developed mythology of the creators of the animal style. Perm Animal Style appeared on the territory of Scytho-Sarmatian world at the beginning of the first millennium CE and disappeared at the beginning of the second millennium, on the eve of the Mongolian invasions. The last traces of this civilization can be observed in the traditional culture of the Ob-Ugrians – the Khantys and the Mansis. Casting of objects for worship existed for over a thousand years and ensured the unity of the pagan world of the Urals and Western Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ural-Siberian cultic casting in myth and ritual|last=Balakin|first=Yu.V.|publisher=Novosibirsk Science|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Počitelj''' is a village in the [[Čapljina]] municipality in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is located in the [[Herzegovina-Neretva Canton]] in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The historic site of Počitelj is located on the left bank of the river [[Neretva]], on the main [[Mostar]] to [[Metković]] road, and it is about 30 km to the south of [[Mostar]].

The village is built in  a natural [[karst]] amphiteatre along the Neretva river. The walled town of Počitelj evolved in the period from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Architecturally, the stone-constructed parts of the town are a [[Citadel Počitelj|fortified complex]], in which two stages of evolution are evident: medieval, and Ottoman.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5092/UNESCO: The historic urban site of Počitelj &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
The first recorded reference to Počitelj dates from 1444, in charters by King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] and in 1448 by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. {{cn-span|It was mentioned as a fortified town  of the Dubrava district, ruled by Duke Stjepan Vukčič Kosača.|date=August 2016}} In the period between 1463-1471 the town housed a Hungarian garrison and was fortified into a strategic defence stronghold.  In 1471, following a brief siege, the town was conquered by the Ottomans. It lost its strategic significance. It remained within the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1878. From 1782 to 1879 Počitelj was the seat of a''kadiluk'' (area under the jurisdiction of a [[qadi]], or judge) and the center of the Počitelj military district from 1713 to 1835.

The significance and the town's appearance has altered during the course of its history.  As far as the development of Počitelj goes, three significant periods can be distinguished: 
# The period of the Hungarian King [[Matthias Corvinus]] during which the town had a major strategic importance (1463–1471)
# The period of the settlement development under the Ottoman Empire with the erection of public buildings: mosques, [[imaret]], [[maktab]], [[madrasa]], [[Turkish bath|hamam]], [[caravanserai|han]] and the clock-tower (1471–1698). 
# The period after the Venetians conquered and destroyed [[Gabela]] (1698–1878), the main Ottoman fortification facing [[Dalmatia]], and recovery of Počitelj's strategic importance.

After the establishment of Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, Počitelj lost its strategic importance and started deteriorating rapidly. The population declined gradually. The loss of the town's strategic role assisted in the preservation of the original urban architectural ensemble, so that the town remained in its original form to present day.

The entire historic urban site of Počitelj and surrounding area suffered extensive collateral damage during the 1992-1996 [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Namely, it was heavily damaged by Croatian forces during the 1993 [[Bosnian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gort|first=Jerald|title=Religion, Conflict and Reconciliation: Multifaith Ideals and Realities|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-1460-1|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Layton|first=Robert|title=Destruction and Conservation of Cultural Property|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-21695-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sells"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sells|first=Michael|title=The Bridge Betrayed: Religion and Genocide in Bosnia|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21662-8|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the bombing, Počitelj's sixteenth-century master works of Islamic art and architecture were destroyed and a large part of the town's population was displaced.&lt;ref name="layton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sells"/&gt;

As proposed by the University of York, United Kingdom, and the University of Sarajevo, Počitelj was in 1996 named by the [[World Monuments Watch]] as one of the world's 100 most endangered cultural heritage sites.
In  the year 2000 the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Government initiated the Programme of the permanent protection of Počitelj. The programme includes the protection of cultural heritage from deterioration, restoration of damaged and destroyed buildings, encouraging the return of the refugees and displaced persons to their homes and the long-term protection and revitalization of the Počitelj's historic urban area. The Programme is on-going.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

As of 2008, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) expressed concern over the proposed construction of a nearby highway, Corridor Vc.  Initial plans include a 1,000-meter long, 100-meter high bridge over the Neretva river.  It is feared that the construction will result in a “physical, visual and ecological degradation and devastation of this cultural and historical unity and its authentic surroundings.” &lt;ref&gt;ICOMOS Bosnia-Herzegovina (2008).

==Historic sites==
* The '''Gavrakanpetanović house''': built at the end of the 16th century, it was named after and housed the captains of Počitelj, who belonged to the Gavrakanpetanovič family. It is typical example of the residential architecture of the village. It is the only house in town to have separate rooms for men and women. The house became the residence of an artists' colony between 1961 and 1975, one of which was the Italian painter [[Vittorio Miele]]. This was the longest operating artist colony in Southeast Europe. During the Bosnian war, the house was set on fire. It was restored in its original state in 2003.
* The '''Šišman Ibrahim-pašina džamija''' or '''Hajji Alija''' mosque: built in 1563 by Hajji-Alija, son of Musa. It was repaired in the 17th century by Šišman Ibrahim pasha. The locals gave the mosque afterwards his name. The domed mosque is notable for its special acoustics. The mosque was restored in the 1970s, but badly damaged during the Bosnian War in 1993. It was restored again in 2002.
* The '''Kula''', a silo-shaped fort overlooking the village from the top of the hill. It used to house watchmen and military as a guard against possible intrusions from the Neretva valley.
* The '''Sahat Kula''', a bell tower located closer to the river and at the south side of the old town.

== Demographics ==
No up-to-date data currently exists for Počitelj and its demographic profile was significantly altered after the Bosnian war. The last demographics research was conducted in 1991 and its results were as follows:

Population Total: 905&lt;ref&gt;Official results from the book: Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine - Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]] - 660 (72.92%)
* [[Croats]] - 172 (19.00%)
* [[Yugoslavs]] - 36 (3.97%)
* [[Serbs]] - 20 (2.20%)
* others and unknown - 17 (1.87%)

== Significance ==
Počitelj represents one of the few urban ensembles in Bosnia and Herzegovina that were preserved in their integrity to the present times. It was also developed through the several phases of the history beginning with the medieval period. Its significant strategic role from the 13th to 17th century gave its inhabitants the power to build one of the most important, and best preserved ensembles within the city walls in the region. 
The town can be compared with some of the noted world heritage sites as the old towns of Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina), [[Ohrid]] ([[Republic of Macedonia]]), [[Safranbolu]] (Turkey), [[Gjirokaster]] (Albania). Počitelj's layout and use of building materials put it into the group of Ottoman-Mediterranean types of small settlements.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

Much of these derive from the influence of [[List of martial arts|various international]] [[martial arts]]. An additional aspect of combat with [[improvised weapon]]ry is sometimes included to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/902658-wwe-the-50-best-props-in-wrestling-history|title=WWE: The 50 Best Props in Wrestling History|last=Massey|first=Daniel|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/895919-the-top-10-best-illegal-weapons-in-pro-wrestling-history#slide0|title=The Top 10 Best Illegal Weapons in Pro Wrestling History|last=Clark|first=Tom|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These facts were once kept [[Trade secret|highly secret]], but are now a widely accepted [[open secret]].

Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e. interviews) will often directly acknowledge the dramatic and "fixed" nature of the spectacle.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
{{main|History of professional wrestling}}
Originating as a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe&lt;ref name="FILA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011195312/http://fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 October 2011|title=Roots and history of Olympic wrestling|last=Anon|work=International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|publisher=FILA|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as a [[sideshow]] exhibition in [[North America]]n [[traveling carnival]]s and [[vaudeville]] [[music hall|halls]], professional wrestling grew into a standalone genre of entertainment with many diverse variations in cultures around the globe, and is now a billion dollar entertainment industry. Since the 1980s, local forms have greatly declined in Europe,&lt;!---OLD SCHOOL EUROPEAN PRO WRESTLING STILL EXISTS IN THE uK AND TO A LESSER EXTENT FRANCE AND GERMANY ---&gt; wrestling from North America has experienced several different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century and a half of existence and has been exported back to Europe to fill the cultural gap left by the aforementioned decline of local versions. The advent of television gave professional wrestling a new outlet, and wrestling (along with [[boxing]]) was instrumental in making [[pay-per-view]] a viable method of [[Digital distribution|content delivery]].

== Scope and influence ==

[[File:Christopher Daniels 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A wrestler ([[Christopher Daniels]]) leaps off the top rope]]
Show wrestling has become especially prominent in [[Central America|Central]]/North America, Japan and Europe ([[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom|especially the United Kingdom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2007/10/22/encuesta-de-mitofsky-revela-que-la-lucha-no-es-el-segundo-deporte-mas-popular-en-mexico/|title=Encuesta De Mitofsky Revela Que La Lucha No Es El Segundo Deporte Mas Popular En Mexico|author=Yoav|date=October 22, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2009|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804090134/http://superluchas.net/2007/10/22/encuesta-de-mitofsky-revela-que-la-lucha-no-es-el-segundo-deporte-mas-popular-en-mexico/|archivedate=August 4, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], there was a very popular wrestling television program from the 1960s to the early 1980s called ''[[Telecatch]]''. High-profile figures in the sport have become celebrities or [[cultural icon]]s in their native or adopted home countries.

Although professional wrestling started out as small acts in [[sideshow]]s, traveling [[circus]]es and [[traveling carnival|carnivals]], today it is a billion-dollar industry. Revenue is drawn from ticket sales, network television broadcasts, [[pay-per-view]] broadcasts, branded merchandise and home video. Pro wrestling was instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Annual shows such as [[WrestleMania]], [[TNA Bound for Glory|Bound for Glory]] and formerly [[Starrcade]] are among the highest-selling pay-per-view programming each year. In modern day, internet programming has been utilized by a number of companies to air web shows, internet pay per views (IPPVs) or on-demand content, helping to generate internet-related revenue earnings from the evolving [[World Wide Web]].

Home video sales dominate the [[Billboard charts]] Recreational Sports DVD sales, with wrestling holding anywhere from 3 to 9 of the top 10 spots every week.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard Recreational Sports Weekly Top 10 -- [http://www.letstalkwrestling.com/search/label/Billboard%20Recrational%20Sports%20DVD%20charts Billboard Sports Weekly DVD Sales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107004140/http://www.letstalkwrestling.com/search/label/Billboard%20Recrational%20Sports%20DVD%20charts |date=2015-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its persistent cultural presence and to its novelty within the performing arts, wrestling constitutes [[#Study and analysis of professional wrestling|a recurring topic in both academia and the media]]. Several documentaries have been produced looking at professional wrestling, most notably, ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'' directed by Barry W. Blaustein, and ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows|Wrestling with Shadows]]'' featuring wrestler [[Bret Hart]] and directed by Paul Jay. There have also been many fictional depictions of wrestling; the 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'' received several [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations and began a career revival for star [[Mickey Rourke]].

Currently, the largest professional wrestling company worldwide is the United States-based [[WWE]], which bought out many smaller regional companies in the late 20th century, as well as its primary US competitors [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in early 2001. Other prominent professional wrestling companies worldwide include the US-based [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|Impact Wrestling]], formerly known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH); [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] and [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide]] in Mexico; and the Japanese [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]], [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] leagues.

{{main|Kayfabe|Shoot (professional wrestling)}}
When talking about professional wrestling, there are two levels: the "in-show" happenings that are presented through the shows, and happenings which are outside the scope of performance (in other words, are [[real life]]) but have implications on the performance, such as performer contracts, legitimate injuries, etc. Because actual events are often co-opted by writers for incorporation into storylines for the performers, the lines are often blurred and become confused.

Special care must be taken when talking about people who perform under their own name. The actions of the character should be considered fictional events, wholly separate from the life of the performer. This is similar to other entertainers who perform with a persona that shares their own name (such as [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Kurt Angle (character)|his fictional persona]]).

Some wrestlers would incorporate elements of their real-life personalities into their characters, even if they and their in-ring persona have different names.

=== Kayfabe ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Historians are unsure at what point wrestling changed from competitive catch wrestling into worked entertainment. Those who participated felt that maintenance of a constant and complete illusion for all who were not involved was necessary to keep audience interest. For decades, wrestlers lived their public lives as though they were their characters.

The practice of keeping the illusion, and the various methods used to do so, came to be known as "[[kayfabe]]" within wrestling circles, or "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|working]] the [[Confidence trick|marks]]". An entire lexicon of slang jargon and euphemism developed to allow performers to communicate without outsiders' knowledge of what was being said.

Occasionally a performer will deviate from the intended sequence of events. This is known as a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]]. Sometimes shoot-like elements are included in wrestling stories to blur the line between performance and reality. These are known as "worked shoots". However, the vast majority of events in professional wrestling are preplanned and improvised within accepted boundaries.

Gradually, the predetermined nature of professional wrestling became an open secret, as prominent figures in the wrestling business (including World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon) began to publicly admit that wrestling was entertainment, not competition. This public reveal has garnered mixed reactions from the wrestling community, as some feel that exposure ruins the experience to the spectators as does [[Exposure (magic)|exposure]] in [[Magic (illusion)|illusionism]]. Despite the public admission of the theatrical nature of professional wrestling, many U.S. states still [[Regulation of sport|regulate]] professional wrestling as they do other professional competitive sports. For example, New York State still regulates "professional wrestling" through the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] (SAC).

=== Aspects of performing art ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Professional wrestling shows can be considered a form of [[theater in the round]], with the ring, ringside area, and entryway comprising a [[stage (theatre)|stage]]. However, there is a much more limited concept of a [[fourth wall]] than in most theatric performances. The audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as [[spectator sport|spectators]] to the sporting event being portrayed, and are encouraged to interact as such. This leads to a high level of audience participation; in fact, their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds.&lt;ref name="Barthes" /&gt; Often, individual matches will be part of a longer story line conflict between "[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]]" (often shortened to just "faces") and "[[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]]". "Faces" (the "good guys") are those whose actions are intended to encourage the audience to cheer, while "heels" (the "bad guys") act to draw the spectators' ire.&lt;ref name="HSW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm |title=How Pro Wrestling Works |last=Grabianowski |first=Ed |work=HowStuffWorks, Inc. |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |accessdate=2014-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LDla2zy5?url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm |archivedate=2013-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
There is no governing authority for professional wrestling rules, although there is a general standard which has developed. Each [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] has their own variation, but all are similar enough to avoid confusion most of the time. Any rule described here is simply a standard, and may or may not correspond exactly with any given promotion's ruleset.

Due to the staged nature of wrestling, these are not actual "rules"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling2.htm|title=How Pro Wrestling Works|date=2006-01-13|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that they would be considered in similar articles about actual sports like [[freestyle wrestling]]. Instead, the "rules" in this article are implemented and supposedly enforced for the sake of [[suspension of disbelief]] (known as [[kayfabe]] in the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|jargon of the business]]).

=== General structure ===
Matches are held between two or more sides ("corners"). Each corner may consist of one wrestler, or a team of two or more. Most team matches are governed by tag team rules (see below). Other matches are free-for-alls, with multiple combatants but no teams. In all variants, there can be only one winning team or wrestler.

The standard method of scoring is the "fall", which is accomplished by:
* [[Pin (professional wrestling)|Pinning]] the opponent's shoulders to the mat, typically for three seconds (though other times have been used)
* Forcing the opponent to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]]
* [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|Disqualification]] of the opponent
* The opponent remaining outside the ring for too long ([[#Countout|countout]])
* [[Knockout|Knocking out]] or otherwise incapacitating the opponent
These are each explained in greater detail below. Typically, pinfalls and submissions must occur within the ring area, however there are times where it may be stipulated otherwise.

Most wrestling matches last for a set number of falls, with the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls, submissions, or countouts being the winner. Historically, matches were wrestled to 3 falls ("best 2 out of 3") or 5 falls ("best 3 out of 5"). The standard for modern matches is one fall. However, even though it is now standard, many announcers will explicitly state this (e.g. "The following contest is set for one fall with a 20-minute time limit.") These matches are given a time limit; if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit, the match is declared a draw. Modern matches are generally given a 10- to 30-minute time limit for standard matches; title matches can go for up to one hour. British wrestling matches held under [[Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules]] are 2 out of 3 falls.

An alternative is a match set for a prescribed length of time, with a running tally of falls. The entrant with the most falls at the end of the time limit is declared the winner. This is usually for 20, 30 or 60 minutes, and is commonly called an [[Iron Man match]]. This type of match can be modified so that fewer types of falls are allowed.

In matches with multiple competitors, an elimination system may be used. Any wrestler who has a fall scored against them is forced out of the match, and the match continues until only one remains. However, it is much more common when more than two wrestlers are involved to simply go one fall, with the one scoring the fall, regardless of who they scored it against, being the winner. In championship matches, this means that, unlike one-on-one matches (where the champion can simply disqualify himself or get himself counted out to retain the title via the '''Champion&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Advantage'''), the champion does ''not'' have to be pinned or involved in the decision to lose the championship. However, [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] champions often find advantages, not in Champion's Advantage, but in the use of weapons and outside interference, as these poly-sided matches tend to involve [[hardcore wrestling|no holds barred]] rules.

[[File:Professional wrestling ladder match.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A WWE [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], 2009]]
Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the [[ladder match]]. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize).  Another common specialty match is known as the [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]]. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on this type of match is the WWE's [[Royal Rumble]] where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match and other wrestlers follow in 90 second intervals (previously 2 minutes) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring. All other rules stay the same. For more match types, see [[Professional wrestling match types]].

Every match must be assigned a rule keeper known as a [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]], who is the final arbitrator. In multi-man [[lucha libre]] matches, two referees are used, one inside the ring and one outside.

Due to the [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] role that referees play in wrestling of serving as liaison between the bookers backstage and the wrestlers in the ring (the role of being a final arbitrator is merely [[kayfabe]]), the referee is present, even in matches that do not at first glance appear to require a referee (such as a ladder match, as it is no holds barred, and the criteria for victory could theoretically be assessed from afar). Although their actions are also frequently scripted for dramatic effect, referees are subject to certain general rules and requirements to maintain the theatrical appearance of unbiased authority. The most basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared for a fall or disqualification. This allows for [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] characters to gain a scripted advantage by distracting or disabling the referee to perform some ostensibly illegal maneuver on their opponent. Most referees are unnamed and essentially anonymous, though some wrestling promotions have let their officials reveal their names.

Special [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|guest referee]]s may be used from time to time; by virtue of their celebrity status, they are often scripted to dispense with the appearance of neutrality and use their influence to unfairly influence the outcome of the match for added dramatic impact. Face special referees will often fight back against hostile heel wrestlers, particularly if the special referee is either a wrestler himself or a famous martial artist (such as [[Tito Ortiz]] at the main event at [[Hard Justice (2005)|TNA Hard Justice 2005]]).

For heel special referees, common ways of assisting the heel wrestler to obtain victory include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Counting fast whenever the face wrestler is being pinned, while counting slow, faking a wrist or eye injury, or even refusing to count at all, when the heel wrestler is being pinned.
* Allowing heel wrestlers to use blatantly illegal tactics that most normal referees would instantly disqualify for, while not extending these relaxed rules to face wrestlers.
* Disqualifying the face wrestler for unfair reasons, such as an accidental attack on the referee or a maneuver that appears to be an illegal attack.
* Feigning unconsciousness far longer than they would normally otherwise be out, or using convenient distractions to look away from the wrestlers for a prolonged period of time. This allows for greater opportunities for run-ins or use of illegal weapons and tactics, or can be used as an excuse to avoid counting a pinfall or calling a submission in the face's favor. The referee often instantly up the moment the heel wrestler seems to have an advantage, usually the moment the heel goes for the pinfall or applies a submission finisher.
* Actually assisting in attacking the face wrestler.

Matches are held within a [[wrestling ring]], an elevated square [[canvas]] mat with posts on each corner. A cloth apron hangs over the edges of the ring. Three horizontal ropes or cables surround the ring, suspended with turnbuckles which are connected to the posts. For safety, the ropes are padded at the turnbuckles and cushioned mats surround the floor outside the ring. Guardrails or a similar barrier enclose this area from the audience. Wrestlers are generally expected to stay within the confines of the ring, though matches sometimes end up outside the ring, and even in the audience, to add excitement.

=== Tag rules ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
{{main|Tag team}}
[[Image:Jeff-Hardy-Dropkick,-RLA-Melb-10.11.2007 filtered.jpg|thumb|250px|A tag team match in progress: [[Jeff Hardy]] kicks [[Umaga (wrestler)|Umaga]], while their respective partners, [[Triple H]] and [[Randy Orton]], encourage them and reach for the tags]]
In some team matches, only one entrant from each team may be designated as the "legal" or "active" wrestler at any given moment. Two wrestlers must make physical contact (typically palm-to-palm) to transfer this legal status. This is known as a "tag", with the participants "tagging out" and "tagging in". Typically the wrestler who is tagging out has a 5-second count to leave the ring, whereas the one tagging in can enter the ring at any time, resulting in heels legally double-teaming a face.

The non-legal wrestlers must remain outside the ring or other legal area at all times (and avoid purposeful contact with the opposing wrestlers) or face reprimand from the referee. In most promotions, the wrestler to be tagged in must be touching the turnbuckle on his corner, or a cloth strap attached to the turnbuckle.

Some multi-wrestler matches allow for a set number of legal wrestlers, and a legal wrestler may tag out to any other wrestler, regardless of team. In these matches, the tag need not be a mutual effort, and this results in active wrestlers being tagged out against their will, or non-legal wrestlers forced to enter the battle.

Sometimes, poly-sided matches that pit every man for himself will incorporate tagging rules. Outside of kayfabe, this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action (as these matches tend to go on for long periods of time), and to make the action in the ring easier to choreograph. One of the most mainstream examples of this is the Four-Corner match, the most common type of match in the [[WWE]] before it was replaced with its equivalent Fatal Four-Way; four wrestlers, each for himself, fight in a match, but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time. The other two are positioned in the corner, and tags can be made between any two wrestlers.

In a Texas Tornado Tag Team match, all the competitors are legal in the match, and tagging in and out is not necessary. All matches fought under [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore rules]] (such as no disqualification, no holds barred, [[ladder match]], etc.) are all contested under ''[[de facto]]'' Texas Tornado rules, since the lack of ability of a referee to issue a disqualification renders any tagging requirements moot.

Regardless of rules of tagging, a wrestler cannot pin his or her own tag team partner, even if it is technically possible from the rules of the match (e.g. Texas Tornado rules, or a three-way tag team match). This is called the "Outlaw Rule" because the first team to attempt to use that (in an attempt to unfairly retain their tag team titles) was the [[New Age Outlaws]].

[[File:Big John defeats Sensuelle Rosé.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An example of pinfall]]
To score by pinfall, a wrestler must pin both his opponent's shoulders against the mat while the referee slaps the mat three times (referred to as a "three count"). This is the most common form of defeat. The pinned wrestler must also be on his back and, if s/he is lying on his stomach, it usually does not count. A count may be started at any time that a wrestler's shoulders are down (both shoulders touching the mat), back-first and any part of the opponent's body is lying over the wrestler. This often results in pins that can easily be kicked out of, if the defensive wrestler is even slightly conscious. For example, an attacking wrestler who is half-conscious may simply drape an arm over an opponent, or a cocky wrestler may place his foot gently on the opponent's body, prompting a three-count from the referee.

Illegal pinning methods include using the ropes for leverage and hooking the opponent's clothing, which are therefore popular cheating methods for [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], unless certain stipulations make such an advantage legal. Such pins as these are rarely seen by the referee and are subsequently often used by heels and on occasion by cheating faces to win matches. Even if it is noticed, it is rare for such an attempt to result in a disqualification (see below) and instead it simply results in nullification of the pin attempt, so the heel wrestler rarely has anything to lose for trying it anyway.

Occasionally, there are instances where a pinfall is made where both wrestlers' shoulders were on the mat for the three-count. This situation will most likely lead to a draw, and in some cases a continuation of the match or a future match to determine the winner.

==== Submission ====
To score by submission, the wrestler must make his opponent give up, usually, but not necessarily, by putting him in a submission hold (e.g. figure four leg-lock, arm-lock, sleeper-hold).

[[File:John Cena performs STF against Mark Henry.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John Cena]] performs his [[Professional wrestling holds#STF|STF]] submission hold against [[Mark Henry]]]]
A wrestler may voluntarily submit by verbally informing the referee (usually used in moves such as the Mexican Surfboard, where all four limbs are incapacitated, making tapping impossible). Also, since [[Ken Shamrock]] popularized it in 1997, a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission by "[[Submission (combat sports)|tapping out]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabianowski| first=Ed|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling2.htm|title=Rules of professional wrestling|publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com|date=2006-01-13| accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, tapping a free hand against the mat or against an opponent. Occasionally, a wrestler will reach for a rope (see rope breaks below), only to put his hand back on the mat so he can crawl towards the rope some more; this is NOT a submission, and the referee decides what his intent is. Submission was initially a large factor in professional wrestling, but following the decline of the submission-oriented [[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can]] style from mainstream professional wrestling, the submission largely faded. Despite this, some wrestlers, such as [[Chris Jericho]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Bret Hart]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Dean Malenko]], [[Chris Benoit]], and [[Tazz]], became famous for winning matches via submission. A wrestler with a signature submission technique is portrayed as better at applying the hold, making it more painful or more difficult to get out of than others who use it, or can be falsely credited as inventing the hold (such as when Tazz popularized the [[kata ha jime]] judo choke in pro wrestling as the "Tazzmission").

Since all contact between the wrestlers must cease if any part of the body is touching, or underneath, the ropes, many wrestlers will attempt to break submission holds by deliberately grabbing the bottom ropes. This is called a "rope break", and it is one of the most common ways to break a submission hold. Most holds leave an arm or leg free, so that the person can tap out if he wants. Instead, he uses these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes (the bottom one is the most common, as it is nearest the wrestlers, though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as [[Chris Masters]]' Master Lock) or drape his foot across, or underneath one. Once this has been accomplished, and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee, the referee will demand that the offending wrestler break the hold, and start counting to five if the wrestler does not. If the referee reaches the count of five, and the wrestler still does not break the hold, he is disqualified.

If a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] decides that his client wrestler should tap out, but cannot convince the wrestler himself to do so, he may "throw in the towel" (by literally taking a gym towel and hurling it into the ring where the referee can see it). This is the same as a submission, as in [[kayfabe]] the manager is considered the wrestlers [[Law of agency|agent]] and therefore authorized to make formal decisions (such as forfeiting a match) on the client's behalf.

==== Knockout ====
Passing out in a submission hold constitutes a loss by [[knockout]]. To determine if a wrestler has passed out in WWE, the referee usually picks up and drops his hand. If it drops to the mat or floor three consecutive times without the wrestler having the strength to hold it up, the wrestler is considered to have passed out. At one point this was largely ignored. However, the rule is now much more commonly observed for safety reasons. If the wrestler has passed out, the opponent then scores by submission.

A wrestler can also win by knockout if he does not resort to submission holds, but stills pummels his opponent to the point that he is completely out cold. To check for a knockout in this manner a referee would wave his hand in front of the wrestlers' face and, if the wrestler does not react in any way, the referee would award the victory to the other wrestler.

==== Countout ====
A countout (alternatively "count-out" or "count out") happens when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for the referee to count to ten (twenty in some promotions) and thus disqualified. The count is broken and restarted when a wrestler in the ring exits the ring. Playing into this, some wrestlers would "milk" the count by sliding in the ring and immediately sliding back out. As he was technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting again, it is sufficient to restart the count. This is often referred to by commentators as "breaking the count". Heels often use this tactic in order to buy themselves more time to catch their breath, or to attempt to frustrate their [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] opponents.

If all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time, the referee would begin a count (usually ten seconds, twenty in Japan). If nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count, the match is ruled a draw. Any participant who stands up in time would end the count for everyone else, while in a Last Man Standing match this form of a countout is the only way that the match can end, so the referee would count when one or more wrestlers are down and one wrestler standing up before the 10-count does not stop the count for another wrestler who is still down.

In some promotions (and most major modern ones), Championships cannot change hands via a countout, unless the on-screen authority declares it for at least one match, although in others, championships may change hands via countout. Heels are known to take advantage of this and will intentionally get counted out when facing difficult opponents, especially when defending championships.

==== Disqualification ====
Disqualification (sometimes abbreviated as "DQ") occurs when a wrestler violates the match's rules, thus losing automatically. Although a countout can technically be considered a disqualification (as it is, for all intents and purposes, an automatic loss suffered as a result of violating a match rule), the two concepts are often distinct in wrestling. A no disqualification match can still end by countout (although this is rare). Typically, a match must be declared a "no holds barred" match, a "street fight" or some other term, in order for both disqualifications and countouts to be waived.

Disqualification from a match is called for a number of reasons:
* Performing any illegal holds or maneuvers, such as refusing to break a hold when an opponent is in the ropes, hair-pulling, choking or biting an opponent, or repeatedly punching with a closed fist. These violations are usually subject to a referee-administered five count and will result in disqualification if the wrestler does not cease the offending behavior in time. Note that the ban on closed fists does not apply if the attacker is in middair when the punch connects, like with [[Jerry Lawler]]'s diving fist drop or [[Roman Reigns]]' [[Superman Punch]].
* Attacking an opponent's eye, such as raking it, poking it, [[Eye-gouging|gouging it]], punching it or other severe attacks to the eye.
* Any outside interference involving a person not involved in the match striking or holding a wrestler. Sometimes (depending on the promotion and uniqueness of the situation), if a heel attempts to interfere but is ejected from the ring by a wrestler or referee before this occurs, there may not be a disqualification. In this disqualification method, the wrestler being attacked by the foreign member is awarded the win. Sometimes, however, this can work in heels' favor. In February 2009, [[Shawn Michaels]], who was under the [[kayfabe]] employment of [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]], interfered in a match and super kicked JBL in front of the referee to get his employer the win via "outside interference".
* Striking an opponent with a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|foreign object]] (an object not permitted by the rules of the match; see [[hardcore wrestling]]) (sometimes the win decision can be reversed if the referee spots the weapon before pin attempt or after the match because they tried to strike when referee is either distracted or knocked out).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wgcsIi1RBI World Champion Bully Ray vs. Samoa Joe - Oct 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using any kind of "banned" move (see below for details).
* A direct [[Groin attack|low blow to the groin]] (unless the rules of the match specifically allow this).
* Intentionally laying hands on the referee.
* Pulling an opponent's mask off during a match (this is illegal in Mexico, and sometimes in Japan).
* Throwing an opponent over the top rope during a match (this move is still illegal in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], however, in cases like the [[Royal Rumble]] match, this will be allowed in order to eliminate a wrestler from the match.)
* In a mixed tag team match, a man hitting a woman(intergender), or a normal sized wrestler attacking an opposing midget wrestler(tag team matches involving teams with one normal-sized and one midget wrestler).

In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use his own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and ''immediately'' disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are [[Groin attack|low blows]], [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|weapon usage]], interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with his own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although ''dusty finishes'' (named after, and made famous by, [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term "ref bump". While the referee remains "unconscious", wrestlers are free to violate rules until he is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked him out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin his opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick out on his own accord).

If all participants in a match continue to breach the referee's instructions, the match may end in a double disqualification, where both wrestlers or teams (in a [[tag team]] match) have been disqualified. The match is essentially nullified, and called a draw or in some cases a restart or the same match being held at a pay-per-view or next night's show.  Sometimes, however, if this happens in a match to determine the challenger for a heel champion's title, the champion is forced to face both opponents simultaneously for the title.  Usually, the double disqualification is caused by the heel wrestler's associates in a match between two face wrestlers to determine his opponent.

==== Forfeit ====
Although extremely rare, a match can end in a forfeit if the opponent either does not show up for the match, or shows up but refuses to compete. Although a championship usually cannot change hands except by pinfall or submission, a forfeit victory is enough to crown a new champion. The most famous example of this happened on the December 8, 1997 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', when [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] handed the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] to [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] after refusing to defend the title.

Forfeit victories are extremely rare in wrestling. When a pay-per-view match is booked and one wrestler is unable to make it for one reason or another, it is usually customary to insert a last minute replacement rather than award a wrestler a victory by forfeit. Forfeit victories are almost always reserved for when the story the promotion is telling specifically requires such an ending. In addition to the aforementioned moment between Steve Austin and The Rock, other instance of this happening was in March 2009, when Triple H decided not to show up for a handicap match against [[Cody Rhodes]] and [[Ted Dibiase Jr.]], instead opting to attack Randy Orton in his own home.

Despite being, statistically, an extremely rare occurrence, [[The Godfather (wrestler)#Intercontinental Champion (1998–2000)|Charles Wright]] is one wrestler who is famous for turning forfeit victories into his own gimmick. During the late 1990s, Wright called himself "The Godfather" and portrayed the gimmick of a pimp. He would often bring multiple women, who he referred to as "hoes," to the ring with him, and would offer the sexual services of these women to his opponents in exchange for them forfeiting their matches against him.

==== Draw ====
A professional wrestling match can end in a draw. A draw occurs if both opponents are simultaneously disqualified (as via [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] or if the referee loses complete control of the match and both opponents attack each other with no regard to being in a match, like Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker at 2002 Unforgiven), neither opponent is able to answer a ten-count, or both opponents simultaneously win the match. The latter can occur if, for example, one opponent's shoulders touch the mat while maintaining a submission hold against another opponent. If the opponent in the hold begins to [[Submission (combat sports)|tap out]] at the same time a referee counts to three for pinning the opponent delivering the hold, both opponents have legally achieved scoring conditions simultaneously. Traditionally, a championship may not change hands in the event of a draw (though it may become vacant), though some promotions such as [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] have endorsed rules where the champion may lose a title by disqualification. A variant of the draw is the time-limit draw, where the match does not have a winner by a specified time period (a one-hour draw, which was once common, is known in wrestling circles as a "Broadway").

Also if two wrestlers have been given a disqualification by either the referee or the chairman, this is a no contest and if there is a title on the line the champion keeps the championship.

==== No contest ====
A wrestling match may be declared a no contest if the winning conditions are unable to occur. This can be due to excessive interference, loss of referee's control over the match, one or more participants sustaining debilitating injury not caused by the opponent, or the inability of a scheduled match to even begin. A no contest is a state separate and distinct from a draw &amp;mdash; a draw indicates winning conditions were met. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably in practice, this usage is technically incorrect.

== Dramatic elements ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
While each wrestling match is ostensibly a competition of athletics and strategy, the goal of each match from a business standpoint is to excite and entertain the audience. Although the competition is staged, dramatic emphasis can be utilized to draw out the most intense reaction from the audience. Heightened interest results in higher attendance rates, increased ticket sales, higher ratings on television broadcasts (which result in greater ad revenue), higher [[pay-per-view]] buyrates, and sales of branded merchandise and recorded video footage. All of these contribute to the profit of the promotion company.

=== Character/gimmick ===
[[Image:El Hijo De Santo vs Blue Demon Jr.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Demon, Jr.]] wrestles [[El Hijo del Santo]]]]
In Latin America and English-speaking countries, most wrestlers (and other on-stage performers) portray [[Persona|character]] roles, sometimes with personalities wildly different from their own. These personalities are a [[gimmick]] intended to heighten interest in a wrestler without regard to athletic ability. Some can be unrealistic and [[cartoon]]-like (such as [[Doink the Clown]]), while others carry more verisimilitude (such as [[Chris Jericho]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[John Cena]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], and [[CM Punk]]). In [[lucha libre]], many characters wear masks, adopting a [[secret identity]] akin to a [[superhero]], a near-sacred tradition.&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Lords of the Ring| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/04/lord-of-rings.html |publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Orlando| date=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual wrestler may sometimes use his real name, or a minor variation of it, for much of his career, such as [[Bret Hart]], [[John Cena]] and [[Randy Orton]]. Others can keep one ring name for their entire career (cases in point include [[Shawn Michaels]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Ricky Steamboat]]), or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or company. Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company, forcing the wrestler to find a new one when he leaves (although a simple typeset change, such as changing [[Rhyno]] to '''Rhino''', can usually get around this), and sometimes a character is owned by the wrestler. Sometimes, a wrestler may change his legal name to obtain ownership of his ring name (examples include [[Test (wrestler)|Andrew Martin]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior|Warrior]]). Many wrestlers (such as [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[The Undertaker]]) are strongly identified with their character, even responding to the name in public or between friends. It's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal names, unless otherwise introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Storm, Lance (August 9, 2010). [http://www.stormwrestling.com/080910.html "Q&amp;A Commentary"]. ''Storm Wrestling''.&lt;/ref&gt; A professional wrestling character's popularity can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media (see [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[El Santo]]) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter [[politics]] ([[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Jesse Ventura]], among others).

Typically, matches are staged between a [[protagonist]] (historically an audience favorite, known as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], or "the good guy") and an [[antagonist]] (historically a villain with arrogance, a tendency to break rules, or other unlikable qualities, called a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]). In recent years, however, [[antihero]]es have also become prominent in professional wrestling. There is also a less common role of a "tweener", who is neither fully face nor fully heel yet able to play either role effectively (case in point, [[Samoa Joe]] during his first run in [[Impact Wrestling|TNA Wrestling]] from June 2005 to November 2006).

At times a character may "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]]", altering their face/heel alignment. This may be an abrupt, surprising event, or it may slowly build up over time. It almost always is accomplished with a markable change in behavior on the part of the character. Some turns become defining points in a wrestler's career, as was the case when [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|Hulk Hogan turned heel]] after being a top face for over a decade. Others may have no noticeable effect on the character's status. If a character repeatedly switches between being a face and heel, this lessens the effect of such turns, and may result in apathy from the audience. [[Vince McMahon]] is a good example of having more heel and face turns than anyone in WWE history.

As with personae in general, a character's face or heel alignment may change with time, or remain constant over its lifetime (the most famous example of the latter is [[Ricky Steamboat]], a [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r who remained a babyface throughout his entire career). Sometimes a character's heel turn will become so popular that eventually the audience response will alter the character's heel-face cycle to the point where the heel persona will, in practice, become a face persona, and what was previously the face persona, will turn into the heel persona, such as when [[Dwayne Johnson]] first began using "The Rock" persona as a heel character, as opposed to his original "Rocky Maivia" babyface persona.  Another legendary example is [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who was originally booked as a heel, with such mannerisms as drinking on the job, using [[profanity]], breaking company property, and even [[Brian Pillman#World Wrestling Federation (1996–1997)|breaking into people's private homes]].  However, much to WWF's surprise, the fans got such a charge out of Austin's antics that he effectively became one of the greatest antiheroes in the history of the business. He, along with the stable of [[D-Generation X]], is generally credited with ushering in [[the Attitude Era]] of WWF programming.

=== Story ===
[[File:Broken Hardys Expedition of Gold.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matt Hardy]] and [[Jeff Hardy]] as Broken Hardys]]
While true [[Exhibition game|exhibition match]]es are not uncommon, most matches tell a story analogous to a scene in a play or film, or an episode of a serial drama: The face will sometimes win (triumph) or sometimes lose (tragedy). Longer [[story arc]]s can result from multiple matches over the course of time. Since most promotions have a championship title, competition for the championship is a common impetus for stories. Also, anything from a character's own hair to his job with the promotion can be [[Gambling|wager]]ed in a match.

Some matches are designed to further a story of only one participant. It could be intended to portray him or her as a strong unstoppable force, a lucky underdog, a sore loser, or any other characterization. Sometimes non-wrestling [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s are shown to enhance a character's image without the need for matches.

Other stories result from a natural rivalry between two or more characters. Outside of performance, these are referred to as [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]]. A feud can exist between any number of participants and can last for a few days up to multiple decades. The feud between [[Ric Flair]] and [[Ricky Steamboat]] lasted from the late 1970s into the early 1990s and allegedly spanned over two thousand matches (although most of those matches were mere [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es). The career-spanning history between characters [[Mike Awesome]] and [[Masato Tanaka]] is another example of a long-running feud, as is the case of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] vs. [[Vince McMahon]], one of the most lucrative feuds in the World Wrestling Federation during 1998 and 1999.

In theory, the longer a feud is built up, the more audience interest (aka [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]]) will exist. The [[Card (sports)|main event]] of a wrestling show is generally the one with the most heat behind it. Commonly, a heel will hold the upper hand over a face until a final showdown, heightening dramatic tension as the face's fans desire to see him win.

Throughout the history of professional wrestling, many other elements and forms of media have been utilized in professional wrestling storytelling: pre- and post-match interviews, "backstage" skits, positions of authority and [[Work (professional wrestling)|worked]] behind-the-scenes feuds, division rankings (typically the #1-contendership spot), contracts, lotteries, news stories on websites, and in recent years [[social media]].

Also, anything that can be used as an element of drama can exist in professional wrestling stories: [[Romance (love)|romantic relationship]]s (including love triangles and marriage), racism, classism, nepotism, favoritism, corporate corruption, family bonds, personal histories, grudges, theft, cheating, assault, betrayal, bribery, seduction, stalking, confidence tricks, extortion, blackmail, substance abuse, self-doubt, self-sacrifice; even kidnapping, sexual fetishism,&lt;!--Gene Snitsky's foot fetish--&gt; necrophilia,&lt;!--Katie Vick--&gt; misogyny, rape and death have been portrayed in wrestling. Some promotions have included supernatural elements such as magic, curses, the [[undead]] and [[Satanism|Satanic]] imagery (most notably [[the Undertaker]] and his [[Ministry of Darkness]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] that regularly performed evil rituals and [[human sacrifice]] in Satanic-like worship of a hidden power figure). Celebrities would also be involved in storylines.

Commentators have become important in communicating the relevance of the characters' actions to the story at hand, filling in past details and pointing out subtle actions that may otherwise go unnoticed.

==== Promos ====
{{main|Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo}}
A main part of the story-telling part of wrestling is a promo, short for promotional interview. Promos are performed, or "cut", in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|wrestling jargon]], for a variety of reasons, including to heighten interest in a wrestler, or to hype an upcoming match.

Since the crowd is often too loud or the venue too large for promos to be heard naturally, wrestlers will use amplification when speaking in the ring. Unlike most Hollywood acting, large and highly visible handheld microphones are typically used and wrestlers often speak directly to the audience.

=== Championships ===
{{main|Championship (professional wrestling)}}
Professional wrestling mimics the structure of [[Champion|title match]] [[combat sport]]s. Participants compete for a [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship]] and must defend it after winning it. These titles are represented physically by a [[Championship belt|title belt]] that can be worn by the champion. In the case of team wrestling, there is a title belt for each member of the team.

Almost all [[professional wrestling promotion]]s have one major title, and some have more. Championships are designated by divisions of weight, height, gender, wrestling style and other qualifications.

Typically, each promotion only recognizes the "legitimacy" of their own titles, although [[cross-promotion]] does happen. When one promotion absorbs or purchases another, the titles from the defunct promotion may continue to be defended in the new promotion or be decommissioned.

[[wikt:behind the scenes|Behind the scenes]], the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|bookers]] in a company will place the title on the most accomplished performer, or those the bookers believe will generate [[Fandom|fan]] interest in terms of event attendance and television viewership. Lower ranked titles may also be used on the performers who show potential, thus allowing them greater exposure to the audience. However other circumstances may also determine the use of a championship. A combination of a championship's lineage, the caliber of performers as champion, and the frequency and manner of title changes, dictates the audience's perception of the title's quality, significance and reputation.

A wrestler's championship accomplishments can be central to their career, becoming a measure of their performance ability and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|drawing]] power. In general, a wrestler with multiple title reigns or an extended title reign is indicative of a wrestler's ability to maintain audience interest or a wrestler's ability to perform in the ring. As such, the most accomplished or decorated wrestlers tend to be revered as legends despite the predetermined nature of title reigns. American wrestler [[Ric Flair]] has had multiple [[World heavyweight championship (professional wrestling)|world heavyweight championship]] reigns spanning over three decades. Japanese wrestler [[Último Dragón]] once held and defended a record 10 titles simultaneously.

=== Non-standard matches ===
Often a match will take place under additional rules, usually serving as a special attraction or a climactic point in a feud or storyline. Sometimes this will be the culmination of an entire feud, ending it for the immediate future (known as a blowoff match).

Perhaps the most well-known non-standard match is the [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|cage match]], in which the ring is surrounded by a fence or similar metal structure, with the express intention of preventing escape or outside interference—and with the added bonus of the cage being a potentially brutal weapon or platform for launching attacks. The WWE has another provision where a standard cage match can end with one wrestler or wrestling team escaping the cage through the door or over the top.

Another example is the WWE's Royal Rumble match, which involves thirty participants in a random and unknown order. The Rumble match is itself a spectacle in that it is a once-yearly event with multiple participants, including individuals who might not interact otherwise. It also serves as a catalyst for the company's ongoing feuds, as well as a springboard for new storylines.

=== Ring entrance ===
[[Image:Triple H Entrance Sequence Melbourne 10.11.2007.jpg|thumb|450px|[[Triple H]] performing his ring entrance pose, mounting the second rope and displaying his physique, under strobe lights]]
While the wrestling matches themselves are the primary focus of professional wrestling, a key dramatic element of the business can be entrances of the wrestlers to the arena and ring. It is typical for a wrestler to get their biggest crowd reaction (or "pop") for their ring entrance, rather than for anything they do in the wrestling match itself, especially if former main event stars are returning to a promotion after a long absence.

All notable wrestlers now enter the ring accompanied by music, and regularly add other elements to their entrance. The music played during the ring entrance will usually mirror the wrestler's personality. Many wrestlers, particularly in America, have music and lyrics specially written for their ring entrance. While invented long before, the practice of including music with the entrance gained rapid popularity during the 1980s, largely as a result of the huge success of [[Hulk Hogan]] and the WWF, and their [[1980s professional wrestling boom|Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]. When a match is won, the victor's theme music is usually also played in celebration.

Because wrestling is predetermined, a wrestler's entrance music will play as they enter the arena, even if they are, in [[kayfabe]], not supposed to be there. For example, in 2012 through 2014, [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] was a trio of wrestlers who were (in kayfabe) not at the time under contract with WWE (hence their gimmick of entering the ring through the crowd), but they still had entrance music which was played whenever they entered the arena, despite the fact that they were kayfabe invaders.

With the introduction of the Titantron entrance screen in 1997, WWF/WWE wrestlers also had entrance videos made that would play along with their entrance music.

Other dramatic elements of a ring entrance can include:
* [[Pyrotechnics]]
* Additional visual graphics or staging props to complement the entrance video/routine or further emphasize the character. For instance, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]'s entrance graphics employ heavy use of fire-themed visuals, [[The Undertaker]]'s entrance features dark lighting, fire, fog and dry ice, and lightning-themed effects, [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]]'s entrance would feature use of multicolored psychedelic style patterns, [[The Miz]] has in the past incorporated inflatable lettering spelling out the word "AWESOME" into his entrance, and [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] frequently used an inflatable entrance tunnel during his [[WWE]] tenure. [[Goldust]] has been known to use on-screen visual effects in his entrance to simulate the presentation of a feature film (i.e. widescreen, production company credits), as to emphasize his Hollywood-themed film aficionado character. [[Brodus Clay]] entered with disco ball lighting effects to emphasize his "Funkasaurus" character.
* A distinct sound or opening note in the music (used to elicit a [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian]] response from the crowd). For example, the glass shattering in [[WWF The Music, Vol. 3|Steve Austin's entrance theme]], [[The Undertaker]]'s signature [[Funeral toll|bell toll]], or the sound of bells and a cow's moo in JBL's theme.
* Darkening of the arena, often accompanied by [[Stage lighting|mood lighting]] or [[strobe light]]ing, such as in The Undertaker's, [[Triple H]]'s, or [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]'s entrances. Certain colors of lighting have been associated with specific wrestlers; for instance, blue lighting for [[The Undertaker]], green lighting for Triple H, [[D-Generation X]], and [[Shane McMahon]], red and orange lighting for [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], multicolored lighting for [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]], gold lighting for [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]], pink lighting for [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]], and so forth.
* Costumes that evoke "otherworldly" or "fictional" themes. With examples such as Big Van Vader's bio-mechanical themed headdress which spewed steam, Pyro's fire shooting outfit, Shockmaster's bejeweled space helmet, and Ricky Steamboat's dragon costume, to name a few.
* Entering in a manner in keeping with their character traits, such as a fast, highly energetic entrance, or a slow, stoic entrance. For example, The Ultimate Warrior would run at high speed down the entrance ramp and into the ring while [[Randy Orton]] would slowly and darkly walk to the ring. The Undertaker has adopted one of the most notable entrances, taking around 4 to 5 minutes, darkening the whole arena, and performing a slow, intimidating walk. Like sound effects, some entrance mannerisms often become signature to individual wrestlers. For example, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]'s entrance often involves him standing on the second turnbuckle, raising his hands in the air for few seconds, and then doing the same thing for the other three turnbuckles, a mannerism which has become just as much a signature part of Austin's entrance as the glass-shattering sound effect.
* Driving a vehicle into the arena. For example, [[Eddie Guerrero]] would arrive into the arena in a lowrider, The Undertaker (in his "American Bad Ass" biker gimmick), [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Tara]], and the [[Disciples of Apocalypse]] on motorcycles, [[The Mexicools]] on riding lawn mowers, JBL in his limousine, [[Alberto Del Rio]] arriving into the arena in various luxury cars, Steve Austin driving an [[all-terrain vehicle]], and perhaps most recently [[Camacho (wrestler)|Camacho]] and [[Hunico]] entering on a lowrider bicycle.
* Acting out a trademark behavior, such as posing to display their [[Bodybuilding|muscularity]], mounting the ring ropes, or sitting in the corner.
* Talking to the crowd using a distinctive [[patter]]. For instance, chanting or rapping along with the music (i.e. [[Road Dogg]], [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]]). Another example is [[Vickie Guerrero]] entering to no music, but announcing her arrival with the words "Excuse me!"
* Many [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] with narcissistic gimmicks ([[Lex Luger]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Cody Rhodes]], [[Paul Orndorff]], etc.) would admire themselves with a mirror on their way to the ring.
* Coming through the audience, such as [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman's]] beer drinking and can smashing entrance, or [[Diamond Dallas Page]]'s exit through the crowd, or most recently, The Shield walking through the arena.
* Accompaniment by a [[Cornerman|ringside crew]] or personal security, an example of which would be [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]]
* Entering the arena by a lift in the stage, such as [[Kurt Angle]], [[David Heath (wrestler)|Gangrel]] and [[Rey Mysterio]]
* If a wrestler is a current champion, he will attempt to visually draw attention to his championship belt by either holding it high over his head or (if the belt is worn around the waist) moving his hands across it or pointing to it.
Another method of entry involves descending from the ceiling with a [[Zip-line]] or [[Abseiling|rappel line]] and stunt harness. This has been done by Shawn Michaels at [[WrestleMania XII]], by Sting many times in WCW and TNA, and has gained major controversy over its role in the death of wrestler [[Owen Hart]] at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]].

Special ring entrances are also developed for big occasions, most notably the [[WrestleMania]] event. For example, WrestleMania III and VI both saw all wrestlers enter the arena on motorized miniature wrestling rings. Live bands are sometimes hired to perform live entrance music at special events. [[John Cena]] and [[Triple H]] are particularly notable in recent years for their highly theatrical entrances at WrestleMania.

=== Women's wrestling ===
{{see also|Women in WWE|Impact Knockouts}}
[[File:Cholita wrestling bolivia3 Joel Alvarez.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fighting Cholitas]] in Bolivia]]
The women's division of professional wrestling has maintained a recognized world champion since 1937, when [[Mildred Burke]] won the original World Women's title. She then formed the World Women's Wrestling Association in the early 1950s and recognized herself as the first champion, although the championship would be vacated upon her retirement in 1956. The NWA however, ceased to acknowledge Burke as ''their'' Women's World champion in 1954, and instead acknowledged [[June Byers]] as champion after a controversial finish to a high-profile match between Burke and Byers that year. Upon Byers' retirement in 1964, [[The Fabulous Moolah]], who won a junior heavyweight version of the [[NWA World Women's Championship]] (the predecessor to the [[WWE Women's Championship]]) in a tournament back in 1958, was recognized by most NWA promoters as champion by default.

=== Intergender wrestling ===
For most of its history, men and women would rarely compete against each other in professional wrestling, as it was deemed to be unfair and unchivalrous. [[Andy Kaufman]] used this to gain notoriety when he created an Intergender Championship and declared it open to any female challenger. This led to a long (worked) feud with [[Jerry Lawler]].

In the 1980s, mixed tag team matches began to take place, with a male and female on each team and a rule stating that each wrestler could only attack the opponent of the same gender. If a tag was made, the other team had to automatically switch their legal wrestler as well. Despite these restrictions, many mixed tag matches do feature some physical interaction between participants of different genders. For example, a heel may take a cheap shot at the female wrestler of the opposing team to draw a negative crowd reaction. In lucha libre, cheap-shots and male-female attacks are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt;

[[Intergender wrestling|Intergender]] singles bouts were first fought on a national level in the 1990s. This began with [[Luna Vachon]], who faced men in ECW and WWF. Later, [[Chyna]] became the first female to hold a belt that was not exclusive to women when she won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]].  While it is a rare feat in WWE, in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]], [[ODB (wrestler)|ODB]] participates in singles intergender matches.  Also, ODB's kayfabe husband and tag team partner [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] held the Knockouts tag team titles for a record 478 days before it was stripped by [[Brooke Hogan]] because Young was a male.

=== Midget wrestling ===
{{further|Midget wrestling}}
Midget wrestling can be traced to professional wrestling's carnival and vaudeville origins. In recent years, the popularity and prevalence of midgets in wrestling has greatly decreased due to wrestling companies depriving midget divisions of storyline or feud. However, WWE has made a few attempts to enter this market with their "minis" in the 1990s and the "junior's league" as recent as 2006. It is still a popular form of entertainment in Mexican wrestling, mostly as a "sideshow".

Some wrestlers may have their own specific "mini me", like [[Mascarita Sagrada]], Alebrije has Quije, etc. There are also cases in which midgets can become valets for a wrestler, and even get physically involved in matches, like [[KeMonito|Alushe]], who often accompanies [[Tinieblas]], or [[KeMonito]], who is portrayed as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's mascot and is also a valet for Mistico. [[Dave Finlay]] was often aided in his matches by a midget known mainly as [[Hornswoggle]] while in WWE, who hid under the ring and gave a [[Shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]] to Finlay to use on his opponent. Finlay also occasionally threw him at his opponent(s). Hornswoggle has also been given a run with the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]] and feuded with [[D-Generation X|D-X]] in 2009.

== Styles and characteristics in different countries ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:ALL JAPAN プロレス LOVE in Taiwan.jpg|thumb|250px|A match of All Japan Pro Wrestling in Taiwan, 2009]]
The U.S., Japan and Mexico are three countries where there is a huge market and high popularity for professional wrestling. But the styles of professional wrestling are different, given their independent development for a long period.

Professional wrestling in the U.S. tends to have a heavy focus on story building and the establishment of characters (and their personalities). There is a story for each match, and even a longer story for successive matches. The stories usually contain characters like [[face (professional wrestling)|faces]] and [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], and less often [[antihero]]es and tweeners. It is a "triumph" if the face wins, while it is a "tragedy" if the heel wins. The characters usually have strong and sharp personalities, with examples like [[Doink the Clown]], whose personality is melodramatic, slapstick and fantastical. The opposition between faces and heels is very intense in the story, and the heels may even attack the faces during TV interviews. The relationship between different characters can also be very complex.

[[File:Lucha libre — Arena México por Carlos Adampol 001.jpg|thumb|left|Mexican wrestler [[Andrade Cien Almas|La Sombra]] taking down opponent with a wrestling move]]
Although professional wrestling in Mexico ([[Lucha libre]]) also has stories and characters, they are less emphasized. Wrestlers in Mexico are traditionally more agile and perform more [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial maneuvers]] than [[History of professional wrestling in the United States|professional wrestlers in the U.S.]] who, more often, rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents.&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt; The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that wrestlers in the [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division ({{Lang-es|italics=yes|peso semicompleto}}) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre. Wrestlers often execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the [[wrestling ring]]'s ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/06/17/1638198.html|title=CANOE - SLAM! Sports - Wrestling - Lucha Libre 101|publisher=Slam.canoe.ca|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucha libre is also known for its [[tag team]] wrestling matches, in which the teams are often made up of three members, instead of two as is common in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stas|last=Bekman|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/sports/pro-wrestling/8-6-Lucha-Libre-confuses-me-what-are-the-rules.html|title=8.6. Lucha Libre confuses me, what are the rules?|publisher=Stason.org|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of Japanese professional wrestling ([[puroresu]]) is again different. With its origins in traditional American style of wrestling and still being under the same genre, it has become an entity in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Sports/Wrestling/Professional/Puroresu/desc.html|title=Open Directory category description|publisher=Open Directory|year=1995|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the similarity to its American counterpart in that the outcome of the matches remains predetermined, the phenomena are different in the form of the [[sport psychology|psychology]] and presentation of the sport. In most of the largest promotions, such as [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]], [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], it is treated as a [[Contact sport#Full-contact sport|full contact]] [[combat sport]] as it mixes hard hitting [[martial arts]] strikes with [[Shoot wrestling#Shoot-style|shoot style]] [[Submission (combat sports)|submission holds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresu.com/intro.html|title=Puroresu Dojo Introduction|publisher=Puroresu.com|year= 1995|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the U.S. it is rather more regarded as an entertainment show. Wrestlers incorporate kicks and strikes from [[martial arts]] disciplines, and a strong emphasis is placed on [[submission wrestling]], and unlike the use of involved storylines in the U.S., they are not as intricate in Japan, more emphasis is placed on the concept of "fighting spirit", meaning the wrestlers display of physical and mental stamina are valued a lot more than theatrics. Many of Japan's wrestlers including top stars such as [[Shinya Hashimoto]], [[Riki Chōshū]] and [[Keiji Mutoh]] came from a legitimate martial arts background and many Japanese wrestlers in the 1990s began to pursue careers in mixed martial arts organizations such as Pancrase and Shooto which at the time retained the original look of puroresu but were actual competitions. Other companies, such as Michinoku Pro Wrestling and [[Dragon Gate]], wrestle in a style similar to Mexican companies like AAA and CMLL. This is known as "Lucharesu".

== Culture ==
[[File:Frank-gotch.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Frank Gotch]], 20th century professional wrestler]]
Professional wrestling has developed its own cultures, both internal and external.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Those involved in producing professional wrestling have developed a kind of global [[Secret society|fraternity]], with familial bonds, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|shared language]] and passed-down traditions. New performers are expected to "pay their dues" for a few years by working in lower-profile promotions and working as ring crew before working their way upward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|title=Wrestling School|work=How Professional Wrestling Works| publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling5.htm|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Derek|title=Discovery: Accidental Perfection|publisher=The Wrestling Oratory|date=2007-08-11|url=http://oratory.rajah.com/index.php?archive=3281|quote="Dragon Gate is a unique promotion as they still follow many of wrestling's biggest traditions, one being that veterans get theirs first because rookies need to "pay their dues" like they did."|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411141859/http://oratory.rajah.com/index.php?archive=3281|archivedate=2008-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permanent rosters of most promotions develop a backstage [[pecking order]], with veterans mediating conflicts and mentoring younger wrestlers.&lt;ref name="Unions"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gadd|first=Mitchell|title=Unions|work=Reading Between the Ropes|publisher=WrestleZone.com|date=2006-07-13|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/column.php?articleid=154797119|accessdate=2008-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412003958/http://www.wrestlezone.com/column.php?articleid=154797119|archivedate=2008-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many decades (and still to a lesser extent today) performers were expected to keep the illusions of wrestling's legitimacy alive even while not performing, essentially acting in character any time they were in public.&lt;ref name="Kreit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreit|first=Alex|title=Professional Wrestling and Its Fans: A Sociological Study of the Sport of Pro-Wrestling|work=Solie's Vintage Wrestling|publisher=Jump City Productions|year=1998|url=http://www.solie.org/articles/pwandfans.html|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some veterans speak of a "sickness" among wrestling performers, an inexplicable pull to remain active in the wrestling world despite the devastating effects the job can have on one's life and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kamchen|first=Richard|title=Retro review: Piper's tale scrappy as he is|work=SLAM!

Fans of professional wrestling have their own subculture, comparable to [[fandom|those of science fiction, video games, or comic books]]. Those who are interested in the backstage occurrences, future storylines and reasonings behind company decisions read newsletters written by journalists with inside ties to the wrestling industry.&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipscomb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipscomb|first=William|title=The Operational Aesthetic in the Performance of Professional Wrestling|publisher=Department of Communications Studies, Louisiana State University|date=May 2005|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-01252005-152153/unrestricted/Lipscomb__III_dis.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324222906/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-01252005-152153/unrestricted/Lipscomb__III_dis.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "rags" or "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dirt sheet|dirt sheet]]s" have expanded into the Internet, where their information can be dispensed on an up-to-the-minute basis. Some have expanded into [[radio]] shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Some fans enjoy a pastime of collecting tapes of wrestling shows from specific companies, of certain wrestlers, or of specific genres. The internet has given fans exposure to worldwide variations of wrestling they would be unable to see otherwise.&lt;ref name="Bollom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bollom|first=Brandon W.|title=Professional Wrestling Migration: Puroresu in America|date=2004-05-07|url=http://www.burninghammer.com/academic/puroresu.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100045/http://www.burninghammer.com/academic/puroresu.pdf|archive-date=2008-04-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, many companies have been founded which deal primarily in wrestling footage. When the WWE purchased both WCW and ECW in 2001, they also obtained the entire past video libraries of both productions and have released many past matches online and on home video.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Like some other sports, [[Fantasy sport|fantasy league]]s have developed around professional wrestling. Some take this concept further by creating [[Fantasy wrestling|E-fed]]s (electronic federations), where a user can create their own fictional wrestling character, and [[role-playing]] storylines with other users, leading to scheduled "shows" where match results are determined by the organizers, usually based on a combination of the characters' statistics and the players' roleplaying aptitude, sometimes with audience voting.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Professional wrestling in mainstream culture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
From the first established world championship, the top professional wrestlers have garnered fame within mainstream society. Each successive generation has produced a number of wrestlers who extend their careers into the realms of music, acting, writing, business, politics or public speaking, and are known to those who are unfamiliar with wrestling in general. Conversely, celebrities from other sports or general pop culture also become involved with wrestling for brief periods of time. A prime example of this is [[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]] of the 1980s, which combined wrestling with [[MTV]].

[[File:US Navy 050519-N-7130B-003 Professional wrestling champion and actor Bill Goldberg takes a moment to pose with the photographers of Operations Department^rsquo,s OP Division during his tour of USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|[[Bill Goldberg]] during his tour of [[USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76)|USS ''Ronald Reagan'']]]]
Professional wrestling is often portrayed within other works using parody, and its general elements have become familiar [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s and [[Internet meme|meme]]s in American culture.

Some terminology originating in professional wrestling has found its way into the common vernacular. Phrases such as "body slam", "sleeper hold" and "tag team" are used by those who do not follow professional wrestling. The term "smackdown", popularized by [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' in the 1990s, has been included in [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionaries since 2007.

Many television shows and films have been produced which portray in-character professional wrestlers as protagonists, such as ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'', ''[[¡Mucha Lucha!]]'', ''[[Nacho Libre]]'', and the Santo film series. At least two stage plays set in the world of pro wrestling have been produced: ''The Baron'' is a comedy that retells the life of an actual performer known as [[James Raschke|Baron von Raschke]]. ''From Parts Unknown...'' is an award-nominated Canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler. The 2009 ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[W.T.F. (South Park)|W.T.F.]]" played on the soap operatic elements of professional wrestling. One of the lead characters on the Disney Channel series ''[[Kim Possible]]'' was a huge fan of pro wrestling and actually featured it on an episode (with two former WWE wrestlers voicing the two fictitious wrestlers featured in the episode). The 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'', about a washed-up professional wrestler, garnered several Oscar nominations.

The 1950 [[film noir]] [[Night and the City]], directed by [[Jules Dassin]] and starring [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Gene Tierney]], told the story of a promoter in [[London]] trying to make it big, and featured a match involving real professional wrestler [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]].

=== Study and analysis of professional wrestling ===
With its growing popularity, professional wrestling has attracted attention as a subject of serious [[Academia|academic]] study and [[Journalism|journalistic]] criticism. Many courses, theses, essays and dissertations have analyzed wrestling's [[convention (norm)|convention]]s, content, and its role in modern society. It is often included as part of studies on theatre, sociology, performance, and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Caceres|last=Ernesto Cruz|title=Monday Night Identity Wars: The Evolution of Performance Conventions in Professional Wrestling|year=2005|location=2005 Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association National Conference Program|url=http://www.popularculture.org/2005%20PAGES/2005%20Program.htm|accessdate=2008-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050613082746/http://www.popularculture.org/2005%20PAGES/2005%20Program.htm|archivedate=2005-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Brian|last=Ledford|title=Grappling with Masculinity: Representation and Reception of Televised Professional Wrestling Imagery|publisher=SIUE College of Arts and Sciences|location=2005 Spring Colloquium: Thinking About Masculinity|url=http://www.siue.edu/CAS/COLLOQUIA/MasculProgramFINAL.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100044/http://www.siue.edu/CAS/COLLOQUIA/MasculProgramFINAL.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] developed a course of study on the cultural significance of professional wrestling,&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Comparative Media Studies course on Professional Wrestling -- [http://mitcmsprowrestling.blogspot.com/2006/12/this-class-will-explore-cultural.html Official Course weblog]&lt;/ref&gt; and anthropologist Heather Levi has written an ethnography about the culture of lucha libre in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;The World of Lucha Libre: Secrets, Revelations, and Mexican National Identity -- [[The World of Lucha Libre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

But this was not always the case; in the early 20th century, once it became apparent that the "sport" was worked, pro wrestling was looked down on as a cheap entertainment for the uneducated working class&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt;—an attitude that still exists to varying degrees today.&lt;ref name="Lipscomb"/&gt; The French theorist [[Roland Barthes]] was among the first to propose that wrestling was worthy of deeper analysis, in his essay "The World of Wrestling" from his book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', first published in 1957.&lt;ref name="Barthes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The World Of Wrestling|work=Mythologies|year=1957|url= http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/Barthes-wrestling.htm|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt; Barthes argued that it should be looked at not as a scamming of the ignorant, but as [[spectacle]]; a mode of theatric performance for a willing, if bloodthirsty, audience. Wrestling is described as performed art which demands an immediate reading of the juxtaposed meanings. The logical conclusion is given least importance over the theatrical performers of the wrestlers and the referee. According to Barthes the function of a wrestler is not to win: it is to go exactly through the motions which are expected of him and to give the audience a theatrical spectacle. This work is considered a foundation of all later study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lagorio|first=Christine|title=Wrestling With The Margins|work= Education Supplement 2005|publisher=The Village Voice|date=2005-01-04|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/0502,lagorio,59937,12.html|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 release ''[[Lipstick and Dynamite, Piss and Vinegar: The First Ladies of Wrestling]]'' chronicled the development of women's wrestling throughout the 20th century. Pro wrestling has been featured several times on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]''. MTV's documentary series ''[[True Life]]'' featured two episodes titled "I'm a Professional Wrestler" and "I Want to Be a Professional Wrestler". Other documentaries have been produced by [[TLC (TV channel)|The Learning Channel]] (''The Secret World of Professional Wrestling'') and [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] (''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2072">'''Regulating Lines''' is a [[design]] concept in architecture which uses proportions of geometry in buildings giving its harmony and order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&amp;objectid=10862664&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent architect who espoused this concept was [[Le Corbusier]].

==History==
Regulating Lines have been used in early buildings like [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] and Michaelangelo’s Capitiol etc.

==Le Corbusier==
[[File:Petit Trianon.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Front of the Petit Trianon]]
Le Corbusier argues from historical evidence that great architecture of the past has been guided by the use of what came to be known in English as ''Regulating lines''. These lines, starting at significant areas of the main volumes, could be used to rationalize the placement of features in buildings. Le Corbusier lists off several structures he claims used this, including a speculative ancient temple form, [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], the [[Capitol (Rome)|Capitol]] in [[Rome]],  the [[Petit Trianon]], and lastly, his [[World War I|prewar]] neoclassical work in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and some more contemporary modern buildings. In each case, he attempts to show how the lines augment the fine proportions and add a rational sense of coherence to the buildings. In this way, the order, the function, and the volume of the space are drawn into one architectural moment. Le Corbusier argues that this method aids in formalizing the intuitive sense of aesthetics and integrating human proportions as well.

Le Corbusier claims in the text that no architects trained in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-arts]] technique use regulating lines, because of contradictory training, but most of the Grand Prix architects did use them, even if they were supplementing the basic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Pol. "'Vers un architecture' par Le Corbusier-Saungnier," pt. 2, L'Architecte 1, no. 3. 1924, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the concept in early work, [[Villa Schwob]] in 1916.

'''Samuel Alken''' Sr. ([[London]] October 22, 1756 &amp;ndash; November 9, 1815 [[London]]) was an English [[artist]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Grove Dictionary of Art'' David Alexander 
 on Samuel Alken at [http://www.artnet.com/library/00/0018/T001854.asp artnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a leading exponent of the newly developed technique of [[aquatint]].

==History==
Samuel Alken entered the [[Royal Academy Schools]], London, as a sculptor in 1772. He published ''A New Book of Ornaments Designed and Etched by Samuel Alken'' in 1779, and later established himself as one of the most competent engravers in the new technique of aquatint.

His works included plates after [[George Morland]], [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]] and [[Francis Wheatley (painter)|Francis Wheatley]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Alken, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plates for ''Sixteen views of the lakes in Cumberland and Westmorland''  after drawings  [[John Emes]] and John Smith &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=List Of New Publications, And New Editions|journal=The Register of the Times, Or: Political Museum|date=1795|volume=6|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NME_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixteen views of the lakes in Cumberland and Westmorland|url=http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/2034876|publisher=Yale Center For British Art|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were  published in 1796,&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; and a set of aquatint views of North Wales  after drawings by the Rev.

There are some sporting paintings signed ''S. Alken'', but they may be the work of his eldest son, Samuel.

'''Sarah Hoare''' (1777–1856) was a British author and artist known for her scientific poetry.

==Work==
Hoare was born on 7 July 1777 in [[Old Broad Street]] in the parish of [[St Peter le Poer]], London to Samuel and Sarah (née Gurney) Hoare.&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office: Society of Friends' Registers, Notes and Certificates of Births, Marriages and Burials. Records of the General Register Office, Government Social Survey Department, and Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, RG 6. The National Archives, Kew, Richmond, Surrey, England&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831 she wrote and illustrated ''Poems on Conchology and Botany''.  Hoare's book is an early example of a female Victorian author using observations and scientifically based research to inform her writing.&lt;ref name="Moine2015" /&gt; Hoare's poems are a rare example of a collection based on [[conchology]].&lt;ref name="Moine2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moine|first1=Fabienne|title=Women Poets in the Victorian Era Cultural Practices and Nature Poetry|date=2015|publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group Ltd|location=Oxfordshire|isbn=9781472464774|pages=219–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that Hoare and her contemporaries were influenced by the writings of [[Erasmus Darwin]] and in particular by his poem ''The Loves of Plants''.&lt;ref name="Priestman2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Priestman|first1=Martin|title=The Poetry of Erasmus Darwin: Enlightened Spaces, Romantic Times|date=2013|publisher=Routledge The Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=Oxfordshire|isbn=9781472419545|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus''' is a marble [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] used for the burial of [[Junius Bassus]], who died in 359.  It has been described as "probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_early_christian_studies/v001/1.1.rutgers.html Journal of Early Christian Studies], Leonard Victor Rutgers, ''The Iconography of the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus'' (review of Malbon book) - Volume 1, Number 1, Spring 1993, pp. 94-96; for Janson it is also the "finest Early Christian sarcophagus", and Kitzinger, 26, calls it the "most famous".&lt;/ref&gt;  The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]],  was rediscovered in 1597,&lt;ref&gt;or 1595, see Elsner, p. 86n.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]) in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].  The base is approximately 4 x 8 x 4 feet.

Together with the [[Dogmatic sarcophagus]] in the same museum, this sarcophagus is one of the oldest surviving high-status sarcophagi with elaborate carvings of Christian themes, and a complicated [[iconography|iconographic]] programme embracing the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.

==Junius Bassus==
Junius Bassus was an important figure, a senator who was in charge of the government of the capital as [[praefectus urbi]] when he died at the age of 42 in 359.  His father had been [[Praetorian prefect]], running the administration of a large part of the Western Empire.  Bassus served under [[Constantius II]], son of [[Constantine I]].  Bassus, as the inscription on the sarcophagus tells us, converted to Christianity shortly before his death - perhaps on his deathbed.  Many still believed, like [[Tertullian]], that it was not possible to be an emperor and a Christian, which also went for the highest officials like Bassus.

==Style==
The style of the work has been greatly discussed by art historians, especially as its date is certain, which is unusual at this period.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, 237&lt;/ref&gt;  All are agreed that the workmanship is of the highest quality available at the time, as one might expect for the tomb of such a prominent figure.  
[[File:1060 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|left|Cast of Christ's trial before Pilate, with Pilate about to wash his hands.]]

The sarcophagus in many respects shows fewer features of the [[Late Antique]] style of sculpture typified in the [[Arch of Constantine]] of several decades earlier: "The sculpture ignores practically all the rules obeyed by official reliefs. Some figures are portrayed frontally, but certainly not all, and they are not shown in a thoroughly Late Antique manner; the scenes are three-dimensional and have depth and background .... drapery hangs on recognizable human forms rather than being arranged in predetermined folds; heads are varied, portraying recognisably different people."&lt;ref&gt;Reece, 240&lt;/ref&gt;  The sarcophagus has been seen as reflecting a blending of late [[Hellenistic]] style with the contemporary Roman or Italian one, seen in the "robust" proportions of the figures, and their slightly over-large heads.

The setting in the niches casts the figures against a background of shadow, giving "an emphatic [[chiaroscuro]] effect"&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, Maurizio; ''Treasures of the Vatican'', p.10, Skira, Geneva and New York, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; - an effect much more noticeable in the original than the cast shown here, which has a more uniform and lighter colour.  The cast also lacks the effects created by light on polished or patinated highlights such as the heads of the figures, against the darker recessed surfaces and backgrounds.

[[Ernst Kitzinger]] finds "a far more definite reattachment to aesthetic ideals of the Graeco-Roman past" than in the earlier [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] and that of the "Two Brothers", also in the [[Vatican Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  The form continues the increased separation of the scenes; it had been an innovation of the earliest Christian sarcophagi to combine a series of incidents in one continuous (and rather hard to read) [[frieze]], and also to have two registers one above the other, but these examples show a trend to differentiate the scenes, of which the Junius Bassus is the culmination, producing a "multitude of miniature stages", which allow the spectator "to linger over each scene", which was not the intention of earlier reliefs which were only "shorthand pictographs" of each scene, only intended to identify them.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 22-26, 25 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes a "lyrical, slightly sweet manner" in the carving, even in the soldiers who lead St Peter to his death, which compares to some small carvings from the Hellenized east in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], though they are several decades older.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 26-27, 26 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even allowing for "the gradual appropriation of a popular type of Christian tomb by upper-class patrons whose standards asserted themselves increasingly both in the content and in the style of these monuments", Kitzinger concludes that the changes must reflect a larger "regeneration" in style.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:1056 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Job (Bible)|Job]] on the dunghill; [[Adam and Eve]]]] 
The carvings are in [[high relief]] on three sides of the sarcophagus, allowing for its placement against a wall.  The column and many parts of the figures are carved completely in the round.  The arrangement of relief scenes in rows in a columnar framework is an introduction from [[Asia Minor]] at about this time.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  No portrait of the deceased is shown, though he is praised in lavish terms in an inscription; instead, the ten niches are filled with scenes from both the New and [[Old Testament]]s, plus one, the ''[[Traditio Legis]]'', that has no Scriptural basis.

The scenes on the front are:&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; in the top row, [[Sacrifice of Isaac]], Judgement or Arrest of [[Saint Peter|Peter]], Enthroned Christ with Peter and Paul (''Traditio Legis''), and a double scene of the [[Pilate#Pilate in the canonical Gospel accounts|Trial of Jesus]] before [[Pontius Pilate]], who in the last niche is about to wash his hands. In the bottom row: [[Job (Bible)|Job]] on the dunghill, [[Adam and Eve]], [[Palm Sunday|Christ's entry into Jerusalem]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion's den (heads restored), Arrest or leading to execution of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]].
[[File:1065 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|Cast of one of the sides; [[putti]] harvesting grapes.]]
The tiny [[spandrel]]s above the lower row show scenes with all participants depicted as lambs: on either side of Christ entering Jerusalem are the ''[[Miracle of the loaves and fishes]]'' and the ''[[Baptism of Jesus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F-GkS6wWdLEC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=Sarcophagus+of+Junius+Bassus+eagle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m9CRNQGfUr&amp;sig=1rd97ZJY0WegesgvyKoplC-NgkM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ev-mSYnfI5SIjAe3u5zoDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPR7,M1 ''Rome the Cosmopolis''], p. vii caption 6, Catharine Edwards, [[Greg Woolf]], Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-03011-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-03011-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other scenes may be the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|''Three youths in the fiery furnace'']], the ''[[Raising of Lazarus]]'', ''[[Moses]] receiving the tablets'' and ''Moses striking the rock''.&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, 90, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=dyJpvuK6Do8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Sarcophagus+of+Junius+Bassus&amp;as_brr=3#PPA10,M1 J.W. Appell]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sides have more traditional Roman scenes of the [[season|Four Seasons]] represented by [[putti]] performing seasonal tasks such as harvesting grapes.  On a damaged plaque surmounting the lid is a poem praising Bassus in largely secular terms, and the [[inscription]] running along the top of the body of the sarcophagus identifies him, and describes him as a "[[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]", or recent convert.  Further small reliefs on the lid, and heads at the corners, are badly damaged,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rome101.com/Christian/Magician/pages/Vat31648_0609_0855WS.htm Texts], though nb the descriptions of the iconography here are not accurate.&lt;/ref&gt; they showed scenes of feasts and a burial procession typical of pagan sarcophagi;&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 87&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible the lid was not created to match the base.

===Scenes with Christ===
The emphasis on scenes of judgement may have been influenced by the career of Bassus as a magistrate, but all the scenes shown can be paralleled in other Christian works of the period.
[[File:1057 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|left|Detail - cast of the central sections: ''[[Traditio Legis]]'' and ''Jesus entering Jerusalem''.]]

In all the three scenes where he appears Christ is a youthful, beardless figure with shortish hair (though longer than that of other figures), which is [[Depiction of Jesus|typical of Christian art at this period]].  The angel standing behind [[Abraham]] in the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]] is depicted similarly, and without wings.  Christ appears in the centre of both rows; in the top row as a law-giver or teacher between his chief followers, Peter and Paul (the ''Traditio Legis''), and on the bottom entering Jerusalem. Both scenes borrow from pagan [[Ancient Roman art|Roman iconography]]: in  the top one Jesus is sitting with his feet on a billowing cloak representing the sky, carried by [[Caelus]], the classical personification of the heavens.  Christ hands Peter a scroll, probably representing the [[Gospel]]s, as emperors were often shown doing to their heirs, ministers or generals.&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p. 80, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}. Hellemo, pp. 65-70 discusses the place of the work in the development of the ''traditio legis'' subject.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Pilate Christ also carries a scroll, like a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Janson&lt;/ref&gt;  Pilate, perhaps worried by Jesus's reputation for miracles, is making the gesture Italians still use to ward off the [[evil eye]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, 89 - the ''cornu'', a fist with the index and little finger extended.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pilate has a mild and passive appearance, contrasting strongly with the powerful and determined expression of the figure in low relief profile behind him on the wall, the only figure in these scenes depicted in this style and technique.  If he is not just one of Pilate's subordinate officers, he may be intended as a portrait or statue of the emperor; Roman official business was usually conducted before such an image, upon which (under the deified pagan emperors) any oaths required were made.

The lower scene loosely follows the entry ("adventus") of an emperor to a city, a scene often depicted in Imperial art; Christ is "identified as imperator by the imperial eagle of victory" in the [[conch (architecture)|conch]] moulding above the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; p. 97; Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962, and see Edwards &amp; Woolf, op &amp; page cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was already a tradition, borrowed from pagan [[iconography]], of depicting ''Christ the Victor''; in this work that theme is linked to the [[Passion of Jesus]], of which the entry to Jerusalem is the start,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BnA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Sarcophagus+of+Junius+Bassus+eagle&amp;as_brr=3#PPA100,M1 ''Adventus Domini''], p. 100, Geir Hellemo&lt;/ref&gt; a development that was to play a great part in shaping the Christian art of the future.

The inclusion of the pagan figure of Caelus may seem strange, but he was not an important figure in [[Ancient Roman religion]], so was evidently considered as a harmless pictorial convention by the Christian designer of the composition, as well as one of the elements showing continuity with Roman tradition.  From the following century personifications of the [[River Jordan]] often appear in depictions of the [[Baptism of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p.133 &amp; figs, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the manuscript [[Chronography of 354]], just a few years older than the sarcophagus and made for another elite Christian, is full of personifications of cities, months and other concepts.  The putti in the Chronography also relate closely to those on the sides of the sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meyer Schapiro]], ''Selected Papers, volume 3, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art'', p. 143, 1980, Chatto &amp; Windus, London, {{ISBN|0-7011-2514-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other scenes===
[[File:Isaac sarcifice Pio Christiano Inv31648.jpg|thumb|Cast of the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]]. The hand of God originally came down to hold Abraham's knife (both are now missing).]]

The Old Testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of Christ's sacrifice in the [[New Testament]], in an early form of [[Typology (theology)|typology]].  Adam and Eve are shown covering their nakedness after the [[Fall of Man]], which created the [[original sin]] and hence the [[Atonement in Christianity|need for Christ to be sacrificed]] for our sins.  Adam and Eve themselves made no sacrifices, but behind Eve is a lamb, and beside Adam a sheaf of [[wheat]], referring to the sacrifices of their two sons, [[Cain]] and [[Abel]].  Just to the right of the middle is Daniel in the lion's den, saved by his faith, and on the left is Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.  Job is seen at the point when he has lost everything, but retains his faith; his wife and a "comforter" look on anxiously.  Christians saw these as foreshadowings of the sacrifice of God's only son, Jesus, though the [[Crucifixion]] itself, a rare subject up until the 5th century, is not depicted.

The scenes prior to the martyrdoms of Peter and Paul, both common in Early Christian art, show the same avoidance of the climactic moments which were usually chosen in later Christian art.  But they demonstrate to the viewer how the heavenly crown could be achieved by ordinary Christians, although the Imperial persecutions were now over.  Both scenes also took place in Rome, and this local interest is part of the balance of Christian and traditional Roman gestures that the sarcophagus shows.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner's main theme&lt;/ref&gt;  The reeds behind Paul probably represent [[San Paolo alle Tre Fontane|the boggy area of the city]] where Paul's execution was traditionally believed to have happened.&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter's execution was believed to have happened close to his grave, which was within a few feet of the location of the sarcophagus; both executions were believed to have occurred on the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|same day]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">The '''setting''' is both the [[time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] within a [[narrative]], either [[non-fiction|nonfiction]] or [[fiction]]. A [[literary element]], the setting helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (literature)|mood]] for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world &lt;ref&gt;[[#Truby|Truby]], 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Social environment|milieu]]'' to include a [[Context (language use)|context]] (especially [[society]]) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include [[culture]], [[historical period]], [[geography]], and [[hour]]. Along with the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], setting is considered one of the fundamental components of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, pp.1,65,115,171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Setting is an important element in a narrative and in some works the setting becomes a character itself. The term setting is often used to refer to the social milieu in which the events of a novel occur&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lodge|Lodge]], 1992, pp.58-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[novelist]] [[Donna Levin]] has described how this social milieu shapes the characters’ values.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin]], 1992, pp.110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the story setting include the passage of time, which may be static in some stories or dynamic in others with, for example, changing seasons.

==Types==
Setting may take various forms:
* [[Alternate history (fiction)|Alternate history]]
* [[Campaign setting]]
* [[Constructed world]]
* [[Dystopia]]
* [[Fantasy world]]
* [[Fictional city]]
* [[Fictional country]]
* [[Fictional crossover]]
* [[Fictional location]]
* [[Fictional universe]]
* [[Future history]]
* [[Imaginary world]]
* [[Mythical place]]
* [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Parallel universe]]
* [[Planets in science fiction]]
* [[Simulated reality]]
* [[Virtual reality]]
* [[Utopia]]

[[File:Sjisart.png|thumb|An example of American Shift_JIS art.]]
[[File:Gikoneko Image.svg|thumb|{{nihongo|'''Giko Neko'''|ギコネコ|gikoneko}} Posted on the [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] {{nihongo|'''HONTEN(HIRU&amp;nbsp;NO&amp;nbsp;BU)'''|本店（昼の部）|honten(hirunobu)}} in 1998.]]

'''Shift_JIS art''' is artwork created from characters within the [[Shift JIS]] character set, a [[Japanese Industrial Standards]] (JIS) superset of [[JIS X 0201]] (in turn almost a superset of [[ASCII]]) intended for Japanese usage.  Naturally there are many similarities between Shift_JIS artwork and [[ASCII art]].

Shift_JIS has become very popular on [[internet forum|web-based bulletin board]]s, notably [[2channel]], and has even made its way into mainstream media and commercial advertising in [[Japan]].

Within the Japanese community, Shift_JIS art is sometimes abbreviated as ''SJIS art'', but is most commonly referred to as "'''AA'''" meaning ASCII art, although it rarely restricts itself to the 95 printable characters within the ASCII standard.

As with [[ANSI art]], SJIS art is sometimes used for animation. However, due to technical advances, SJIS art also appears in the form of [[Adobe Flash]] files and animated [[GIF]]s.

Unlike Western ASCII art, which is generally designed to be viewed with a [[monospaced font]], Shift_JIS art is designed around the proportional-width (albeit CJK characters are always the same width) [[Japanese gothic typeface|MS PGothic]] font supplied with [[Microsoft Windows]], which is the default font for web sites in Japanese versions of Windows.  This dependency has led to the development of the free [[Mona Font]], in which each character is the same width as its counterpart in MS PGothic. This is useful on operating systems lacking the PGothic font, such as [[Linux]].

== In Japanese media ==
The Japanese movie and television show, {{nihongo|''[[Densha Otoko]]''|電車男}}, frequently included Shift_JIS art, both during screen transitions and within the story itself.  One of the recurring characters in the TV series was a Shift_JIS artist who would often draw full-screen Shift_JIS works of art as a way of expressing his support and encouraging the lead character. When they got engaged, posts began flowing in congratulating the new couple, and extravagant Shift JIS art pictures were posted.

The ''[[Touhou Project]]'' meme "Yukkuri shite itte ne!" comes from a Shift_JIS attempt to draw the lead characters of Touhou, Reimu and Marisa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">The '''Society of British Composers''' was founded in 1905 to protect the interests of British composers and to provide publication, promotion and performance opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/136.htm|title= 136TH GARLAND OF BRITISH LIGHT MUSIC COMPOSERS|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was disbanded in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Macmillan encyclopedia of music and musicians|author=Wier, Albert Ernest|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, a number of talented composers were graduating from the [[Royal Academy of Music]] without any avenue for publication and performance of their work. The problem came to a head with the ''Piano Sonata in D Minor'' produced by the young composer [[Benjamin Dale]]. The sonata was sixty pages long, leading to problems with commercial publication, and the Society of British Composers was founded by [[Frederick Corder]], [[John Blackwood McEwen]], [[Tobias Matthay]] and others at the Royal Academy of Music to address that and similar problems. The society published the sonata in its first yearbook through its imprint Charles Avison, Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The British piano sonata, 1870-1945|author=Hardy, Lisa|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick Corder served as the first chairman, and the society followed a publication plan which provided a selection of compositions for use in performance. Publication was made under the imprint of Charles Avison, Ltd. through [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]], which was later changed to Cary and then to [[Novello &amp; Co]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bax: a composer and his times|author=Foreman, Lewis|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was founded without women members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe|author=Clark, Linda L.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1914 women composers were allowed to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herstoryuntold.org.uk/subject.php?id=13&amp;PHPSESSID=1422764cb4a544131dd3c1d092a22448|title=Frances Mary Hefford Cocking|accessdate=29 February 2012}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Soleto Map''' is a possibly ancient [[map]], which depicts [[Salento]] on a small piece of [[ostrakon]] derived from a [[terracotta]] vase.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of 2005 colloquium on Soleto Map an Moonpellier, France: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080307125758/http://www.unc.edu/awmc/soletomap.html A New Ancient Map? The Salentine peninsula in the 5th century BC] (page taken down: link from Wayback Machine).&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the ostrakon is undoubtedly ancient, doubts have been raised about the age of the map.

==Background==
The map was discovered in [[Soleto]] (southern [[Italy]]) by [[Belgium|Belgian]] archaeologist Thierry van Compernolle of [[Montpellier University]] on August 21, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper article on the discovery of the map:[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/11/18/wmap18.xml Telegraph - Archaeologists find western world's oldest map]&lt;/ref&gt; The map itself dates back to 500 BC and contains letters derived from a [[Greek script]]. The languages expressed on the map are both [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and [[Messapian language|Messapian]]. Moreover, the Soleto Map describes the city of [[Taranto]] (called Taras), as well as other cities of Salento such as Soleto, [[Santa Maria di Leuca|Leuca]], [[Ugento]], and [[Otranto]]. The map went on public display in 2005 at the Archaeological National Museum of Taranto.

==Controversy==
Even though the Soleto Map is considered the oldest map in [[Western culture|Western civilization]], there are allegations that it is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;One of those allegations is here: http://www.maproomblog.com/2006/02/is_the_soleto_map_a_forgery.php (read on November 26th, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In the January/February 2006 issue of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] newspaper ''Geschiedenis Magazine'', Dutch [[archaeologist]] Douwe Yntema of Vrije University in [[Amsterdam]] found the authenticity of the map questionable.&lt;ref&gt;See this article for more discussion on this controversy:[http://mailman.geo.uu.nl/pipermail/maphist/2006-February/006646.html Maphist - 'World's oldest map' a fake? (Soleto map 5th century BC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713101518/http://mailman.geo.uu.nl/pipermail/maphist/2006-February/006646.html |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the ostrakon is ancient, the authenticity of the engravings are dubious.&lt;ref&gt;See this article for more discussion on this controversy:[http://mailman.geo.uu.nl/pipermail/maphist/2006-February/006646.html Maphist - 'World's oldest map' a fake? (Soleto map 5th century BC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713101518/http://mailman.geo.uu.nl/pipermail/maphist/2006-February/006646.html |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yntema, the map looks like a school atlas with placenames engraved with "north" at the top. Moreover, the Soleto Map shows the towns as points rather than house symbols found on other ancient maps. Finally, the engravings follow the precise borders of the ostrakon itself, which can lead anyone to interpret the Soleto Map as being made after the terracotta vase was first broken.&lt;ref&gt;Claus Moser, [http://www.kartentisch.de/?p=70 (in German)] at kartentisch.de&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7483">'''Symphony No. 1, Op. 13''' in E♭ by the [[Romania]]n composer [[George Enescu]] reflects the composer's training in both Vienna and Paris. In the former location he studied the Brahmsian tradition with [[Robert Fuchs]], and in the latter the French tradition with [[Jules Massenet]] and [[Gabriel Fauré]] {{harv|Botstein|n.d.}}.

==History==
Enescu completed the symphony in 1905 {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=98}}, and it was premiered on Sunday, 21 January 1906 at the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris, on the fourteenth concert of the 1905–06 series of the [[Concerts Colonne]], conducted by [[Édouard Colonne]] {{harv|Hoffman and Rațiu|1971|loc=311–12}}. It was published by Enoch et co., Paris, in 1906. The score is dedicated to [[Alfredo Casella]], Enescu's former classmate at the Paris Conservatoire and lifelong friend. In turn, Casella would dedicate his Second Symphony to Enescu in 1908 {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=99}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, E{{Music|flat}} clarinet, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 cornets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (triangle, tambourine, cymbals, bass drum), 2 harps, 20 first violins, 18 or 20 second violins, 14 violas, 12 cellos, and 12 contrabasses.

==Analysis==
The symphony falls into three [[movement (music)|movements]]:
*Assez vif et rythmé
*Lent
*Vif et vigoureux
The first movement is dominated by the three component motives of the first theme, announced in unison at the beginning {{harv|Hoffman and Rațiu|1971|loc=306}}. It is in the traditional [[sonata form|sonata-allegro form]], with a rather short development section and the culmination in the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=87–88}}.

The slow movement can be regarded as an extended ''[[Lied]]'' form: ''A–B–C–B–C–A'', preceded by an introduction and concluded with a coda. However, the second half (the ''B–C–A'' portion) does not simply repeat the material from the first part, but develops it, and is not followed with a full recapitulation but closes rather suddenly with only the ''A'' material, and then the coda {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=88}}.

The exposition of the finale, also in sonata-allegro form, is similar to that of the first movement, with the main difference being that the place of a first theme is taken by a group of clearly defined thematic elements (the first, in the unison strings, forms a quasi-permanent background, followed by a second figure in the brass, a third in the trombone, and so on). The second theme is anticipated in triplets, only gradually achieving a stable profile after several attempts {{harv|Hoffman and Rațiu|1971|loc=307}}.

'''Teen Musical Theater of Oregon''' (TMTO) is a youth theater program in [[Medford, Oregon]], USA, produced by Craterian Performances along with [[Next Stage Repertory Company]]. 

==Description==
Teen Musical Theater of Oregon includes kids age 13 - 19 but will sometimes add children age 9 - 12, known as Children's Musical Theater of Oregon, depending on the show. Along with children and teens of this age, Teen Musical Theater will sometimes add "Guest Stars" to the shows who take on roles such as Daddy Warbucks in [[Annie (musical)|Annie]] and The Man In Chair from [[The Drowsy Chaperone]]. TMTO will generally put on three productions a year - a spring show, a summer show, and a winter show.&lt;ref name="craterian"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=About Teen Musical Theater of Oregon |url=http://www.craterian.org/presenter/teen-musical-theater-of-oregon/|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMTO will occasionally produce concerts with a smaller, selected cast.

==History==

Teen Musical Theater began back in 2006 with a spring production of [[Grease (musical)|Grease]]. At that time the production was called Children's Musical Theater of [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] (CMTA) until it was later renamed Children's Musical Theater of Oregon (CMTO). The company was founded by composer and keyboardist John Taylor and his wife Rhonda Taylor.&lt;ref name="John Taylor Bio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=John|title=John Taylor Music Services |url=http://www.johntaylormusicservices.com/bio.htm|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His inspiration to found this organization came from the impact John P. Healy Jr. had on him when he was a part of San Jose Children's Musical Theater. Shortly after the 2008 summer production of [[Oklahoma!]], Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was adopted by Craterian Performances. During the spring 2010 performance of [[Will Rogers Follies]], a new branch of Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was created, called Teen Musical Theater of Oregon. While CMTO is still a working entity of the organization, it has taken a back seat allowing TMTO to produce the majority of the Musical Theater of Oregon's productions.&lt;ref name="craterian"/&gt;

==Original productions==
The company has made three original productions: Broadway: A Musical Journey, Broadway II: The Journey Continues, and Moving On: TMTO in Concert. The first two being revues of many Broadway songs from many different Broadway shows including Lion King, Damn Yankees, A Chorus Line, The Color Purple and Hairspray.&lt;ref name="Broadway II: The Journey Continues"&gt;{{cite news|last=moeschl|first=richard|title="Broadway II: The Journey Continues"|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090320/TEMPO/903200303/-1/rss11=22 November 2013|newspaper=Mail Tribune|date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway series was created as a collaboration between John Taylor and David McCandless. Moving On was created and directed by Cailey McCandless and was a sendoff concert for eight graduating seniors who had participated in TMTO for years.

Others of this type include [[Cap O' Rushes]], [[Catskin]], [[Little Cat Skin]], [[Allerleirauh]], [[The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter]], [[The She-Bear]], [[Tattercoats]], [[Mossycoat]], [[The Princess That Wore A Rabbit-Skin Dress]], and [[Donkeyskin]], or the legend of [[Saint Dymphna]].&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/donkeyskin/other.html Tales Similar to Donkeyskin]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Maria Tatar, p 213, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A king loved his daughter so much that he kept her in her rooms for fear harm would come to her.  She complained to her nurse; unbeknownst to her, the nurse was a witch. She told her to get a wheelbarrow and a bearskin from the king. The king gave them to her, the nurse enchanted them, and when the princess put on the skin, it disguised her, and when she got into the wheelbarrow, it took her wherever she wanted to go. She had it take her to a forest.

A prince hunted her, but when she called to him to call off his dogs, he was so astounded that he asked her to come home with him. She agreed and went in the wheelbarrow. His mother was surprised, and more when the bear began to do housework as well as any servant. One day, the prince had to go to a ball given by a neighbouring prince. The bear wanted to go, and he kicked it.  When he left, she implored his mother for leave to just go and watch. With it, she went to her wheelbarrow and used the wand to turn her bearskin into a ballgown of moon-beams. At the ball, the prince fell in love with her, but she fled, so she would be back in time to hide herself. She was pleased when he told his mother of her, because she had fooled him, and laughed under the table.  The second ball, she went in a gown of sunlight, and his attempts to follow her carriage did not succeed.

The [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] time, the prince succeeded in getting a ring on her finger.  When he went home, he declared he would search for her.  First, he wanted some soup, and for the bear to have nothing to do with it, because every time he mentioned his love, the bear muttered and laughed.  The bear put the ring in the soup.  The prince asked her to take off the skin, and she became a [[attractiveness|beautiful]] young woman.  She told the prince and his mother how her father had kept her imprisoned, and the prince married her.

==Commentary==
This is an unusual variant of this tale as commonly, the heroine flees the threat of enforced marriage to her own father, as in Allerleirauh, The She-Bear, Donkeyskin, and The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; or the legend of [[Saint Dymphna]]. Other tales where the heroine has another motive include [[Catskin]], where she flees being married off to the first man, Cap O' Rushes where her father interpreted her words to mean she did not love him, and [[The Child who came from an Egg]], whose (apparent) father had been conquered by another army.

'''The Centre of Attention''' is a [[London]]-based contemporary art organisation set up in 1999. Projects are shown internationally and constitute an ongoing enquiry into the phenomenon of art production, presentation and consumption.

The Centre’s participatory or [[Gonzo journalism|Gonzo]] curating approach include controversial exhibitions such as "Viva la republique" set during the [[Golden Jubilee]] with [[Banksy]], [[Jamie Reid]] and [[Genesis P-Orridge]]; "The curators" which entirely eliminated the artists from the exhibition by putting the curators on display, as well as in-depth solo projects with artists such as a [[Fluxus]] concert with [[Ken Friedman]] or a [[kinetic art]] retrospective of [[Nicolas Schöffer]].

The Centre of Attention was selected for the 51st [[Venice Biennale]] by curator [[Rosa Martinez]] and presented Swansong/Schwanengesang an installation with works from [[Benedict Carpenter]], House of O'Dwyer, Damien Roach and [[Wolfgang Tillmans]]. In this piece, also presented in MousonTurm Frankfurt and [[Mercer Union]] in Toronto, the audience is given an opportunity to rehearse its own funeral: participants select a song; then lay on a plinth, performing death, while the song is webstreamed, formally, reversing the viewer/art-object dynamic.

'''''The Magic Monastery''''' is a collection of [[teaching stories]] from the [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Mysticism|mystical]] tradition, by the writer [[Idries Shah]], together with some stories by the author himself.

The work was first published by the [[Octagon Press]] in 1972. ISF Publishing, sponsored by [[The Idries Shah Foundation]], published a paperback edition on 2017, followed by the [[e-book]] version which can be read online at the ISF official website. 

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had performed while alive. As such, ''The Magic Monastery'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Summary==
''The Magic Monastery'' with the subtitle ''Analogical and Action Philosophy of the Middle East and Central Asia'', contains traditional [[teaching story|teaching stories]] as well as pieces composed by [[Idries Shah]]. The author writes in the preface: "It consists of a representative cross-section of Sufi teaching which constitutes a harmonized whole rather than a selection of typical extracts."

==Reception==
In the August 1972 edition of ''[[Encounter (magazine)| Encounter]]'' magazine, [[Doris Lessing]] described the work as "a particularly and intriguingly informative" "textbook for students".

The book was featured in ''[[The Observer]] Review'''s Book of the Year on 17 December 1972, where it was described as "remarkable for its precise response to the real and inner needs of the time."

In October 1972, writing in the journal ''[[Asian Affairs]]'', historian [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams]] described ''The Magic Monastery'' as "accurately expressing Sufi thought and practice in vivid terms easily comprehensible to readers" and wrote that it illustrates "the manner in which Sufi practice, with its devastating criticism of purely academic learning and its continuing Socratic search for truth at any cost, exercises a powerful appeal to many thoughtful people in the West."&lt;ref name="AsianAffairs"&gt;{{cite journal

On June 5, 1972, the ''[[Worcester News|Worcester Evening News]]'' wrote that book contained "an enormous amount of commonsense" and that the reader "will become amused, educated, immersed."

A reviewer wrote in the ''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]'' on 22 June 1972 that the book "offers much in the way of contemplation and hope, a respite from the ills of modern society."

In the London ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|Evening News]]'' on 5 April 5 1972, the reviewer wrote that the book "...prob[ed] gently into deeper levels of the mind and echo[ed] with what might be conscience."

In the ''Kingston Borough News'', on 19 January 1973, the reviewer was of the opinion that "You won't be quite the same person when you have read this book." and rated the work as "Highly recommended."

Writer, novelist and philosopher, [[Colin Wilson]] in his review of ''The Magic Monastery'' noted that Shah "is not primarily concerned with propagating some secret doctrine. He is concerned with the method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted... The [[Sufism|Sufis]] transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in the manner of the Zen masters, and one of the chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into the subconscious and activate its hidden forces."&lt;ref name="BooksAndBookmen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Colin|author-link=Colin Wilson|title=Worlds of Magic|journal=Books &amp; Bookmen|publisher=[[Hansom Books]]|volume=17|issue=201|date=June 1972|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted psychiatrist Arthur Deikman, in his book ''The Observing Self'' , also mentions tales found in ''The Magic Monastery'' as examples of stories that can indirectly communicate important teachings, for instance, by illustrating the difficulty in describing mystical perception to those who've never experienced it.&lt;ref name=&gt;''The Observing Self'' {{cite book

'''The Peel Players''' were an [[amateur theatre]] group from the [[Isle of Man]] in operation during the 1910s and specialising in [[Manx English|Anglo-Manx]] dialect productions.

Through the initiation of [[Sophia Morrison]],&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Mona Douglas, 'Story of a Militant Manxwoman: Sophia Morrison was a Champion of Manx Culture' (1964), in ''[http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/~stephen/chiollaghbooks/MD_RESTORING_S.pdf "Restoring to Use Our Almost-Forgotten Dances": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance]'' by Mona Douglas, ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, pp. 61 - 65&lt;/ref&gt; the group met for the first time in July 1912 at Christian Street School, [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]].&lt;ref name="Cubbon"&gt;'Drama' in ''A Bibliographical Account of Works Relating to the Isle of Man: Volume II'', compiled and edited by [[William Cubbon]], London: Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 1005 - 1030&lt;/ref&gt; They commenced playing in 1913 with [[Christopher R. Shimmin]] as [[Theatrical producer|producer]].

On 13 January 1913 the Players premiered Shimmin's short Manx dialect play, ''Illiam Kodhere's Will'', in the [[Gaiety Theatre, Isle of Man|Gaiety Theatre]] in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].&lt;ref name="Shimmin"&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/manxliterature/13308060625/ Original cast list], in ''Illiam Kodhere's Will'' by Christopher R. Shimmin, Peel, Isle of Man: Yn Cheshaght Gailckagh, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The Players then took their production of this and another of Shimmin's plays, ''[[The Charm (play)|The Charm]]'', to the David Lewis' Theatre in [[Liverpool]]. It was reported of this performance (by Sophia Morrison) that "There was a crowded house. The Liverpool newspapers gave unstinted praise to both plays and players."&lt;ref name="notes2"&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v2p057.htm 'Notes'] by Sophia Morrison in ''Mannin'', No. 2, November 1913&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of that same year, the Players did a production of Shimmin's next plays, ''Luss ny Graih'' and ''The Dooinney Moyllee''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v2p063.htm 'Creating a Manx Drama'] by Sophia Morrison in ''Mannin'', No. 2, November 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

The Players were keen to use the profits from their performances for charitable purposes in line with their Manx ideals. This included a donation of £52 in 1913 to [[Manx Gaelic Society|The Manx Society]], for "the publication of Manx books and music, music prizes, and so forth,"&lt;ref name="Notes 1915"&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v5p298.htm 'Notes'] by Sophia Morrison in ''Mannin'', No. 5, May 1915&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the Society was in desperate need of money,&lt;ref name="Manx Quarterly"&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq13085.htm 'Manx Society, Annual Meeting: President’s Address'], ''The Manx Quarterly'', No. 13, Vol. II&lt;/ref&gt; and a donation in 1915 to help fund the provision of copies of [[Thomas Edward Brown|T. E. Brown's]] poems for all schools on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v5teb.htm 'T. E. Brown Memorial'] in ''Mannin'', No. 2, May 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[World War I]] broke out, ''[[Mannin (journal)|Mannin]]'' reported that: "The Peel Players' revenue had been devoted to war objects, so that their work had been somewhat curtailed for lack of funds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v6p378.htm 'Notes'] by Sophia Morrison in ''Mannin'', No. 6, November 1916&lt;/ref&gt; This continued for the following year, when ''Mannin'' reported that the Players:&lt;ref name="Notes 1915" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"have this season given their profits to war funds, or for gifts to Peel men on active service and in training; £10 went to Douglas Needlework Fund, £10 to Douglas Belgian Hostel, £5 8s. to Ramsey Belgian Hostel, and the rest to Peel men serving on sea or land."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was only two years after this, in January 1917, that Sophia Morrison, the inspiration behind the Players, died. The central connection between Morrison and the Players was demonstrated by some of their members forming her [[Pall-bearer|pallbearers]]: John J. Joughin, Christopher R. Shimmin, C. Cashin and C. H. Cowley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq18048.htm 'Obituary: Miss Sophia Morrison'], ''The Manx Quarterly'', No. 18, Vol. IV&lt;/ref&gt; The Peel Players did not last long beyond this time.

People who acted with the Peel Players include: Christopher R. Shimmin, William B. Meyrick, John J. Joughin, Evelyn Christian, Amy Preston, C. Cashin, C. H. Cowley, W. H. Crellin, John W. Kelly, Hilda Vick, Amelia Keegan, Lionel Lucas, Charles W. Palmer, [[Tom Dodd (Manx actor)|Tom Dodd]], Sam Harrison and Annie V. Cain.&lt;ref name="Shimmin" /&gt;

Although the Peel Players were only a small amateur group, they are perhaps the most significant theatre group in modern Manx history. Through their central place in the Manx Cultural Revival and their premiering works by perhaps the island's most important playwright, in Christopher R. Shimmin, the Peel Players have been compared to the [[Abbey Theatre]] in [[Dublin]] for their significance to Manx culture.&lt;ref name="Douglas" /&gt;

==Plays produced==
* ''Illiam Kodhere's Will'' by Christopher R. Shimmin
* ''[[The Charm (play)|The Charm]]'' by Christopher R. Shimmin
* ''Luss by Graih'' by Christopher R. Shimmin
* ''The Dooinney Moyllee'' by Christopher R. Shimmin
It had also been hoped that the Players could stage productions of ''Catchin Kirree'' by F. Corris and ''Ellie's Stranger'' by [[W. Clucas Kinley]], but the onset of the First World War disrupted these plans.&lt;ref name="notes2" /&gt;

'''The Theatre Chipping Norton''', sometimes '''The Theatre, Chipping Norton''', is a theatre, cinema, gallery and music venue in [[Chipping Norton]], [[Oxfordshire]], England.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Theatre, Chipping Norton|url=http://housetheatre.org.uk/venues/the-theatre-chipping-norton/|website=House|publisher=Farnham Maltings|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Us now|url=http://www.chippingnortontheatre.com/index.php?us_now|publisher=The Theatre Chipping Norton|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main auditorium was originally a [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] citadel, built in 1888. After some years as a furniture warehouse it was rediscovered in 1968; fundraising began in 1973, the theatre was registered as a charity in 1974, and it opened as a theatre in 1975. It acquired adjoining properties to provide space for bar, gallery, green rooms, offices and rehearsal space, and underwent a major refurbishment in 1996 with [[Arts Council England]] assistance.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief history of the theatre|url=http://www.chippingnortontheatre.com/index.php?history|publisher=The Theatre Chipping Norton|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre produces original shows and hosts touring companies; in 2016 it co-produced with [[The Dukes (Lancaster)|The Dukes]] a 20th-anniversary touring production of ''[[Stones in His Pockets]]''. It prides itself on its annual "world-renowned traditional family [[pantomime]]".&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name="cavendish"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavendish|first1=Dominic|title=Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, The Theatre, Chipping Norton, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/8990274/Ali-Baba-and-the-Forty-Thieves-The-Theatre-Chipping-Norton-review.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dicks|first1=Matt|title=Robin Hood review at the Theatre, Chipping Norton – ‘artfully silly’|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/robin-hood-review-at-the-theatre-chipping-norton-artfully-silly/|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=[[The Stage]]|date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)''''' was painted by [[Salvador Dalí]] in 1966-1967 and is seen by many as one of Dalí's last masterpieces. Filled chaotically with the violent struggle of the men in the picture and the big fish. A golden knife stabs into the fish and the azure- blue sea becomes red with blood.

This painting is a dedication to [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]], a 19th-century French painter who specialised in battle scenes.

'''''We, the Normal'''''   is a 1987 video by American [[video art]]ist [[George Kuchar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Everleth|first1=Mike|title=George Kuchar, R.I.P.|url=http://www.undergroundfilmjournal.com/george-kuchar-r-i-p/|work=Underground Film Journal|date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''We, the Normal''  records Kuchar's trip to [[Boulder, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=world&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reinke|first1=Steve|authorlink1=Excrements of Time: A Brief Introduction to The World of George Kuchar, with Descriptive Notes to the Works|title=The World of George Kuchar|date=2006|publisher=VDB|location=Chicago|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, Kuchar addresses humanity, [[nature]], society.&lt;ref name=normal&gt;{{cite video | people=Kuchar, George (Director) | date=1987 | url=http://www.vdb.org/titles/we-normal | title=We, the Normal | medium=Video | location=Chicago | publisher=Video Data Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The video begins with a conversation about the heater's being turned off between George and his friend, Don, who is trying to take a nap. The video proceeds, as Kuchar lazes around the house, musing about his films and the "perfect [[hors d'oeuvre]]." George cuts between shots of what he is seeing, and shots of his face displaying his thoughts and discomfort with comedic effect.&lt;ref name=normal/&gt;

At a [[Party#Dinner party|Dinner party]], George introduces his friend, Lorna, with apprehension. Kuchar claims that most people do not like Lorna.&lt;ref name=world/&gt; Later George confronts Jim, calling him Tim, who will be leading George and Don on a [[Hiking|hike]] the next day. They are to leave in the late morning, and it will be quite cold up there.&lt;ref name=normal/&gt;

On the hike, George inserts his musings on humanity and [[nature]], as well as a slew of photographs. Throughout the hike, Kuchar records shots of the mountains up which they are hiking. As the three head further up into the mountains, George expresses a growing discomfort.&lt;ref name=normal/&gt;

After the hike, George goes to Lorna's home. They talk about Lorna's daughter and her boyfriend, whom George refers to as a "little twerp."&lt;ref name=normal/&gt;

'''Ye Olde Edgar''' is at 86 and 88 Lower Bridge Street, on the corner of Shipgate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]]. England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376316|desc= Ye Olde Edgar, Chester|accessdate= 31 October 2011|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The building dates probably from the late 16th century.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  It was originally two houses that were later combined as an inn, and have since been converted back into two houses.&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 93| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

It has basically a [[timber framing|timber-framed]] structure, part of which has been replaced in brick.  Its panels are plastered, and it is roofed in grey [[slate]].  The building is in two storeys, with two [[bay (architecture)|bays]] facing each street.  The lower storey is mainly in painted brick, with brackets supporting the [[jettying|jettied]] upper storey.  The side facing Lower Bridge Street contains three [[casement window]]s, and that facing Shipgate Street has two similar windows and a doorway.  The upper storey is timber-framed, with [[close studding]].  On the side facing Lower Bridge Street are two five-light [[mullion]]ed windows, above which are two blank [[gable]]s; that facing Shipgate Street has two two-light mullioned windows, above which are two gables, each containing a four-light mullioned window.  The rear of the building is clad in brick.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;

==Name==

It is thought that the name commemorates [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] who visited Chester in 973.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;
