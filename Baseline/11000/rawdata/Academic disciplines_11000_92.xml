'''ALBOAN''' is the outreach arm of the Loyola Province of the [[Society of Jesus]] for development and social action. It was founded in 1994 but has roots in mission secretariats in [[San Sebastián]], in [[Gujarat]], [[India]], and in the [[Far East]]. It is situated in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] country of [[Bilbao]] and [[Pamplona]]. In 2004 support for [[Fe y Alegría]] was incorporated into ALBOAN. In 2009 offices opened in all provincial capitals and [[Navarre]], with headquarters in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alboan.org/portal/seccion.asp?S=8&amp;N=12|title=Nuestras raices - ALBOAN|last=|website=|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALBOAN undertakes development projects in countries in the southern hemisphere, as well as in autonomous region of Spain where it is situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bmasi.net/en/news/item/974/974|title=B+I Strategy - B+I Strategy and ALBOAN Foundation sign Collaboration Agreement|last=Team|first=B+I Strategy|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly involved in research and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oa.upm.es/8315/1/INVE_MEM_2010_83049.pdf Bordeaux Management School.

==Projects==
ALBOAN, together with the Carmen Gandarias Foundation, has financed several projects. In Nicaragua between 2007 and 2009 modern technologies and the training of 120 teachers to use these technologies was subsidized for 20 schools. This included computers, printers, and audiovisual equipment. In Tchad in 2010, 8 schools with more than 2,500 students were refurbishing and equipped and teachers trained. In Colombia from 2011 to 2014, assistance was given for the education of more than 4,000 young people in five depressed regions of the country. Then from 2013 until 2016 assistance went to 26 rural schools with 750 students in the Amazonian region of [[Pucallpa, Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fundacioncarmengandarias.com/contenidos.php?seccion=3&amp;categoria=14&amp;subcategoria=6&amp;idColaboracion=12&amp;lang=en# Carmen Foundation.

'''Acoustic cleaning''' is a maintenance method used in [[Material handling equipment|material-handling]] and storage systems that handle [[Bulk material handling|bulk granular or particulate materials]], such as [[grain elevator]]s, to remove the buildup of material on surfaces.   Acoustic cleaning apparatus, usually built into the material-handling equipment,   works by generating powerful [[sound wave]]s which shake particulates loose from surfaces, reducing the need for manual cleaning.

==History and design ==
An acoustic cleaner consists of a sound source similar to an [[air horn]] found on trucks and trains, attached to the material-handling equipment, which directs a loud sound into the interior.  It is powered by compressed air rather than electricity so there is no danger of sparking, which could set off an explosion.  It consists of two parts:
*The acoustic driver.  In the driver, compressed air escaping past a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] causes it to vibrate, generating the sound.  It is usually made from solid machined [[stainless steel]].  The diaphragm, the only moving part, is usually manufactured from special aerospace grade titanium to ensure  performance and longevity.
*The bell, a flaring horn, usually made from spun 316 grade stainless steel. The bell serves as a sound [[resonator]], and its flaring shape couples the sound efficiently to the air, increasing the volume of sound radiated.
The overall length of acoustic cleaner horns range from 430&amp;nbsp;mm to over 3 metres long.  The device can operate from a pressure range of 4.8 to 6.2 bars or 70 to 90 psi. The resultant sound pressure level will  be around 200&amp;nbsp;dB.

There are generally 4 ways to control the operation of an acoustic cleaner. 
*The most common is by a simple timer.
*[[SCADA]] (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition).
*PLC ([[programmable logic controller]]).
*Manually by [[Ball valve]].

An acoustic cleaner will typically sound for 10 seconds and then wait for a further 500 seconds before sounding again. This ratio for on/off is approximately proportional to the working life of the diaphragm. Provided the operating environment is between −40&amp;nbsp;C and 100&amp;nbsp;°C, a diaphragm should last between 3 and 5 years. The wave generator and the bell have a much longer life span and will often outlast the environment in which they operate.

The older bells which were made from  cast iron were susceptible to [[rust]]ing in certain environments. The new bells made from 316 spun steel have no problem with rust and are ideal for sterile environments such as found in the food industry or in pharmaceutical plants.

Acoustic cleaning began in the early 1970s with experiments using  ship horns or [[air raid siren]]s.  The first acoustic cleaners  were made from [[cast iron]]. From 1990 onwards the technology became commercially viable and began to be used in dry processing, storage, transport, power generation and manufacturing industries. The latest technology uses 316 spun stainless steel to ensure optimum performance.

==Operation and performance==
The majority of acoustic cleaners operate in the audio frequency range from 60 [[hertz]] up to 420 Hz. However a few operate in the [[infrasonic]] range, below 40 Hz, which is mostly below the human hearing range, to satisfy strict [[noise control]] requirements.
There are three scientific fields which converge in the understanding of acoustic cleaning technology.
*Sound propagation. This relates to an understanding of the nature of the sound waves, how they vary and how they will interact with the environment.
*Mathematics of the environment. [[Materials science]], surface [[friction]], [[distance]] and areas familiar to a mechanical engineer.
*[[Chemical engineering]]. The chemical properties of the powder or substance to be debonded. Especially the auto adhesive properties of the powder.
An acoustic cleaner will  create a series of very rapid and powerful sound induced pressure fluctuations which are then transmitted into the solid particles of ash, [[dust]], granules or powder. This causes them to move at differing speeds and debond from adjoining particles and the surface that they are adhering to. Once they have been separated then the material will fall off due to [[gravity]] or it will be carried away by the process gas or air stream. 

The key features which determine whether or not an acoustic cleaner will be effective for any given problem are the particle size range, the [[moisture content]] and the [[density]] of the particles as well as how these characteristics will change with temperature and time.
Typically particles between 20 micrometres and 5&amp;nbsp;mm with moisture content below 8.5% are ideal. Upper temperature limits are dependent upon the melting point of the particles and acoustic cleaners have been employed at temperatures above 1000 C to remove ash build-up in boiler plants.

It is important to match the operating frequencies to the requirements. Higher frequencies can be directed more accurately whilst lower frequencies will carry further, and are generally used for more demanding requirements. A typical selection of frequencies available would be as follows:

*420 Hz for a small acoustic cleaner which might be used to clear bridging at the base of a silo.
*350 Hz will be more powerful and this frequency can be used to unblock material build-up in ID (induced draft) fans, filters, cyclones, mixers, dryers and coolers.
*230 Hz. At this frequency, the power involved is sufficient to use in most [[electricity generation]] applications.
*75 Hz and 60 Hz. These are generally the most powerful acoustic cleaners and are often used in large vessels and [[Storage silo|silo]]s.

==Health and safety==
The introduction of acoustic cleaners has been a significant improvement in many areas of [[health and safety]]. For instance in [[Storage silo|silo]] cleaning - the previous solutions tended to be intrusive or destructive. Air cannons, [[soot blower]]s, external vibrators, hammering or costly man entry are all superseded by noninvasive sonic horns.
An acoustic cleaner requires no down time and will operate during normal usage of the site.
Taking the example of silo cleaning a little further, there are two typical problems.

===Bridging===
This is when the silo blocks at the outlet. Previously the problem was addressed by manual cleaning from underneath the silo which in its turn introduced significant risk from falling material when the blockage was cleared. An acoustic cleaner is able to operate from the top of a silo through in situ material to clear the blockage at the base.

===Rat holing===
Compaction on the side of a silo. This not only reduces the operating volume in a silo but it also compromises quality control by disrupting the first in first out cycle. Older material compacted on the side of a silo can also start to degrade and produce dangerous gases. An acoustic cleaner will produce sound waves which will make the compacted material resonate at a different rate to the surrounding environment resulting in debonding and clearance.

==Advantages of acoustic cleaners==
*Repetitive use during operations means that there are fewer unscheduled shut downs.
*Improved material flow by the elimination of hang-ups, blocking and bridging.
*Minimisation of cross contamination by ensuring complete emptying of the environment.
*Improved cleaning and reduction of health and safety risks.
*Increased energy efficiency. Reducing the buildup on heat exchange surfaces results in lower energy usage.
*Extended plant life. Aggressive cleaning regimes are avoided.
*Ease of operation. It is easy to automate the horns either at regular intervals or to tie the sounding in to changes in their environment such as pressure or flow rates.
*Importantly they prevent the material buildup problem from occurring in the first place.

These advantages mean that the financial payback is often very quick.

It is also possible to compare acoustic cleaners directly to alternative solutions.

*Air cannons. These are well established but are expensive with limited coverage thus requiring multi unit purchase. They are also noise intrusive and have a high compressed air consumption.
*Vibrators. These are easy to fit to an empty silo but can cause structural damage as well as contributing to powder compaction.
*Low friction linings. These are very quiet but are expensive to install. Also they are prone to erosion and can then contaminate the environment or product.
*Inflatable pads and liners. Again these are easy to install in an empty silo. They help side wall buildup but have no impact on bridging. They are also hard to maintain and can cause compaction.
*Fluidisation through a 1 way membrane. This can help already compacted material. However they are expensive and difficult to install and maintain. They can also contribute to mechanical interlocking and bridging.

==Specific applications for acoustic cleaners==
*[[Boiler]]s. Cleaning of the heat transfer surfaces.
*[[Electrostatic precipitator]]s. Acoustic cleaners are being used for cleaning hoppers, turning vanes, distribution plates, collecting plates and electrode wires.
*[[Super heater]]s, economisers and air heaters.
*Duct work. 
*Filters. Acoustic cleaners are used on reverse air, pulse jet and shaker units. They are effective in reducing pressure drop across the collection surface which will increase bag life and prevent hopper pluggage. Generally they can totally replace the both reverse air fans and shaker units and significantly reduce the compressed air requirement on pulse jet filters.
*ID fans.   Acoustic cleaning helps to provide a uniform cleaning pattern even for inaccessible parts of the fan. This maintains the balance of the fan.
*[[Kiln]] inlet. Acoustic cleaners help to prevent particulate buildup at the [[kiln]] inlet and this will minimise nose ring formation.
*Mechanical pre Collectors. Acoustic cleaners help prevent buildup around the impellers and between the tubes.
*Mills. Acoustic cleaners help maintain material flow and also prevent blockages in the pre grind silos. They also help prevent material buildup in the downstream separators and fans.
*Planetary Coolers. Acoustic cleaners help prevent bridging and ensure complete evacuation.
*Precipitator. Acoustic cleaners help clean the turning vanes, distribution plates, collecting plates and electrode wires. They can either assist or replace the mechanical rapping systems. They also prevent particulate buildup in the under hoppers which would otherwise result in opacity spiking.
*Pre heaters.  Used in towers, gas risers, cyclones and fans.
*Ship cargo holds. Used both to clean and de aerate current loads.
*[[Silo cleaning|Silos and hoppers]].  To prevent bridging and rat holing.
*Static cyclones. Acoustic cleaners will work both within the cyclone and with the associated duct work.

The '''[[Albania]]n Soil Research Institute''' ({{lang-sq|Instituti i Kërkimit të Tokave}}) was a scientific research institute on soil research that was created in 1971 and discontinued in 2006.

==History==
The Soil Research Institute was created in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] in 1971, as a continuation of a pre-existing institute of soil research then based in [[Kamëz]]. Its goal was the [[Pedology (soil study)|pedologic]] study on agricultural and non agricultural land, as well as topographic measurement on land in Albania. In 1996 the Institute of Study and Projection of Irrigation and Drainage Projects, which had been created in 1945, merged into the Soil Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akti.gov.al/kerkimishkencor/ministrite/doc_mbumk/InstiStudimeveTokave.pdf  From the Albanian government website description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akti.gov.al/kerkimishkencor/ministrite/doc_mbumk/TeDhenatInstituteve.pdf Tatjana Dishnica on the history of the scientific agricultural institutes of Albania]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the institute was dissolved by law (government decree Nr. 515, as of 19 July 2006) as a nationwide reorganization occurred, following which new scientific institutions (called Transfer Centers of Agricultural Technology ({{lang-sq|Qendra e Transferimit të Teknologjive Bujqësore}})) were created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://80.78.70.231/pls/kuv/f?p=201:Vendim%20i%20KM:515:19.07.2006 Government decree to end the institution]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">The '''American Bryological and Lichenological Society''' is an organization devoted to the scientific study of all aspects of the [[biology]] of [[bryophytes]] and [[lichen]]-forming [[fungi]] and is one of the nation's oldest botanical organizations. It was originally known as the '''Sullivant Moss Society''', named after [[William Starling Sullivant]]. The Society publishes a quarterly journal distributed worldwide, ''[[The Bryologist]]'', which includes articles on all aspects of the biology of [[mosses]], [[hornworts]], [[liverworts]] and lichens.

==History==
The Society was founded in 1898, and was first known as the Sullivant Moss Chapter. It was founded by [[Elizabeth Gertrude Britton]] and [[Abel Joel Grout]].  [[Carolyn Wilson Harris]] was vice president of the Society during 1904–1905 and charge of the Lichen Department from 1901–1905.

[[Annie Morrill Smith]] was a central figure in the organization in the early years, contributing much time, energy, and money. She was editor or associate editor of ''[[The Bryologist]]'' for ten years, and changed the name to the Sullivant Moss ''Society''.

[[Christianity]] has not generally practised [[aniconism]], or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images, but has had an [[Christian art|active tradition of making and venerating images]] of [[God in Christianity|God]] and other religious figures. However, there are periods of aniconism in [[History of Christianity|Christian history]], notably during the controversy of the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] of the 8th century, and following the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century, when [[Calvinism]] in particular rejected all images in churches, and this practice continues today in Reformed (Calvinist) churches, as well as some forms of [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christianity]]. The [[Catholic Church]] has always defended the use of sacred images in churches, shrines, and homes, encouraging their [[dulia|veneration]] but condemning anyone who would [[latria|worship]] them as if they were gods themselves. 

The use of religious icons and images continues to be advocated at the highest level by religious leaders of major Christian denominations such as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Catholicism|Catholics]].&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCGB2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilliams83/&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnPaulAudience/&gt; The veneration of icons is also a key element of the [[doxology]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=webster231/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casiday447/&gt; The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church accept the church council which condemned iconoclasm and mandated the use of sacred images, the icons of saints, and the crucifix in churches, public shrines, and in homes. The explanation of the consistency of sacred images with the Christian religion was largely based on the arguments of [[St. John Damascene]].

Christian aniconism has only very rarely covered general secular images, unlike [[aniconism in Islam]]; [[Anabaptist]] groups such as the [[Amish]] are rare exceptions.

==Early Christianity==
{{more information|Depiction of Jesus}}
Several voices in [[Early Christianity]] expressed "grave reservations about the dangers of images",&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"&gt;Freedberg, 176&lt;/ref&gt; though contextualizing these remarks has often been the source of fierce controversy, as the same texts were brought out at intervals in succeeding centuries. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] described the mentions of Christian views on Christian images before the mid-6th century as "scattered and spotty",&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and of an earlier period wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is a striking fact that when painting and sculpture first began to infiltrate Christian assembly rooms and cemeteries they did so practically unheeded by either opponents of or apologists for Christianity—engaged though these were in passionate disputes over idols and idolatry. No literary statement from the period prior to the year 300 would make one suspect the existence of any Christian images other than the most laconic and hieroglyphic of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

— and yet from [[archaeology]] it is clear that the use of quite complex figurative Christian images was widespread by that date. There are mentions of images of [[Jesus]] from the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] onwards. The [[Catacombs of Rome]] contain the earliest images, mostly painted, but also including [[relief]]s carved on [[sarcophagi]], dating from the end of the 2nd century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus is often represented by [[pictogram]] symbols, though he is also portrayed. In the [[Dura-Europos church]], of about 230-256, which of the very early churches surviving is in the best condition, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the [[Good Shepherd]].&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, ''Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine'', p. 134, Mercer University Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Protestant position on the history of images in places of worship however is expressed by Phillip Schaff, &lt;blockquote&gt;'Yet previous to the time of Constantine we find no trace of an image of Christ properly speaking except among the Gnostic Carpocratians and in the case of the heathen emperor Alexander Severus who adorned his domestic chapel as a sort of pantheistic Pantheon with representatives of all religions. The above mentioned idea of the uncomely personal appearance of Jesus the entire silence of the Gospels about it and the Old Testament prohibition of images restrained the church from making either pictures or statues of Christ until the Nicene age when a great reaction in this respect took place though not without energetic and long continued opposition.&lt;ref name= "schaff"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Schaff | first = Phillip | title = History of the Christian Church | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | location = Massachusetts | page = 381 | date = 2006 | url = 
https://books.google.com/books?id=NV8sAAAAYAAJ | isbn = 9781565631960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Corby Finney's analysis of Early Christian writing and material remains distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting Early Christians on the issue: "first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen". These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that "overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined", so placing less emphasis on the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish background]] of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii-xii, viii and xi quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Images were also associated with the [[idolatry]] of the pagan [[Ancient Roman religion]] and other cults and religions around them,&lt;ref&gt;Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, et al. "Iconoclasm." In [[Grove Art Online]]. Oxford Art Online, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T039783 subscription required] (accessed April 26, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and much early Christian polemic was devoted to attacking paganism for idolatry. In the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] the issues are discussed in the [[Letters of St. Paul]] and a [[Idolatry and Christianity|prohibition of idolatry]] is included in the [[Apostolic Decree]]. The objections to "decorative and symbolic devices, narrative and didactic images", a description that encompasses much though not all of the earliest Christian art, were much less, as these were not plausibly capable of "idolatric abuse"; according to Kitzinger, "much of the art of the Roman catacombs betrays a studied attempt to avoid any suspicion or encouragement of idolatric practices".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jocelyn Toynbee]] agrees:"In two-dimensional, applied art of this kind there was never any danger of idolatry in the sense of actual worship of cult-images and votive pictures".&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 294-295; see also Jensen, 13-19 on the types of early images.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century there are increased, if scattered, expressions of opposition to images. At the Spanish non-ecumenical [[Synod of Elvira]] (c. 305) bishops concluded, "Pictures are not to be placed in churches, so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration", the earliest such prohibition known.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 36, http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/elvira.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eusebius]] (died 339) wrote a letter to [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]] (Emperor Constantine's sister) saying "To depict purely the human form of Christ before its transformation, on the other hand, is to break the commandment of God and to fall into pagan error";&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251], p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; though this did not stop her decorating [[Santa Constanza|her mausoleum]] with such images. By the end of the century Bishop [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (died 403) "seems to have been the first cleric to have taken up the matter of Christian religious images as a major issue".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 92&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote an appeal to John, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 394) in which he recounted how he tore apart a curtain hanging on the doors of the church decorated with an image of 'Christ or one of the saints' and admonished the other bishop that such images are "opposed&amp;nbsp;... to our religion", while also replacing the curtain with another expensively embroidered one.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 9, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001051.htm letter 51]&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers cited in later controversies were [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Lactantius]], although evidence of opposition to images by church leaders is often also evidence of their usage in the church.&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the question of images caused a tension in the early church between a theologically-trained clerical elite and the broad mass of followers of the church, and perhaps especially women; the letter of Eusebius being a leading piece of evidence cited here. However other scholars, including Finney and Toynbee,&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii-xii; Toynbee, 295&lt;/ref&gt; dispute this reading of the documentary evidence, pointing out that the physical evidence of sites such as the [[Catacomb of Callistus]] suggests that "church authorities at least tolerated if not approved both the decoration and the content of the iconography on its own property over a fairly long period of time".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that the use of images was regarded as especially characteristic of heretics. [[Irenaeus]], (c. 130–202) in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (1:25;6) says scornfully of the Gnostic [[Carpocratians]], "They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles [pagans]". Irenaeus does not speak critically of icons or portraits in a general sense, only of certain gnostic sectarians use of icons. On the other hand, by the 8th century there is evidence that opposition to images was associated with what was by then the largely vanished heresy of [[Arianism]], though the historical evidence for this now appears slender,&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251]&lt;/ref&gt; and important early figurative mosaics in Italy were created under Arian rule.

==After Constantine==
However, as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles with traditions of religious images, and especially after the conversion of Constantine (c. 312), the legalization of Christianity, and, later that century, the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, many new people came into the new large public churches, which began to be decorated with images that certainly drew in part on imperial and pagan imagery: "The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], The Early Church (The Penguin History of the Church, 1993), 283; Hurlbut, J. L. The Story of the Christian Church. Zondervan, 1967, p.62; Loverance, Rowena (2007). Christian Art. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 117. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02479-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility that Christian art was a movement from below, disapproved of by the clerical hierarchy, vanishes in the large churches built with imperial patronage at the urging of that hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest literary evidence of ''[[proskynesis]]'' before images comes from the first half of the 6th century;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94&lt;/ref&gt; it had already been common before the cross by the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 90&lt;/ref&gt;  The lighting of candles before images, and leaving lit candles and lamps (going beyond what might merely be necessary to actually see them) is mentioned in 6th century sources.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justinian to the Iconoclastic period==
The period after the reign of [[Justinian]] (527-565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 85-87; 95-115&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kitzinger, "during the late sixth and seventh centuries devotional practices in front of images became elaborate, common, and intense".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it was in this period that images seem to have become common in Christian homes, and "Once admitted to that sphere their use and abuse was beyond control".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 98&lt;/ref&gt;  Literary mentions of Christian images greatly increase, in the accounts of pilgrims to the [[Holy Land]], in works of history, and in popular accounts of the lives of saints; at the same time some of these begin to mention acts of iconoclasm against images. The legendary nature of much of the last two types of material is clear, but the stories remain evidence of practices around images and beliefs as to what images were capable of.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

It is this period that the attribution to individual images of the potential to achieve, channel or display various forms of spiritual grace or divine power becomes a regular motif in literature. In the many miracle stories, there is a "tendency to break down the barrier between image and prototype", so that "the image acts or behaves as the subject itself is expected to act or behave. It makes known its wishes&amp;nbsp;... It enacts evangelical teachings,&amp;nbsp;... When attacked it bleeds,&amp;nbsp;... [and] In some cases it defends itself against infidels with physical force&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Images make promises, and demand that promises made by others are kept, are immune to attack, and most commonly of all, images bestow "some kind of material benefit upon&amp;nbsp;... votaries".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous example of this is the role ascribed to the [[Image of Edessa]] (or Mandylion) in the failure of the Persian siege of the city in 544. The image is not mentioned in the account of [[Procopius]], writing soon after the event, but first appears as the agent of the failure in the history of [[Evagrius Scholasticus]] of about 593.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;  Though most often images are described as acting through some kind of intermediary, sometimes direct physical contact produces the benefit, as with a dry well that refilled when an icon was lowered in the bucket, or medical benefit ascribed to drinking some ground-up plaster from a fresco in water.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 105-107 and note&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 6th century [[Julian of Atramytion]] objected to sculpture, but not paintings, which is effectively the Orthodox position to the present day, except for small works.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94-95 (with long note); Freedberg, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Byzantine iconoclasm ==
[[File:Irenekirken.jpg|thumb|A simple cross replaced a mosaic figure during the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], [[Hagia Irene]] Church in Istanbul]]
{{Main article|Byzantine iconoclasm}}

There were two periods of [[iconoclasm]], or image destruction, in the [[Byzantine Empire]], in the mid eighth and early ninth centuries. The arguments of the Iconoclasts remain rather obscure, as almost all their writings were [[book burning |destroyed]] after the "[[Triumph of Orthodoxy]]". The simple belief that images were idolatrous appears to have been their main motive; reference was made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], and aniconic statements by the [[Church Fathers]], some of which may now be lost. One theological issue revolved around the two natures of [[Jesus]]. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be [[Nestorianism]], and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was [[Monophysitism]], all icons were thus heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96, 106-118, 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Cyril, "Historical Introduction," in Bryer &amp; Herrin, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–6, "Chronology", pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179, "Anthology of Texts in Translation", pp.&amp;nbsp;180–186&lt;/ref&gt;

The political aspects of the conflicts are complex, involving with the relationship between the Byzantine Emperors, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] councils, and the Pope. There has been much scholarly discussion over the possible influence on the Iconoclasts of the [[aniconism in Islam]], the century-old  religion which had inflicted devastating defeats on Byzantium in the decades preceding. Most scholars reject direct religious influence, though many feel the feeling of crisis produced by defeats at the hands of Islam contributed to the Iconoclast movement. Both the cross and secular two-dimensional images continued to be acceptable, indeed were used to replace religious imagery in the two best-known examples. The defeat of Byzantine Iconoclasm was so emphatic that the issue has never arisen again in Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', pp.&amp;nbsp;98–106, 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Iconoclasm==
Figurative [[monumental sculpture]] was still avoided in the [[Western Christianity|West]] until the time of [[Charlemagne]] around 800; the [[Franks]] had no association of sculpture with cult images and a life-size [[crucifix]] (with "corpus") known to have been in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen]] was probably a pivotal work, opening the way to the free general use of large sculpture. This was contemporary with the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (see below). Religious sculpture, especially if large and free-standing, has always been extremely rare in [[Eastern Christianity]]. The Western church was anxious to distinguish its use of images from idolatry, and set out its theological position in the Carolingian [[Libri Carolini]], in similar but slightly different terms to those set out by the Eastern church after the episode of Iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33, 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}; Schiller, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

In his travels through the [[Auvergne]] between 1007 and 1020 the cleric Bernard of Angers was initially disapproving of the large crucifixes with a sculpted three-dimensional ''corpus'', and other religious statues that he saw, but he came to accept them.  The [[Gero Cross]], the earliest life-size crucifix image to survive, probably dates to around 960.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;  

===God the Father===
The depiction of [[God the Father in Western art|God the Father in art]] long remained unacceptable; he was typically only shown with the features of Jesus, which had become fairly standardized by the 6th century, in scenes such as the [[Garden of Eden]]. The rationale for this was the doctrine of the pre-existing Christ or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', which holds that Christ has existed from the beginning of time. Very simply put, as a member of the [[Holy Trinity]] of three persons in one God, representations of God could be achieved by depicting Jesus as ''Logos'', except in the few cases where both Jesus and God the Father needed to be shown separately, as in scenes of the [[Baptism of Jesus]]. Alternatively God the Father was represented only by the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], which probably reached [[Christian art]] from [[Hellenistic Judaism]], as it is prominent in the wall paintings of the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] in [[Syria]]. Depictions of God the Father, essentially as the [[Old Testament]] [[Ancient of Days]], only became common in the West from about 1200 onwards, and remain controversial in Eastern Orthodoxy, still being prohibited by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] for example (where images of the Ancient of Days, also banned, are held to represent Christ). Free-standing monumental sculpture is also avoided by the Orthodox churches, and reliefs are much rarer, especially large ones. On the other hand, [[icon]]s have a slightly different theological position in Orthodoxy and play a more significant part in religious life than in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], let alone the Protestant churches.

===Bernard of Clairvaux===
[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090–1153) was an influential [[Cistercian]] monk who famously wrote against the excessive use of imagery in a monastic context, and was largely responsible for the unornamented style of [[Cistercian architecture]]. However his attack concentrated on what he saw as frivolous non-religious elements in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] religious art of his day, which he said distracted monks from their religious life.&lt;ref&gt;"But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness? Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books."{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was prepared to sacrifice religious imagery also, both to save money and avoid "distractions of the senses",&lt;ref name="Freedberg, 176"/&gt;

==Among Nestorians==
In the [[Church of the East]], also known as the Nestorian church, opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the [[rise of Islam]] in the region, where it forbade any type of depictions of Saints and [[biblical prophets]]. As such, the Church was forced to get rid of their icons.&lt;ref name="Nestorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=21-05-027-f|title=The Shadow of Nestorius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|The Reformation and art}}

Opposition to religious imagery was a feature of proto-Protestant movements such as the [[Lollards]] in England.

The [[Reformation]] produced two main branches of Protestant Christianity; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith. Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

On the contrary, at the time of the Reformation, [[Calvinist]]s preached in violent terms the rejection of what they perceived as idolatrous Catholic practices such as religious pictures, statues, or relics of saints, as well as against the [[Lutheran]] retention of [[sacred art]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Karlstadt]] was the earliest extreme iconoclast, to be followed by [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]]. The Reformed (Calvinist) churches (including the Anglican, [[Puritan]]/[[Congregational]] and [[Reformed Baptist]] Churches) completely prohibited the display of religious images. Reformed theologians such as [[Francis Turretin]], [[Theodore Beza]], [[Westminster divines|the Divines of the Westminster Assembly]], and later [[Robert Dabney]] and [[John Murray (theologian)|John Murray]],&lt;ref name="the-highway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-highway.com/pictures_Murray.html |title= Murray on pictures of Christ |publisher=the-highway.com|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  explicitly reject the depiction of Christ, citing arguments drawn from the second commandment, as well as writings of the early church, using the same texts and arguments as Byzantine iconoclasts.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 165(quoted)-166, 167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The Calvinist [[Westminster Larger Catechism]] of 1647 asks in Question 109, 'What are the sins forbidden in the second commandment?
Answer: The sins forbidden in the second commandment are, all devising, counseling, commanding, using, and anywise approving, any religious worship not instituted by God himself; tolerating a false religion; the making any representation of God, of all or of any of the three persons, either inwardly in our mind, or outwardly in any kind of image or likeness of any creature'.

{{cquote| Romanists make images of God the Father, painting him in their church windows as an old man; and an image of Christ on the crucifix; and, because it is against the letter of this commandment, they sacrilegiously blot it out of their catechism, and divide the tenth commandment into two.

Apart from official destruction of art, there were outbreaks of violent Calvinist [[iconoclasm]] such as the [[Beeldenstorm]] in the [[Low Countries]] in 1566. During this time, [[Anglicanism]], falling with the broader Reformed tradition, also removed most religious images and symbols from churches and discouraged their private use. [[Elizabeth I of England]] was one of many Anglicans to exhibit somewhat contradictory attitudes, both ordering a [[crucifix]] for her chapel when they were against a law she had approved, and objecting forcefully when the [[Dean of St Paul's]] put in the royal pew a service book with "[[woodcut|cuts]] resembling angels and saints, nay, grosser absurdities, pictures resembling the Holy [[Trinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 175&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Reformed churches are now considerably more relaxed over the use of religious art and symbols than they were in the Reformation period, though many denominations avoid images in churches, and in the Anglican Church matters such as the use of altar crosses and crucifixes can arouse strong feelings. However while portraits of saints were destroyed, portraits of contemporary individuals, including church leaders, were not considered problematic, and exist in large numbers. Reformed Christians did not object to small religious images, typically of episodes from the [[New Testament]], in the form of [[old master print|prints]], and Bible illustrations or picture books, especially those intended for children, were and continue to be widely used in Protestantism,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inventing the Holy Land: American Protestant Pilgrimage to Palestine, 1865–1941|author=Rogers, S.S.|date=2011|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739148440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeMlQ4xgB60C|page=24|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so that in the 17th century, even "the ordinary Puritan enjoyed a Bible with pictures".&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=From Sacred to Secular: Visual Images in Early American Publications|author=Lacey, B.E.|date=2007|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=9780874139617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VXsjvrmMvAC|page=17|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faced with the Protestant challenge to imagery, then far more virulent than it usually is today, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] reacted by quietly removing some types of medieval imagery that could not be justified theologically, but otherwise by strengthening its commitment to the use of art and images to promote the Christian message, though tightening up on the detailed content of imagery, which was brought under stricter control by the church.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 176-177&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtual end of the production of religious painting in Reformed parts of Europe had the effect of diverting artistic production into secular subjects, especially in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] of the 17th century. While Catholic Europe was still producing [[Baroque]] altarpieces in large numbers, the Netherlands produced genre scenes, very often of ungodly behavior, still lifes, portraits and landscapes. Moralistic messages were often attached to these, though the subject matter often fights somewhat with them. Protestant religious art, mainly in the form of illustrations of biblical events, continued in [[printmaking]] and book illustrations, for example in the [[etching]]s of [[Rembrandt]], who also painted biblical subjects. In the early stages of the Reformation, Protestant propagandists made vigorous use of images satirizing their opponents.

Calvinist aniconism, especially in printed material, and stained glass, can generally be said to have weakened in force, although the range and context of images used are much more restricted than in Catholicism, Lutheranism, or parts of Anglicanism, the latter of which also incorporated many high church practices after the [[Oxford Movement]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The relationship between '''[[BDSM]] and the law''' changes significantly from nation to nation. It is entirely dependent on the legal situation in individual countries whether the practice of BDSM has any criminal relevance or legal consequences. Criminalization of consensually implemented BDSM practices is usually not with explicit reference to BDSM, but results from the fact that such behavior as spanking or cuffing someone could be considered a breach of personal rights, which in principle constitutes a criminal offense. In Germany, Netherlands, [[Japan]] and [[Scandinavia]], such behavior is legal in principle. In Austria the legal status is not clear, while in Switzerland some BDSM practices can be considered criminal. Spectacular incidents like the US scandal of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'' and the British [[Operation Spanner]] demonstrate the degree to which difficult grey areas can pose a problem for the individuals and authorities involved. It is very important to learn the legal status of the right of consent in the judicial statue of the country of resident for the practitioners of BDSM.

==Current status==

===Austria===
§90 of the criminal code declares bodily injury (§§ 83, 84) or the endangerment of physical security (§89) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the "victim" has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities.  Case law from the Austrian Supreme Court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities (and thus punishable) when a "serious injury" (meaning a damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than 24 days) or the "death" of the "victim" results.  A ''light injury'' is considered generally ''permissible'' when the "victim" has consented to it.  In cases of threats to bodily well-being, the standard depends on the probability that an injury will actually occur.  If serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out, then even the threat itself is considered punishable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Zum konkreten Fall der Körperverletzung durch Handlungen im BDSM-Bereich gibt es allerdings keine gefestigte Rechtsprechung. Es kann durchaus sein, dass der Oberste Gerichtshof im BDSM-Bereich auch leichte Körperverletzung als sittenwidrig und somit als strafbar ansieht. Ob eine Handlung gegen die guten Sitten verstößt, hängt in Österreich nämlich davon ab, ob einem vorbildlichen Menschen die Sorge um die Gesundheit des „Opfers“ wichtiger wäre als die Rücksicht auf dessen Wünsche. Es besteht also keine Rechtssicherheit.--&gt;

===Canada===
In 2004, a judge in Canada ruled that videos seized by the police featuring BDSM activities were not obscene, and did not constitute violence, but a "normal and acceptable" sexual activity between two consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' that a person must have an active mind during the specific sexual activity in order to legally consent.  The Court ruled that it is a criminal offence to perform a sexual act on an unconscious person – whether or not that person consented in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can’t consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author= Mike Blanchfield|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/998055--woman-can-t-consent-to-sex-while-unconscious-supreme-court-rules?bn=1|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The practice of BDSM is not generally penalized in Germany if it is conducted with the mutual consent of the partners involved.

The following sections of the criminal code may be relevant in certain instances for BDSM practices:
{{col-begin}}
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top" style="border:0"|
* [[Sexual assault]] (§177)
* [[Sexual abuse]] of persons unable to resist (§179)
* [[Insult]] and insult by deed (§185)
* [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] (§223)
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top"|
* Aggravated battery (§224)
* [[False imprisonment]] (§239)
* [[Coercion]] (§240)
{{col-end}}
To fulfill the charge of coercion, the use of violence or the threat of a "severe mistreatment" must involve an endangerment to life and limb.  In cases where the continued application of the treatment could be ended through the use of a [[safeword]], neither coercion nor sexual coercion may be charged.  In the case of charges of sexual abuse of people incapable of resistance, similar principles apply.  In this case, taking advantage of a person's inability to resist in order to perform sexual acts on that person is considered punishable.  The potential use of the safeword is considered to be sufficient possibility for resistance, since this would lead to the cessation of the act, and so a true inability to resist is not considered to be in effect. The charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges, according to §194. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement.

According to §228 of the German criminal code, a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases in which the deed can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given.  On 26 May 2004, the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to §228.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the Bundesgerichtshof, 26 May 2004, 2 StR 505/03, which may be found at: BGHSt 49, 166 ([http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;Datum=2004-5&amp;Seite=0&amp;client=12&amp;nr=29672&amp;pos=19&amp;anz=244&amp;Blank=1.pdf bundesgerichtshof.de])&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, this ruling makes the question of indecency dependent on the degree to which the bodily injury might be likely to impair the health of the receiving party. According to the BGH, the line of [[indecency]] is definitively crossed when "under an objectively prescient consideration of all relevant circumstances the party granting consent could be brought into concrete danger of death by the act of bodily injury." In its ruling, the court overturned a verdict by the Provincial Court of Kassel, according to which a man who had choked his partner and thereby involuntarily strangled her, had been sentenced to probation for negligent manslaughter.  The court had rejected a conviction on charges of bodily injury leading to death on the grounds that the victim had, in its opinion, consented to the act. Following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases, the Appeals Court of [[Hamm]] ruled in February 2006 that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful childraising.&lt;ref&gt;Appeals Court of Hamm in its judgement of 1 February 2006, case number 10 UF 147/04, available online at the [http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php# Portal of the North Rhine-Westfalian Ministry of Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217060746/http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php |date=17 December 2004 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
For Italian law, BDSM is right on the border between crime and legality, and everything lies in the interpretation of the Code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing "injury" to another person is to be punished. In this context, though, "injury" is legally defined as "anything causing a condition of illness", and "illness" is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is "any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism" (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is "a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy". This makes it somewhat risky to play with someone, as later the "victim" might call for foul play using any sort of little mark as evidence against the partner. Also, any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it. BDSM play between nonconsenting adults or minors or in public is of course punished according to normal laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayzad.com/ Ayzad], ''BDSM – Guida per esploratori dell'erotismo estremo'', Castelvecchi, 2004 {{ISBN|88-7615-025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
In September 2010, a Swedish court ruled that a 32-year-old man was acquitted of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16-year-old woman (the [[age of consent]] in Sweden is 15).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/29302/20100928 Man freed in landmark S&amp;M case]&lt;/ref&gt;  Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revisef65.org/loven.html SM og loven] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution.  This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries, which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.

===Switzerland===
The age of consent in Switzerland is 16 years, which also applies for BDSM play. Children (i.e. those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years.  Certain practices, however, require granting consent to light injuries and thus are only allowed for those over 18. Since Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened, on 1 April 2002, ownership of "objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content" is punishable. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochists, since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfill these criteria.  Critics also object to the wording of the law, which puts sado-masochists in the same category as [[pedophilia|pedophiles]] and [[pederasty|pederasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ig-bdsm.ch/index.php?pid=24 Interessengemeinschaft BDSM Schweiz] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
British law does not recognize the possibility of consenting to [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]]. Such acts are illegal, even between consenting adults, and these laws are enforced ([[R v Brown]] being the leading case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp|title=Spanner Trust submission to the Home Office Review Board on Sexual Offences|publisher=The Spanner Trust|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071214235525/http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp| archivedate= 14 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; R v Brown dismissed the defence of consent, meaning that the men charged of sexual offences could not defend their actions. It has been pointed out that people can consent to activities such as boxing and body piercing, which also result in pain, but apparently cannot consent to BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009]|title=Roffee, James (2015). When Yes Actually Means Yes in Rape Justice. 72 - 91|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202053600/http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the situation that, while Great Britain and especially London are world centers of the closely related fetish scene, there are only very private events for the BDSM scene which are in no way comparable to the German "Play party" scene.

[[Operation Spanner]] was the name of an operation carried out by police in the United Kingdom city of Manchester in 1987, as a result of which a group of homosexual men were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for their involvement in consensual sadomasochism over a ten-year period. The resulting [[House of Lords]] case (''[[R v Brown]]'', colloquially known as "the Spanner case") ruled that [[informed consent|consent]] was not a valid legal defence for [[wounding]] and [[actual bodily harm]] in the UK, except as a foreseeable incident of a lawful activity in which the person injured was participating, e.g. surgery. Following Operation Spanner the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in January 1999 in [[Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom]] that no violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] the individuals live in, as it is the State's responsibility to balance the concerns of [[public health]] and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. In the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill 2007, the British Government cited the Spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts, as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of ''"[[extreme pornography]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons: ''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/en/07130x-n.htm#index_link_206 Criminal Justice And Immigration Bill]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014]] the video distribution of some BDSM practices has become illegal.

=== United States ===
The United States Federal law does not list a specific criminal determination for consensual BDSM acts. Many BDSM practitioners cite the legal decision of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'', 95 N.Y.2d 846 (2000), or the "Cybersex Torture Case", {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} which was the first U.S. appellate decision to hold (in effect) that one does not commit assault if the victim consents. However, many individual states do criminalize specific BDSM actions within their state borders.  Some states specifically address the idea of "consent to BDSM acts" within their assault laws, such as the state of New Jersey, which defines "simple assault" to be "a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle ''entered into by mutual consent'', in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm |title=New Jersey NJ Criminal Offenses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=14 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104155828/http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm |archive-date=4 November 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oregon Ballot Measure 9]] was a [[initiative|ballot measure]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] in [[1992 in the United States|1992]], concerning sadism, masochism, [[gay rights]], pedophilia, and [[public education]], that drew widespread national attention. It would have added the following text to the [[Oregon Constitution]]:
{{cquote|All governments in Oregon may not use their monies or properties to promote, encourage or facilitate [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] or masochism. All levels of government, including [[public education]] systems, must assist in setting a standard for Oregon's youth which recognizes that these behaviors are abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse and they are to be discouraged and avoided.}}
It was defeated in the November 3, 1992 [[general election]] with 638,527 votes in favor, 828,290 votes against.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Documents/elections/initiative.pdf Oregon Blue Book: Initiative, Referendum and Recall: 1902-2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bayesian probability''' is an [[Probability interpretations|interpretation of the concept of probability]], in which, instead of [[frequentist probability|frequency]] or [[propensity probability|propensity]] of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cox |first=R. T. |author-link=Richard Threlkeld Cox |doi=10.1119/1.1990764 |title=Probability, Frequency, and Reasonable Expectation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=14 |pages=1–10 |year=1946 |ref=harv|bibcode=1946AmJPh..14....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; representing a state of knowledge&lt;ref name = "ghxaib"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jaynes, E.T. |year=1986 |contribution=Bayesian Methods: General Background |title=Maximum-Entropy and Bayesian Methods in Applied Statistics |editor=Justice, J. H. |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as quantification of a personal belief.&lt;ref name="Finetti, B. 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Finetti|first1=Bruno|title=Theory of Probability: A critical introductory treatment|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons ltd.|location=Chichester|isbn=9781119286370|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of [[propositional logic]] that enables reasoning with hypotheses, i.e., the propositions whose [[truth value|truth or falsity]] is uncertain. In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under [[frequentist inference]], a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability.

Bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies some [[prior probability]], which is then updated to a [[posterior probability]] in the light of new, relevant [[data]] (evidence).&lt;ref name="paulos"&gt;{{cite web |author-link=John Allen Paulos |last=Paulos |first=John Allen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=thomas%20bayes&amp;st=cse |title=The Mathematics of Changing Your Mind [by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne] |department=Book Review |newspaper=New York Times |date=5 August 2011 |access-date=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation.

The term ''Bayesian'' derives from the 18th&amp;nbsp;century mathematician and theologian [[Thomas Bayes]], who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical [[data analysis]] using what is now known as [[Bayesian inference]].&lt;ref name="HOS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stigler|first1=Stephen M.|title=The history of statistics|date=March 1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674403413|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}} Mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] pioneered and popularised what is now called Bayesian probability.&lt;ref name="HOS" /&gt;{{rp|97–98}}

==Bayesian methodology==
Bayesian methods are characterized by concepts and procedures as follows:
* The use of [[random variable]]s, or more generally unknown quantities,&lt;ref name="rbp"/&gt; to model all sources of uncertainty in statistical models including uncertainty resulting from lack of information (see also [[Uncertainty quantification#Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty|aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty]]).
* The need to determine the prior probability distribution taking into account the available (prior) information.
* The sequential use of [[Bayes' formula]]: when more data become available, calculate the posterior distribution using Bayes' formula; subsequently, the posterior distribution becomes the next prior.
* While for the frequentist a [[null hypothesis|hypothesis]] is a [[Proposition#Treatment in logic|proposition]] (which must be [[principle of bivalence|either true or false]]), so that the frequentist probability of a hypothesis is either 0 or 1, in Bayesian statistics the probability that can be assigned to a hypothesis can also be in a range from 0 to 1 if the truth value is uncertain.

==Objective and subjective Bayesian probabilities==
Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations on Bayesian probability. For ''[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivists]]'', interpreting probability as extension of [[logic]], ''probability'' quantifies the reasonable expectation everyone (even a "robot") sharing the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by [[Cox's theorem]].&lt;ref name="ghxaib" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "vkdmsn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Richard T.|title=The algebra of probable inference|date=1961|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press ; Oxford University Press [distributor]|location=Baltimore, Md. : London|isbn=9780801869822|edition=[Repr.].|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Subjectivism|subjectivists]]'', ''probability'' corresponds to a personal belief.&lt;ref name="Finetti, B. 1974" /&gt; Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the [[Dutch book]] argument or by the [[decision theory]] and [[de Finetti's theorem]].&lt;ref name="Finetti, B. 1974" /&gt; The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.

==History==
{{Main|History of statistics#Bayesian statistics}}

The term ''Bayesian'' refers to [[Thomas Bayes]] (1702–1761), who proved a special case of what is now called [[Bayes' theorem]] in a paper titled "[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]".&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne, Sharon Bertsch. (2011). {{Google books|_Kx5xVGuLRIC|''The Theory That Would Not Die,'' p. 10.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that special case, the prior and posterior distributions were [[Beta distribution]]s and the data came from [[Bernoulli trial]]s. It was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) who introduced a general version of the theorem and used it to approach problems in [[celestial mechanics]], medical statistics, [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, Stephen M. (1986) ''The history of statistics.'' Harvard University press. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's [[principle of insufficient reason]], was called "[[inverse probability]]" (because it [[Inductive reasoning|infer]]s backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes).&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006&gt;Fienberg, Stephen. E. (2006) [http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue01/fienberg.pdf ''When did Bayesian Inference become "Bayesian"?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910070556/http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue01/fienberg.pdf |date=September 10, 2014 }} ''Bayesian Analysis'', 1 (1), 1–40. See page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1920s, "inverse probability" was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that came to be called [[frequentist statistics]].&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006/&gt;

In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace developed in two directions, giving rise to ''objective'' and ''subjective'' currents in Bayesian practice.
[[Harold Jeffreys]]' ''Theory of Probability'' (first published in 1939) played an important role in the revival of the Bayesian view of probability, followed by works by [[Abraham Wald]] (1950) and [[Leonard J. Savage]] (1954). The adjective ''Bayesian'' itself dates to the 1950s;  the derived ''Bayesianism'', ''neo-Bayesianism'' is of 1960s coinage.&lt;ref&gt;

In the objectivist stream, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed and the data analysed.&lt;ref name=Bernardo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernardo | first1 = J.M. | authorlink = José-Miguel Bernardo | year = 2005 | title = Reference analysis | url = | journal = Handbook of statistics | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 17–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No subjective decisions need to be involved. In contrast, "subjectivist" statisticians deny the possibility of fully objective analysis for the general case.

In the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods and the consequent removal of many of the computational problems, and to an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, R.L. (2004) ''A conversation with James O. Berger'', Statistical science, 9, 205–218&lt;/ref&gt; While frequentist statistics remains strong (as seen by the fact that most undergraduate teaching is still based on it &lt;ref&gt;[[José-Miguel Bernardo|Bernardo, José M.]] (2006) [http://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/ICOTS7/Proceedings/PDFs/InvitedPapers/3I2_BERN.pdf ''A Bayesian mathematical statistics primer'']. ICOTS-7&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}), Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, e.g., in the field of [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bishop, C.M. ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.'' Springer, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justification of Bayesian probabilities==
The use of Bayesian probabilities as the basis of [[Bayesian inference]] has been supported by several arguments, such as [[Cox's theorem|Cox axioms]], the [[Dutch book|Dutch book argument]], arguments based on [[decision theory]] and [[de Finetti's theorem]].

===Axiomatic approach===
[[Richard Threlkeld Cox|Richard T. Cox]] showed that&lt;ref name = "vkdmsn" /&gt; Bayesian updating follows from several axioms, including two [[functional equations]] and a hypothesis of differentiability. The assumption of differentiability or even continuity is controversial; Halpern found a counterexample based on his observation that the Boolean algebra of statements may be finite.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J. ''A counterexample to theorems of Cox and Fine'', Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 10: 67–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Other axiomatizations have been suggested by various authors with the purpose of making the theory more rigorous.&lt;ref name="rbp"&gt;Dupré, Maurice J., Tipler, Frank J. [http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ba/1340369856 ''New Axioms For Rigorous Bayesian Probability''], Bayesian Analysis (2009), Number 3, pp. 599–606&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch book approach===
The Dutch book argument was proposed by de Finetti; it is based on betting. A [[Dutch book]] is made when a clever gambler places a set of bets that guarantee a profit, no matter what the outcome of the bets. If a [[bookmaker]] follows the rules of the Bayesian calculus in the construction of his odds, a Dutch book cannot be made.

However, [[Ian Hacking]] noted that traditional Dutch book arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. For example, [[Ian Hacking|Hacking]] writes&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (1967, Section 3, page 316), Hacking (1988, page 124)&lt;/ref&gt; "And neither the Dutch book argument, nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms, entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be Bayesian. It is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the Bayesian model of learning from experience. Salt could lose its savour."

In fact, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on "[[probability kinematics]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skyrms|first=Brian|date=1987-01-01|title=Dynamic Coherence and Probability Kinematics|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=54|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1086/289350|jstor=187470}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the publication of [[Richard Jeffrey|Richard C. Jeffreys]]' rule, which is itself regarded as Bayesian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayes-theorem/|title=Bayes' Theorem|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The additional hypotheses sufficient to (uniquely) specify Bayesian updating are substantial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21329-8_15|title=Probability in Physics|last=Fuchs|first=Christopher A.|last2=Schack|first2=Rüdiger|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=|isbn=9783642213281|editor-last=Ben-Menahem|editor-first=Yemima|series=The Frontiers Collection|location=|pages=233–247|language=en|arxiv=1103.5950|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-21329-8_15|editor-last2=Hemmo|editor-first2=Meir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not universally seen as satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas van Fraassen|van Frassen, B.]] (1989) ''Laws and Symmetry'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-824860-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision theory approach===
A [[statistical decision theory|decision-theoretic]] justification of the use of Bayesian inference (and hence of Bayesian probabilities) was given by [[Abraham Wald]], who proved that every [[admissible decision rule|admissible]] statistical procedure is either a Bayesian procedure or a limit of Bayesian procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Abraham. ''Statistical Decision Functions.'' Wiley 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, every Bayesian procedure is [[admissible decision rule|admissible]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo, José M., Smith, Adrian F.M. ''Bayesian Theory.'' John Wiley 1994. {{ISBN|0-471-92416-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors==
Following the work on [[expected utility]] [[optimal decision|theory]] of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]],  decision-theorists have accounted for [[optimal decision|rational behavior]] using a probability distribution for the [[Agent-based model|agent]]. Johann Pfanzagl completed the ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by providing an axiomatization of subjective probability and utility, a task left uncompleted by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]: their original theory supposed that all the agents had the same probability distribution, as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1967, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Pfanzagl's axiomatization was endorsed by Oskar Morgenstern: "Von Neumann and I have anticipated...[the question whether probabilities] might, perhaps more typically, be subjective and have stated specifically that in the latter case axioms could be found from which could derive the desired numerical utility together with a number for the probabilities (cf. p. 19 of The [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]). We did not carry this out; it was demonstrated by Pfanzagl ... with all the necessary rigor".&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern (1976, page 65)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] noted that the individual agent's probability distribution could be objectively studied in experiments. The role of judgment and disagreement in science has been recognized since [[Aristotle]] and even more clearly with [[Francis Bacon]]. The objectivity of science lies not in the psychology of individual scientists, but in the process of science and especially in statistical methods, as noted by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stigler |first=Stephen M. |year=1978 |authorlink=Stephen Stigler |title=Mathematical statistics in the early States |journal=Annals of Statistics |volume=6 |issue=March |pages=239–265 esp. p. 248 |publisher= |doi=10.1214/aos/1176344123 |jstor=2958876 |mr=483118 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344123 |accessdate= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recall that the objective methods for falsifying propositions about personal probabilities have been used for a half century, as noted previously. Procedures for [[statistical hypothesis testing|testing hypotheses]] about probabilities (using finite samples) are due to [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1931) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]] (1931, 1937, 1964, 1970). Both [[Bruno de Finetti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galavotti|first=Maria Carla|date=1989-01-01|title=Anti-Realism in the Philosophy of Probability: Bruno de Finetti's Subjectivism|journal=Erkenntnis (1975-)|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=239–261|doi=10.1007/bf01236565|jstor=20012239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galavotti|first=Maria Carla|date=1991-12-01|title=The notion of subjective probability in the work of Ramsey and de Finetti|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-2567.1991.tb00839.x/abstract|journal=Theoria|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=239–259|doi=10.1111/j.1755-2567.1991.tb00839.x|issn=1755-2567}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank P.

The "Ramsey test" for evaluating probability distributions is implementable in theory, and has kept experimental psychologists occupied for a half century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson et al. (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;
This work demonstrates that Bayesian-probability propositions can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]], and so meet an empirical criterion of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]], whose work inspired Ramsey. (This [[falsifiability]]-criterion was popularized by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#ProDem "Karl Popper" in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T76Zd20IYlgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logic+of+scientific+discovery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eGfU8COmAA&amp;sig=W8TTt29x5sG8aCGpYuWnonDFH8M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=crC3TJKND46ssAPp06jkCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=falsifiability&amp;f=false ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''] 2nd Edition, Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-27843-0}} (Reprint of 1959 translation of 1935 original) Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Modern work on the experimental evaluation of personal probabilities uses the randomization, [[double blind|blinding]], and Boolean-decision procedures of the Peirce-Jastrow experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce &amp; Jastrow (1885)
&lt;/ref&gt; Since individuals act according to different probability judgments, these agents' probabilities are "personal" (but amenable to objective study).

Personal probabilities are problematic for science and for some applications where decision-makers lack the knowledge or time to specify an informed probability-distribution (on which they are prepared to act). To meet the needs of science and of human limitations, Bayesian statisticians have developed "objective" methods for specifying prior probabilities.

Indeed, some Bayesians have argued the prior state of knowledge defines ''the'' (unique) prior probability-distribution for "regular" statistical problems; cf. [[well-posed problem]]s. Finding the right method for constructing such "objective" priors (for appropriate classes of regular problems) has been the quest of statistical theorists from Laplace to [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]]. These theorists and their successors have suggested several methods for constructing "objective" priors (Unfortunately, it is not clear how to assess the relative "objectivity" of the priors proposed under these methods):
* [[principle of maximum entropy|Maximum entropy]]
* [[Haar measure|Transformation group analysis]]
* [[José-Miguel Bernardo|Reference analysis]]

Each of these methods contributes useful priors for "regular" one-parameter problems, and each prior can handle some challenging [[statistical model]]s (with "irregularity" or several parameters). Each of these methods has been useful in Bayesian practice. Indeed, methods for constructing "objective" (alternatively, "default" or "ignorance") priors have been developed by avowed subjective (or "personal") Bayesians like [[James Berger (statistician)|James Berger]] ([[Duke University]]) and [[José-Miguel Bernardo]] ([[University of Valencia|Universitat de València]]), simply because such priors are needed for Bayesian practice, particularly in science.&lt;ref name="refa"&gt;Bernardo, J. M. (2005). [http://www.uv.es/~bernardo/RefAna.pdf ''Reference Analysis'']. ''Handbook of Statistics'' 25 (D. K. Dey and [[C. R. Rao]] eds). Amsterdam: Elsevier, 17–90&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for "the universal method for constructing priors" continues to attract statistical theorists.&lt;ref name="refa" /&gt;

Thus, the Bayesian statistician needs either to use informed priors (using relevant expertise or previous data) or to choose among the competing methods for constructing "objective" priors.

Historical accounts for early U.S. naval history now occur across the spectrum of two and more centuries. This Bibliography lends itself primarily to [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] covering early U.S. naval history beginning around the [[American Revolution]] period on through the 18th and 19th centuries and includes sources which cover notable naval commanders, Presidents, important ships, major naval engagements and corresponding wars. The bibliography also includes sources that are not committed to the subject of U.S. naval history per se but whose content covers this subject extensively.

Among the contemporary and earlier historical accounts are [[WP:PSTS|primary sources]], historical accounts, often derived from letters, dispatches, government and military records, captain's logs and diaries, etc., written by authors who were involved in or closely associated to the historical episode in question. Primary source material is often collected, compiled and published by other editors also, sometimes many years after the historical subject has passed. Many of the authors are notable and even famous in their own right and are linked to their corresponding biographies.

==Listing and format of sources==
Sources dedicated to or well committed to a subject are listed under that subject/section.
Sources in any given section can often be used for other subjects/section so a link is sometimes provided to those section(s). A few of the more general sources are sometimes duplicated in the various sections where they equally apply. Sections/subjects are listed in chronological order.  For uniformity in the listing, sources in this bibliography employ the format supported by [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bibliographies#Examples|WikiProject Bibliographies]], presented in the example shown directly below, noting author's ''lastname'' first, etc., year-date of publication, book title in ''italics'', number of pages, ISBN and/or OCLC number (when available):
&lt;center&gt;
*'''Last, First, (1900), ''Book-title'', Publisher, 123 pages, ISBN '''0123...''', Url'''''
&lt;/center&gt;
Primary sources listed in this bibliography are denoted with an uppercase bold ' ('''P''') ' before the book title. Many of the historical accounts were authored by members and ex-members of the U.S. Navy who have not only offered primary accounts but have very often gone on to write about naval history in other general and specific capacities—these sources will be denoted with an  ' ('''N''') ' following the author's name.

Many of the sources are available for searching and viewing online. Copyrighted publications are often offered for partial viewing, while sources in the public domain can be viewed in their entirety and are denoted with '' 'E'book' ''. At this late date most of the publications are now available in PDF and/or EPUB formats.  A link to the publication is included at the end of a given title listing.

As the listings in the various sections are often lengthy, a link to the ''' 'Top' ''' of a given section is provided at the end of that section.

'''Butser Ancient Farm''' is an [[archaeological open-air museum]] located near [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]] in [[Hampshire]], southern [[England]]. Butser features experimental reconstructions of prehistoric, Romano-British and Anglo-Saxon buildings. Examples of Neolithic dwellings,  [[Iron Age]] [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]], a Romano-British villa and an early Saxon house are on display. The site is used as both a tourist attraction and a site for the undertaking of [[experimental archaeology]]. In this latter capacity, it was designed so that archaeologists could learn more about the agricultural and domestic economy in Britain during the millennium that lasted from circa 400 [[BCE]] to 400 CE, in what was the Late [[British Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] periods.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1999&gt;[[#Rey99|Reynolds 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1970 by the [[Council for British Archaeology]], in 1972 they recruited experimental archaeologist [[Peter J. Reynolds]] to run the site as project director. It was initially located on the site of a Bronze and Iron Age farmstead on [[Butser Hill]], but in 1989 relocated to Hillscombe Down, and in 1991 to Bascombe Copse on the slopes of [[Windmill Hill, Hampshire|Windmill Hill]].

The farm is open to the public and runs various events throughout the year. Archaeologist [[Mick Aston]] commented that "Virtually all the reconstruction drawings of Iron Age settlements now to be seen in books are based" on the work at Butser Farm, and that it "revolutionised the way in which the pre-Roman Iron Age economy was perceived".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ast01|Aston 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Butser Ancient Farm was founded in 1970 by the [[Council for British Archaeology]] and in 1972 they recruited [[experimental archaeology|experimental archaeologist]] [[Peter J. Reynolds]] (1939–2001) as director.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1979&gt;[[#Rey79|Reynolds 1979]]. pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The farm was named after its original site at Little Butser, a northerly spur of [[Butser Hill]], a few kilometres from [[Petersfield]] in Hampshire. In the original Bronze and Iron Ages, a farmstead had been found on Little Butser, whose occupants had farmed the valley to the north and east.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reynolds1979/&gt; 

In 1976 a second site, known as the Ancient Farm Demonstration Area (AFDA), was opened at [[Hillscombe Down]] on the southern slopes of Butser Hill, about a kilometre away from the main Farm. This was primarily designed to be a public site which could act as an educational resource for schoolchildren, and it was intended that this would take away the visitor pressure from the original site, where the large numbers of visitors (at times over a thousand people turned up to open days) were getting in the way of the experimental archaeology.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1999/&gt; The first Butser Farm site at Little Butser was subsequently closed down in 1989.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1999/&gt; 

In 1991 the project moved to Bascomb Copse on the slopes of [[Windmill Hill, Hampshire]] between [[Chalton, Hampshire]] and [[Clanfield, Hampshire]], about 5&amp;nbsp;km from the original site.

Buildings at the farm include simulated pre-Roman [[roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]]s and a simulated [[Roman villa]].  The 'Longbridge Deverell House' was the first full-sized roundhouse to be built at the latest site, and at the time one of the largest in Europe.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

After Peter's death in 2001, the site was run by his partner, Christine Shaw, for a number of years. Under her guidance, one of Peter's projects, a Roman building, was completed, resulting in the first full scale construction simulation of the wing of a Romano-British villa from Sparsholt, near Winchester. It was financed with the support of the [[Discovery Channel]], and was filmed for a ten-part series for television.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

In 2006/7, a management team was assembled, and with Christine's guidance, took over the running of the Butser Project. The management team consists of Simon Jay and Maureen Page, running the farm under the business "Butser Education CIC". {{fact|date=July 2012}}

It was also in 2006 that the 'Longbridge Deverell House' started to collapse, and prompted a programme of redevelopment of the constructions across the farm. A major re-assessment of the techniques of building was undertaken. It was decided to use the opportunity to examine the accumulated information of a further 20 years of excavation evidence.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

Following the dismantling of the 'Longbridge Deverell House', the replacement is based on the excavations of the 'Little Woodbury House'. Under the leadership of David Freeman, construction started in February 2007 and finished in December, having gone through one of the wettest summers on record.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

'''Cardiac psychology''' is a specialization of [[health psychology]] that focuses on the primary and secondary prevention of [[heart disease]] by incorporating strategies to address the [[emotional]] and [[behavioral]] barriers to [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes (e.g. [[smoking cessation]]), and that seeks to enhance recovery in cardiac patients by means of providing patients tools (e.g. stress management and psychotherapy) to cope with life and physical changes associated with their disease. Cardiac psychologists can help cardiac patients across the lifespan: prevention, pre-surgery, post-surgery, and [[rehabilitation medicine|rehabilitation]] of cardiac disease with a particular emphasis on achieving optimal [[quality of life]] outcomes.

Cardiac psychology also includes both [[research]] and [[clinical psychology|clinical practice]] aspects. Research labs have been founded at [[Tilburg University]], [[Tilburg]] Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/corps Tilburg University]&lt;/ref&gt; led by Dr. [[Susanne Pedersen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/webwijs/show/?uid=s.s.pedersen Susanne Pedersen]&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[East Carolina University]], [[Greenville, North Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;East Carolina University, [http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/psyc/cardiacpsychology ''Cardiac Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt; led by Dr. [[Samuel Sears]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/psyc/searss Samuel F. Sears, Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt; that focus on psychological aspects of cardiac disease. Cardiac psychology as a term was first used by Robert Allan, PhD, and Stephen Schiedt, MD, as a title of their 1996 book, ''Heart and Mind: The Practice of Cardiac Psychology'' and launched increased attention to the clinical practice of cardiac psychology. More recently, additional texts, such as ''Psychotherapy with Cardiac Patients'', (2008) by Ellen Dornelas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behavioralcardiology.com/id8.html Ellen Dornelas]&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to update the literature related to clinical techniques used in the care of cardiac patients.

The Co-Managed IT security service model entails security monitoring, event correlation, incident response, system tuning, and compliance support across an organization’s entire IT environment. Co-Management allows organizations to collaborate with their service providers by blending security expertise of the provider with the contextual knowledge of the customer to optimize security posture.

Co-Managed security services also allow for organizations’ critical data and tools to be remotely managed by a team of certified engineers and security analysts from a 24/7/365 [[Information_security_operations_center|Security Operations Center (SOC)]]. This service approach allows for customer data to remain in-house while the [[Security_information_and_event_management|SIEM]] platform is either on-site or cloud-hosted. The service provider’s staff works in conjunction with customer security teams to outline the rules of engagement inside the environment to provide monitoring and respond to alerts in real-time. The Security Operation Center also provide the “care and feeding”, and development of a variety of security solutions. The co-managed approach also allows organizations to focus on emerging internal projects and other critical areas of IT.

According to Gartner’s [https://www.gartner.com/doc/3112220/use-comanaged-siem How and When to Use Co-managed Security Information and Event Management report], “Co-managed SIEM services enable security and risk management leaders to maximize value from SIEM and enhance security monitoring capabilities, while retaining control and flexibility.” and "Co-management is on the rise and expected to grow five-fold by 2020."

''SIEM,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem&lt;/ref&gt; IDS/IPS, Compliance Automation, Network Configuration Management Tools, Advanced Threat Intelligence, Network Access Control, Endpoint Threat Detection and Response, Application Security, File Integrity Monitoring, Forensic Investigation, and Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment'', are all examples of cyber security solutions that co-managed service providers support&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eventtracker.com/campaigns/co-managed-siem/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[education]], '''computational thinking''' is a set of [[problem-solving]] methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that a [[computer]] could execute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Computational Thinking Benefits Society| journal = 40th Anniversary Blog of Social Issues in Computing |  year = 2014| last1 = Wing | first1 = Jeannette| url = http://socialissues.cs.toronto.edu/index.html%3Fp=279.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The history of computational thinking dates back at least to the 1950s but most ideas are much older.&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"&gt;{{Cite book | title =Proceedings  of the 16th Koli Calling Conference on Computing Education Research| chapter = The Long Quest for Computational Thinking| year = 2016| last1 = Tedre | first1 = Matti| last2 = Denning | first2 = Peter J.| url = http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/PUBS/long-quest-ct.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''computational thinking'' was first used by [[Seymour Papert]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Papert, Seymour. Mindstorms: Children, computers, and powerful ideas. Basic Books, Inc., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00191473| title = An exploration in the space of mathematics educations| journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning| volume = 1| year = 1996| last1 = Papert | first1 = Seymour| authorlink1 = Seymour Papert| url = http://www.papert.org/articles/AnExplorationintheSpaceofMathematicsEducations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational thinking can be used to [[algorithm]]ically solve complicated problems of scale, and is often used to realize large improvements in efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Computational thinking:

The phrase ''computational thinking'' was brought to the forefront of the [[computer science]] community as a result of an [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Communications essay on the subject by [[Jeannette Wing]]. The essay suggested that thinking computationally was a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists, and argued for the importance of integrating computational ideas into other disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1118178.1118215| title = Computational thinking| journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 49| issue = 3| pages = 33| year = 2006| url = https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf| last1 = Wing | first1 = Jeanette M. | authorlink = Jeannette Wing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

The characteristics that define computational thinking are [[decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]], [[pattern recognition]] / [[data representation]], [[generalization]]/[[abstraction]], and [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to computational thinking|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zp92mp3/|website=BBC Bitesize|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring Computational Thinking|url=https://www.google.com/edu/resources/programs/exploring-computational-thinking/|website=Google for Education|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By decomposing a problem, identifying the variables involved using data representation, and creating algorithms, a generic solution results. The generic solution is a generalization or abstraction that can be used to solve a multitude of variations of the initial problem.

[[File:The Computational Thinking Process.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The "three As" Computational Thinking Process describes computational thinking as a set of three steps: abstraction, automation, and analysis.]]

Another characterization of computational thinking is the "three As" iterative process based on three stages:
# '''Abstraction''': Problem formulation;
# '''Automation''': Solution expression;
# '''Analyses''': Solution execution and evaluation.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Connection to the "four Cs" ===

The [[four Cs of 21st century learning]] are communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity. The fifth C could be computational thinking which entails the capability to resolve problems algorithmically and logically. It includes tools that produce models and visualize data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.educationdive.com/news/should-the-4-cs-of-21st-century-skills-make-room-for-one-more/517878/|title=Should the 4 Cs of 21st century skills make room for one more?|work=Education Dive|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational thinking is applicable across subjects beyond science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) which include the social sciences and language arts. Students can engage in activities where they identify patterns in grammar as well as sentence structure and use models for studying relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://educationworld.in//EWIssue.aspx|title=http://educationworld.in//EWIssue.aspx|website=EducationWorld.in|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}} {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the 4 Cs have gradually gained acceptance as vital elements of many school syllabi. This development triggered a modification in platforms and directions such as inquiry, project-based, and more profound learning across all K-12 levels. Many countries have introduced computer thinking to all students. The United Kingdom has CT in its national curriculum since 2012. Singapore calls CT as “national capability”. Other nations like Australia, China, Korea, and New Zealand embarked on massive efforts to introduce computational thinking in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-02-25-the-5th-c-of-21st-century-skills-try-computational-thinking-not-coding|title=The 5th ‘C’ of 21st Century Skills? Try Computational Thinking (Not Coding) - EdSurge News|date=2018-02-25|work=EdSurge|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, President Barack Obama created this program, Computer Science for All to empower this generation of students in America with the proper computer science proficiency required to flourish in a digital economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csforall.org/|title=CSforALL|website=csforall.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computational thinking means thinking or solving problems like computer scientists. CT refers to thought processes required in understanding problems and formulating solutions. CT involves logic, assessment, patterns, automation, and generalization. Career readiness can be integrated into learning and teaching environments in multiple ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eschoolnews.com/2017/10/25/future-5th-c-career-readiness/|title=Future-forward: How to incorporate the 5th ‘C’ of 21st Century learning|date=2017-10-25|work=eSchool News|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In K-12 education ==

Jeannette Wing envisioned computational thinking becoming an essential part of every child's education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, since her article (published in 2006) integrating computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum has faced several challenges including the agreement on the definition of computational thinking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Valerie|last2=Stephenson|first2=Chris|year=2011|title=Bringing computational thinking to K-12: what is Involved and what is the role of the computer science education community?|journal=Acm Inroads|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grover|first=Shuchi|last2=Pea|first2=Roy|year=2013|title=Computational Thinking in K–12 A Review of the State of the Field|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=42|doi=10.3102/0013189x12463051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, computational thinking is broadly defined as a set of cognitive skills and problem solving processes that include (but are not limited to) the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Chris|date=May 2011|title=Defining Computational Thinking for K-12|journal=CSTA Voice|volume=7|issue=2|pages=3–4|issn=1555-2128|quote=CT is a problem solving process...|author2=Valerie Barr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Using abstractions and pattern recognition to represent the problem in new and different ways
* Logically organizing and analyzing data
* Breaking the problem down into smaller parts 
* Approaching the problem using programmatic thinking techniques such as iteration, symbolic representation, and logical operations
* Reformulating the problem into a series of ordered steps (algorithmic thinking)
* Identifying, analyzing, and implementing possible solutions with the goal of achieving the most efficient and effective combination of steps and resources
* Generalizing this problem-solving process to a wide variety of problems

Current integration computational thinking into the K-12 curriculum comes in two forms: in computer science classes directly or through the use and measure of computational thinking techniques in other subjects. Teachers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics ([[STEM fields|STEM]]) focused classrooms that include computational thinking, allow students to practice [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] skills such as [[trial and error]] (Barr, et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barr|first1=David|last2=Harrison|first2=John|last3=Leslie|first3=Conery|title=Computational Thinking: A Digital Age Skill for Everyone|journal=Learning &amp; Leading with Technology|date=2011-03-01|volume=38|issue=6|pages=20–23|issn=0278-9175}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerie Barr]] and Chris Stephenson describe computational thinking patterns across disciplines in a 2011 [http://inroads.acm.org ACM Inroads] article&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However [[Conrad Wolfram]] has argued that computational thinking should be taught as a distinct subject.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/computational-thinking-code-success Computational thinking is the code to success] Conrad Wolfram, The Times Educational Supplement&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for Computational Thinking ==

[[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has a Center for Computational Thinking. The Center's major activity is conducting PROBEs or '''PROB'''lem-oriented '''E'''xplorations. These PROBEs are experiments that apply novel computing concepts to problems to show the value of computational thinking. A PROBE experiment is generally a collaboration between a computer scientist and an expert in the field to be studied. The experiment typically runs for a year. In general, a PROBE will seek to find a solution for a broadly applicable problem and avoid narrowly focused issues. Some examples of PROBE experiments are optimal kidney transplant logistics and how to create drugs that do not breed drug-resistant viruses.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CompThink/probes.html PROBE Experiments]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computational thinking resources ==

There are a handful of on-line institutions which provide curriculum, and other related resources to build and strengthen pre-college students with computational thinking, analysis and problem-solving. One prominent one is the [http://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy]. It offers training sessions for both pre-college students, as well as teachers.

The resources include ready-made courses and materials for professionals, colleges, schools, and students. The services also include advising policymakers and governments on education reform and curriculum development.

== Criticism ==

The concept of computational thinking has been criticized as too vague, as it's rarely made clear how it is different from other forms of thought.&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.csteachers.org/resource/resmgr/JonesCTOnePager.pdf|title=The Trouble with Computational Thinking|date=|website=|publisher=ACM|last1=Jones|first1=Elizabeth|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some computer scientists worry about the promotion of computational thinking as a substitute for a broader computer science education, as computational thinking represents just one small part of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denning|first1=Peter J.|title=Beyond computational thinking|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 June 2009|volume=52|issue=6|pages=28|doi=10.1145/1516046.1516054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others worry that the emphasis on Computational Thinking encourages computer scientists to think too narrowly about the problems they can solve, thus avoiding the social, ethical and environmental implications of the technology they create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easterbrook|first1=Steve|title=From Computational Thinking to Systems Thinking: A conceptual toolkit for sustainability computing|journal=Proceedings of the 2nd international conference ICT for Sustainability|date=2014|doi=10.2991/ict4s-14.2014.28|url=http://www.atlantis-press.com/php/pub.php?publication=ict4s-14&amp;frame=http%3A//www.atlantis-press.com/php/paper-details.php%3Fid%3D13446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tedre2016"/&gt;

The '''Corning Museum of Glass''' is a [[museum]] in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]] dedicated to the art, history and science of [[glass]]. It was founded in 1951 by [[Corning Incorporated|Corning Glass Works]] and currently has a collection of more than 45,000 glass objects, some over 3,500 years old.&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us: Corning Museum of Glass|url=http://www.cmog.org/about#.UUNVGhycd8E|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1951 by Corning Glass Works (now [[Corning Incorporated]]) as a gift to the nation for the company’s 100th anniversary, the Corning Museum of Glass is a not-for-profit museum dedicated to telling the story of a single material: glass. [[Thomas S. Buechner]], who would later become director of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the founding director of the glass museum, serving in the post from 1951 to 1960 and again from 1973 to 1980.

=== Growth and renovations ===
[[File:CorningGlassTower.jpg|thumb|250px|Tower sculpture consisting of 600 glass bowls]]
The original Museum and library were housed in a low, glass-walled building designed by [[Harrison &amp; Abramovitz]] in 1951. By 1978, the Museum had outgrown its space.  [[Gunnar Birkerts]] designed a new addition, creating a flowing series of galleries with the library at their core, linked to the old building via light-filled, windowed ramps. With memories of the 1972 hurricane still fresh (see Flood Damage), the new galleries were raised high above the flood line on concrete pillars. The new Museum opened to the public on May 28, 1980, exactly 29 years after its first opening.

By the early 1990s, the Corning Museum of Glass was once more overflowing its exhibition space, and increasing visitation put a strain on guest facilities. In 1996, the Museum embarked upon the first phase of a planned five-year, $65 million transformation. Under the directorship of Dr. [[David Whitehouse]], the first element to be added was The Studio. This state-of-the-art teaching facility for glassblowing and coldworking opened for classes in 1996.

Architects Smith-Miller + Hawkinson designed an addition to the main Museum building, using glass wherever possible to convey the beauty and elegance of the art form in the building itself. The Museum's renovation was completed in 2001, and included a new visitors' center, Sculpture Gallery, (now the Contemporary Glass Gallery), Hot Glass Show demonstration stage and a hands-on Innovation Center with exhibitions designed by [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]]. A redesigned 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) GlassMarket, one of the largest Museum shops in the country, filled the entire first floor of the museum. The Rakow Library was relocated to new quarters across the Museum campus.

Over the past decade, the Museum’s collection, programs, and global impact have grown significantly. At the beginning of 2012, the Museum announced a $64 million expansion project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/52558/corning-museum-of-glass-thomas-phifer-and-partners-expansion/ |title=Largest Contemporary Glass Museum to Open in Upstate NY |publisher=Hyperallergic.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[Thomas Phifer]], to expand contemporary gallery and Hot Glass Show space. The new contemporary wing is slated to open in March 2015.&lt;ref name=june2012pr&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterbenk|first=Yvette|title=Corning Museum of Glass Unveils Plans for $64 Million Expansion|url=https://news.yahoo.com/corning-museum-glass-unveils-plans-64-million-expansion-110345959.html|work=June 6, 2012|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2015/01/25/cmog-contemporary-glass/22313897/ |title=Corning glass museum acquires new contemporary pieces |publisher=Stargazette.com |date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Cornings-glass-museum-acquires-contemporary-works-for-new-wing/36817 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flood damage ===
In June 1972, disaster struck as [[Hurricane Agnes]] emptied a week's worth of rain into the surrounding Chemung River Valley. On June 23, the Chemung River overflowed its banks and poured five feet four inches of floodwater into the Museum. When the waters receded, staff members found glass objects tumbled in their cases and crusted with mud, the library's books swollen with water. The case holding 600 rare books tipped over, and the books were covered by mud and shards of glass panes. Half of the entire Library collection was damaged in the flood. According to Martin and Edwards, 528 of the Museum's 13,000 objects had sustained damage (1977, 11)&lt;ref name="flood"/&gt; At the time, Buechner described the flood as "possibly the greatest single catastrophe borne by an American museum."&lt;ref name="flood"/&gt;  Conservation was an immediate concern and staff moved quickly to freeze the flooded materials. Museum staff members, under the directorship of  [[Robert H. Brill]] were faced with the tremendous task of restoration: every glass object had to be meticulously cleaned and restored, while the library's contents had to be cleaned and dried page by page, slide by slide, even before being assessed for rebinding, restoration, or replacement.&lt;ref name=flood&gt;{{cite book|title=The Corning Flood: Museum Under Water|year=1977|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|location=Corning, New York|isbn=087290-063-0|page=60|url=http://www.cmog.org/sites/default/files/collections/FF/FFAE9039-62D0-4450-A0ED-ACE0BD397297.pdf|editor=Martin, John H.|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the extensive recovery efforts, the Library occupied an abandoned Acme grocery store across the street from the Museum. Altogether, staff and volunteers dried, cleaned, and restored over 7,000 water-logged, frozen books over the next 2 years. The rare books were sent to Carolyn Horton, a leading restoration expert, who disassembled, washed, deacidified and rebound them. On August 1, 1972, the Museum reopened with restoration work still underway.

== The Glass Collection ==
=== Galleries ===
The Museum's Glass Collection showcases more than 35 centuries of glass artistry. The Museum's collection of contemporary artworks includes pieces by significant artists such as [[Klaus Moje]], [[Karen LaMonte]], [[Bruno Pedrosa]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Libenský / Brychtová]] and [[Josiah McElheny]]. The Glass Collection Galleries show the most comprehensive and celebrated glass collection in the world. The galleries explore Near Eastern, Asian, European, and American glass and glassmaking from antiquity through present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Lawrence|first=Lee|date=August 9, 2011|title=Art, technology, design, crisscrossing the globe [exhibition review]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303544604576429774286392838 | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tell the story of glass creation, from a full-scale model of an Egyptian furnace, to the grand factories of Europe, to the small-scale furnaces that fueled the Studio Glass movement that began in America in 1962. The galleries contain objects representing every country and historical period in which glassmaking has been practiced. The galleries include: Glass in Nature, Origins of Glassmaking, Glass of the Romans, Glass in the Islamic World, Early Northern European Glass, The Rise of Venetian Glassmaking, Glass in 17th-19th Century Europe, 19th Century European Glass, Asian Glass, Glass in America, Corning: From Farm Town to “Crystal City,” Paperweights of the World and Modern Glass.

In addition to these galleries, there is the Jerome and Lucille Strauss Study Gallery, Frederick Carder Gallery and Ben W. Heineman Sr. Gallery of Contemporary Glass. The Study Gallery is filled with a wide range of objects from all periods. The gallery is named after Museum benefactors Jerome and Lucille Strauss, who, by gift and bequest, provided the Museum with an unparalleled collection of 2,400 drinking glasses dating from ancient to modern times. The Frederick Carder Gallery features an extensive collection of glass designed by [[Frederick Carder]] (1863–1963), a gifted English designer who managed Steuben Glass Works from its founding in 1903 until 1932. During this time, the production of Steuben changed from various types of colored glass to colorless glass.

The Museum’s gallery of contemporary glass focuses on vessels, objects, sculptures, and installations made by international artists over the last 25 years. The purpose of the gallery is to show the different ways in which glass is used as a medium for contemporary art. The gallery is named for the Ben W. Heineman Sr. family, who donated a major collection of contemporary glass to the Museum in 2005.

=== Exhibitions ===
The Corning Museum of Glass offers exhibitions year-round. Past exhibitions have included: [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/medieval-glass#.UUMv4xycd8E Medieval Glass for Popes, Princes and Peasants], [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/east-meets-west-cross-cultural-influences-glassmaking-18th-and-19th-centuries#.UUMwDhycd8E East Meets West: Cross-Cultural Influences in Glassmaking in the 18th and 19th Centuries] and [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/mirror-to-discovery#.UUMwQhycd8E Mirror to Discovery: The 200-Inch Disk and the Hale Reflecting Telescope at Palomar].

Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hot Glass Show is offered all day, every day and is included in the cost of admission. At each demonstration, the glassmaker takes a glob of molten glass and shapes the globs into vases, bowls, or sculptures. Throughout the demonstration, a narrator describes the process, and cameras give viewers a close-up look into the furnaces where the glass is heated. The show gives viewers a look into an ancient Roman technique that is still used today for glass making. Each show lasts between 20–40 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Details glass blowing in Corning, N.Y. November 18, 2001. Washington Post. Accessed on LexisNexis. http://www.lexisnexis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hot Glass Roadshow =====
The Museum takes the Hot Glass Show on the road, bringing the unique demonstration to the public, designers, and other museums. The Museum uses unique equipment in order to recreate the state-of-the-art studio environment. The Hot Glass Roadshow travels internationally.&lt;ref&gt;“High Museum of Art Presents the Hot Glass Roadshow.” (2012, Aug. 28). High Museum of Art: Press Release. &lt; http://www.high.org/Press/Press-Releases/2012/August/Hot-Glass-Roadshow.aspx&gt;. Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== At sea =====
The demonstration is also presented on Celebrity cruise ships, such as Celebrity Solstice, Celebrity Equinox, and Celebrity Eclipse. Each cruise ship has a hotshop on the top deck where the Museum’s glassmakers present their live glassmaking demonstrations. The demos reach more than 300,000 people each year, and the ships visit ports around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrity eclipse launch: these pros are a glass act. Washington Post. April 30, 2010. Travel Trade Gazette UK &amp; Ireland http://business.highbeam.com/409990/article-1G1-225419675/celebrity-eclipse-launch-these-pros-glass-act&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flameworking Demonstration ====
The demo is a live, 15-minute narrated demonstration of glassworking at a 5,000 degree Fahrenheit gas- and oxygen-powered torch. The show is also included in the cost of admission, and is offered throughout the day in the Museum’s Glass Innovation Center. During the show, the glassmaker melts rods and tubes of glass to shape them into a variety of shapes from animals, beads, ornaments, sculptures and vessels. The [[flameworking]] technique is an ancient glass making technique, which is demonstrated at the Museum.

==== Optical Fiber Demo ====
The Optical Fiber Demo explains how thin threads of glass can carry enormous amounts of digital information and power our high-speed information age. The demo lasts about 15 minutes, is offered every day, and is included in the cost of admission. The demonstration takes place in the museum’s Glass Innovation Center. Demonstrators show how light can be used for communication, how glass can accurately carry light signals, what glass composition will carry light signals most clearly, and how optical fiber provides us with the massive amounts of bandwidth necessary for today’s world. The presentation begins with a discussion of how man has been using light to communicate for centuries. It continues with a demonstration of total internal reflection – the basic principle behind optical fiber. In the mid-1800s, Daniel Colladon, a Swiss scientist, explained how total internal reflection allowed light to be directed along a very specific path with lively visible demonstrations that showed light following the path of a stream of falling water. Total internal reflection traps the light in the stream, and traps it the same way in a glass fiber.

==== Glassbreaking Demo ====
The demonstration is a 15-minute demo that explores how glass breaks and why. Demonstrators show how glass can become stronger or weaker depending on how it is heated or cooled; demonstrators explain how this phenomenon affects the way it breaks. The demonstration takes place in the Windows Gallery of the Museum’s Innovation Center and the demo is included in the cost of admission.

{{cosmology}}
A '''cyclic model''' (or '''oscillating model''') is any of several [[cosmological model]]s in which the [[universe]] follows infinite, or indefinite, self-sustaining cycles. For example, the oscillating universe theory briefly considered by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1930 theorized a universe following an [[eternity|eternal]] series of oscillations, each beginning with a [[big bang]] and ending with a [[big crunch]]; in the interim, the universe would [[metric expansion of space|expand]] for a period of time before the gravitational attraction of matter causes it to collapse back in and undergo a [[Big Bounce|bounce]].

==Overview==
In the 1920s, theoretical physicists, most notably [[Albert Einstein]], considered the possibility of a cyclic model for the universe as an (everlasting) alternative to the model of an [[metric expansion of space|expanding universe]]. However, work by [[Richard C. Tolman]] in 1934 showed that these early attempts failed because of the cyclic problem: according to the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]], entropy can only increase.&lt;ref name="Tolman 1934"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that successive cycles grow longer and larger. Extrapolating back in time, cycles before the present one become shorter and smaller culminating again in a Big Bang and thus not replacing it. This puzzling situation remained for many decades until the early 21st century when the recently discovered [[dark energy]] component provided new hope for a consistent cyclic cosmology.&lt;ref name="Frampton 2006"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a five-year survey of 200,000 galaxies and spanning 7 billion years of cosmic time confirmed that "dark energy is driving our universe apart at accelerating speeds."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110519113152.htm Dark Energy Is Driving Universe Apart: NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer Finds Dark Energy Repulsive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0911/0911.5347v4.pdf The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey: Direct constraints on blue galaxy intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts]&lt;/ref&gt;

One new cyclic model is  [[brane cosmology]] model of the [[Big Bang|creation of the universe]], derived from the earlier [[ekpyrotic]] model. It was proposed in 2001 by [[Paul Steinhardt]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[Neil Turok]] of [[Cambridge University]]. The theory describes a universe exploding into existence not just once, but repeatedly over time.&lt;ref name="Steinhardt, Turok 2001a"&gt;

A different cyclic model relying on the notion of [[phantom energy]] was proposed in 2007 by Lauris Baum and [[Paul Frampton]] of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref name="Baum, Frampton 2007"&gt;

|bibcode = 2008MPLA...23...33B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cyclic models include [[Conformal cyclic cosmology]] and [[Loop quantum cosmology]].

==The Steinhardt&amp;ndash;Turok model==
In this cyclic model, two parallel [[orbifold]] planes or [[Membrane (M-Theory)|M-branes]] collide periodically in a higher-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Paul J. Steinhardt, Neil Turok 2004"&gt;
{{cite journal

 |arxiv=astro-ph/0404480
|bibcode = 2005NewAR..49...43S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The visible four-dimensional universe lies on one of these [[branes]]. The collisions correspond to a reversal from contraction to expansion, or a [[big crunch]] followed immediately by a [[big bang]]. The matter and radiation we see today were generated during the most recent collision in a pattern dictated by [[quantum fluctuation]]s created before the branes. After billions of years the universe reached the state we observe today; after additional billions of years it will ultimately begin to contract again. [[Dark energy]] corresponds to a force between the branes, and serves the crucial role of solving the [[monopole problem|monopole]], [[horizon problem|horizon]], and [[flatness problem|flatness]] problems. Moreover, the cycles can continue indefinitely into the past and the future, and the solution is an [[attractor]], so it can provide a complete history of the universe.

As [[Richard C. Tolman]] showed, the earlier cyclic model failed because the universe would undergo inevitable [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[heat death of the universe|heat death]].&lt;ref name="Tolman 1934" /&gt; However, the newer cyclic model evades this by having a net expansion each cycle, preventing [[entropy]] from building up. However, there remain major open issues in the model. Foremost among them is that colliding [[Membrane (M-Theory)|branes]] are not understood by string theorists, and nobody knows if the [[scale invariance|scale invariant]] spectrum will be destroyed by the big crunch. Moreover, as with [[cosmic inflation]], while the general character of the forces (in the [[ekpyrotic]] scenario, a force between branes) required to create the [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s is known, there is no candidate from [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Baum–Frampton model==
This more recent cyclic model of 2007 makes a different technical assumption concerning the equation of state of the dark energy which relates pressure and density through a parameter '''w'''.&lt;ref name="Baum, Frampton 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baum, Frampton 2006"&gt;

|bibcode=2007PhRvL..98g1301B
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes '''w''' &lt; −1 (a condition called [[phantom energy]]) throughout a cycle, including at present. (By contrast, Steinhardt–Turok assume '''w''' is never less than −1.) In the Baum–Frampton model, a septillionth (or less) &lt;!-- Use 10&lt;sup&gt;−X&lt;/sup&gt; notation please--&gt; of a second (i.e. 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or less) before the would-be [[Big Rip]], a turnaround occurs and only one causal patch is retained as our universe. The generic patch contains no [[quark]], [[lepton]] or [[force carrier]]; only [[dark energy]] – and its entropy thereby vanishes. The [[adiabatic process]] of contraction of this much smaller universe takes place with constant vanishing entropy and with no matter including no [[black holes]] which disintegrated before turnaround.

The idea that the universe "comes back empty" is a central new idea of this cyclic model, and avoids many difficulties confronting matter in a contracting phase such as excessive [[structure formation]], proliferation and expansion of [[black holes]], as well as going through [[phase transition]]s such as those of QCD and electroweak symmetry restoration. Any of these would tend strongly to produce an unwanted premature bounce, simply to avoid violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The surprising '''w''' &lt; −1 condition may be logically inevitable in a truly infinitely cyclic cosmology because of the entropy problem. Nevertheless, many technical back up calculations are necessary to confirm consistency of the approach. Although the model borrows ideas from [[string theory]], it is not necessarily committed to strings, or to [[higher dimensions]], yet such speculative devices may provide the most expeditious methods to investigate the [[internal consistency]]. The value of '''w''' in the Baum–Frampton model can be made arbitrarily close to, but must be less than, −1.

== Other cyclic models ==
* [[Conformal cyclic cosmology]]—a general relativity based theory due to [[Roger Penrose]] in which the universe expands until all the matter decays and is turned to light—so there is nothing in the universe that has any time or distance scale associated with it. This permits it to become identical with the Big Bang, so starting the next cycle.
* [[Loop quantum cosmology]] which predicts a "quantum bridge" between contracting and expanding cosmological branches.

== Resurrection plants ==
Many resurrection plants use constitutive and inducible mechanisms to deal with drought and then later desiccation stress.&lt;ref name="Gechev" /&gt; Protective proteins such as cyclophilins, dehydrins, and [[late embryogenesis abundant proteins|LEA proteins]] are maintained at levels within a desiccation resistant species typically only seen during drought stress for desiccation sensitive species, providing a greater protective buffer as inducible mechanisms are activated.&lt;ref name="Hoekstra" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gechev" /&gt; Some species also continuously produce [[anthocyanin]]s and other polyphenols.&lt;ref name="Gechev" /&gt; An increase in the hormone ABA is typically associated with activation of inducible metabolic pathways.&lt;ref name="Gechev" /&gt; Production of sugars (predominantly [[sucrose]]), aldehyde dehydrogenases, heat shock factors, and other LEA proteins are upregulated after activation to further stabilize cellular structures and function.&lt;ref name="Hoekstra" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gechev" /&gt; Composition of the cell wall structure is altered to increase flexibility so folding can take place without irreparably damaging the structure of the cell wall.&lt;ref name="Gechev" /&gt; Sugars are utilized as water substitutes by maintaining hydrogen bonds within the cell membrane.&lt;ref name="Proctor"/&gt; Photosynthesis is shut down to limit production of reactive oxygen species and then eventually all metabolic are drastically reduced, the cell effectively becoming dormant until rehydration.&lt;ref name="Gechev" /&gt;

In [[astrophysics]], '''dark flow''' is a possible non-random component of the [[peculiar velocity]] of [[galaxy cluster]]s. The actual measured velocity is the sum of the velocity predicted by [[Hubble's Law]] plus a possible small and unexplained (or ''dark'') velocity flowing in a common direction.

According to standard [[cosmological model]]s, the motion of galaxy clusters with respect to the [[cosmic microwave background]] should be randomly distributed in all directions. However, analyzing the three-year [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) data using the kinematic [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]], astronomers [[Alexander Kashlinsky]], F. Atrio-Barandela, D. Kocevski and H. Ebeling found evidence of a "surprisingly coherent" 600–1000&amp;nbsp;km/s&lt;ref name="10.1086/592947" /&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1088/0004-637X/691/2/1479" /&gt; flow of clusters toward a 20-degree patch of sky between the constellations of [[Centaurus]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]].

The researchers had suggested that the motion may be a remnant of the influence of no-longer-visible regions of the universe prior to [[inflationary cosmology|inflation]]. Telescopes cannot see events earlier than about 380,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], when the universe became transparent (the [[cosmic microwave background]]); this corresponds to the [[particle horizon]] at a distance of about 46 billion (4.6×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) [[light year]]s. Since the matter causing the net motion in this proposal is outside this range, it would in a certain sense be outside our [[visible universe]]; however, it would still be in our past [[light cone]].

The results appeared in the October 20, 2008, issue of [[Astrophysical Journal Letters]].&lt;ref name="10.1086/592947"&gt;{{cite journal

In 2013, data from the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck space telescope]] showed no evidence of "dark flow" on that sort of scale, discounting the claims of evidence for either gravitational effects reaching beyond the visible universe or existence of a multiverse.&lt;ref name="newsci-dn23340" /&gt; However, in 2015  Kashlinsky ''et al'' claim to have found support for its existence using both Planck and WMAP data.&lt;ref name="10.1088/0004-637X/810/2/143"&gt;{{cite journal

The dark flow was determined to be flowing in the direction of the [[Centaurus]] and [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] constellations.&lt;ref name="Kash2010"&gt;NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (2010, March 11). Mysterious cosmic 'dark flow' tracked deeper into universe. ScienceDaily. Retrieved 2010-09-28, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100310162829.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=August 2013}} This corresponds with the direction of the [[Great Attractor]], which is a gravitational mystery originally discovered in 1973. However, the source of the Great Attractor's attraction was thought to originate from a massive cluster of galaxies called the [[Norma Cluster]], located about 250 million light-years away from Earth.

In a study from March 2010, Kashlinsky extended his work from 2008, by using the 5-year WMAP results rather than the 3-year results, and doubling the number of galaxy clusters observed from 700. The team also sorted the cluster catalog into four "slices" representing different distance ranges. They then examined the preferred flow direction for the clusters within each slice. While the size and exact position of this direction display some variation, the overall trends among the slices exhibit remarkable agreement.&lt;ref name="Kash2010" /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=August 2013}}  "We detect motion along this axis, but right now our data cannot state as strongly as we'd like whether the clusters are coming or going," Kashlinsky said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mysterious Cosmic 'Dark Flow' Tracked Deeper into Universe |author1=Reddy, Francis  |author2=Chandler, Lynn |publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/releases/2010/10-023.html |date=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team has so far catalogued the effect as far out as 2.5 billion light-years, and hopes to expand its catalog out further still to twice the current distance.

== Criticisms ==

Astrophysicist [[Edward L. Wright|Ned Wright]] posted an online response to the study arguing that its methods are flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/dark-flow-errors.html |title=Archived item in Ned Wright's News of the Universe |publisher=Astro.ucla.edu |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the "dark flow" study released a statement in return, refuting three of Wright's five arguments and identifying the remaining two as a typo and a technicality that do not affect the measurements and their interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kashlinsky.info/bulkflows/Wright_is_wrong |title=Refutation of Wright's remarks |publisher=Kashlinsky.info |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2012-11-11 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent statistical work done by Ryan Keisler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=0910.4233|title=The Statistical Significance of the "Dark Flow" |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=707 |pages=L42–L44 |date=2009-10-22 |last1=Keisler |first1=Ryan |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/707/1/L42 |bibcode = 2009ApJ...707L..42K }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims to rule out the possibility that the dark flow is a physical phenomenon because Kashlinsky et al. did not consider the primary [[anisotropies]] of the [[CMB|cosmic microwave background (CMB)]] to be as important as they are.

NASA's Goddard Space Center considered that this could be the effect of a sibling universe or a region of space-time fundamentally different from the observable universe. Data on more than 1,000 galaxy clusters have been measured, including some as distant as 3 billion light-years. Alexander Kashlinsky claims these measurements show the universe's steady flow is clearly not a statistical fluke. Kashlinsky said: "At this point we don't have enough information to see what it is, or to constrain it. We can only say with certainty that somewhere very far away the world is very different than what we see locally. Whether it's 'another universe' or a different fabric of space-time we don't know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.discovery.com/space/dark-flow-universe.html | title=Mysterious 'Dark Flow' May Be Tug Of Other Universe |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Mersini-Houghton]] and Rich Holman observe that some anisotropy is predicted both by theories involving interaction with another universe, or when the frame of reference of the CMB does not coincide with that of the universe's expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5966|title=A Tale of Two Oxford Talks – Not Even Wrong|work=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, data from the European Space Agency's [[Planck satellite]] was claimed to show no statistically significant evidence of existence of dark flow.&lt;ref name="newsci-dn23340"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23340-blow-for-dark-flow-in-plancks-new-view-of-the-cosmos.html|title=Blow for 'dark flow' in Planck's new view of the cosmos|date=3 April 2013|author=Maggie McKee|journal=[[New Scientist]]|issue=2911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1303.5090"&gt;{{arxiv|1303.5090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, another analysis by a member of the Planck collaboration, Fernando Atrio-Barandela, suggested the data were consistent with the earlier findings from WMAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{arxiv|1303.6614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular media continued to be interested in the idea, with Mersini-Houghton claiming the Planck results support existence of a multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5907|title=Hard Evidence for the Multiverse Found, but String Theory Limits the Space Brain Threat|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=22 May 2013|author=Peter Woit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2326869/Is-universe-merely-billions-Evidence-existence-multiverse-revealed-time-cosmic-map.html|title=Is our universe merely one of billions?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1771">In [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], a '''descent direction''' is a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\in\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; that, in the sense below, moves us closer towards a local minimum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^*&lt;/math&gt; of our objective function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose we are computing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^*&lt;/math&gt; by an iterative method, such as [[line search]]. We define a descent direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k\in\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; at the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th iterate to be any &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{p}_k,\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)\rangle &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \langle , \rangle &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[inner product]]. The motivation for such an approach is that small steps along &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k&lt;/math&gt; guarantee that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f&lt;/math&gt; is reduced, by [[Taylor's theorem]].

Using this definition, the negative of a non-zero gradient is always a
descent direction, as &lt;math&gt; \langle -\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k), \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) \rangle = -\langle \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k), \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k) \rangle &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

Numerous methods exist to compute descent directions, all with differing merits. For example, one could use [[gradient descent]] or the [[conjugate gradient method]].

More generally, if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[positive definite]] matrix, then
&lt;math&gt;d = -P \nabla f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is a descent direction
&lt;ref name="?"&gt;{{cite book | author =  J. M. Ortega and W. C. Rheinbold | title = Iterative Solution of Nonlinear Equations in Several Variables | pages = 243 | year = 1970 | doi = 10.1137/1.9780898719468
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
This generality is used in [[preconditioned]] gradient descent methods.

'''''Dictionary of Women Artists''''' is a two-volume dictionary of 600 women artists born before 1945, going back to the Middle Ages. It was edited by Delia Gaze with 23 advisors and over 100 contributors. Gaze is a writer for the [[Oxford DNB]] and wrote several biographies that were released in the 2004 edition of the ODNB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/search?q=delia+gaze Delia Gaze] in the ODNB&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is widely cited as a reference for Western women artists and has a disclaimer that it is biased towards Western artists because of the constraints imposed on the selection. The book includes a list of artists in alphabetical order and chronological order and a bibliography of sources. Preceding the biographies is a series of "introductory surveys", a product of a somewhat dated notion in gender studies that women can be grouped into categories. There are many women artists mentioned in the surveys whose biography was not included, because there was not enough documented material to fulfill the inclusion criteria. The work was meant as a follow-up to a previous reference work including 21,000 women painters, sculptors, printmakers, and illustrators by Chris Petteys, the ''Dictionary of Women Artists: An International Dictionary of Women Artists Born Before 1900'', published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27948939 Reviewed Work: ''DICTIONARY OF WOMEN ARTISTS'' 2 vol. by Delia Gaze], Review by: Sheila Klos in ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (Spring 1998), pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with that work is that the more well-documented women were included with countless "one-liners".

In 2001 Gaze produced a new "Concise" edition with a smaller selection in a single volume.

The '''Doctor of Architecture''' (D Arch) degree program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/school-view/?record_id=20569&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture/accredited-programs&lt;/ref&gt; The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/info/mission/&lt;/ref&gt;, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional  graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.

Currently, the only University in the United States offering a Doctor of Architecture degree is the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]. The Doctorate of Architecture was first accredited by NAAB in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the University of Hawaii program is open to students who have completed high school, transfer students who have completed some college-level work, and students who have completed Baccalaureate or advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the degree requires 120 undergraduate credits and 90 graduate credits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the onshore oil rig|offshore oil rig|Oil platform}}
A '''drilling rig''' is a machine that [[Drilling|creates holes]] in the earth's subsurface. Drilling rigs can be massive structures housing equipment used to drill water wells, oil wells, or natural gas extraction wells, or they can be small enough to be moved manually by one person and such are called [[auger (drill)|auger]]s. Drilling rigs can sample subsurface mineral deposits, test rock, soil and groundwater physical properties, and also can be used to install sub-surface fabrications, such as underground utilities, instrumentation, tunnels or wells. Drilling rigs can be mobile equipment mounted on trucks, tracks or trailers, or more permanent land or marine-based structures (such as [[oil platform]]s, commonly called 'offshore oil rigs' even if they don't contain a drilling rig). The term "rig" therefore generally refers to the complex equipment that is used to penetrate the surface of the Earth's [[continental crust|crust]].

Small to medium-sized drilling rigs are mobile, such as those used in mineral exploration drilling, blast-hole, water wells and environmental investigations. Larger rigs are capable of drilling through thousands of metres of the [[Earth]]'s crust, using large "[[mud pump]]s" to circulate [[drilling mud]] (slurry) through the [[drill bit]] and up the casing [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]], for cooling and removing the "cuttings" while a well is drilled. Hoists in the rig can lift hundreds of [[ton]]s of [[drill pipe|pipe]]. Other equipment can force [[acid]] or sand into reservoirs to facilitate extraction of the oil or natural gas; and in remote locations there can be permanent living accommodation and catering for crews (which may be more than a hundred). Marine rigs may operate thousands of miles distant from the supply base with infrequent crew rotation or cycle.

==History==
[[File:Lingle Oil Rig.jpg|thumb|Antique drilling rig now on display at Western History Museum in Lingle, Wyoming. It was used to drill many water wells in that area—many of those wells are still in use.]]
[[Image:ZigongSaltwells.jpg|thumb|left|Antique drilling rigs in Zigong, China]]

Until [[internal combustion engine]]s were developed in the late 19th century, the main method for drilling rock was muscle power of man or animal. The technique of oil drilling through [[percussion drilling|percussion]] or [[rotary drilling]] has its origins dating back to the ancient Chinese Han Dynasty in 500 BC, where percussion drilling was used to extract natural gas in the Sichuan province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oil - A Beginner's Guide |last= Smil  |first=Vaclav |publisher=Oneworld Publications |year=2017 |isbn=978-1786072863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early oil and gas drilling methods were seemingly primitive as it required several technical skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oil - A Beginner's Guide |last= Smil  |first=Vaclav |publisher=Oneworld Publications |year=2017 |isbn=978-1786072863}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Investing in Oil and Gas: The ABC's of DPPs |last=Heshelow  |first=Kathy  |publisher=Iuniverse |year=2010 |isbn=978-1450261715 |pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills involved the availability of heavy iron bits and long bamboo poles, the manufacturing of long and sturdy cables woven from bamboo fiber, and levers. Heavy iron bits were attached to long bamboo cables suspended from bamboo derricks and then were repeatedly raised and dropped into a manually dug hole by having two to six men jumping on a lever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oil - A Beginner's Guide |last= Smil  |first=Vaclav |publisher=Oneworld Publications |year=2017 |isbn=978-1786072863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Han dynasty oil wells made by percussion drilling was effective but only reached 10 meters deep and 100 meters by the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oil - A Beginner's Guide |last= Smil  |first=Vaclav |publisher=Oneworld Publications |year=2017 |isbn=978-1786072863}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, the Chinese were exploring and drilling oil wells more than 2000 feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Investing in Oil and Gas: The ABC's of DPPs |last=Heshelow  |first=Kathy  |publisher=Iuniverse |year=2010 |isbn=978-1450261715 |pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modernized variant of the ancient Chinese drilling technique was used by American businessman [[Edwin Drake]] to drill Pennsylvania's first oil well in 1859 using small steam engines to power the drilling process rather than by human muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oil - A Beginner's Guide |last= Smil  |first=Vaclav |publisher=Oneworld Publications |year=2017 |isbn=978-1786072863}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, outside of the oil and gas industry, roller bits using mud circulation were replaced by the first pneumatic reciprocating piston Reverse Circulation (RC) drills, and became essentially obsolete for most shallow drilling, and are now only used in certain situations where rocks preclude other methods. RC drilling proved much faster and more efficient, and continues to improve with better metallurgy, deriving harder, more durable bits, and compressors delivering higher air pressures at higher volumes, enabling deeper and faster penetration. Diamond drilling has remained essentially unchanged since its inception.

==Petroleum drilling industry==
[[Petroleum|Oil]] and [[natural gas]] drilling rigs are used not only to identify geologic reservoirs but also to create holes that allow the extraction of oil or natural gas from those reservoirs. Primarily in onshore oil and gas fields once a well has been drilled, the drilling rig will be moved off of the well and a service rig (a smaller rig) that is purpose-built for completions will be moved on to the well to get the well on line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baars|first=D.L.|title=Petroleum; a primer for Kansas|year=1989|publisher=Kansas Geological Survey|page=40|url=http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Oil/primer12.html|edition=Educational Series, no. 7|author2=Watney, W.L. |author3=Steeples, D.W. |author4= Brostuen, E.A |accessdate=18 April 2011|quote=After the cementing of the casing has been completed, the drilling rig, equipment, and materials are removed from the drill site. A smaller rig, known as a workover rig or completion rig, is moved over the well bore. The smaller rig is used for the remaining completion operations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This frees up the drilling rig to drill another hole and streamlines the operation as well as allowing for specialization of certain services, i.e. completions vs. drilling.

==Mining drilling industry==
[[Mining]] drilling rigs are used for two main purposes, exploration drilling which aims to identify the location and quality of a mineral, and production drilling, used in the production-cycle for mining. Drilling rigs used for [[rock blasting]] for surface mines vary in size dependent on the size of the hole desired, and is typically classified into smaller pre-split and larger production holes. [[Underground mining (hard rock)]] uses a variety of drill rigs dependent on the desired purpose, such as production, bolting, cabling, and tunnelling.

==Mobile drilling rigs==
[[File:Mercedes Benz Atego - Bohranlage (1).jpg|thumbnail|Mobile drilling rig mounted on a truck]]
In early oil exploration, drilling rigs were semi-permanent in nature and the derricks were often built on site and left in place after the completion of the well. In more recent times drilling rigs are expensive custom-built machines that can be moved from well to well. Some light duty drilling rigs are like a mobile crane and are more usually used to drill water wells. Larger land rigs must be broken apart into sections and loads to move to a new place, a process which can often take weeks.

Small mobile drilling rigs are also used to drill or bore [[Deep foundation|piles]]. Rigs can range from 100 [[ton]] [[continuous flight auger]] (CFA) rigs to small air powered rigs used to drill holes in quarries, etc. These rigs use the same technology and equipment as the oil drilling rigs, just on a smaller scale.

The drilling mechanisms outlined below differ mechanically in terms of the machinery used, but also in terms of the method by which drill cuttings are removed from the cutting face of the drill and returned to surface.

==Drilling rig classification==
There are many types and designs of drilling rigs, with many drilling rigs capable of switching or combining different drilling technologies as needed. Drilling rigs can be described using any of the following attributes:

===By power used===
* Mechanical&amp;nbsp;— the rig uses torque converters, clutches, and transmissions powered by its own engines, often diesel
* Electric&amp;nbsp;— the major items of machinery are driven by electric motors, usually with power generated on-site using internal combustion engines
* Hydraulic&amp;nbsp;— the rig primarily uses hydraulic power
* Pneumatic&amp;nbsp;— the rig is primarily powered by pressurized air
* Steam&amp;nbsp;— the rig uses steam-powered engines and pumps (obsolete after middle of 20th Century.)

===By pipe used===
* Cable&amp;nbsp;— a cable is used to raise and drop the drill bit
* Conventional&amp;nbsp;— uses metal or plastic drill pipe of varying types
* [[Coil tubing]]&amp;nbsp;— uses a giant coil of tube and a downhole drilling motor

===By height===
''(Rigs are differentiated by height based on how many connected pipe they are able to "stand" in the derrick when needing to temporarily remove the drill pipe from the hole. Typically this is done when changing a drill bit or when "logging" the well.)''

* Single&amp;nbsp;— can pull only single drill pipes. The presence or absence of vertical pipe racking "fingers" varies from rig to rig.
* Double&amp;nbsp;— can hold a stand of pipe in the derrick consisting of two connected drill pipes, called a "double stand".
* Triple&amp;nbsp;— can hold a stand of pipe in the derrick consisting of three connected drill pipes, called a "triple stand".
* Quadri&amp;nbsp;— can store stand of pipe in the derrick composed of four connected drill pipes, called a "quadri stand".

===By method of rotation or drilling method===
* No-rotation includes direct push rigs and most service rigs
* [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|Rotary table]]&amp;nbsp;— rotation is achieved by turning a square or hexagonal pipe (the "Kelly") at drill floor level.
* [[Top drive]]&amp;nbsp;— rotation and circulation is done at the top of the drill string, on a motor that moves in a track along the derrick.
* Sonic&amp;nbsp;— uses primarily vibratory energy to advance the drill string
* Hammer&amp;nbsp;— uses rotation and percussive force (see [[Down-the-hole drill]])

===By position of derrick===
* Conventional&amp;nbsp;— [[derrick]] is vertical
* Slant&amp;nbsp;— [[derrick]] is slanted at a 45 degree angle to facilitate horizontal drilling

==Drilling Techniques==
There are a variety of drilling techniques which can be used to drill a [[borehole]] into the ground. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, in terms of the depth to what it can drill, the type of sample returned, the costs involved and penetration rates achieved. Some types included are Rotary cut, Rotary Abrasive, Rotary Reverse, Cable Tooling, and Sonic Drilling.  

===Auger drilling===
[[Auger drilling is done with a [[Helix|helical]] screw which is driven into the ground with rotation; the earth is lifted up the borehole by the blade of the screw.]] Hollow stem auger drilling is used for softer ground such as swamps where the hole will not stay open by itself for environmental drilling, geotechnical drilling, [[soil]] [[engineering]] and [[geochemistry]] reconnaissance work in exploration for [[mineral]] deposits. Solid flight augers/bucket augers are used in harder ground construction drilling. In some cases, [[mining|mine]] shafts are dug with auger drills. Small augers can be mounted on the back of a utility truck, with large augers used for sinking piles for bridge foundations.

Auger drilling is restricted to generally soft unconsolidated material or weak weathered [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. It is cheap and fast.

===Percussion rotary air blast drilling (RAB)===
RAB drilling is used most frequently in the mineral exploration industry. (This tool is also known as a [[Down-the-hole drill]].) The drill uses a pneumatic reciprocating piston-driven "hammer" to energetically drive a heavy drill bit into the rock. The drill bit is hollow, solid steel and has ~20&amp;nbsp;mm thick tungsten rods protruding from the steel matrix as "buttons". The tungsten buttons are the cutting face of the bit.

The cuttings are blown up the outside of the rods and collected at surface. [[Air]] or a combination of air and [[foam]] lift the cuttings.

RAB drilling is used primarily for [[mineral]] [[Prospecting|exploration]], water bore drilling and blast-hole drilling in mines, as well as for other applications such as engineering, etc. RAB produces lower quality samples because the cuttings are blown up the outside of the rods and can be contaminated from contact with other rocks.
RAB drilling at extreme depth, if it encounters water, may rapidly clog the outside of the hole with debris, precluding removal of drill cuttings from the hole. This can be counteracted, however, with the use of "stabilizers" also known as "reamers", which are large cylindrical pieces of steel attached to the drill string, and made to perfectly fit the size of the hole being drilled. These have sets of rollers on the side, usually with tungsten buttons, that constantly break down cuttings being pushed upwards.

The use of high-powered air compressors, which push 900-1150&amp;nbsp;cfm of air at 300-350&amp;nbsp;psi down the hole also ensures drilling of a deeper hole up to ~1250&amp;nbsp;m due to higher air pressure which pushes all rock cuttings and any water to the surface. This, of course, is all dependent on the density and weight of the rock being drilled, and on how worn the drill bit is.

===Air core drilling===
Air core drilling and related methods use hardened [[steel]] or [[tungsten]] blades to bore a hole into unconsolidated ground. The drill bit has three blades arranged around the bit head, which cut the unconsolidated ground. The rods are hollow and contain an inner tube which sits inside the hollow outer rod barrel. The drill cuttings are removed by injection of compressed air into the hole via the annular area between the innertube and the drill rod. The cuttings are then blown back to surface up the inner tube where they pass through the sample separating system and are collected if needed. Drilling continues with the addition of rods to the top of the drill string. Air core drilling can occasionally produce small chunks of cored rock.

This method of drilling is used to drill the weathered [[regolith]], as the drill rig and steel or tungsten blades cannot penetrate fresh rock. Where possible, air core drilling is preferred over RAB drilling as it provides a more representative sample. Air core drilling can achieve depths approaching 300 metres in good conditions. As the cuttings are removed inside the rods and are less prone to contamination compared to conventional drilling where the cuttings pass to the surface via outside return between the outside of the drill rod and the walls of the hole. This method is more costly and slower than RAB.

===Cable tool drilling===
[[Image:Well spudder 8606.jpg|thumb|upright|Cable tool water well drilling rig in West Virginia. These slow rigs have mostly been replaced by rotary drilling rigs in the U.S.]]
Cable tool rigs are a traditional way of drilling [[water well]]s. The majority of large diameter water supply wells, especially deep wells completed in [[bedrock]] [[aquifers]], were completed using this drilling method. Although this drilling method has largely been supplanted in recent years by other, faster drilling techniques, it is still the most practicable drilling method for large diameter, deep bedrock wells, and in widespread use for small rural water supply wells. The impact of the drill bit fractures the rock and in many shale rock situations increases the water flow into a well over rotary.

Also known as [[Ballistics|ballistic]] well drilling and sometimes called "spudders", these rigs raise and drop a drill string with a heavy [[carbide]] tipped drilling bit that chisels through the rock by finely pulverizing the subsurface materials. The drill string is composed of the upper drill rods, a set of "jars" (inter-locking "sliders" that help transmit additional energy to the drill bit and assist in removing the bit if it is stuck) and the [[drill bit]]. During the drilling process, the drill string is periodically removed from the borehole and a [[bailer]] is lowered to collect the drill cuttings (rock fragments, soil, etc.). The bailer is a bucket-like tool with a trapdoor in the base. If the borehole is dry, water is added so that the drill cuttings will flow into the bailer. When lifted, the trapdoor closes and the cuttings are then raised and removed. Since the drill string must be raised and lowered to advance the boring, the casing (larger diameter outer piping) is typically used to hold back upper soil materials and stabilize the borehole.

Cable tool rigs are simpler and cheaper than similarly sized rotary rigs, although loud and very slow to operate. The world record cable tool well was drilled in New York to a depth of almost {{convert|12,000|ft|m}}. The common [[Bucyrus-Erie]] 22 can drill down to about {{convert|1,100|ft|m}}. Since cable tool drilling does not use air to eject the drilling chips like a rotary, instead using a cable strung bailer, technically there is no limitation on depth.

Cable tool rigs now are nearly obsolete in the United States. They are mostly used in Africa or Third-World countries. Being slow, cable tool rig drilling means increased wages for drillers. In the United States drilling wages would average around US$200 per day per man, while in Africa it is only US$6 per day per man, so a slow drilling machine can still be used in undeveloped countries with depressed wages. A cable tool rig can drill {{convert|25|ft|m}} to {{convert|60|ft|m}} of hard rock a day. A newer rotary drillcat top head rig equipped with down-the-hole (DTH) hammer can drill {{convert|500|ft|m}} or more per day, depending on size and formation hardness.

===Reverse circulation (RC) drilling===
[[Image:RC Rig sideview.jpg|thumb|RC Drill Rig Sideview|right|Track mounted Reverse Circulation rig (side view).]]
[[File:L23VTx119ft HHH16 BHD40 Kobelco CK1800 Crane France.jpg|left|thumb|Reverse Circulation Drilling set-up on Vertical Travel Leads at the Port of La Rochelle, France]]
RC drilling is similar to air core drilling, in that the drill cuttings are returned to surface inside the rods. The drilling mechanism is a [[pneumatic]] reciprocating piston known as a "hammer" driving a tungsten-steel drill bit. RC drilling utilises much larger rigs and machinery and depths of up to 500 metres are routinely achieved. RC drilling ideally produces dry rock chips, as large air [[gas compressor|compressors]] dry the rock out ahead of the advancing drill bit. RC drilling is slower and costlier but achieves better penetration than RAB or air core drilling; it is cheaper than diamond coring and is thus preferred for most [[mineral exploration]] work.

Reverse circulation is achieved by blowing air down the rods, the differential pressure creating [[airlift pump|air lift]] of the water and cuttings up the "inner tube", which is inside each rod. It reaches the "divertor" at the top of the hole, then moves through a sample hose which is attached to the top of the "cyclone". The drill cuttings travel around the inside of the cyclone until they fall through an opening at the bottom and are collected in a sample bag.

The most commonly used RC drill bits are 5-8&amp;nbsp;inches (13–20&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter and have round tungsten 'buttons' that protrude from the bit, which are required to drill through [[shale]] and abrasive rock. As the buttons wear down, drilling becomes slower and the rod string can potentially become bogged in the hole. This is a problem as trying to recover the rods may take hours and in some cases weeks. The rods and drill bits themselves are very expensive, often resulting in great cost to drilling companies when equipment is lost down the bore hole. Most companies will regularly re-grind the buttons on their drill bits in order to prevent this, and to speed up progress. Usually, when something is lost (breaks off) in the hole, it is not the drill string, but rather from the bit, hammer, or stabilizer to the bottom of the drill string (bit). This is usually caused by operator error, over-stressed metal, or adverse drilling conditions causing downhole equipment to get stuck in a part of the hole.

Although RC drilling is air-powered, water is also used to reduce dust, keep the drill bit cool, and assist in pushing cutting back upwards, but also when "collaring" a new hole. A [[Drilling mud|mud]] called "Liqui-Pol" is mixed with water and pumped into the rod string, down the hole. This helps to bring up the sample to the surface by making the sand stick together. Occasionally, "Super-Foam" (a.k.a. "Quik-Foam") is also used, to bring all the very fine cuttings to the surface, and to clean the hole. When the drill reaches hard rock, a "collar" is put down the hole around the rods, which is normally PVC piping. Occasionally the collar may be made from metal casing. Collaring a hole is needed to stop the walls from caving in and bogging the rod string at the top of the hole. Collars may be up to 60 metres deep, depending on the ground, although if drilling through hard rock a collar may not be necessary.

Reverse circulation rig setups usually consist of a support vehicle, an auxiliary vehicle, as well as the rig itself. The support vehicle, normally a truck, holds diesel and water tanks for resupplying the rig. It also holds other supplies needed for maintenance on the rig. The auxiliary is a vehicle, carrying an auxiliary engine and a booster engine. These engines are connected to the rig by high pressure air hoses. Although RC rigs have their own booster and [[Air compressor|compressor]] to generate air pressure, extra power is needed which usually isn't supplied by the rig due to lack of space for these large engines. Instead, the engines are mounted on the auxiliary vehicle. Compressors on an RC rig have an output of around 1000 [[cubic feet per minute|cfm]] at 500 [[pound-force per square inch|psi]] (500&amp;nbsp;L·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3.4&amp;nbsp;MPa). Alternatively, stand-alone air compressors which have an output of 900-1150cfm at 300-350 psi each are used in sets of 2, 3, or 4, which are all routed to the rig through a multi-valve manifold.

===Diamond core drilling===
[[Image:Layne Rig57.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Multi-combination drilling rig (capable of both [[diamond core drill|diamond]] and reverse circulation drilling). Rig is currently set up for diamond drilling.]]

[[Diamond core drill]]ing ([[exploration diamond drilling]]) utilizes an annular diamond-impregnated drill bit attached to the end of hollow drill rods to cut a cylindrical core of solid rock. The diamonds used to make diamond core bits are a variety of sizes, fine to microfine industrial grade [[diamond]]s, and the ratio of diamonds to metal used in the matrix affects the performance of the bits cutting ability in different types of rock formations. The [[diamond]]s are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from [[brass]] to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut.  The bits made with hard steel with a low diamond count are ideal for softer highly fractured rock while others made of softer steels and high diamond ratio are good for coring in hard solid rock. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions&amp;nbsp;— lubrication, cooling, and removal of drill cuttings from the hole.

Diamond drilling is much slower than reverse circulation (RC) drilling due to the hardness of the ground being drilled. Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock. Techniques vary among drill operators and what the rig they are using is capable of, some diamond rigs need to drill slowly to lengthen the life of drill bits and rods, which are very expensive and time consuming to replace at extremely deep depths. As a diamond drill rig cores deeper and deeper the time consuming part of the process is not cutting 5 to 10 more feet of rock core but the retrieval of the core with the wire line &amp; overshot tool.
[[Core sample]]s are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut. An "overshot" attached to the end of the winch cable is lowered inside the rod string and locks on to the backend (aka head assembly), located on the top end of the core barrel. The winch is retracted, pulling the core tube to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the core tube when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube.

[[File:Atlas Copco core bits.jpg|thumb|right|Diamond core drill bits]]
Once the core tube is removed from the hole, the core sample is then removed from the core tube and catalogued. The Driller's assistant unscrews the backend off the core tube using tube wrenches, then each part of the tube is taken and the core is shaken out into core trays. The core is washed, measured and broken into smaller pieces using a hammer or sawn through to make it fit into the sample trays. Once catalogued, the core trays are retrieved by geologists who then analyse the core and determine if the drill site is a good location to expand future mining operations.

Diamond rigs can also be part of a multi-combination rig. Multi-combination rigs are a dual setup rig capable of operating in either a reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drilling role (though not at the same time). This is a common scenario where exploration drilling is being performed in a very isolated location. The rig is first set up to drill as an RC rig and once the desired metres are drilled, the rig is set up for diamond drilling. This way the deeper metres of the hole can be drilled without moving the rig and waiting for a diamond rig to set up on the [[Drill floor|pad]].

===Direct push rigs===
Direct push technology includes several types of drilling rigs and drilling equipment which advances a drill string by pushing or hammering without rotating the drill string. While this does not meet the proper definition of drilling, it does achieve the same result&amp;nbsp;— a [[borehole]]. Direct push rigs include both [[cone penetration test]]ing (CPT) rigs and direct push sampling rigs such as a [[PowerProbe]] or [[Geoprobe]]. Direct push rigs typically are limited to drilling in unconsolidated soil materials and very soft rock.

CPT rigs advance specialized testing equipment (such as electronic cones), and soil samplers using large hydraulic rams. Most CPT rigs are heavily ballasted (20 metric tons is typical) as a counter force against the pushing force of the hydraulic rams which are often rated up to 20&amp;nbsp;kN. Alternatively, small, light CPT rigs and offshore CPT rigs will use [[anchors]] such as screwed-in ground anchors to create the reactive force. In ideal conditions, CPT rigs can achieve production rates of up to 250–300 meters per day.

Direct push drilling rigs use hydraulic cylinders and a hydraulic hammer in advancing a hollow core sampler to gather soil and groundwater samples. The speed and depth of penetration is largely dependent on the soil type, the size of the sampler, and the weight and power of the rig. Direct push techniques are generally limited to shallow soil sample recovery in unconsolidated soil materials. The advantage of direct push technology is that in the right soil type it can produce a large number of high quality samples quickly and cheaply, generally from 50 to 75 meters per day. Rather than hammering, direct push can also be combined with sonic (vibratory) methods to increase drill efficiency.

===Hydraulic rotary drilling===
[[Oil well]] drilling utilises tri-cone roller, carbide embedded, fixed-cutter diamond, or diamond-impregnated drill bits to wear away at the cutting face. This is preferred because there is no need to return intact samples to surface for assay as the objective is to reach a formation containing oil or natural gas. Sizable machinery is used, enabling depths of several kilometres to be penetrated. Rotating hollow drill pipes carry down [[bentonite]] and [[barite]] infused [[drilling mud]]s to lubricate, cool, and clean the [[Well drilling|drilling bit]], control downhole pressures, stabilize the wall of the [[borehole]] and remove [[drill cuttings]]. The mud travels back to the surface around the outside of the drill pipe, called the [[annulus (oil well)|annulus]]. Examining rock chips extracted from the mud is known as [[mud logging]]. Another form of [[Formation evaluation|well logging]] is electronic and is commonly employed to evaluate the existence of possible oil and gas deposits in the [[borehole]]. This can take place while the well is being drilled, using [[Measurement While Drilling]] tools, or after drilling, by [[Well logging|lowering measurement tools]] into the newly drilled hole.

The rotary system of drilling was in general use in Texas in the early 1900s. It is a modification of one invented by Fauvelle in 1845, and used in the early years of the oil industry in some of the oil-producing countries in Europe. Originally pressurized water was used instead of mud, and was almost useless in hard rock before the diamond cutting bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petroleum |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main breakthrough for rotary drilling came in 1901, when [[Anthony Francis Lucas]] combined the use of a steam-driven rig and of mud instead of water in the [[Spindletop]] discovery well.&lt;ref&gt;Roughnecks, Rock Bits And Rigs: The Evolution Of Oil Well Drilling Technology In Alberta, 1883-1970

The drilling and production of oil and gas can pose a [[safety]] risk and a hazard to the [[Natural environment|environment]] from the ignition of the entrained gas causing dangerous fires and also from the risk of oil leakage polluting water, land and groundwater. For these reasons, redundant safety systems and highly trained personnel are required by law in all countries with significant production.

==Automated drill rig==
An automated drill rig (ADR) is a state-of-the-art automated full-sized walking land-based drill rig that drills long lateral sections in horizontal wells for the oil and gas industry.&lt;ref name="New Tech" /&gt;  ADRs are agile rigs that can move from pad to pad to new well sites faster than other full-sized drilling rigs. Each rig costs about  $25 million. ADR is used extensively in the [[Athabasca oil sands]]. According to the "Oil Patch Daily News", "Each rig will generate 50,000 man-hours of work during the construction phase and upon completion, each operating rig will directly and indirectly employ more than 100 workers." Compared to conventional drilling rigs", Ensign, an international oilfield services contractor based in Calgary, Alberta, that makes ADRs claims that they are "safer to operate,  have "enhanced controls intelligence," "reduced environmental footprint, quick mobility and advanced communications between field and office."&lt;ref name="New Tech"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.newtechmagazine.com/index.php/oilpatch-daily-news/drilling/11331-ensign-launches-newest-and-most-powerful-automated-adr-1500s-pad-drill-rigs-in-montney-play |title=Ensign Launches Newest And Most Powerful Automated ADR 1500S Pad Drill Rigs In Montney Play |date=21 November 2014 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=New Tech Magazine |location=Calgary, Alberta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210131127/http://www.newtechmagazine.com/index.php/oilpatch-daily-news/drilling/11331-ensign-launches-newest-and-most-powerful-automated-adr-1500s-pad-drill-rigs-in-montney-play |archivedate=10 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005 the first specifically designed slant automated drilling rig (ADR), Ensign Rig No. 118, for [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) applications was mobilized by Deer Creek Energy Limited, a Calgary-based oilsands company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newtechmagazine.com/index.php/daily-news/archived-news/3699-deer-creek-and-ensign-spud-first-sagd-wells-using-slant-automated-drilling-rig |title=Deer Creek And Ensign Spud First SAGD Wells Using Slant Automated Drilling Rig |work=newtechmagazine.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210131220/http://www.newtechmagazine.com/index.php/daily-news/archived-news/3699-deer-creek-and-ensign-spud-first-sagd-wells-using-slant-automated-drilling-rig |archivedate=2014-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits of the technology==
Drill technology has advanced steadily since the 19th century. However, there are several basic limiting factors which will determine the depth to which a bore hole can be sunk.

All holes must maintain outer diameter; the diameter of the hole must remain wider than the diameter of the rods or the rods cannot turn in the hole and progress cannot continue. Friction caused by the drilling operation will tend to reduce the outside diameter of the drill bit. This applies to all drilling methods, except that in diamond core drilling the use of thinner rods and casing may permit the hole to continue. Casing is simply a hollow sheath which protects the hole against collapse during drilling, and is made of metal or [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Often diamond holes will start off at a large diameter and when outside diameter is lost, thinner rods put down inside casing to continue, until finally the hole becomes too narrow. Alternatively, the hole can be reamed; this is the usual practice in oil well drilling where the hole size is maintained down to the next casing point.

For percussion techniques, the main limitation is air pressure. Air must be delivered to the piston at sufficient pressure to activate the reciprocating action, and in turn drive the head into the rock with sufficient strength to fracture and pulverise it. With depth, volume is added to the in-rod string, requiring larger compressors to achieve operational pressures. Secondly, [[groundwater]] is ubiquitous, and increases in [[pressure]] with depth in the ground. The air inside the rod string must be pressurised enough to overcome this water pressure at the bit face. Then, the air must be able to carry the rock fragments to surface. This is why depths in excess of 500 m for reverse circulation drilling are rarely achieved, because the cost is prohibitive and approaches the threshold at which diamond core drilling is more economic.

Diamond drilling can routinely achieve depths in excess of 1200 m. In cases where money is no issue, extreme depths have been achieved, because there is no requirement to overcome water pressure. However, water circulation must be maintained to return the drill cuttings to surface, and more importantly to maintain cooling and lubrication of the cutting surface of the bit; while at the same time reduce friction on the steel walls of the rods turning against the rock walls of the hole. When water return is lost the rods will vibrate, this is called "rod chatter", and that will damage the drill rods, and crack the joints.

Without sufficient lubrication and cooling, the matrix of the drill bit will soften. While diamond is the hardest substance known, at 10 on the [[Mohs hardness scale]], it must remain firmly in the matrix to achieve cutting. Weight on bit, the force exerted on the cutting face of the bit by the drill rods in the hole above the bit, must also be monitored.

A unique drilling operation in deep ocean water was named [[Project Mohole]].

==New oilfield technologies==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
 	
Research includes technologies based on the utilization of [[Water jet cutter|water jet]], [[Plasma (physics)|chemical plasma]], [[Spallation|hydrothermal spallation]] or [[laser]].

==Causes of deviation==
Most drill holes deviate slightly from their planned trajectory. This is because of the torque of the turning bit working against the cutting face, because of the flexibility of the steel rods and especially the screw joints, because of reaction to [[foliation (geology)|foliation]] and structure within the rock, and because of [[refraction]] as the bit moves into different rock layers of varying resistance. Additionally, inclined holes will tend to deviate upwards because the drill rods will lie against the bottom of the bore, causing the drill bit to be slightly inclined from true. It is because of deviation that drill holes must be surveyed if deviation will impact the usefulness of the information returned. Sometimes the surface location can be offset laterally to take advantage of the expected deviation tendency, so the bottom of the hole will end up near the desired location.  Oil well drilling commonly uses a process of controlled deviation called [[directional drilling]] (e.g., when several wells are drilled from one surface location).

==Rig equipment==
[[Image:Oil Rig NT8.svg|thumb|Simple diagram of a drilling rig and its basic operation]]Drilling rigs typically include at least some of the following items: See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a more detailed description.

*[[Blowout preventer]]s: (BOPs)
The equipment associated with a rig is to some extent dependent on the type of rig but (#23 &amp; #24) are devices installed at the wellhead to prevent fluids and gases from unintentionally escaping from the [[borehole]]. #23 is the annular (often referred to as the "Hydril", which is one manufacturer) and #24 is the [[pipe rams]] and [[blind rams]].  In the place of #24 [[Variable bore rams]] or VBRs can be used.  These offer the same pressure and sealing capacity found in standard pipe rams, while offering the versatility of sealing on various sizes of drill pipe, production tubing and casing without changing standard pipe rams.  Normally VBRs are used when utilizing a tapered drill string (when different size drill pipe is used in the complete drill string).
*[[Centrifuge]]: an industrial version of the device that separates fine silt and sand from the drilling fluid.
*[[Solids control]]: solids control equipment is for preparing drilling mud for the drilling rig.
*[[Chain tong]]s: wrench with a section of chain, that wraps around whatever is being tightened or loosened. Similar to a pipe wrench.
*[[Degasser]]: a device that separates air and/or gas from the [[drilling fluid]].
*[[Desander]] / [[desilter]]: contains a set of [[hydrocyclone]]s that separate sand and silt from the drilling fluid.
*[[Drawworks]]: (#7) is the mechanical section that contains the spool, whose main function is to reel in/out the drill line to raise/lower the [[traveling block]] (#11).
*[[Drill bit (well)|Drill bit]]: (#26) is a device attached to the end of the drill string that breaks apart the rock being drilled. It contains jets through which the drilling fluid exits.
*[[Drill pipe]]: (#16) joints of hollow tubing used to connect the surface equipment to the [[bottom hole assembly]] (BHA) and acts as a conduit for the [[drilling fluid]]. In the diagram, these are "stands" of drill pipe which are 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe connected together and "stood" in the derrick vertically, usually to save time while [[Tripping (pipe)|tripping pipe]].
*[[Elevators (drilling rig)|Elevators]]: a gripping device that is used to latch to the drill pipe or casing to facilitate the lowering or lifting (of pipe or casing) into or out of the [[borehole]].
*[[Mud motor]]: a hydraulically powered device positioned just above the [[Drilling bit#Well drilling bits|drill bit]] used to spin the bit independently from the rest of the drill string.
*[[Mud pump]]: (#4) reciprocal type of pump used to circulate drilling fluid through the system.
*[[Mud tank]]s: (#1) often called mud pits, provides a reserve store of drilling fluid until it is required down the wellbore.
*[[Rotary table (drilling rig)|Rotary table]]: (#20) rotates the drill string along with the attached tools and bit.
*[[Shale shaker]]: (#2) separates [[drill cuttings]] from the drilling fluid before it is pumped back down the [[borehole]].

== Occupational safety ==
Drilling rigs create some safety challenges for those who work on them. One safety concern is the use of [[seatbelt]]s for workers driving between two locations. Motor vehicle fatalities on the job for these workers is 8.5 times the rate of the rest of the US working population, which can be attributed to the low rate of seatbelt use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/08/07/super-workplace/ |title = The Importance of Occupational Safety and Health: Making for a "Super" Workplace |date = 7 August 2013 |accessdate = 16 January 2015 |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |first1 = Jaclyn |last1 = Krah |first2 = Richard L. |last2 = Unger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earth Economics''' is a [[501c3]] non-profit headquartered in [[Tacoma, Washington]], United States. The organization uses natural [[capital valuation]] to help decision makers and local stakeholders understand the value of [[natural capital]] assets. By identifying, monetizing, and valuing natural capital and [[ecosystem services]], Earth Economics helps communities and organizations make sound investment and policy decisions that mitigate risk, add value, and build [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]]. The organization has a small in-house staff of [[economists]] that collaborate with experts in [[economics]], [[ecology]], [[hydrology]], [[policy]] and [[systems modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org|title=Home|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==

Earth Economics' current mission states, "We quantify and value the benefits nature provides. Our work drives effective decisions and systemic change through a combination of education, natural capital analysis, and policy recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org/vision/|title=Mission and Vision|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its website, Earth Economics offers "a pragmatic, collaborative approach to help organizations make sound investment and policy decisions that mitigate risk, add value, and build resilience by taking nature into account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eartheconomics.org/what-we-do|title=What We Do|website=Earth Economics|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization currently focuses on the global and regional priorities of working lands, freshwater, oceans, forests, and communities.

Earth Economics offers five types of services: 
* Workshops &amp; Trainings: Earth Economics offers hands-on workshops, trainings, and presentations that aim to raise awareness about ecological economics concepts and cost-effective solutions that build resilience, [[biodiversity]], and equity. 
* Ecosystem Services Valuation: Earth Economics is best known for their expertise in natural capital valuation. The Ecosystem Valuation Toolkit (EVT), an expanding and searchable database of ecosystem service values, serves as the foundation for these analyses. 
* Benefit-Cost Analysis: Earth Economics’ benefit-cost analysis framework expands traditional cost-benefit equations to include ecosystem services and other factors including health, recreation, and effects on culture and community. 
* Industry Analysis: Earth Economics works with businesses and economic development agencies to reduce risk, improve the efficiency of operations, reduce [[carbon footprint]], and expand job opportunities. 
* Finance &amp; Investment Strategies: Earth Economics works with organizations to develop innovative approaches and practical financing strategies to preserve, enhance, or restore natural capital assets, including [[conservation lands]], [[green infrastructure]], working forests and farms, and [[green building]]s.

==History==

Originally known as the Asia-Pacific Environmental Exchange (APEX), the organization was founded as a project of [[The Tides Center]]. The initial co-founders were David Batker, Jim Puckett, [[Annie Leonard]], Joshua Farley, Joshua Reyneveld, and Isabel De La Torre. Earth Economics evolved into an autonomous organization and received IRS [[501(c)3]] tax exempt, public charity status in March 2006.

From 2006 until 2016, co-founder David Batker acted as Earth Economics' Executive Director and Chief Economist. In 2016, Batker moved to a joint President and Chief Economist position. Batker's research and advocacy focuses on the value that natural systems have in providing food, water, flood risk reduction, climate stabilization, and other benefits. His work has been used to establish the value of watersheds and new funding mechanisms for maintaining natural capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/study-puts-price-on-puget-sound/|title=Study puts price on Puget Sound|date=2008-07-25|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Economics has a track record of working alongside NGOs, businesses, and governmental organizations to inform investment and shift local and international policy in ways that account for the benefits of ecosystem services. Since 2013, Earth Economics has been working to incorporate ecosystem services in federal benefit-cost analysis and accounting practices.

'''Ethnozoology''' is the study of the past and present interrelationships between [[human culture]]s  and the [[animal]]s in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/ethnoarchaeology/ethnozoology/index.shtml Ethnozoology Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508024045/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/ethnoarchaeology/ethnozoology/index.shtml |date=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes classification and naming of zoological forms, cultural knowledge and use of wild and domestic animals.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson,  Leslie Main. Ethnobiology - Traditional Biological Knowledge in Contemporary Global Context.  Anthropology 491 study guide,  Athabasca University 2002. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the main subdisciplines of [[ethnobiology]] and shares many methodologies and theoretical frameworks with [[ethnobotany]].

Ethnozoology is the study of human and animal interaction. Ethnobiology includes ethnobotany, which concerns the study of human-plant relationships and ethnozoology. Ethnozoology focuses explicitly on human-animal relationships and knowledge humans have acquired concerning the Earth's fauna. Ethnozoological study concerns the significance of this knowledge to our understanding of the roles played by animals in human society. Faunal resources play a variety of roles in human life throughout history, and their importance to human beings is not only utilitarian but cultural, religious, artistic, and philosophical. Ethnozoology can be understood broadly, from ecological, cognitive, and symbolic perspectives. Human knowledge about natural faunal resources entails sensing, recognizing, classifying, living things. Ethnozoology is a discipline that connects scientific methods to traditional systems of knowledge and cultural beliefs.

== Conservation ==
In a broader context, ethnozoology and its companion discipline, ethnobotany, contribute to the larger science of [[ethnobiology]]. The history of ethnobiology is divided into three periods. The pre-classical period, which began around 1860, focused on collecting information about humans' use of resources, while the classical period, which began in 1954, produced anthropological studies on [[linguistics]] and biological classifications. The current period, or post-classical period, has been described as a meeting of [[social science]] and the study of [[natural resources]].&lt;ref name=Alves2012&gt;Alves, R. (2012). Relationships between fauna and people and the role of ethnozoology in animal conservation. Ethnobiology and Conservation, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the profound human influence on faunal biodiversity, wildlife conservation planning is becoming increasingly urgent. It is widely acknowledged that environmental health is important to human health, and [[biodiversity loss]] can have both indirect and direct negative effects on human wellbeing. The close link between human health and ecological/faunal health is substantiated with five important concepts: animals cause and disseminate disease for humans and vice versa, animals can be guards of human health, animals are used in traditional medicine practices throughout the world, animals are a source of drugs and treatments in human diseases, and animals are used in medical research.&lt;ref name=Alves2012/&gt;

== The social sciences ==

=== Sociology ===

[[Sociology]] has been slow to explore ethnozoology and grant it credibility.&lt;ref name=Arluke2003&gt;Arluke, A. (2003). Ethnozoology and the future of sociology. International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy, 23(3), 26-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of ethnozoology is important because policy makers and concerned citizens are too often left to be informed only by animal advocates or biomedical researchers, both of which are inherently biased. Animals provide humans with a better understanding of ourselves, and how we think and act toward animals has the potential to reveal our attitudes toward other people and social order. Evidence of this can be seen in the ways that animal images may at times be expressing underlying racism: "the most damning testimony given by accused police at the [[Rodney King]] trial involved characterization of King as a 'gorilla'; during the Gulf War Saddam Hussein was described in the American press as a 'rat'; and the actions of people in the Los Angeles riots were likened by the media commentators to 'packs of vicious animals'".&lt;ref name=Arluke2003/&gt;

Sociology is a science concerned with groups and group formation, including those facing structural and interpersonal oppression, suffering, and vulnerability. Sub-fields in this area include [[African-American studies|African Americans studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[gay/lesbian studies]]. However, not much attention or legitimacy is awarded animal studies as a sub-field. Modern use of animals in the developed world, especially in the United States, can be characterized by exploitation, domination, and oppression.&lt;ref name=Irvine&gt;Irvine, L. (2008). Animals and sociology. Sociology Compass, 2(6), 1954–1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal cruelty and abuse is not only present in the industrial farming of livestock, but also in such circumstances as dog fighting, cow tipping, horse racing, circus acts, and other entertainment industries and practices. Furthermore, animals are often victims and pawns used in domestic violence. The widespread abuse of animals in modern society is important for sociology because it involves an entrenched assumption about the connection between cruelty toward animals and violence directed and human beings. Some research has even suggested ways in which the human-animal interaction can challenge dominant sociological theories about the self.&lt;ref name=Irvine/&gt;

=== Anthropology ===
[[Anthropology]] has done more to study ethnozoology in terms of the history of the function of animals in non-industrialized societies and the role that animals play symbolically and religiously in different cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=Arluke2003/&gt; The [[domestication]] process has been a chief concern for anthropologists, whose interests are in the history of human desire to understand animals, enslave them, and harness their power. Animal-derived products have been used especially for food, but also for clothing, tools, toys, and for medicinal and magic-religious purposes. Many cultures associate strong supernatural powers between the animal and human worlds, including mythologies and connections with totemic, ancestral, or magical animals and animal-gods.&lt;ref&gt;Alves, R. R., Rosa, I. L., Neto, N. A. L., &amp; Voeks, R. (2012). Animals for the gods: Magical and religious faunal use and trade in Brazil. Human Ecology, 40(5), 751-780.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sax2001&gt;Sax, B. (2001). The mythical zoo. An Encyclopedia of Animals in World Myth, Legend and Folklore.Santa Barbara, CA: ABC Clio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals are given symbolic meaning, as in the western association of [[black cat]]s with poor luck.&lt;ref name=Sax2001/&gt; Biological knowledge varies according to cultural and traditional knowledge and experiences. People share a basic way of comprehending the natural world based on common [[evolution]]ary history, and this foundation connects scientific biology with its historical roots in different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary perspective on human cognition and affect indicates some degree of universality in perception and decision-making with regard to the natural world and its fauna. The interaction between these aspects of [[psychology]], [[biodiversity]] of the Earth's wildlife, and the unique social, cultural, and economic contexts within which humans interact and develop produces [[cultural diversity]]. Paleoanthropological studies suggest that linguistic approaches to ethnobiology have only recently evolved in the context of human history,&lt;ref&gt;Hunn, E. (2007). Ethnobiology in four phases. Journal of Ethnobiology, 27(1), 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that these linguistic approaches only provide a partial understanding to how humans perceive and engage with the natural world around them.&lt;ref&gt;Mithen, S. (2006). Ethnobiology and the evolution of the human mind. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 12(s1), S45-S61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firdeusi Institute Logo.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Seal of Firdeusi Institute for Persian Studies]]

Firdeusi (eng: Ferdowsi) Institute for Iranian and Persian Studies is a non-for-profit and non-governmental organisation, which scientific and research activity is conducted autonomously, and is not based on political or religious matters. The Institute has been established in the form of “Center” (with no membership) by two founders: [[Marin Barleti University]] and Iranian Cultural Foundation “Saadi Shirazi” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.iranalbania.ir|title=Official web-site of Saadi Shirazi Cultural Foundation|work= iranalbania.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to the Cooperation agreement held in October 6, 2010. The ceremony of launching was held  on 29 October 2010, initiating the functioning of the first research institute for Persian studies in Albania, at University level.

The '''Institute name''' “Firdeusi” (eng: Ferdowsi) comes the greatest Persian poets, thinkers and writers, Abul-Kasim Hasan Pur-Ali Tusi Ferdowsi, known otherwise as the Father of the Iranology Studies worldwide. The choice came also as a tribute to the “Ferdowsi [[Shahnameh]] Millenium” proclaimed by [[UNESCO]]  in 2010.
The Institute Logo has been inspired by the poet’s name and is interwoven with calligraphy elements from the [[Persian language]]. Logo represents an open book, being a metaphor of the scientific character of the Institute.

==Persian studies in Albania==
Iranian studies in Albania although not academically pursued, have always enjoyed Albanian people interest. The diffusion of Persian literature and culture in Albania is closely linked with the presence of Ottoman Empire in Albania and with the heavy influence Persian culture exerted on the Ottoman administration and Turkish culture of the era. Another key factor in the popularisation of Persian culture among Albanians is the expansion of Islam in the territories lived in by Albanians during the 16th and 17th centuries. Meanwhile, during the 19th century, the Persian language was widely used among Albanian intellectuals.

Naim and Sami Frashëri were among the most prominent scholars of oriental and Iranian studies in Albania. Naim Frashëri published two books in Persian: the first, ''Grammar of the Persian Language'' was published in 1871, while the second one, a compilation of poems in Persian, ''Tehajjulat''" was published in 1885. These represented the cornerstone of Persian literature and culture in Albania.

Other personalities of Iranology in Albania include: Vexhi Buharaja, translator into Albanian language of many Persian books (such as “Gjylistani dhe Bostani” “3500 verses from Shahname”, etc.), [[Tahir Dizdari]], author of “Persian words in Albanian language”, Hafiz Ali Korca and Fan Noli, with his  translation of Omar Khajam’s famous “quatrains”, Dalan Shapllo, scholar, writer and translator of Hafiz Shirazi’s mystical poems and many more contemporaneous Albanian linguists, scholars and writers.

'''Folk science''' describes ways of understanding and predicting the natural and social world, without the use of rigorous methodologies (see [[Scientific method]]). One could label all understanding of nature predating the Greeks as "folk science".

Folk science is often accepted as "common wisdom" in a given culture, and gets passed on as [[meme]]s. According to some [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]], it may also reflect the output of evolved [[cognitive]] processes of the [[human mind]] which have been adapted in the course of [[human evolution]].

[[Scientific skepticism|Skeptics]] often investigate the influence and validity of folk science.

'''Glass disease''', also referred to as '''sick glass''' or  '''glass illness''', is a degradation process of glass that can result in '''weeping''', '''crizzling''', '''spalling''', cracking and fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunicki-Goldfinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunicki-Goldfinger|first1=Jerzy J.|title=Unstable historic glass: symptoms, causes, mechanisms and conservation|journal=Reviews in Conservation|date=2008|volume=9|pages=47-60 |url=https://www.iiconservation.org/node/2258|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Glass disease is caused by an inherent instability in the chemical composition of the original [[glass]] formula.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; 
Properties of a particular glass will vary with the type and proportions of [[silica]], [[alkali]] and [[Alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] in its composition.&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;
Once damage has occurred it is irreversible, but decay processes can be slowed by climate control to regulate surrounding temperature, humidity, and air flow.

==Chemical composition and decay==
Glass disease is caused by an inherent fault in the chemical composition of the original [[glass]] formula.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; 
Glass contains three types of components: ''network formers''  establish basic structure, ''network stabilizers'' make glass strong and water resistant, and ''[[Ceramic flux|flux]]'' lowers the melting point at which the glass can be formed.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=   Cansler |first1=Clay  |title=From Ancient to Art Nouveau |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=2 |pages=24-25 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common formulations of glass may include [[silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a former, alkali oxides such as [[Sodium oxide|soda]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) or [[potash]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) for flux, and alkaline earth oxides such as [[Lime (material)|lime]] (CaO) for stabilizing.&lt;ref name="Hogg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogg|first1=Simon|last2=McPhail|first2=David|last3=Oakley|first3=Victoria|last4=Rogers|first4=Philip|title=Cracking Crizzling - Eight Years of Collaborative Research|journal=Conservation Journal|date=1998|issue=29|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-29/cracking-crizzling-eight-years-of-collaborative-research/|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

Structurally, glass is composed of a network of SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-tetrahedrons. In addition to the ''network former'' silicon which establishes its principal structure, glass contains ''network modifying agents'' such as the alkali ions Na+ and K+ and the alkali earth ions Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ and Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+.  Glass does not have a defined [[stoichiometry]], rather the network is flexible. It can incorporate other ions, depending upon factors such as the main composition and firing conditions of the glass.&lt;ref name="Gradmann"/&gt; This causes almost all glass to be chemically unstable to some extent.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt;

Electron charge differences of ions within the structure form the basis of its bonding. Both viscosity and transition temperature are related to the availability of oxygen bonds in the glass's composition.  Modifying agents tend to lower the melting point of the silica.   Higher contents of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increase [[acidity]] of the glass. Higher contents of CaO, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increase [[basicity]].&lt;ref name="Gradmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gradmann|first1=Rena|title=Analysis of historical islamic glazes and the development of a substitution|date=2016 |publisher=Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg|location=w|url=https://d-nb.info/1112041508/34|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The chemical stability of glass decreases when only Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are added as flux, because bonding becomes weaker. The chemical stability of glass can be increased by adding CaO, MgO, ZnO, and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. To be stable, glass composition must balance temperature lowering agents with stabilizing agents.&lt;ref name="Gradmann"/&gt;

Exposure of a glass surface to moisture, either in solution or from humidity in the atmosphere, causes chemical reactions to occur on and below the surface of the glass. The exchange of alkali metal ions (from within the glass) and hydrogen ions (from outside) can cause chemical and structural changes to the glass. When alkali metal cations in the near-surface layer are replaced by smaller hydrogen ions, structural differences between the affected surface layer and the unaffected lower layers of glass cause increasing tensile stress, which in turn can cause cracking.&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oakley|first1=Victoria|last2=Rogers|first2=Philip |last3=McPhail|first3=David|last4=Amaku|first4=Afi|title=Vessel Glass Deterioration in the Museum Environment: A Quantitative Study by Surface Analysis|journal=Conservation Journal|date=April 1992|issue=3 |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-03/vessel-glass-deterioration-in-the-museum-environment-a-quantitative-study-by-surface-analysis/|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CW"&gt;{{cite journal|title=20 years ago - Investigating crizzling|journal=Chemistry World (originally appeared in ''Chemistry in Britain'', 1992.)|date=3 October 2012|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/20-years-ago-investigating-crizzling/5499.article|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of degradation due to glass disease depends on the amount and proportion of alkaline compounds mixed with silica, and on surrounding conditions.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;
Inadequate [[calcium oxide]] causes the alkalis in the glass to remain water-soluble at a low level of humidity. Exposure to higher levels of [[relative humidity]] during storage or display causes alkali to hydrate and leach out of the glass. Repeated changes in humidity can be particularly damaging. It is important to realize that any glass object can deteriorate if it is exposed to unsuitable environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt; Crystal, historic glass, or treasured family items should never be exposed to the high temperatures and water pressure of a dishwasher.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for Your Glass|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/caring-for-your-glass/|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|Energy dispersive x-ray analysis]] (EDXA),&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CW"/&gt; [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) and [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) can be used to study exchange reactions in different types of glass. By quantifying and studying chemical structure and reactions at the near-surface layer, the mechanisms of glass disease can be better understood.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt; 
Measurement of the pH of glass surfaces is particularly important if glass objects have a matte surface, or have been exposed to [[kaolin]] or other substances. In the case of extremely small objects such as glass beads, pH measurement may be necessary to determine whether alkaline salts are present and changes in the glass are occurring.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovell"/&gt;

==Stages of deterioration==
The processes involved in glass disease can reduce the transparency of the glass or even threaten the integrity of the structure.  Glass disease causes a complex disintegration of the glass which can be identified through a variety of symptoms, including weeping, crizzling, spalling, cracking and fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Connor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Steve|title=Museum tries to stem disease affecting glass: Chemists are being used to combat a disease that is shattering exhibits|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/museum-tries-to-stem-disease-affecting-glass-chemists-are-being-used-to-combat-a-disease-that-is-1556872.html|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=The Independent|date=11 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
The following description of glass beads from an object in the collection of the [[British Museum]], effectively illustrates the range of symptoms that can occur with glass disease:  
{{quote|"Two factors indicated that the deterioration was the result of the phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘glass disease’; first, damage was limited to beads of one particular  colour  (pale  yellow)  and  second,  visible  signs  of  all the  various  stages  of  glass  disease  were  present  on  these beads.  This  included  the  presence  of  small  white crystals  on  the  surface  of  most  pale  yellow  beads  and  a fine network of uniform cracks or ‘crizzling’ crossing the surface of 55 of the 69 beads. This crizzling appeared to be more prevalent around the bead holes. A total of 32 beads had areas of spalling, or advanced crizzling, where cracks had  extended  further  into  the  glass  structure... Many had areas that had already spalled and the fragments lost.  Vertical  cracks  extending  through  the  glass  were  present on 37 beads and four beads had become detached due  to  complete  fragmentation."&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;}}

===Stage One===
The initial stage of glass disease occurs when moisture causes alkali to be leached out of the glass. This becomes apparent when [[hygroscopic]] alkali deposits on the glass give it a cloudy or hazy appearance.&lt;ref name= "Oakley"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/article/crizzling |title=Crizzling |author= |date=April 26, 2012 |work= |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This may occur within as little as five to 10 years of the glass's manufacturing. 
The glass may feel slippery or slimy&lt;ref name="Laidman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laidman|first1=Jenni |title=Seeking cures for glass disease |work=The Blade|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/frontpage/2002/05/13/Seeking-cures-for-glass-disease.html|accessdate=20 April 2018|date=May 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
and tiny droplets, or ''weeping'', may be seen in high humidity (above 55%).&lt;ref name= "Koob"/&gt; 
The hydrated alkali can form fine crystals on the surface of the glass in low relative humidity (below 40%).&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;

At this stage, it may be possible to gently wash the glass and remove the surface alkali.&lt;ref name= "Koob"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koob |first=Stephen |title=Conservation and Care of Glass Objects |publisher=Archetype Publications |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=1-904982-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This will help to stabilize the glass by reducing the surface pH, and by removing dust, soiling, and hygroscopic components that attract further moisture.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;

===Stage Two===
If alkali builds up due to ion exchange, and remains on the surface of the glass, the decay process will accelerate. The presence of sodium or potassium ions in the alkali build up will increase the pH on the surface of the glass, causing it to become basic. This will dissolve silica from the glass as well as releasing more alkali ions.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Oakley" /&gt;

The haziness seen on the glass may not disappear entirely when washed and dried. When examined closely at an angle with a low light, fine cracks like tiny silvery lines or shimmering rays, may be visible.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt; A microscope can confirm the presence of cracks. The cracks are caused by the loss of alkali, which leaves microscopic gaps in the structure of the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

===Stage Three===
As higher amounts of alkali leach from the glass cracks are likely to become deeper. ''Crizzling'' is a distinctive network of fine cracks in the glass which is visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brill|first1=Robert H.|title=Crizzling – a problem in glass conservation|journal=Journal of  Glass Studies|date=1975|volume=20|pages=121–131.|url=https://www.cmog.org/sites/default/files/collections/34/348E74A3-0852-4509-8F50-B4BC45EBD363.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, the crazing can gain a more uniform appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;  However, crizzling may not be uniform due to the creation of micro-climates on the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

===Stage Four===
Distinct cracks may appear on the surface of the glass, and surface material may flake or chip, a process referred to as ''spalling.''&lt;ref name="Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

===Stage Five===

In the most severe stage of deterioration, the structural integrity of the glass has been lost and the glass may  separate into pieces.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

==Prevalence==
A survey of glass objects at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, in 1992, found that more than 1 in 10 objects in the collection were affected by crizzling, ranging from 16th century Venetian to 20th century Scandinavian glass.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Fi|last2=Oakley|first2=Victoria|title=In pursuit of a clear answer: An Exhibition Road partnership|journal=Conservation Journal|date=2005|issue=50|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-50/in-pursuit-of-a-clear-answer-an-exhibition-road-partnership/|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Venetian glass is particularly susceptible because artisans minimized the use of lime, to make the glass as clear as possible.  
The works of modern glassmakers who experiment with their glass formulas, such as [[Ettore Sottsass]], can also be at high risk for damage.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;

Museums such as the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] may find glass disease an issue of great importance because many of the Native American cultural materials in their collections incorporate [[glass beads]].&lt;ref name="O'Hern"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Hern|first1=Robin |last2=McHugh |first2=Kelly |title=Red, Blue, and Wound all over: Evaluating Condition Change and Cleaning of  Glass  Disease on Beads|journal=Objects Specialty Group Postprints|date=2014|volume=Twenty-One|pages=205-228 |url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/osg-postprints/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/03/osg021-09.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McHugh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohern |first1=Robin |last2=McHugh |first2=Kelly |title=Deterioration and Conservation of Unstable Glass Beads  on Native American Objects|journal=The Bead Forum|date=2013|volume=63 |url=https://beadresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/Repeating_Material/The_Bead_Forum_Archive/The-Bead-Forum-Issue-63-Autumn-2013.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Small ornamental glass beads were often made cheaply, using recipes with a high flux to silica ratio. This makes them more susceptible to glass disease.  Blues, reds, and black are often affected by glass disease. The combination of glass beads with other materials (cordage, fabric, leather, metal, bone, surface colorants, ceremonial substances, and kaolin) complicates deterioration and conservation of ethnographic objects.&lt;ref name="Lovell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovell|first1=Adam|title=GLASS BEAD DETERIORATION OF ETHNOGRAPHIC  OBJECTS: IDENTIFICATION, PREVENTION, AND  TREATMENT|date=July 18, 2006|publisher=John F. Kennedy University|location=Pleasant Hill, CA|url=http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Glass_Bead_Deterioration.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
In the earliest stage of glass disease, it may be possible to wash the glass to remove the surface alkali. The Corning Museum of Glass recommends washing with tap water (tepid, not hot&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;) and a mild (non-ionic&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;) conservation detergent. This should be  followed by rinsing with de-ionized or distilled water, and careful drying to remove moisture. Careful washing can remove surface deposits, restore the appearance of clearness to the glass, and help to slow further deterioration.&lt;ref name="Washing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Washing Glass|url=https://blog.cmog.org/2011/12/09/washing-glass/|website=Corning Museum of Glass|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Roy|last1=Newton|first2=Sandra|last2=Davison |title=Conservation of glass|date=1996|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=0750624485|pages=207-209}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ethanol]] has also been suggested for cleaning, particularly for glass beads, depending on the surrounding materials that may be affected.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;

Once more serious damage has occurred, it cannot be reversed.  Climate control of humidity and temperature is a possible intervention.  Because crizzling results from the reaction of components of the glass with water vapour, controlling humidity and temperature can slow its occurrence.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; At the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], items in the collection are kept at stable levels of relative humidity, between 40 and 55 percent.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt; 
Fans may be used within a case to encourage the movement of air and minimize adsorption of moisture on the glass surface. Deterioration is more likely to occur in areas with restricted air-flow which allow moisture to remain on the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt; Chemical methods for retarding corrosion rates and stabilizing surfaces are being investigated.&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt; 

When a composite object contains a variety of materials, one of which is sick glass, the considerations involved in conserving and displaying the object become more complicated. For example, the [[British Museum]] chose to conserve and display a Siberian shamanic apron made of leather, glass and other materials. They weighed the likelihood that it would decay more quickly if shown against the desirability of making a unique object visible and the inevitability of its eventual degradation. "Its conservation and display ensures that access to this beautiful and unique object is maximized before the pale yellow beads, which are intrinsic to the object, are inevitably lost beyond repair."&lt;ref name="Swift"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swift|first1=Rachel|last2=Meek|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Rode|first3=Nicole|last4=Komlosy|first4=Anouska|title=A radioactive shamanic apron with glass disease|journal=The British Museum Technical Research Bulletin|date=2012|volume=6|pages=25-32|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/BMTRB_6_Swift-et-al.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glass recycling''' is the processing of [[waste]] [[glass]] into usable products. Glass waste should be separated by chemical composition, and then, depending on the end use and local processing capabilities, might also have to be separated into different colors.  Many recyclers collect different colors of glass separately since glass retains its color after [[recycling]]. The most common types used for consumer containers are colorless glass, green glass, and brown or amber glass. Glass is ideal for recycling since none of the material is degraded by normal use.

Glass makes up a large component of household and [[industrial waste]] due to its weight and density. The glass component in [[municipal waste]] is usually made up of [[bottle]]s, broken [[glassware]], [[light bulb]]s and other items. Adding to this waste is that many manual methods of creating glass objects have a defect rate of around forty percent. Glass recycling uses less energy than manufacturing glass from sand, lime and soda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Case history: The truth about recycling|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9249262?story_id=9249262|publisher=The Economist|access-date=7 May 2012|date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Glass that is crushed and ready to be remelted is called '''cullet'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass, Common Wastes &amp; Materials |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/glass.htm|publisher=US EPA|access-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many collection points have separate bins for clear, green and amber. Glass reprocessors that intend to make glass containers require separation by color, because glass tends to retain its color after recycling.  If the recycled glass is intended for other products, or if the glass reprocessor uses newer optical sorting equipment, separation by color at the collection point may not be required. Heat-resistant glass like [[Pyrex]] or [[borosilicate glass]] should not be disposed of in the glass container because even a small piece of such material will alter the viscosity of the fluid in the [[furnace]] at remelt.

==Recycling into glass containers==
When glass is used for new container manufacturing, it is virtually infinitely recyclable. The processing and use of recycled glass in manufacturing conserves raw materials, and reduces energy consumption.  That which is not recycled, but crushed, reduces the volume of waste sent to [[landfill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Standards]] Institute (2005) PAS 101, Recovered container glass, Specification for quality and guidance for good practice in collection&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mnn/&gt;

==Recycling into other products==
The use of the recycled glass as aggregate in [[concrete]] has become popular in modern times, with large scale research being carried out at Columbia University in New York. This greatly enhances the aesthetic appeal of the concrete. Recent research findings have shown that concrete made with recycled glass aggregates have shown better long term strength and better thermal insulation due to the thermal properties of the glass aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Poutos, A.M. Alani, P.J. Walden, C.M. Sangha. (2008). Relative temperature changes within concrete made with recycled glass aggregate. Construction and Building Materials, Volume 22, Issue 4, Pages 557-565.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]], a mix of colors crushed to a small size, is substituted for pea gravel or crushed rock in many construction and utility projects, saving municipalities like the City of [[Tumwater, Washington]] [[Public Works]], thousands of dollars (depending on the size of the project). Glass aggregate is not sharp to handle.  In many cases, the state Department of Transportation has specifications for use, size and percentage of quantity for use.  Common applications are as pipe bedding—placed around sewer, storm water or drinking water pipes to transfer weight from the surface and protect the pipe.  Another common use would be as fill to bring the level of a concrete floor even with a foundation.

Other uses for recycled glass include:
*[[Fiberglass insulation]] products
*[[Ceramic]] {{Linktext|sanitary ware}} production
*As a [[Ceramic flux|flux]] in [[brick|brick manufacture]]
*[[Astroturf]]
*Agriculture and landscape applications, such as [[top dressing]], [[root|root zone]] material or [[bunker (golf)|golf bunker]] sand
*[[Recycled glass countertops]]
*As [[Sand filter|water filtration media]]
*[[Abrasives]]

Mixed waste streams may be collected from [[materials recovery facilities]] or [[mechanical biological treatment]] systems. Some facilities can sort out mixed waste streams into different colours using [[electro-optical sorting]] units.

==By country==
===Germany===
In 2004, Germany recycled 2,116,000 tons of glass. Reusable glass or plastic (PET) bottles are available for many drinks, especially beer and carbonated water as well as soft drinks (''Mehrwegflaschen''). The [[Container deposit legislation|deposit per bottle]] (''Pfand'') is €0.08-€0.15, compared to €0.25 for recyclable but not reusable plastic bottles. There is no deposit for glass bottles which do not get refilled.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Altglasleerung.JPG|thumb|right|Vehicle emptying a glass recycling container in Vienna]]
Glass collection points, known as ''bottle banks'' are very common near [[shopping centre]]s, at [[civic amenity site]]s and in local neighborhoods in the [[United Kingdom]]. The first bottle bank was introduced by Stanley Race [[CBE]], then president of the [[British Glass|Glass Manufacturers’ Federation]] and Ron England in [[Barnsley]] on 6 June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/6724099.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bottle bank celebrates birthday | date=2007-06-06 | accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development work was done by the DoE at Warren Springs laboratory, Stevenage, (now AERA at Harwell) and Nazeing Glass Works, [[Broxbourne]] to prove if a usable glass product could be made from over 90% recycled glass. It was found necessary to use magnets to remove unwanted metal closures in the mixture.

Bottle banks commonly stand beside collection points for other recyclable waste like [[paper]], [[metal]]s and [[plastic]]s. Local, municipal [[waste collector]]s usually have one central point for all types of waste in which large glass containers are located. There are now over 50,000 bottle banks in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKL0586716920070606|title=Big British bottle bank birthday|work=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 752,000 tons of glass are now recycled annually.&lt;ref name="UK"/&gt;

The waste recycling industry in the UK cannot consume all of the recycled container glass that will become available over the coming years, mainly due to the colour imbalance between that which is manufactured and that which is consumed. The UK imports much more green glass in the form of [[wine]] bottles than it uses, leading to a surplus amount for recycling.

The resulting surplus of green glass from imported bottles may be exported to producing countries, or used locally in the growing diversity of secondary end uses for recycled glass.&lt;ref&gt;British Standards Institute (2005) PAS 102, Specification for processed glass for selected secondary end markets&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}}, [[Cory Environmental]] were shipping glass cullet from the UK to [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsrecycle.com/materials/glass/news.jsp?story=6296 Cory shipping mixed glass to Portugal direct from Cornwall], www.letsrecycle.com. Retrieved 2006-11-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
Rates of recycling and methods of waste collection vary substantially across the United States because laws are written on the state or local level and large municipalities often have their own unique systems. Many cities do [[curbside recycling]], meaning they collect household recyclable waste on a weekly or bi-weekly basis that residents set out in special containers in front of their homes.

Apartment dwellers usually use shared containers that may be collected by the city or by private recycling companies which can have their own recycling rules.  In some cases, glass is specifically separated into its own container because broken glass is a hazard to the people who later manually sort the co-mingled recyclables.  Sorted recyclables are later sold to companies to be used in the manufacture of new products.

In 1971, the [[Oregon Bottle Bill|state of Oregon passed a law]] requiring buyers of carbonated beverages (such as beer and soda) to pay five cents per container (increased to ten cents in April 2017) as a deposit which would be refunded to anyone who returned the container for recycling. This law has since been copied in [[Bottle Bill|nine other states]] including New York and California. The abbreviations of states with deposit laws are printed on all qualifying bottles and cans. In states with these container deposit laws, most supermarkets automate the deposit refund process by providing [[Reverse vending machine|machines]] which will count containers as they are inserted and then print credit vouchers that can be redeemed at the store for the number of containers returned. Small glass bottles (mostly beer) are broken, one-by-one, inside these deposit refund machines as the bottles are inserted. A large, wheeled hopper (very roughly 1.5&amp;nbsp;m by 1.5&amp;nbsp;m by 0.5&amp;nbsp;m) inside the machine collects the broken glass until it can be emptied by an employee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35648">The '''history of calendars''', means that people creating and using methods for keeping track of days and larger divisions of time, covers a practice with ancient roots.

Archeologists have reconstructed methods of [[timekeeping]] that go back to prehistoric times at least as old as the [[Neolithic]]. The natural units for timekeeping used by most historical societies are the [[day]], the [[solar year]] and the [[lunation]].
[[Calendar]]s are explicit schemes used for timekeeping. The first historically attested and formulized calendars date to the [[Bronze Age]], dependent on the development of [[Bronze Age writing|writing]] in the [[Ancient Near East]]. The [[Sumerian calendar]] was the earliest, followed by the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]], [[Assyrian calendar|Assyrian]] and [[Elamite]] calendars.

A larger number of calendar systems of the ancient Near East appear in the [[Iron Age]] archaeological record, based on the Assyrian and [[Babylonian calendar]]s. This includes the calendar of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], which in turn gave rise to the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] as well as the [[Hebrew calendar]].

Calendars in antiquity were usually [[lunisolar]], depending on the introduction of [[intercalary month]]s to align the solar and the lunar years. This was mostly based on observation, but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically, as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd-century [[Coligny calendar]]. Nevertheless, the Roman calendar contained very ancient remnants of a pre-Etruscan 10-month solar year.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in the Etruscan period" in [http://global.britannica.com/topic/Roman-religion Roman religion] in Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman calendar was reformed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BCE. The [[Julian calendar]] was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years.
This created a dissociation of the calendar [[month]] from the [[lunation]].

In the 11th century in [[Iran|Persia]], a calendar reform led by [[Omar Khayyam|Khayyam]] was announced in 1079, when the length of the year was measured as 365.24219858156 days.&lt;ref name="Khayyam biography"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html|title=Khayyam biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.&lt;ref name="Khayyam biography"/&gt;

The [[Gregorian calendar]] was introduced as a refinement of the Julian calendar in 1582, and is today in worldwide use as the ''de facto'' calendar for secular purposes.

==Etymology==
The term ''calendar'' itself is taken from the ''[[calends]]'', the term for the first day of the month in the [[Roman calendar]], related to the verb ''calare'' "to call out", referring to the calling or the announcement that the new moon was just seen. Latin ''calendarium'' meant "account book, register", as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month.

The Latin term was adopted in [[Old French]] as ''calendier'' and from there in [[Middle English]] as ''calender'' by the 13th century. The spelling ''calendar'' is from [[Early Modern English]].

An alternative hypothesis connects "calendar" with [[Koledari]] in Slavic, pre-Christian tradition, which was later incorporated into Christmas. ''Kolo'' means "circle, cycle" and ''dar'' means "a gift".

==Prehistory==
A number of prehistoric structures have been proposed as having had the purpose of timekeeping (typically keeping track of the course of the [[solar year]]).
This includes many [[megalithic]] structures, and reconstructed arrangements going back far into the [[Neolithic]] period.

A ceramic artefact from Bulgaria, known as the [[Slatino furnace model]], has been pronounced by local archeologists and media to be the oldest known calendar representation, a claim not endorsed in mainstream views.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey D., 2000, Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity, London:Routledge p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[mesolithic]] arrangement of twelve pits and an arc found in [[Warren Field]], [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, dated to roughly 10,000 years ago, has been described as a [[lunar calendar]] and was dubbed the "world's oldest known calendar" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2013-07-scotland-lunar-calendar-stone-age-rethink.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809125949/http://phys.org/news/2013-07-scotland-lunar-calendar-stone-age-rethink.html|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vučedol culture#Oldest European calendar|Oldest European calendar]] is found near to [[Vukovar]] in modern-day Croatia. It is a ceramic vessel bearing inscribed ideograms of celestial objects.

==Ancient Near East==

The ancient [[Sumer]]ian calendar divided a year into 12 [[lunar month]]s of 29 or 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/mesopotamiancalander.htm|title=Mesopotamia, Calendar|publisher=International World History Project|website=History-world.org|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each month began with the sighting of a new moon. Sumerian months had no uniform name throughout Sumer because of the religious diversity.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/89368/calendar/60208/Babylonian-calendars|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|entry=Calendar|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in scribes and scholars referring to them as "the first month", "the fifth month" etc. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} To keep the lunar year of 354 days in step with the solar year of 365.242 days an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|extra month]] was added periodically, much like a [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] [[leap year]].&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There were no weeks in the Sumerian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1947|last=Yust|first=Walter|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|page=576|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: A New Survey of Universal Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holy days and time off from work were usually celebrated on the first, seventh and fifteenth of each month. In addition to these holy days, there were also feast days which varied from city to city.

==Antiquity==

===Babylonia and Persia===
{{further|Babylonian calendar|Zoroastrian calendar}}

Although the earliest evidence of Iranian calendrical traditions is from the [[second millennium BCE]], predating the appearance of the Iranian prophet [[Zoroaster]], the first fully preserved calendar is that of the [[Achaemenid]]s.  Throughout recorded history, [[Persian people|Persians]] have been keen on the idea and importance of having a [[calendar]]. They were among the first cultures to use a [[solar calendar]] and have long favoured a solar over [[lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] approaches. The sun has always been a symbol in [[Iranian culture]] and is closely related to the folklore regarding [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name=EI-C-i&gt;{{harv|Panaino|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old Persian calendar ====
Old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a [[360-day calendar]] based on the solar observation directly and modified for their beliefs. Days were not named. The months had two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months of 30 days were named for festivals or activities of the [[pastoral]] year. A 13th month was added every six years to keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons.

==== Zoroastrian calendar ====
{{main|Zoroastrian calendar}}
The first calendars based on [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] cosmology appeared in the later Achaemenid period (650 to 330 BCE). They evolved over the centuries, but month names changed little until now.

The unified [[Achaemenid Empire]] required a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised in [[Egypt]]ian tradition, with 12 months of 30 days, each dedicated to a [[yazata]] (Eyzad), and four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four days per month were dedicated to [[Ahura Mazda]] and seven were named after the six [[Amesha Spentas]]. Thirteen days were named after Fire, Water, Sun, Moon, [[Tiri, Estonia|Tiri]] and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, [[Sraosha]] (Soroush, yazata of prayer), [[Rashnu]] (the Judge), [[Fravashi]], [[Verethragna|Bahram]] (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and [[Vayu-Vata|Vata]], the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, [[Daena]] (yazata of religion and personified conscious), [[Ashi]] (yazata of fortune) and [[Arshtat]] (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to [[Asman]] (lord of sky or Heaven), [[Zam]] (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the 'Endless Light' of paradise).

==== Modifications by Parthians, Ardashir I, Hormizd I, Yazdgerd III ====
The [[Parthia]]ns (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BCE, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the [[Middle Persian]] names used by the [[Sassanians]]. For example, in Achaemenid times the modern Persian month 'Day' was called Dadvah (Creator), in Parthian it was Datush and the Sassanians named it Dadv/Dai (Dadar in Pahlavi).

When in April of AD 224 the Parthian dynasty fell and was replaced by the Sasanid, the new king, [[Ardashir I]], abolished the official Babylonian calendar and replaced it with the Zoroastrian.   This involved a correction to the places of the ''gahanbar'', which had slipped back in the seasons since they were fixed.   These were placed eight months later, as were the ''epagemonai'', the 'Gatha' or 'Gah' days after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name.   Other countries, such as the Armenians and Choresmians, did not accept the change.

==== The formation of the current Persian calendar in the 11th century ====

[[Toghril Beg]], the founder of the [[Seljuq dynasty]], had made Esfahan the capital of his domains and his grandson [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] was the ruler of that city from 1073. An invitation was sent to [[Khayyam]] from Malik-Shah and from his vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]] asking Khayyam to go to Esfahan to set up an Observatory there. Other leading astronomers were also brought to the Observatory in Esfahan and for 18 years Khayyam led the scientists and produced work of outstanding quality. During this time Khayyam led work on compiling astronomical tables and he also contributed to calendar reform in 1079.

Cowell quotes [[The Calcutta Review]] No 59:-
''When the Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, [[Omar Khayyam|Omar]] was one of the eight learned men employed to do it, the result was the Jalali era (so called from Jalal-ud-din, one of the king's names) - 'a computation of time,' says Gibbon, 'which surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style.'''

Khayyam measured the length of the year as 365.24219858156 days. Two comments on this result. Firstly it shows an incredible confidence to attempt to give the result to this degree of accuracy. We know now that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime. Secondly it is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Greece===
The Greeks, as early as the time of [[Homer]], appear to have been familiar with the division of the year into the twelve lunar months but no intercalary month ''Embolimos'' or day is then mentioned. Independent of the division of a month into days, it was divided into periods according to the increase and decrease of the moon. 
Thus, the first day or new moon was called ''Noumenia''. The month in which the year began, as well as the names of the months, differed among the states, and in some parts even no names existed for the months, as they were distinguished only numerically, as the first, second, third, fourth month, etc.

The [[Attic calendar|ancient Athenian calendar]] was a [[lunisolar]] calendar with 354-day years, consisting of twelve months of alternating length of 29 or 30 days. To keep the calendar in line with the solar year of 365.242 days, an extra, intercalary month was added in every other year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Athenian months were called Hekatombion, Metageitnion, Boedromion, Pyanepsion, Maimakterion, Poseidon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, Elaphebolion, Munychion, Thargelion, and Skirophorion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ginzel: Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie |year=1911 |volume=2 |publisher=F.K. |location=Germany |pages= 335–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intercalary month usually came after Poseidon, and was called second Poseidon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In addition to their regular, "festival" calendar, the Athenians maintained a second, political calendar . This "conciliar" calendar divided the year into "[[prytanies]]", one for each of the "[[phylai]]", the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varied over time. Until 307 BC, there were 10 phylai. After that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were about the same length in the 4th century BC, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the [[Julian calendar]].

The table of Greek Olympiads, following the four-year cycles between the [[Olympic Games]] from 1 July 776 BC, continued until the end of the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Davies267"&gt;Davies, p 267&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonian Era of Nabonassar, beginning on 26 February 747 BC, was used by the Greeks of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It was later known in the Middle Ages from the works of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

===Hellenistic period===
{{further|Roman calendar}}

The Greek calendars were greatly diversified by the [[Hellenistic period]], with separate traditions in every Greek state.
Of primary importance for the reconstruction of the regional Greek calendars is the calendar of [[Delphi]], because of the numerous documents found there recording the manumission of slaves, many of which are dated both in the Delphian and in a regional calendar.

The Macedonian Era of the Seleucids, which began with the conquest of [[Babylon]] by [[Seleucus Nicator]] in 312 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It became widely used in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The [[Jews]] knew it as the "era of contracts", and used it in Europe until the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

The Roman Republican calendar numbered years based on the [[List of Roman consuls|sitting consuls]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; References to the year of consulship were used in both conversation and official records.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Romans from the same family often had the same ''praenomen'', which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish them, and there were two consuls at any one time, each of whom might sometimes hold the appointment more than once, meaning that it was (and is) necessary to be well educated in history to understand the references.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;  The Romans had an [[Nundinae|eight-day week]], with the market-day falling every eight days. It was called a ''nundinum'' or 'nine-day' in [[inclusive counting]].

Most of the regional [[Hindu calendar]]s are inherited  from a system standardized in classical [[Hindu astronomy]] 
as adopted via [[Indo-Greek]] transmission in the final centuries BCE, and  reformed by [[Gupta period|Gupta era]] astronomers such as [[Āryabhaṭa]] and [[Varahamihira|Varāhamihira]].

Before the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (before 770 BC), the Chinese Calendars were solar calendars.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In the so-called  [[Wu Xing|five-phase]] calendar, the year consists of 10 months and a transition, each month being 36 days long, and the transitions 5 or 6 days. 
During the [[Warring States period]] (~475-220 BC), the primitive lunisolar calendars were established under the Zhou Dynasty, known as the six ancient calendars ({{zh|t=古六曆|s=古六历}}). The months of these calendars begin on the day with the new moon, with 12 or 13 months (lunations) in a year. The intercalary month is placed at the end of the year. In [[Qin China]], the Qin calendar ({{zh|t=秦曆|s=秦历}}) was introduced. It follows the rules of Zhuanxu's calendar, but the months order follows the Xia's calendar.

Time keeping was important to Vedic rituals, and ''Jyotisha'' was the Vedic era field of tracking and predicting the movements of astronomical bodies in order to keep time, in order to fix the day and time of these rituals.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullerhaslp210"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|title=A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHCe48QSZaUC|year=1860|publisher=Williams and Norgate|pages=210–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was one of the six ancient [[Vedanga]]s, or ancillary science connected with the [[Vedas]] – the scriptures of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit–English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Jyotisha" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 326–327&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu calendar, sometimes referred to as ''Panchanga'', is a collective term for the various [[lunisolar calendar]]s traditionally used in [[Hinduism]]. They adopt a similar underlying concept for timekeeping, but differ in their relative emphasis to moon cycle or the sun cycle, the names of months and when they consider the New Year to start.&lt;ref name=richmond80&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time Measurement and Calendar Construction|publisher= Brill Archive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwEVAAAAIAAJ| accessdate=2011-09-18| year= 1956|author= B.

The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, and remains in use by the [[Hindu]]s in India and Nepal particularly to set the Hindu festival dates. Early Buddhist and Jain communities of India adopted the ancient Hindu calendar, later Vikrami calendar and then local [[Buddhist calendar]]s. Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] festivals continue to be scheduled according to a lunar system in the luni-solar calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anita Ganeri|title=Buddhist Festivals Through the Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-EawToG-6YC&amp;pg=PT11|year=2003|publisher=BRB|isbn=978-1-58340-375-4|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3gAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-392-6|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

===Roman Empire===
{{main|Julian calendar}}
The old Roman year had 304 days divided into 10 months, beginning with [[Martius (month)|March]]. However the ancient historian Livy gave credit to the second early Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]] for devising a calendar of 12 months. The extra months ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' had been invented, supposedly by Numa Pompilius, as stop-gaps.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Julius Caesar realized that the system had become inoperable, so he effected drastic changes in the year of his third consulship.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The [[New Year]] in 709 AUC &lt;!--Book typo as 707 AUC--&gt; began on 1 January and ran over 365 days until 31 December.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Further adjustments were made under Augustus, who introduced the concept of the "leap year" in 757 AUC (AD 4){{Fix|text=conversion is 1 year out}}.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The resultant [[Julian calendar]] remained in almost universal use in Europe until 1582,&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; and in some countries until as late as the twentieth century.

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] introduced the ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' epoch, assuming a foundation of Rome in 753 BC. The system remained in use during the early Middle Ages until the widespread adoption of the [[Dionysian era]] in the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian period]].

In the Roman Empire, the AUC year could be used alongside the consular year, so that the consulship of [[Quintus Fufius Calenus]] and [[Publius Vatinius]] could be determined as 707 AUC (or 47 BC), the third consulship of [[Julius Caesar|Caius Julius Caesar]], with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], as 708 AUC (or 46 BC), and the fourth consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar as 709 AUC (or 45 BC).&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

The seven-day [[week]] has a tradition reaching back to the ancient Near East, but the introduction of the "planetary week" which remains in modern use dates to the Roman Empire period (see also [[names of the days of the week]]).

===Christian Europe===

{{main|Anno Domini}}
For the first six centuries since the birth of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], European countries used various local systems to count years, most usually [[regnal year]]s, modeled on the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In some cases, [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]] was also used. In the 6th century, the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] devised the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' system, dating from the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In the 8th century, the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] used another [[Latin]] term, "''ante uero incarnationis dominicae tempus''" ("the time before the Lord's true incarnation", equivalent to the [[English language|English]] "before Christ"), to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum: Liber Primus |language=Latin | author=[[Bede]] |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml|publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], even Popes continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]], and usage of AD only gradually became common in Europe from the 11th to the 14th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In 1267, the medieval scientist [[Roger Bacon]] stated the times of full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (''horae'', ''minuta'', ''secunda'', ''tertia'', and ''quarta'') after noon on specified calendar dates.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Opus Majus]] of Roger Bacon'', tr. Robert Belle Burke (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1928, reprinted 2000) table facing page 231, {{ISBN|978-1-85506-856-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a third for {{frac|1|60}} of a second remains in some languages, for example [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ثالثة, the modern second is further divided [[decimal]]ly.

Rival [[calendar era]]s to ''Anno Domini'' remained in use in Christian Europe.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In Spain, the "Era of the Caesars" was dated from Octavian's conquest of Iberia in 39 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It was adopted by the [[Visigoths]] and remained in use in [[Catalonia]] until 1180, [[Crown of Castile|Castille]] until 1382 and Portugal until 1415.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

For chronological purposes, the flaw of the Anno Domini system was that dates have to be reckoned backwards or forwards according as they are BC or AD. According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "in an ideally perfect system all events would be reckoned in one sequence. The difficulty was to find a starting point whence to reckon, for the beginnings of history in which this should naturally be placed are those of which chronologically we know least."{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For both Christians and [[Jews]], the prime historical date was the Year of Creation, or ''[[Annus Mundi]]''.&lt;ref name="Davies268"&gt;Davies, p 268&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] fixed the date of Creation at 5509 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt; This remained the basis of the ecclesiastical calendar in the [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]] and [[Russian Orthodox]] world until modern times.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt; The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] fixed on 5500 BC. Later, the [[Church of England]], under [[Archbishop Ussher]] in 1650, would pick 4004 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt;

===Bulgar calendar===
The [[Bulgar calendar]] was a calendar system used by the [[Bulgars]], a seminomadic people, originally from Central Asia, who from the 2nd century onwards dwelled in the Eurasian steppes north of the Caucasus and around the banks of river Volga. In 681 part of the Bulgars settled in the Balkan peninsula and established Bulgaria. The main source of information used for reconstruction of the Bulgar calendar is a short 15th century transcript, which contains 10 pairs of calendar terms, the same dating system being found in a marginal note of a manuscript from the 10th c. According to the reconstructed calendar, the Bulgars used a 12-year cyclic calendar similar to the one adopted by Turkic peoples from the [[Chinese calendar]], with names and numbers that are deciphered as in Bulgar language.

===Islamic calendar===
The [[Islamic calendar]] is based on the prohibition of intercalation (''[[nasi']]'') by [[Muhammad]], in Islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on  9 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] AH 10 (Julian date: 6 March 632). This resulted in an observationally based lunar calendar shifting relative to the seasons of the solar year.

===Icelandic calendar===
{{main|Icelandic calendar}}
In medieval Iceland, a calendar was introduced in the 10th century. While the ancient [[Germanic calendar]]s were based on lunar months, the new Icelandic calendar introduced  a purely solar reckoning, with a year having a fixed number of weeks (52 weeks or 364 days). This necessitated the introduction of "leap weeks" instead of the Julian leap days.

===Indo-Islamic calendars===
{{See also|Fasli calendar}} 
During the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] asked his royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fasholi shan'' (harvest calendar).&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=banglapedia&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amartya Sen]], Akbar's official calendar "Tarikh-ilahi" with the zero year of 1556 CE was a blend of pre-existing Hindu and Islamic calendars. It was not used much in India outside of Akbar's Mughal court, and after his death the calendar he launched was abandoned. However, adds Sen, there are traces of the "Tarikh-ilahi" that survive in the Bengali calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amartya Sen|title=The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bKvAAAAQBAJ|year=2005|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-10583-9|pages=319–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th century Hindu king [[Shashanka]].&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=meghna&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics |last=Guhathakurta |first=Meghna  |last2=Schendel |first2=Willem van  |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780822353188 |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nitish K.

==Mesoamerica==
{{main|Mayan calendar}}
Of all the ancient calendar systems, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and other [[Mesoamerican]] systems are the most complex. The [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n calendar had 2 years, the 260-day Sacred Round, or ''tzolkin'', and the 365-day Vague Year, or ''haab''.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html |title=Maya civilization |accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher=Civilization.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305074426/http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html |archivedate=5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MAYA-g-log-cal-D20-Ajaw.png|thumb|right|200px|A modern pictogram of the Mayan god [[Kinich Ahau|Ahau]], after which the 20th day of the ''tzolkin'' cycle was named]]
The Sacred Round of 260 days is composed of two smaller cycles: the numbers 1 through 13, coupled with 20 different day names: Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Eiznab, Cauac, and Ahau. The Sacred Round was used to determine important activities related to the gods and humans: name individuals, predict the future, decide on auspicious dates for battles, marriages, and so on.&lt;ref name="maya"/&gt;

The two cycles of 13 and 20 intermesh and are repeated without interruption: the cycle would begin with 1 Imix, then 2 Ik, then 3 Akbal and so on until the number 13 was reached, at which point the number cycle was restarted so 13 Ben would be followed by 1 Ix, 2 Men and so on. This time Imix would be numbered 8. The cycle ended after 260 days, with the last day being 13 Ahau.&lt;ref name="maya" /&gt;

The Vague Year of 365 days is similar to our [[Gregorian calendar|modern calendar]], consisting of 18 months of 20 days each, with an unlucky five-day period at the end. The Vague Year had to do primarily with the seasons and agriculture, and was based on the solar cycle. The 18 Maya months are known, in order, as: Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xuc, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Maun, Pax, Kayab and Cumku. The unlucky five-day period was known as [[Uayeb]], and was considered a time which could hold danger, death and bad luck.&lt;ref name="maya" /&gt;

The Vague Year began with the month of Pop. The Maya 20-day month always begins with the seating of the month, followed by days numbered 1 to 19, then the seating of the following month, and so on. This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next. The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, all the way through to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of Uo, written as 0 Uo, then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on. These two cycles coincided every 52 years. The 52-year period of time was called a "bundle" and was similar to a modern-day century.&lt;ref name="maya"/&gt;

==Modern calendars==
{{further|List of calendars|Calendar reform}}
While the [[Gregorian calendar]] is  now in worldwide use for secular purposes, various medieval or ancient calendars remain in regional use for religious or social purposes, including the [[Julian calendar]], the [[Hebrew calendar]], the [[Islamic calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s, the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] etc.

There are also various modern calendars that see limited use, either created for the use of [[new religious movement]]s or reformed versions of older religious calendars, or calendars introduced by regionalist or nationalist movements.

Working with PanCam (a high-resolution panoramic camera), ISEM will aid in the selection of potential targets, especially water-bearing minerals, for close-up investigations and drilling sites.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt;

ISEM could detect, if present, [[organic compound]]s, including evolving trace gases such as hydrocarbons like [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane in the Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt; 

==Objectives==

The stated science objectives of ISEM are: &lt;ref name=IKI&gt;[http://www.planetary-department-iki.ru/projects/future/isem/ISEM_Overview.pdf ISEM (Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars) - Overview] (PDF). [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Geological investigation and study a composition of Martian soils in the uppermost few millimeters of the surface.
* Characterisation of the composition of surface materials, discriminating between various classes of silicates, oxides, hydrated minerals and carbonates.
* Identification and mapping of the distribution of aqueous alteration products on Mars.
* Real-­‐time assessment of surface composition in selected areas, in support of identifying and selection of the most promising drilling sites. 
* Studies of variations of the atmospheric dust properties and of the atmospheric gaseous composition. 

==Development==

ISEM is a derivative of the Lunar Infrared Spectrometer (LIS) being developed by the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI) in Moscow for the planned [[Luna-25]] and [[Luna-27]] Russian landers.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt; Collaborating institutions include: [[Moscow State University]], Main Astrophysical Observatory, [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], the National Research Institute for Physicotechnical and Radio Engineering Measurements (VNIIFTRI) in Russia, [[Moscow State University]], and the [[Aberystwyth University]] in United Kingdom. The science team includes researchers from Russia, France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt;

The instrument has been designed to specifically detect carbonates, oxalates, borates, [[nitrates]], NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-bearing minerals, that are good indicators of past [[Planetary habitability|habitable conditions]] such as aqueous minerals. It is also designed to detect [[organic compounds]], including [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) and those containing [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] C-H molecules.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt; In addition, ISEM can also detect seasonal frost, if present at the landing site, and it can be used to analse the bore hole excavated by the ExoMars drill, if the rover backs away some distance.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2017'/&gt;

[[Image:Institute of BioPhysics Beijing.jpg|thumb|right|350px| Front entrance, Institute of Biophysics, Beijing]]
The '''Institute of Biophysics''', [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (), focuses on [[biophysics|biophysically]] oriented basic research in the life sciences. It was established in 1958, from the former Beijing Experimental Biology Institute founded in 1957. Professor Shizhang Bei, a biologist and member of , founded the Institute in 1958. Professor Tao Xu is the current Director-General.

The main research focus of the Institute is on the fields of protein science and brain &amp; [[cognitive science]]s. The Institute has two National Key Laboratories—"The National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules" and "The State Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences". Establishment of the National Laboratory of Protein Science was given approval by China's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in December 2006. Research in the field of protein science emphasizes the following areas: 3D-structure and function of proteins, bio-membranes and [[membrane protein]]s, protein translation and [[protein folding|folding]], protein interaction networks, the molecular basis of infection and immunity, the molecular basis of sensation and cognition, protein and peptide drugs, and new techniques and methods in protein science research. Research areas in brain and cognitive sciences include neural processes and mechanisms in complex cognition, expression of [[visual perception]] and attention, neural mechanisms of perceptional [[information processing]], and dysfunction in brain cognition.

The Institute has received National Natural Science Foundation, '973', '863',  'Knowledge Innovation Program' and other major [[Research funding|research grants]], supporting outstanding research in a range of areas. The achievements of the Institute in terms of awards, publications, patents, and applied research maintain the Institute at the highest level nationally, and it has worldwide recognition for research in the [[life sciences]]. Among other connections, since 2008 it has hosted an intensive course in [[macromolecular crystallography]] as a resource closely modeled on the course at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] on Long Island, USA, and involving both US and Chinese instructors.

The Biophysical Society of China is affiliated with the Institute. It takes responsibility for editing two core national natural science journals, namely Progress in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics and Acta Biophysica Sinica. Of these, Progress in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics is indexed in the SCI－E database. The institute has a library (1100 square meters) with 28,000 books, more than 33,000 journals, and 11 databases. Library users can use the internet to access about 2,500 foreign e-journals.

The Institute has a research team, with about 400 staff members, 500 [[Graduate school|graduate students]] and 60 visiting scholars and post-docs. Within the scientific staff, there are 89 Principal Investigators and three technical specialists, of whom 14 are members of the Chinese [[Academy of Sciences]]. 28 have received awards from the "100 Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" and 30 have received the "National Outstanding Young Scientists Award".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibp.ac.cn/kydw/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Instituto Butantan''' (in modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], '''Instituto Butantã'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butantan ou Butantã? Instituto Butantã ou Butantan?|url = http://dicionarioegramatica.com.br/2015/12/12/butantan-ou-butanta-instituto-butanta-ou-butantan/|website = DicionarioeGramatica.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, {{IPA-pt|ĩʃtʃiˈtutu butɐ̃ˈtɐ̃|pron}}) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[biologic medical product|biologic]] research center located in Butantã, in the western part of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. '''Instituto Butantan''' is a public institution affiliated with the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] State Secretariat of [[Health]] and considered one of the major scientific centers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Butantan Institute: History and Future Perspectives|journal = PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|date = 2014-07-03|issn = 1935-2727|pmc = 4080994|pmid = 24992341|volume = 8|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002862|first = Marcelo|last = De Franco|first2 = Jorge|last2 = Kalil}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Butantan''' is the largest immunobiologicals and biopharmaceuticals producer in Latin America (and one of the largest in the world). It is world-renowned for its collection of venomous snakes, as well as those of venomous lizards, [[spider]]s, [[insect]]s and [[scorpion]]s. By extracting the reptiles' and insects' venoms, the Institute develops antivenoms and medicines against many diseases, which include tuberculosis, rabies, tetanus and diphtheria.

== History ==
The Institute was founded by the Brazilian [[physician]] and biomedical scientist [[Vital Brazil]] in 1901, according to [[Pasteur Institute]] paradigm, i.e., by combining in the same institution [[medical research]], the transfer of the results to society as health products, and self-financing through this later activity. Its foundation was a reaction to the outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in the city of [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  It is internationally renowned for its research on [[venom (poison)|venomous]] animals; it was visited by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1912. It is also a state-supported producer of [[vaccine]]s against many [[infectious diseases]], such as [[rabies]], [[hepatitis]], [[botulism]], [[tetanus]], [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]] and [[tuberculosis]], as well as polyvalent and monovalent [[antivenom]]s against the bites of [[snakes]], [[lizards]], [[bees]], [[scorpion]]s and [[spider]]s (which, historically were first developed in the beginning of the 20th century by Dr. Vital Brazil and his coworkers).  Among the distinguished scientists at the institute were biochemists [[Karl Slotta]] and [[Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat]], pioneers in the study of progesterone, estriol, and medical use of venom, from 1935 to 1948.

A fire in 2010 destroyed the collection facility, which maintained one of the largest collections of venomous animals in the world, comprising around 80,000 snake specimens, and an estimated 450,000 spiders and scorpions.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The name of the institute comes from "''Butantã''",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a district in the west zone of São Paulo. "''Butantã''" itself is a [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] word&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; meaning "''crushed soil''".

== Education and research ==

The Institute develops basic and applied biomedical research in many areas, including [[molecular biology]], [[immunology]] and [[epidemiology]] and has a graduate research training program in collaboration with other institutions, in the areas of biotechnology and [[infectology]]. Besides its research laboratories, production units and specialized library, it operates an animal breeding center for providing subjects for research and production of sera.  The Instituto Butantan also operate the "Hospital Vital Brazil", a specialist hospital that offers free treatment for poisonous animal stings and bites. The institute also accepts donations of serpents, arthropods and other animals captured by the public and by a network of collaborating centers and individuals.

The following research laboratories are part of the Butantan Institute:
* [[Arthropod]]s
* [[Herpetology]]
* [[Cellular biology]]
* [[Immunogenetics]]
* [[Immunopathology]]
* [[Virus|Viral]] [[Immunology]]
* [[Immunochemistry]]
* [[Genetics]]
* [[Dermatology]]
* [[Pathophysiology]]
* [[Biochemistry]] and [[Biophysics]]
* [[Pharmacology]]
* [[Microbiology]]
* [[Parasitology]]
* [[Biopharmaceutical]]s
* Applied [[Toxinology]]
* [[Biotechnology]] Center

Important Brazilian scientists who have worked in the Butantan Institute are: [[Vital Brazil]], [[Afrânio Pompílio Gastos do Amaral]], [[Isaias Raw]], [[Samuel Pessoa]], [[Willy Beçak]]. The Institute has strong collaborative ties with the [[Pasteur Institute]], [[Paris]], France, and with the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], [[Rio de Janeiro]].

== Production ==
The Butantan Institute is the largest producer in [[Latin America]] (and one of the largest in the world) of immunobiologicals and biopharmaceuticals. In 2001 it produced ca. {{Nowrap|110 million}} doses of vaccines and {{Nowrap|300 thousand}} vials of hyperimmune sera. The institute is responsible for the production of 90% of the vaccines used in Brazil.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  The institute contains a venom farm where researchers milk around a thousand snakes for their [[venom]] which is used to make [[antivenom]]s and for medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eveleigh|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production units manufacture the following bioproducts:

=== Hyperimmune sera and antivenoms ===
* Anti-[[Bothrops|Bothropic]]

== Public activities ==
The Butantan Institute is one of the major touristic and educational attractions in a vast park area in the city section of [[Butantã (district of São Paulo)|Butantã]] in São Paulo. It has a [[serpentarium]], a historical museum, a biological museum, and a museum of microbiology. The venom farm is a major attraction and visitors can see the snakes housed in representations of their natural environments. The park also contains rare tree types.

== Butantan Foundation ==
The '''Fundação Butantan''' is a non-profit corporation established in 1984 to use more efficiently public funds and capital investments made by the Ministry of Health for the production of immunobiologicals. The Foundation reinvests part of the proceeds to build new facilities for new products. Part of the funds are used in the Institute for research and cultural activities, as well as to provide its workers with meals and basic food supplies.

== 2010 fire ==
On May 15, 2010, a fire almost burned down the laboratory and destroyed the Institute's entire collection of snake specimens (approximately 85,000 specimens preserved with [[formaldehyde]] and stored in 70% [[ethanol]]) and ca. 450,000–500,000 specimens of scorpions and spiders (also stored in ethanol).&lt;ref name="number specimens destroyed"/&gt; It was one of the largest collections of snakes in the world.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Over 90 years of research were lost.

The fire started at {{Nowrap|7:08 am}} and was brought under control by a crew of 50 firemen an hour and a half later.&lt;ref name="fire put out"/&gt;  News reports have claimed that the facility was not prepared for a fire, not having a [[fire alarm]] or [[fire sprinkler system|sprinkler system]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  Police are investigating the fire which has been described by curator Francisco Franco as "a loss for humanity".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  None of the live animals or people at the institute was harmed by the fire.&lt;ref name="live animals unharmed"/&gt;

The '''''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''''' refers to two different revisions of a Bible encyclopedia. The first version was published under the general editorship of the [[fundamentalist]] [[James Orr (theologian)|James Orr (1844–1913)]], among other objectives to counteract the impact of [[higher criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;'' The religious bodies of America'' Frederick Emanuel Mayer, Arthur Carl Piepkorn – 1961 "5 ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' was published under the general editorship of James Orr (Chicago: Howard-Severance Co., 1915) to counteract the impact of higher criticism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The original encyclopedia was published by the Howard-Severance Co., Chicago, in 1915. It is in the public domain and can be found freely available at various sites. A revised version, edited by [[Geoffrey W. Bromiley]], was published by [[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] in 1989. It contains articles by nearly 200 [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] scholars about [[archaeological]] discoveries, the language and literature of Bible lands, customs, family life, occupations, and the historical and religious environments of Bible people.

== Reception ==
Writing in a 1984 book review for ''[[Churchman (journal)|The Churchman]]'', Stephen Motyer said the conservatism of the ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' "is that of broad, main-line [[evangelicalism]], although it seems to be slightly more conservative than the work it replaces". He also says it makes "dogmatic use of the Bible", and adds: "sometimes it seems to go over the top somewhat". However, he concludes "The criticisms I have made do not, to my mind, qualify the great solid worth of this production....I...seriously commend this encyclopedia..."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Motyer, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/churchman/098-01_062.pdf Book Reviews – ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributors ==
This list of contributors is taken from the Revised Edition. An asterisk (*) indicates that the person contributed an article to the 1915 edition that is still in the Revised Edition. New articles far outnumber older revised articles in the revised version. For some reason many contributors are listed more than once in the revised version. It is likely that the multiple listings is because of the scholar being at different institutions during the long process of revision. A scholar may have been employed at one school when they submitted one article in the beginning of the revision process and by the end they were employed at another school when they submitted their last article. The subject of the revision process and the rationale for retaining and updating some articles from the 1915 version is discussed in the preface and introduction of the revised version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4553">A '''laticifer''' is a type of elongated secretory cell found in the [[leaf|leaves]] and/or stems of [[plant]]s that produce [[latex]] and [[rubber]] as [[secondary metabolites]]. Laticifers may be divided into:
*'''Articulated laticifers''', i.e., composed of a series of cells joined together, or 
*'''Non-articulated laticifers''', consisting of one long [[coenocyte|coenocytic]] cell.

Non-articulated laticifers begin their growth from the [[meristematic]] tissue of the embryo, termed the laticifer initial, and can exhibit continual growth throughout the lifetime of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Mahlberg, P. G., and P. S. Sabharwal. 1968. Origin and early development of nonarticulated 
laticifers in embryos of ''Euphorbia marginata''. American Journal of Botany '''55''': 375-381.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rajeswari2014&gt;Rajeswari, B., S. P. Kumar, A. P. Rao, and P. S. S. V. Khan. 2014. A Distribution and ultrastructure of laticifers in the phylloclade of ''Euphorbia caducifolia'' Haines, a potential hydrocarbon yielding CAM plant. American journal of Plant Sciences '''5''': 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Laticifer tubes have irregularly edged walls and a larger inner diameter than the surrounding [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;Farías, F. R., J. S. Williamson, S. V. Rodríguez, G. Angeles, and V. O. Portugal. 2009. Bark anatomy in ''Croton draco'' var. ''draco'' (Euphorbiaceae). American Journal of Botany '''96''': 2155-2167&lt;/ref&gt; In the development of the cell, elongation occurs via [[Mitosis|karyokinesis]] and no cell plate develops resulting in coenocytic cells which extend throughout the plant.&lt;ref name=Rajeswari2014 /&gt; These cells can reach up to tens of centimeters long and can be branched or unbranched.
They are thought to have a role in wound healing and as [[plant defense against herbivory|defense against herbivory]], as well as pathogen defense, and are often used for [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

Laticifers were first described by [[H. A. de Barry]] in 1877.

Laticifers are highly specialized cells with unique [[DNA]] which can produce a wide variety of proteins.&lt;ref name=Freitas2010&gt;de Freitas, C. D. T., D. P. de Souza, E. S. Araújo, M. G. Cavalheiro, L. S. Oliveira, and M. V. Ramos. 2010. Anti-oxidative and proteolytic activities and protein profile of laticifer cells of ''Cryptostegia grandiflora'', ''Plumeria rubra'' and ''Euphorbia tirucalli''. Brazilian Society of Plant Physiology '''22''': 11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins include enzymes functioning as [[Protease|proteinases]] and [[chitinase]]s which help defend the producing plant against insects and other herbivores. In one study it was found that the presence and concentration of some proteins can differ greatly within the genus [[Croton (plant)|''Croton'']] relative to three species studied.&lt;ref name=Freitas2010 /&gt;

==Cell Turgor==

Pressurized flow of latex has been studied in multiple ''Asclepias'' species as a form of defense in addition to the secondary metabolites stored in the latex.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, A. A., and K. Konno. 2009. Latex: A model for understanding mechanisms, ecology, and evolution of plant defense against herbivory. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics '''40''': 311-331.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to augment the defense of the plant some non-articulated laticifer cells contain highly pressurized stores of latex. It has been noted that pressure may be produced by the osmotic uptake of water into the laticifer cell resulting in a [[turgid]] cell.&lt;ref&gt;Pickard, W. F. 2007.

Mitter. 1991. Escalation of plant defense: do latex and resin canals spur plant diversification? American Naturalist '''138''': 881-900.&lt;/ref&gt; A desert species, [[Burseraceae|''Bursera schlechtendalii'']], pressurizes the canals right where leaves attach to the stem so that when a grazer eats a leaf latex shoots out. This process is termed the “squirt gun” defense.&lt;ref&gt;Becerra, J. X., and D. L. Venable. 1990.

'''Magnanimity''' (from Latin ''[[wikt: magnanimitas|magnanimitās]]'', from ''[[wikt: magna|magna]]'' "big" + ''[[wikt:animus|animus]]'' "soul, spirit") is the virtue of being great of mind and heart.  It encompasses, usually, a refusal to be petty, a willingness to face danger, and actions for noble purposes. Its [[antithesis]] is pusillanimity (Latin: ''[[wikt:pusillanimitas|pusillanimitās]]''). Although the word magnanimity has a traditional connection to Aristotelian philosophy, it also has its own tradition in English which now causes some confusion.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker+page%3D1123a#note2 footnote] in the Rackham edition. In the Sachs translation it is remarked that two possible translations "pride" and "high mindedness" both only get half of the meaning, while magnanimity only "shifts the problem into Latin".&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Aristotle==
The Latin word ''magnanimitās'' comes from the Greek word μεγαλοψυχία (''megalopsychia'') which means "greatness of soul." In the context of ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' IV.3, [[Aristotle]] associates ''megalopsychia'' more with a sense of pride and self-worth rather than the modern sense of magnanimity. Aristotle writes (1123b1-2), "Now a person is thought to be great-souled if he claims much and deserves much" (δοκεῖ δὴ μεγαλόψυχος εἶναι ὁ μεγάλων αὑτὸν ἀξιῶν ἄξιος ὤν). W.D. Ross translates Aristotle's statement ἔοικε μὲν οὖν ἡ μεγαλοψυχία οἷον κόσμος τις εἶναι τῶν ἀρετῶν· μείζους γὰρ αὐτὰς ποιεῖ, καὶ οὐ γίνεται ἄνευ ἐκείνων (1124a1-2) as the following: "Pride [''megalopsychia''], then, seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues; for it makes them greater, and it is not found without them." The great-souled, Aristotle adds, are "thought to have a good memory for any benefit they have conferred, but a bad memory for those which they have received [...] It is also characteristic of the great-souled man never to ask help from others, or only with reluctance, but to render aid willingly; and to be dignified towards men of position and fortune, unassuming towards those of moderate station..." (1124b25-26, H. Rackham's translation for [[Loeb Classical Library]]).

==Other uses==
[[Noah Webster]] of the American Language defines ''Magnanimity'' as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
MAGNANIMITY, n. [L. magnanimitas; magnus, great, and animus, mind.] Greatness of mind; that elevation or dignity of soul, which encounters danger and trouble with tranquility and firmness, which raises the possessor above revenge, and makes him delight in acts of benevolence, which makes him disdain injustice and meanness, and prompts him to sacrifice personal ease, interest and safety for the accomplishment of useful and noble objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noah Webster|Webster, N.]], ''Dictionary of the American Language'', 1828.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edmund Spenser]], in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', had each knight [[allegorical]]ly represent a virtue; Prince Arthur represented "magnificence", which is generally taken to mean Aristotelian magnificence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.4.iv.html#185 ''Nichomachaen Ethics'' IV 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Spenser|Spenser, E.]], ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The uncompleted work does not include Prince Arthur's book, and the significance is not clear.

[[Democritus]] states that "magnanimity consists in enduring tactlessness with mildness".

As an adjective, the concept is expressed as "magnanimous", e.g. "He is a magnanimous man."  An example of referring to one as magnanimous can be seen in [[Hrólfs saga kraka]] where King [[Hrólfr Kraki]] changes the name of a court servant from Hott to Hjalti for his new-found strength and courage, after which Hjalti refuses to taunt or kill those who previously mocked him.  Because of his noble actions, the king then bestows the title Magnanimous upon Hjalti.

One form of magnanimity is the generosity of the victor to the defeated. For example, magnanimity has been codified between societies by the [[Geneva Conventions]].

Magnanimous relief efforts can serve to offset the collateral damage of war.

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', refers to the chest of man as the seat of magnanimity, or sentiment, with this magnanimity working as the liaison between visceral and cerebral man.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis|Lewis, C. S.]], ''[[The Abolition of Man]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis asserts that, in his time, the denial of the emotions that are found in the eternal and sublime -- that which is humbling as an objective reality -- had led to "men without chests".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44340">'''Microbial genetics''' is a subject area within [[microbiology]] and [[genetic engineering]]. Microbial genetics studies microorganisms for different purposes. The microorganisms that are observed are bacteria, and archaea. Some fungi and protozoa are also subjects used to study in this field. The studies of microorganisms involve studies of genotype and expression system. Genotypes are the inherited compositions of an organism. (Austin, "Genotype," n.d.) Genetic Engineering is a field of work and study within microbial genetics. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/microbiology/chapter/microbes-and-the-tools-of-genetic-engineering/|title=Microbes and the Tools of Genetic Engineering {{!}} Microbiology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;The usage of recombinant DNA technology is a process of this work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The process involves creating recombinant DNA molecules through manipulating a DNA sequence. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/microbiology/chapter/microbes-and-the-tools-of-genetic-engineering/|title=Microbes and the Tools of Genetic Engineering {{!}} Microbiology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;That DNA created is then in contact with a host organism. Cloning is also an example of genetic engineering. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since the discovery of microorganisms by Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek during the period 1665-1885&lt;ref name="Microorganisms Discovery"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gest|first1=Hau|title=The discovery of microorganisms by Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Fellows of The Royal Society|journal=The Royal Society|date=22 May 2004|volume=58|pages=137–201|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2004.0055|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/58/2/187|accessdate=2015-09-25|pmid=15209075}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have been used to study many processes and have had applications in various areas of study in genetics.
For example: Microorganisms' rapid growth rates and short generation times are used by scientists to study evolution. Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek discoveries involved depictions, observations, and descriptions of microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/van_leeuwenhoek_antonie.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632 - 1723)|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mucor is the microfungus that Hooke presented and gave a depiction of. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.science.gov/topicpages/a/antonie+van+leeuwenhoek.html|title=antonie van leeuwenhoek: Topics by Science.gov|website=www.science.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;His contribution being, Mucor as the first microorganism to be illustrated. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek’s contribution to the microscopic protozoa and microscopic bacteria yielded to scientific observations and descriptions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.science.gov/topicpages/a/antonie+van+leeuwenhoek.html|title=antonie van leeuwenhoek: Topics by Science.gov|website=www.science.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;These contributions were accomplished by a simple microscope, which led to the understanding of microbes today and continues to progress scientists understanding.  &lt;ref name="Book on Microorganisms and model systems."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mortlock|first1=Robert|title=Microorganisms As Model Systems for Studying Evolution.|date=2013|publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=978-1-4684-4846-7|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Microbial genetics also has applications in being able to study processes and pathways that are similar to those found in humans such as drug metabolism.&lt;ref name="Applications of Microbial genetics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Cormac D.|title=Drug metabolism in microorganisms|journal=Biotechnology Letters|date=2 September 2014|volume=37|issue=1|pages=19–28|doi=10.1007/s10529-014-1653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in understanding evolution ==
Microbial genetics can focus on Charles Darwin's work and scientists have continued to study his work and theories by the use of microbes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G. Kolter|first=Roberto|last2=Finkel|first2=Steve|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard|last4=Maloy|first4=Stanley|last5=Pringle|first5=Anne|last6=Andersson|first6=Dan|last7=Arnold|first7=Frances|last8=A.C.

Studying evolution by using microbial genetics involves scientists looking at evolutionary balance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of how they may accomplish this is studying natural selection or drift of microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G. Kolter|first=Roberto|last2=Finkel|first2=Steve|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard|last4=Maloy|first4=Stanley|last5=Pringle|first5=Anne|last6=Andersson|first6=Dan|last7=Arnold|first7=Frances|last8=A.C.

Once the subject is observed, scientist may compare it to a sequence of a conserved gene. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The process of studying microbial evolution in this way lacks the ability to give a time scale of when the evolution took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G. Kolter|first=Roberto|last2=Finkel|first2=Steve|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard|last4=Maloy|first4=Stanley|last5=Pringle|first5=Anne|last6=Andersson|first6=Dan|last7=Arnold|first7=Frances|last8=A.C.

Studying the relationship between microbes and the environment is a key component to microbial genetics evolution.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/microbial-genetics|title=ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bacteria]] have been on this planet for approximately 3.5 billion years, and are classified by their shape.&lt;ref name="Applications of microbes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weeks|first1=Benjamin S.|title=Alcamo's microbes and society|date=2012|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=978-0-7637-9064-6|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacterial genetics]] studies the mechanisms of their heritable information, their [[chromosome]]s, [[plasmids]], [[transposons]], and [[phages]].&lt;ref name="Nature-Bacterial genetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacterial genetics|url=http://www.nature.com/subjects/bacterial-genetics|website=Nature|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene transfer systems that have been extensively studied in bacteria include [[Transformation (genetics)|genetic transformation]], [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]].  [[Natural competence|Natural transformation]] is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer between two cells through the intervening medium. The uptake of donor DNA and its recombinational incorporation into the recipient chromosome depends on the expression of numerous bacterial genes whose products direct this process.&lt;ref name="pmid15083159"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen I, Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15083159 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro844 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17997281"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnsborg O, Eldholm V, Håvarstein LS |title=Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function |journal=Research in Microbiology. |volume=158 |issue=10 |pages=767–78 |year=2007 |pmid=17997281 |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, transformation is a complex, energy-requiring developmental process that appears to be an adaptation for repairing DNA damage.&lt;ref name="pmid18295550"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM |title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens |journal=Infection, Genetics, and Evolution |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=267–85 |year=2008 |pmid=18295550 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bacterial conjugation]] is the transfer of genetic material between [[bacteria|bacterial cells]] by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells.  Bacterial conjugation has been extensively studied in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', but also occurs in other bacteria such as ''[[Mycobacterium smegmatis]]''. Conjugation requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is [[Deoxyribonuclease|DNase]] resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by [[homologous recombination]]. ''E. coli'' conjugation is mediated by expression of [[plasmid]] genes, whereas mycobacterial conjugation is mediated by genes on the bacterial chromosome.&lt;ref name="pmid23874149"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gray TA, Krywy JA, Harold J, Palumbo MJ, Derbyshire KM |title=Distributive conjugal transfer in mycobacteria generates progeny with meiotic-like genome-wide mosaicism, allowing mapping of a mating identity locus |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=e1001602 |year=2013 |pmid=23874149 |pmc=3706393 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001602 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transduction (genetics)|Transduction]] is the process by which foreign [[DNA]] is introduced into a cell by a [[virus]] or [[viral vector]].  Transduction is a common tool used by molecular biologists to stably introduce a foreign gene into a host cell's [[genome]].

===Archaea===
[[Archaea]] is a domain of organisms that are [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]], single-celled, and are thought to have developed 4 billion years ago.  "They have no cell nucleus or any other organelles inside their cells."Archaea replicate asexually in a process known as binary fission. The cell division cycle includes when chromosomes of daughter cells replicate. Because archea have a singular structure chromosome, the two daughter cells separate and cell divides.  Archaea have motility include with flagella, which is a tail like structure. Archaeal chromosomes replicate from different origins of replication, producing two haploid daughter cells &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hogan |first1=Michael |title=What are Archaea? - Encyclopedia of Life |url=http://eol.org/info/457 |website=Encyclopedia of Life |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eol.org/info/457}}&lt;/ref&gt; They share a common ancestor with [[bacteria]], but are more closely related to eukaryotes in comparison to bacteria.&lt;ref name="Microbe World"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaea|url=http://www.microbeworld.org/types-of-microbes/archaea|website=Microbe World|publisher=Microbe World|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Archaea are able to survive extreme environments, which leads to many applications in the field of genetics. One of such applications is the use of archaeal enzymes, which would be better able to survive harsh conditions ''[[in vitro]]''.&lt;ref name="Paper on Arcahaeal Enzymes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=Cecilia R.|last2=Patrick|first2=Wayne M.|title=Archaeal Nucleic Acid Ligases and Their Potential in Biotechnology|journal=Archaea|date=2015|volume=2015|pages=1–10|doi=10.1155/2015/170571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene transfer and genetic exchange have been studied in the [[Halophile|halophilic]] archaeon ''[[Halobacterium|Halobacterium volcanii]]'' and the [[Hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] archaeons ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' and ''[[Sulfolobus acidocaldarius]]''.  ''H. volcani'' forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction.&lt;ref name="pmid2818746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenshine I, Tchelet R, Mevarech M |title=The mechanism of DNA transfer in the mating system of an archaebacterium |journal=Science |volume=245 |issue=4924 |pages=1387–9 |year=1989 |pmid=2818746 |doi= 10.1126/science.2818746|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''S. solfataricus'' and ''S. acidocaldarius'' are exposed to DNA damaging agents, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange and genetic recombination with high frequency. Cellular aggregation is thought to enhance species specific DNA transfer between ''Sulfolobus'' cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of [[homologous recombination]].&lt;ref name="pmid18990182"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fröls S, Ajon M, Wagner M, Teichmann D, Zolghadr B, Folea M, Boekema EJ, Driessen AJ, Schleper C, Albers SV |title=UV-inducible cellular aggregation of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is mediated by pili formation |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=938–52 |year=2008 |pmid=18990182 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06459.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19143598"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fröls S, White MF, Schleper C |title=Reactions to UV damage in the model archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=37 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=36–41 |year=2009 |pmid=19143598 |doi=10.1042/BST0370036 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21999488"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ajon M, Fröls S, van Wolferen M, Stoecker K, Teichmann D, Driessen AJ, Grogan DW, Albers SV, Schleper C |title=UV-inducible DNA exchange in hyperthermophilic archaea mediated by type IV pili |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=807–17 |year=2011 |pmid=21999488 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07861.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Archaea are divided into 3 subgroups which are halophiles, methanogens, and thermoacidophiles. The first group, methanogens, are archaeabacteria that live in swamps and marshes as well as in the gut of humans. They also play a major role in decay and decomposition with dead organisms. Methanogens are anaerobic organisms, which are killed when they are exposed to oxygen. The second subgroup of archaeabacteria, halophiles are organisms that are present in areas with high salt concentration like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. The third subgroup thermoacidophiles also called thermophiles, are organisms that live in acidic areas. They are present in area with low pH levels like hot springs and geyers. Most thermophiles are found in the Yellowstone National Park. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaebacteria Examples |url=https://biologywise.com/archaebacteria-examples |website=BiologyWise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeal Genetics is the study of genes that comprise of single, nucleus free cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaeal genetics - Latest research and news {{!}} Nature |url=https://www.nature.com/subjects/archaea-genetics |website=www.nature.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaea have a single, circular chromosomes that contain multiple origins of replication for initiation of DNA synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaeal Genetics {{!}} Boundless Microbiology |url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/archaeal-genetics/ |website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA replication of Archaea involves similar processes including initiation, elongation, and termination. The primase used to synthesize a RNA primer varies than in eukaryotes. The primase by archaea is highly derived version of RNA recognition motif(RRM). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaeal Genetics {{!}} Boundless Microbiology |url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/archaeal-genetics/ |website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaea come from Gram positive bacteria, which both have a single lipid bilayer, which are resistant to antibiotics. Archaea are similar to mitochondria in eukaryotes in that they release energy as  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the chemical reaction called metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaeal Genetics {{!}} Boundless Microbiology |url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/archaeal-genetics/ |website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some archaea known as phototrophic archaea use the sun’s energy to produce ATP. ATP synthase is used as photophosphorylation to convert chemicals into ATP.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hogan |first1=Michael |title=What are Archaea? - Encyclopedia of Life |url=http://eol.org/info/457 |website=Encyclopedia of Life |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Archaea and bacteria are structurally similar even though they are not closely related in the tree of life. The shapes of both bacteria and archaea cells vary from a spherical shape known as coccus or a rod-shape known as bacillus. They are also related with no internal membrane and a cell wall that assists the cell maintaining its shape. Even though archaeal cells have cells walls, they do not contain peptidoglycan, which means archaea do not produce cellulose or chitin.   Archaea are most closely related to eukaryotes due to tRNA present in archaea, but not in bacteria. Archaea have the same ribosomes as eukaryotes that synthesize into proteins. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Morphology of the Archaea |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/archaeamm.html |website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aside from the morphology of archaea and bacteria, there are other differences between these domains. Archaea that live in extreme and harsh environments with low pH levels such as salt lakes, oceans, and in the gut of ruminants and humans are also known as extremophiles. In contrast, bacteria are found in various areas such as plants, animals, soil, and rocks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaea vs Bacteria - Difference and Comparison {{!}} Diffen |url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Archaea_vs_Bacteria |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Fungi===
[[Fungi kingdom|Fungi]] can be both multicellular and unicellular organisms, and are distinguished from other [[microbes]] by the way they obtain nutrients. Fungi secrete [[enzymes]] into their surroundings, to break down organic matter.&lt;ref name="Applications of microbes" /&gt; Fungal genetics uses [[yeast]], and filamentous fungi as model organisms for eukaryotic genetic research, including [[cell cycle]] regulation, [[chromatin]] structure and [[gene regulation]].&lt;ref name="Nature def-Fungal genetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fungal Genetics|url=http://www.nature.com/subjects/fungal-genetics?WT.ac=search_subjects_fungal_genetics|website=Nature.com|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Limited|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the [[fungus]] ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' have contributed substantially to understanding how [[gene]]s work.  ''N. crassa'' is a type of red bread [[mold]] of the [[phylum]] ''[[Ascomycota]]''.  It is used as a [[model organism]] because it is easy to grow and has a [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] life cycle that makes [[Genetics|genetic]] analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring. Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of [[meiosis]] in [[ascospore]]s.  In its natural environment, ''N. crassa'' lives mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It often can be found growing on dead plant matter after fires.

''Neurospora'' was used by [[Edward Tatum]] and [[George Beadle]] in their experiments&lt;ref name="pmid16588492"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beadle GW, Tatum EL |title=Genetic Control of Biochemical Reactions in Neurospora |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=499–506 |year=1941 |pmid=16588492 |pmc=1078370 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.27.11.499|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which they won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]  in 1958. The results of these experiments led directly to the [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]] that specific [[gene]]s code for specific [[protein#Synthesis|proteins]]. This concept proved to be the opening gun in what became [[molecular genetics]] and all the developments that have followed from that.&lt;ref name="pmid15020400"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horowitz NH, Berg P, Singer M, Lederberg J, Susman M, Doebley J, Crow JF |title=A centennial: George W.

''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is a [[yeast]] of the [[phylum]] ''[[Ascomycota]]''.  During vegetative growth that ordinarily occurs when nutrients are abundant, ''S. cerevisiae'' reproduces by [[mitosis]] as [[ploidy#diploid|diploid]] cells. However, when starved, these cells undergo [[meiosis]] to form [[ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] [[spore]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid3070323"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herskowitz I |title=Life cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Microbiological Reviews |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=536–53 |year=1988 |pmid=3070323 |pmc=373162 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite [[mating type]]s MATa and MATα come into contact.  Ruderfer et al.&lt;ref name=Ruderfer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruderfer DM, Pratt SC, Seidel HS, Kruglyak L |title=Population genomic analysis of outcrossing and recombination in yeast |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=1077–81 |year=2006 |pmid=16892060 |doi=10.1038/ng1859 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that, in nature, such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present together in the same [[acus]], the sac that contains the cells directly produced by a single [[meiosis]], and these cells can mate with each other. The second reason is that [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type.  An analysis of the ancestry of natural ''S. cerevisiae'' strains concluded that outcrossing occurs very infrequently (only about once every 50,000 cell divisions).&lt;ref name=Ruderfer /&gt;  The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing suggests that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of diversity) are unlikely to be sufficient for generally maintaining sex from one generation to the next.

''[[Candida albicans]]'' is a diploid fungus that grows both as a yeast and as a [[Hypha|filament]].  ''C. albicans'' is the most common fungal [[pathogen]] in humans. It causes both debilitating mucosal infections and potentially life-threatening systemic infections.  ''C. albicans'' has maintained an elaborate, but largely hidden, mating apparatus.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson A |title=The biology of mating in Candida albicans |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=106–16 |year=2003 |pmid=15035040 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro752 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt; suggested that mating strategies may allow ''C. albicans'' to survive in the hostile environment of a mammalian host.

Among the 250 known species of [[Aspergillus|aspergilli]], about 33% have an identified sexual state.&lt;ref name=Dyer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dyer PS, O'Gorman CM |title=Sexual development and cryptic sexuality in fungi: insights from Aspergillus species |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=165–92 |year=2012 |pmid=22091779 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00308.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among those ''Aspergillus'' species that exhibit a sexual cycle the overwhelming majority in nature are [[Homothallism|homothallic]] (self-fertilizing).&lt;ref name=Dyer /&gt;  [[Selfing]] in the homothallic fungus ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' involves activation of the same mating pathways characteristic of sex in outcrossing species, i.e. self-fertilization does not bypass required pathways for outcrossing sex but instead requires activation of these pathways within a single individual.&lt;ref name="pmid17669651"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paoletti M, Seymour FA, Alcocer MJ, Kaur N, Calvo AM, Archer DB, Dyer PS |title=Mating type and the genetic basis of self-fertility in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans |journal=Current Biology |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=1384–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17669651 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fusion of haploid nuclei occurs within reproductive structures termed ''[[Ascocarp#Cleistothecium|cleistothecia]]'', in which the diploid zygote undergoes meiotic divisions to yield haploid [[ascospore]]s.

===Protozoa===
[[Protozoa]] are unicellular organisms, which have nuclei, and ultramicroscopic cellular bodies within their cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="Applications of microbes" /&gt;  One particular aspect of protozoa that are of interest to human geneticists are their [[Flagellum|flagella]], which are very similar to human [[sperm]] flagella.

Studies of ''[[Paramecium]]'' have contributed to our understanding of the function of meiosis. Like all [[ciliate]]s, ''Paramecium'' has a [[polyploid]] [[macronucleus]], and one or more [[Ploidy#diploid|diploid]] [[Micronucleus|micronuclei]]. The [[macronucleus]] controls non-reproductive cell functions, expressing the genes needed for daily functioning. The [[micronucleus]] is the generative, or [[germline]] nucleus, containing the genetic material that is passed along from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name="pmid8078435"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prescott DM |title=The DNA of ciliated protozoa |journal=Microbiological Reviews |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=233–67 |year=1994 |pmid=8078435 |pmc=372963 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the asexual fission phase of growth, during which cell divisions occur by [[mitosis]] rather than [[meiosis]], clonal aging occurs leading to a gradual loss of vitality. In some species, such as the well studied ''Paramecium tetraurelia'', the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo meiosis followed by either autogamy (self-fertilizaion) or conjugation (outcrossing) (see [[Paramecium#aging|aging in ''Paramecium'']]). DNA damage increases dramatically during successive clonal cell divisions and is a likely cause of clonal aging in ''P. tetraurelia''.&lt;ref name="pmid424739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith-Sonneborn J |title=DNA repair and longevity assurance in Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Science |volume=203 |issue=4385 |pages=1115–7 |year=1979 |pmid=424739 |doi= 10.1126/science.424739|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3091993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes GE, Holmes NR |title=Accumulation of DNA damages in aging Paramecium tetraurelia |journal=Molecular and General Genetics |volume=204 |issue=1 |pages=108–14 |year=1986 |pmid=3091993 |doi= 10.1007/bf00330196|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8127914"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilley D, Blackburn EH |title=Lack of telomere shortening during senescence in Paramecium |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1955–8 |year=1994 |pmid=8127914 |pmc=43283 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1955|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When clonally aged ''P. tetraurelia'' are stimulated to undergo meiosis in association with either [[Reproduction#autogamy|autogamy]] or [[Isogamy#conjugation|conjugation]], the progeny are rejuvenated, and are able to have many more mitotic binary fission divisions. During either of these processes the micronuclei of the cell(s) undergo meiosis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear DNA that had recently undergone meiosis. There is apparently little, if any, DNA damage in the new macronucleus, suggesting that rejuvenation is associated with the repair of these damages in the micronucleus during meiosis.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2013 /&gt;

Many types of virus are capable of genetic recombination.  When two or more individual viruses of the same type infect a cell, their genomes may recombine with each other to produce recombinant virus progeny.  Both DNA and RNA viruses can undergo recombination.  
When two or more viruses, each containing lethal genomic damage infect the same host cell, the virus genomes often can pair with each other and undergo homologous recombinational repair to produce viable progeny.&lt;ref name=BernsteinC&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein C |title=Deoxyribonucleic acid repair in bacteriophage |journal=Microbiological Reviews |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=72–98 |year=1981 |pmid=6261109 |pmc=281499 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3627145"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen D, Bernstein C |title=Recombinational repair of hydrogen peroxide-induced damages in DNA of phage T4 |journal=Mutation Research |volume=184 |issue=2 |pages=87–98 |year=1987 |pmid=3627145 |doi= 10.1016/0167-8817(87)90064-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process is known as multiplicity reactivation.&lt;ref name=BernsteinC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Michod&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–85 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18295550 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 }}http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Enzymes employed in multiplicity reactivation are functionally homologous to enzymes employed in bacterial and eukaryotic recombinational repair.

When a person comes in contact with the virus, unlike the common cold, the flu virus affects people almost immediately. Symptoms of this virus are very similar to the common cold but much worse. Body aches, sore throat, headache, cold sweats, muscle aches and fatigue are among the many symptoms accompanied by the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/232713128|title=Flu : a social history of influenza|last=1956-|first=Quinn, Tom,|date=2008|publisher=New Holland|isbn=9781845379414|location=London|oclc=232713128}}&lt;/ref&gt; A viral infection in the upper respiratory tract results in the common cold.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenhough|first=Beth|date=2012-01-06|title=Where species meet and mingle: endemic human-virus relations, embodied communication and more-than-human agency at the Common Cold Unit 1946–90|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1474474011422029|journal=cultural geographies|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=281–301|doi=10.1177/1474474011422029|issn=1474-4740}}&lt;/ref&gt; With symptoms like sore throat, sneezing, small fever, and a cough, the common cold is usually harmless and tends to clear up within a week or so.

Using microbes, protocols were developed to insert genes into bacterial [[plasmid]]s, taking advantage of their fast reproduction, to make [[biofactories]] for the gene of interest. Such genetically engineered bacteria can produce [[pharmaceuticals]] such as [[insulin]], [[human growth hormone]], [[interferons]] and [[Blood clotting|blood clotting factors]].&lt;ref name="Applications of microbes" /&gt; These biofactories are typically much cheaper to operate and maintain than the alternative procedures of producing pharmaceuticals. They're like millions of tiny pharmaceutical machines that only require basic raw materials and the right environment to produce a large amount of product. The utilization of incorporating the human insulin gene alone has had profound impacts on the medical industry. It's thought that biofactories might be the ultimate key in reducing the price of expensive life saving pharmaceutical compounds.

Microbes synthesize a variety of enzymes for industrial applications, such as fermented foods, laboratory test reagents, dairy products (such as [[renin]]), and even in clothing (such as ''[[Trichoderma]]'' fungus whose enzyme is used to give jeans a stone washed appearance).&lt;ref name="Applications of microbes" /&gt;

There is currently potential for microbes to be used as an alternative for petroleum based surfactants. Microbial surfactants would still have the same kind of [[Hydrophile|hydrophillic]] and [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] functional groups as their petroleum based counterparts, but they have numerous advantages over their competition. In comparison, microbial [[Amphiphile|amphiphillic]] compounds have robust a tendency to stay functional in extreme environments such as areas with high heat or extreme ph. all while being biodegradable and less toxic to the environment. This efficient and cheap method of production could be the solution to the ever increasing global consumption of surfactants. Ironically, the application for bio-based surfactants with the most demand is the oil industry which uses surfactants in general production as well as development of specific oil compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banat|first=I.

Microbes are an abundant source of [[Lipase|lipases]] which have a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. [[Enzyme|Enzymes]] perform a wide variety of functions inside the cells of living things, so it only makes sense that we can use them for similar purposes on a larger scale. Microbial enzymes are typically preferred for mass production due to the wide variety of functions available and their ability to be mass produced. Plant and animal enzymes are typically too expensive to be mass produced, however this is not always the case. Especially in plants. Industrial applications of lipases generally include the enzyme as a more effecient and cost effective catalyst in the production of commercially valuable chemicals from fats and oils, because they are able to retain their specific properties in mild easy to maintain conditions and work at an increased rate. Other already successful applications of lipolytic enzymes include the production of biofuels, polymers, non-stereoisomeric pharmaceuticals, agricultural compounds, and flavor enhancing compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-06-26|title=Industrial applications of microbial lipases|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141022905004606|journal=Enzyme and Microbial Technology|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=235–251|doi=10.1016/j.enzmictec.2005.10.016|issn=0141-0229}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In regards to industrial optimization, the benefit of the biofactory method of production is the ability to direct optimization by means of directed evolution. The efficiency and specificity of production will increase over time by imposing artificial selection. This method of improving efficiency is nothing new in the agriculture, but it's a relatively new concept in industrial production. It is though that this method will be far superior to conventional industrial methods because you have optimization on multiple fronts. The first front being that the microorganisms that make up biofactories can be evolved to our needs. The second front being the conventional method of optimization brought about by the integration of advancing technologies. This combination of conventional and biological advancement is just now becoming utilized and provides a virtually limitless amount of applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-01-20|title=Development of microbial cell factories for bio-refinery through synthetic bioengineering|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165612003112|journal=Journal of Biotechnology|language=en|volume=163|issue=2|pages=204–216|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.05.021|issn=0168-1656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of war}}

'''Military organization''' or '''military organisation''' is the structuring of the armed forces of a [[State (polity)|state]] so as to offer such [[military capability]] as a [[national defense policy]] may require. In some countries [[paramilitary]] forces are included in a nation's armed forces, though not considered military{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}. Armed forces that are not a part of military or paramilitary organizations, such as [[Insurgency|insurgent]] forces, often [[mimic]] military organizations, or use ''[[ad hoc]]'' structures, while formal military organization tends to use [[hierarchical]] forms.

== History ==
{{sectstub|date=July 2018}}
The use of formalized [[Military rank#Roman ranks|ranks]] in a hierarchical structure came into widespread use with the [[Roman Army]].

In modern times, executive control, management and administration of military organization is typically undertaken by governments through a [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] within the structure of [[public administration]], often known as a [[Ministry of Defense]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], or [[Department of War]]. These in turn manage [[Armed Services]] that themselves command formations and units specialising in combat, [[combat support]] and [[combat service support | combat-service support]].

==Executive control, management and administration==
The usually civilian or partly civilian executive control over the national military organization is exercised in [[democracy|democracies]] by an elected political leader as a member of the government's [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], usually known as a Minister of Defense. (In presidential systems, such as the United States, the president is the commander-in-chief, and the cabinet-level defense minister is second in command.) Subordinated to that position are often Secretaries for specific major operational divisions of the armed forces as a whole, such as those that provide general support services to the Armed Services, including their dependants.

Then there are the heads of specific departmental agencies responsible for the provision and management of specific skill- and knowledge-based service such as [[Strategy]] advice, [[Military capability|Capability Development]] assessment, or [[Military science|Defense Science]] provision of research, and design and development of technologies. Within each departmental agency will be found administrative branches responsible for further agency [[business|business specialization]] work.

==Armed services==

In most countries the ''armed forces'' are divided into three or four [[Armed services]] (also: ''service, military service, or military branch''): [[army]], [[navy]], and [[air force]].

Many countries have a variation on the standard model of three or four basic [[Armed Services]]. Some nations also organize their [[Marines (military)|marines]], [[special forces]] or [[ballistic missile|strategic missile]] forces as independent armed services. A nation's [[coast guard]] may also be an independent [[military branch]] of its military, although in many nations the coast guard is a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or civil agency. A number of countries have no navy, for geographical reasons. Some other variations include:

In larger armed forces the culture between the different [[Armed Services]] of the armed forces can be quite different.

Most smaller countries have a single organization that encompasses all armed forces employed by the country in question. Third-world armies tend to consist primarily of infantry, while first-world armies tend to have larger units manning expensive equipment and only a fraction of personnel in infantry units.

It is worthwhile to make mention of the term ''[[Joint warfare|joint]]''.  In western militaries, a [[joint warfare|joint force]] is defined as a unit or formation comprising representation of combat power from two or more branches of the military.

===Internal security forces===
[[Gendarmerie]]s, including equivalents such as [[Internal Troops]], [[Paramilitary|Paramilitary Forces]] and similar, are an internal security service common in most of the world, but uncommon in Anglo-Saxon countries where civil police are employed to enforce the law, and there are tight restrictions on how the armed forces may be used to assist.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States it is a common misunderstanding that their armed forces are totally prohibited from doing so by the [[Posse Comitatus Act]]. This Act, which reserves to Congress the power to employ Federal military force to enforce law and order, refers specifically only to the [[US Army]] and [[US Air Force]]. The [[US Marines]] and [[US Navy|Navy]] are separately regulated, and the [[US Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] has a clear law enforcement role in its peacetime status. The state-controlled [[Army National Guard]] (technically a branch of the US Army) is also excluded from the Posse Comitatus Act. The [[Insurrection Act]] specifically permits the President to use Federal military force to restore public order in extreme emergency situations: this Act was implemented during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|"Rodney King Riots"]] in Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Commands.2C_formations.2C_and_units}}

==Commands, formations and units==
{{Redirect|Military formation|the arrangement or deployment of moving military forces|Tactical formation}}

It is common, at least in the European and North American militaries, to refer to the building blocks of a military as commands, formations and units.

In a military context, a [[Command (military formation)|command]] is a collection of units and formations under the control of a single officer. Although during the [[Second World War]] a Command was also a name given to a [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] in the [[US Army]], in general it is an administrative and executive [[military strategy|strategic]] [[headquarters]] which is responsible to the national government or the national military headquarters. It is not uncommon for a nation's services to each consist of their own command (such as Land Component, Air Component, Naval Component, and Medical Component in the [[Belgian Army]]), but this does not preclude the existence of commands which are not service-based.

{{Anchor|Formation}}A formation is defined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] as "two or more aircraft, ships, or units proceeding together under a commander".&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Defense]], [http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html DOD Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223235143/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html |date=2008-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formin in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] emphasised its combined-arms nature: "Formations are those military organisations which are formed from different speciality Arms and Services troop units to create a balanced, combined combat force. The formations only differ in their ability to achieve different scales of application of force to achieve different strategic, operational and tactical goals and mission objectives."&lt;ref&gt;Fomin, N.N., Great Soviet Encyclopaedia ({{lang-ru|Большая Советская Энциклопедия}}), Moscow, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; It is a composite military organization that includes a mixture of integrated and operationally attached sub-units, and is usually combat-capable. Example of formations include: [[Division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, [[battalion]]s, [[Wing (air force unit)|wings]], etc. Formation may also refer to [[tactical formation]], the physical arrangement or disposition of troops and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of formation in such usage include: [[pakfront]], [[panzerkeil]], [[testudo formation]], etc.

A typical unit is a homogeneous military organization (either combat, [[Combat support|combat-support]] or non-combat in capability) that includes service personnel predominantly from a single arm of service, or a branch of service, and its administrative and command functions are self-contained. Any unit subordinate to another unit is considered its sub-unit or minor unit. It is not uncommon for unit and formation to be used synonymously in the United States. In Commonwealth practice, formation is not used for smaller organizations like battalions which are instead called "units", and their constituent [[platoon]]s or [[Company (military unit)|companies]] are referred to as sub-units. In the Commonwealth, formations are [[Division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, etc.

Different [[armed forces]], and even different branches of service of the armed forces, may use the same name to denote different types of organizations. An example is the "squadron". In most navies a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] is a formation of several ships; in most air forces it is a unit; in the U.S. Army it is a battalion-sized [[cavalry]] unit; and in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armies a squadron is a company-sized sub-unit.

==Table of organization and equipment==
A [[table of organization and equipment]] (TOE or TO&amp;E) is a document published by the U.S. Army Force Management Support Agency that prescribes the organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional size and down, but also including the headquarters of Corps and Armies.

It also provides information on the mission and capabilities of a unit as well as the unit's current status. A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a specific unit (the 3rd Infantry Division). In this way, all units of the same branch (such as infantry) follow the same structural guidelines.

==Modern hierarchy==

{{Military units}}

=== Army hierarchy ===
{{Army units}}

The following table gives an overview of some of the terms used to describe army hierarchy in armed forces across the world. Whilst it is recognized that there are differences between armies of different nations, many are modeled on the [[British Army|British]] or [[United States Armed Forces|American]] models, or both. However, many military units and formations go back in history for a long time, and were devised by various military thinkers throughout European history.

For example, the modern ''Corps'' was first introduced in France about 1805 by Napoleon as a more flexible tactical grouping of two or more divisions during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

They have become part of the organization of most armies around the world.

Rungs may be skipped in this ladder: for example, typically NATO forces skip from battalion to brigade. Likewise, only large military powers may have organizations at the top levels and different armies and countries may also use traditional names, creating considerable confusion: for example, a British or Canadian armored regiment (battalion) is divided into [[Squadron (army)|squadron]]s (companies) and [[troop]]s (platoons), whereas an American cavalry squadron (battalion) is divided into troops (companies) and platoons.

[[Army]], [[army group]], [[region]], and [[theater (military)|theatre]] are all large formations that vary significantly between armed forces in size and hierarchy position.  While [[Division (military)|division]]s were the traditional level at which support elements (field artillery, hospital, logistics and maintenance, etc.) were added to the unit structure, since World War II, many brigades now have such support units, and since the 1980s, regiments also have been receiving support elements.  A regiment with such support elements is called a [[regimental combat team]] in US military parlance, or a [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] in the UK and other forces.

During [[World War II]] the [[Red Army]] used the same basic organizational structure.  However, in the beginning many units were greatly underpowered and their size was actually one level below on the ladder that is usually used elsewhere; for example, a division in the early-WWII Red Army would have been about the size of most nations' regiments or brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armor.kiev.ua/army/hist/doklad-nko-8-39.shtml |title=Доклад НКО август 1939. doklad-nko-8-39.shtml |publisher=Armor.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=121&amp;sid=92105 |script-title=ru:Центральный государственный архив Советской армии (с июня 1992 г.

By contrast, during the same period the German [[Wehrmacht]] Army Groups, particularly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], such as [[Army Group Centre]] significantly exceeded the above numbers, and were more cognate with the Soviet [[Strategic Direction]]s.

=== Naval hierarchy ===
Naval organization at the flotilla level and higher is less commonly abided by, as ships operate in smaller or larger groups in various situations that may change at a moment's notice.  However, there is some common terminology used throughout navies to communicate the general concept of how many vessels might be in a unit.

Navies are generally organized into groups for a specific purpose, usually strategic, and these organizational groupings appear and disappear frequently based on the conditions and demands placed upon a navy.  This contrasts with army organization where units remain static, with the same men and equipment, over long periods of time.

The five-star ranks of Admiral of the Fleet and Fleet Admiral have largely been out of regular use since the 1990s, with the exception of ceremonial or honorary appointments. Currently, all major navies are commanded by an admiral (four-star rank) or vice-admiral (three-star rank) depending on relative size. Smaller naval forces, such as the RNZN, or those navies that are effectively coastguards, are commanded by a rear-admiral (two-star rank), commodore (one-star rank) or even a captain.

Aircraft carriers are typically commanded by a captain. Submarines and destroyers are typically commanded by a captain or commander.  Some destroyers, particularly smaller destroyers such as [[frigate]]s (formerly known as [[destroyer escort]]s) are usually commanded by officers with the rank of commander.  [[Corvette]]s, the smallest class of warship, are commanded by officers with the rank of commander or lieutenant-commander. Auxiliary ships, including [[gunboat]]s, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], [[patrol boat]]s, military [[riverboat|riverine craft]], [[Ship's tender|tenders]] and [[torpedo boat]]s are usually commanded by lieutenants, sub-lieutenants or warrant officers.  Usually, the smaller the vessel, the lower the rank of the ship's commander.  For example, patrol boats are often commanded by [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]s, while frigates are rarely commanded by an officer below the rank of commander.

Historical navies were far more rigid in structure.  Ships were collected in divisions, which in turn were collected in numbered squadrons, which comprised a numbered fleet.  Permission for a vessel to leave one unit and join another would have to be approved on paper.

The modern U.S. Navy is primarily based on a number of standard groupings of vessels, including the [[carrier strike group]] and the [[Expeditionary Strike Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/ US Navy]. GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 2009-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Naval organization continues aboard a single ship. The complement forms three or four departments (such as tactical and engineering), each of which has a number of divisions, followed by work centers.

=== Air Force hierarchy ===
The organizational structures of air forces vary between nations: some air forces (such as the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Royal Air Force]]) are divided into commands, groups and squadrons; others (such as the [[Soviet Air Force]]) have an Army-style organizational structure.  The modern [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] uses [[Air Division (disambiguation)|Air Division]] as the formation between wings and the entire air command.  Like the RAF, Canadian wings consist of squadrons.

==Task force==
A [[task force]] is a unit or formation created as a temporary grouping for a specific operational purpose.  Aside from administrative hierarchical forms of organization that have evolved since the early 17th century in Europe, fighting forces have been grouped for specific operational purposes into mission-related organizations such as the German [[Kampfgruppe]] or the U.S. Combat Team (Army) and Task Force (Navy) during the Second World War, or the Soviet [[Operational manoeuvre group]] during the Cold War. In the British and Commonwealth armies the [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] became the usual grouping of companies during the [[Second World War]] and the Cold War.

Within NATO, a [[Joint Task Force]] (JTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one armed service, a Combined Task Force (CTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one nation, and a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements of more than one armed service and more than one nation.

[[Image:Coppa decorata con scene di carnevale.JPG|thumb|right|Decorated cup from Murano|alt=Decorated cup]]'''Murano glass''' is made on the [[wikt:Venetian|Venetian]] [[island]] of [[Murano]], which has been a glassmaking center for over 700 years. It is also sometimes referred to as [[Venetian glass]]. Today Murano is known for its [[art glass]], but it has a long history of innovations in glassmaking in addition to its artistic fame—and was Europe's first major glassmaking center. During the 1400s, Murano glassmakers created ''[[cristallo]]''—which was almost transparent and considered the finest glass in the world. Murano glassmakers also developed a white-colored glass ([[milk glass]] called ''lattimo'') that looked like [[porcelain]]. They later became Europe's finest makers of mirrors.

Originally, Venice was controlled by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], but it eventually became an independent [[city state]]. It flourished as a trading center and seaport. Its connections with the [[Middle East]] helped its glassmakers gain additional skills, as glassmaking was more advanced in countries such as [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. Although Venetian glassmaking existed as far back as the 8th Century, it became concentrated in Murano by law beginning 1291. Since glass factories often caught fire, this removed much of the possibility of a major fire disaster for the city. Murano glassmakers developed secret recipes and methods for making glass, and the concentration of Venice's glassmaking on the island of Murano enabled better control of those secrets.

Murano became Europe's elite glassmaking center, peaking in popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries. Venice's dominance in trade along the [[Mediterranean Sea]] created a wealthy merchant class that was a strong connoisseur of the arts. This helped establish demand for art glass and more innovations. The spread of glassmaking talent in Europe eventually diminished the importance of Venice and its Murano glassmakers. A defeat by [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte in 1797, and occupation, caused more hardship for Murano's glassmaking industry. Murano glassmaking began a revival in the 1920s. Today, Murano and Venice are tourist attractions, and Murano is home to numerous glass factories and a few individual artists' studios. Its ''[[Museo del Vetro]]'' (Glass Museum) in the [[Palazzo Giustinian]] contains displays on the history of glassmaking as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day.

==Background==
{{See also|Republic of Venice}}
[[Image:Leguna Veneta.png|thumb|right|Venice and Murano|alt=map of Venice, Murano, and Italy]]The Venetian [[city state]] grew during the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] as people fled [[Sack of Rome (410)|barbarian invasions]] to the safety of islands in a [[lagoon]]. Small communities grew in the lagoon, and Venice became the most prominent. The city of Venice became a highly successful trading port, and by the [[11th century]] dominated trade between [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. It also had a strong [[navy]]. European [[Crusades|Crusaders]] passed through Venice on their way to the [[Holy Land]]. Treasures of many kinds were bought and sold in Venice: spices, [[precious metal]]s, [[gemstone]]s, [[ivory]], [[silk]]s—and [[glass]]. Successful trade bred a wealthy merchant class in addition to the [[Nobility|nobles]], and the wealthy were responsible for Venice's famous art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Zerwick49"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass began being produced in Venice around 450, as glassmakers from [[Aquileia]] fled to the islands to escape barbarian invaders.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[archaeological]] evidence of a glass factory in the area is from the Venetian lagoon island of [[Torcello]], which dates from the 7th to 8th century.&lt;ref name="Toso25"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Venetian glassmakers were joined by glassmakers from Byzantium (a.k.a. [[Constantinople]]) and the Middle East—which enriched their glassmaking knowledge.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586"/&gt; Glass was made in the Middle East long before it was made in Europe.{{#tag:ref|The region between the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris and Euphrates]] rivers is considered the birthplace of glassmaking. Glass was made there before 2000 B.C.&lt;ref name="Shotwell343"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass was made in [[History of Syria|Syria]] as far back as 1700 B.C., and around 100 B.C. the Syrians started [[glassblowing]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell546"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] were making small glass vessels as far back as 1470 B.C. Their glassmaking became more sophisticated after the founding of [[Alexandria]] in 322 B.C.&lt;ref name="Shotwell155"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Early products were beads, glass for [[mosaic]]s, jewelry, small mirrors, and window glass.&lt;ref name="Shotwell587"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venetian glassmaking grew in importance to the city's economy. Around 1271, the local glassmakers' guild made rules to help preserve glassmaking secrets. Trade secrets were forbidden to be divulged outside of Venice. If a glassworker left the city without permission, he would be ordered to return.{{#tag:ref|While the Murano glassmakers were typically men, records exist beginning in the 1400s of women working in the manufacture of glass in Murano. A record from 1446 describes the employment of a woman who decorated glass and worked for Salvatore Barovier.&lt;ref name="Toso46"/&gt;|group=Note}} If he failed to return, his family would be imprisoned. If he still did not return, an assassin would be sent to kill him. Additional rules were made regarding ingredients used for making glass and the type of wood used as fuel for the furnaces.&lt;ref name="Shotwell586587"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|pp=586–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Island of Murano===
[[Image:"Le doge de Venise visitant les verreries de Murano".jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] visits Murano|alt=Dignitary visiting a glass factory in Murano]]
A November 8, 1291, law ordered most of Venice's glassmaking industry to be on the "island of [[Murano]]".&lt;ref name="Commerce789"&gt;{{harvnb|United States Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce|1917|p=789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murano is actually a cluster of islands linked by short bridges, and located about {{convert|1|mi}} north of Venice in the Venetian lagoon.&lt;ref name="Commerce789"/&gt; The furnaces used to make molten glass were a fire hazard, especially to cities with wooden structures nearby. The removal of the threat of a disaster from fire was not the only reason for moving the glassmaking industry to Murano. The glassmaking, ''and the glassmakers'', were kept in Murano. The Venetian government did what it believed was necessary to prevent the spread of Venetian glassmaking expertise to potential competitors. Glassmakers could not leave the island without permission from the government. Leaving without permission, or revealing trade secrets, was punishable by death. Another advantage for the Murano location was that imports and exports could easily be monitored.&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murano in the 1200s was a summer resort where the aristocrats of Venice built villas with orchards and gardens. It took about an hour to row a boat from Venice to Murano.&lt;ref name="Zerwick4950"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the glassmakers could not leave the island, the nobles had no constraints. Despite their travel restrictions, the glassmakers lived on a beautiful island, were under the direct rule of Venice's [[Council of Ten]], and had extra privileges.&lt;ref name="Moore31"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not work during the hot summer, as furnace repair and maintenance was conducted at that time.&lt;ref name="Dillon182"&gt;{{harvnb|Dillon|1907|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1300s, the annual summer vacation lasted five months.&lt;ref name="Toso37"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1400s, the summer vacation was shortened to three and one half months.&lt;ref name="Toso45"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the Murano glassworkers believed they were not working enough.{{#tag:ref|In the 1540s, the Murano glassworkers were unhappy with the 35-week work year, complaining that they ''did not get enough time to work''—contrary to typical complaints of too much work.&lt;ref name="Moore33"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}  Glassmakers also enjoyed heightened status. On December 22, 1376, it was announced that if a glassmaker's daughter married a nobleman, there was no forfeiture of social class—and their children were noble.&lt;ref name="Toso40"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major products and innovations==

The glassmakers of Murano are known for many innovations and refinements to glassmaking. Among them are [[Murano beads]], ''[[cristallo]]'', [[Milk glass|''lattimo'']], [[chandelier]]s, and mirrors.&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"/&gt; Additional refinements or creations are [[Goldstone (glass)|goldstone]], multicolored glass ([[millefiori]]), and imitation gemstones made of glass.&lt;ref name="Geary202"&gt;{{harvnb|Geary|2008|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to guarding their secret processes and glass recipes, Venetian/Murano glassmakers strived for beauty with their glass.&lt;ref name="HarperJan1882P181183"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ancient and Modern Venetian Glass of Murano |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yktOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=Giuseppe+Briati+chandelier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiugpviidndAhWOr1kKHYyQC6E4ChDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Giuseppe%20Briati%20chandelier&amp;f=false |magazine= Harper's New Monthly Magazine&lt;!-- Page 181 and 183 --&gt;|location=New York |publisher=Harper and Brothers |date=1882-01-01 |access-date=2018-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aventurine===
Aventurine glass, also known as goldstone glass, is translucent brownish with metallic (copper) specs. It was developed by Venetian glassmakers in the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Shotwell24"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first cited in historical documents in 1626.&lt;ref name="Toso97"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name aventurine is used because it was discovered accidentally.&lt;ref name="Toso97"/&gt;

===Beads===
Glass beads (a.k.a. [[Murano beads]]) were made by the Venetians beginning in the 1200s. The beads were used as [[Prayer beads|rosary beads]] and jewelry. They were also popular in [[Africa]]. [[Christopher Columbus]] noted that the people of the [[New World]] (Native Americans) were "delighted" with the beads as gifts, and beads became popular with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]].&lt;ref name="Zerwick5051"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Calcedonio''===
''Calcedonio'' is a marbled glass that looked like the semiprecious stone [[chalcedony]].&lt;ref name="Getty90"&gt;{{harvnb|Hess|Husband|J. Paul Getty Museum|1999|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of glass was created during the 1400s by [[Angelo Barovier]], who is considered Murano's greatest glassmaker.&lt;ref name="Chambers21"&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|Oldknow|Ft. Wayne Museum of Art|Tampa Museum of Art|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barovier was an expert glassblower, revived enameling, and also worked with colored glass.  His family had been involved with glassmaking since at least 1331, and the family continued in the business after his death.&lt;ref name="McCray"&gt;{{harvnb|McCray|2002|p=chapter 2 of e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1460.{{#tag:ref|At least three authors agree that Angelo Barovier died in 1460.&lt;ref name="Toso46"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shotwell30"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of his birth is less certain, but is said to be around 1400.&lt;ref name="Chambers22"/&gt;|group=Note}}

===Chandeliers===
During the 1700s, Giuseppe Briati was famous for his work with ornamented mirrors and chandeliers.&lt;ref name="HarperJan1882P181183"/&gt; Briati's chandelier style was called ''ciocche''—literally bouquet of flowers. Briati's typical chandelier was large with multiple arms decorated with garlands, flowers and leaves. One of the common uses of the huge Murano chandeliers was interior lighting for theatres and important rooms in palaces. Briati was born in Murano in 1686, and his family's business was glassmaking. He was allowed to work in a Bohemian glass factory, where he learned the secrets of working with Bohemian crystal—which was becoming more popular than Murano ''cristallo''. In 1739, the Council of Ten allowed him to move his furnace from Murano to Venice because his work had caused such jealousy that he and his workers feared for their lives. (His father had been stabbed to death in 1701.)&lt;ref name="Toso122124"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|pp=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briati retired in 1762, and his nephew became manager of the glass works. Briati died in Venice in 1772, and is buried in Murano.&lt;ref name="Toso127"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cristallo''===
''Cristallo'' is a soda glass, created during the 15th century by Murano's Angelo Barovier.{{#tag:ref|Angelo Barovier is generally credited with creating ''cristallo'', and was definitely making it in 1455.&lt;ref name="Moore37"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; One set of authors believes that ''cristallo'' was an incremental "development that stretched over nearly two centuries."&lt;ref name="Syson186"&gt;{{harvnb|Syson|Thornton|2000|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speculate that Barovier perfected the soda ash purification process used for ''cristallo'', and also discovered the stabilizer.&lt;ref name="Syson186"/&gt;|group=Note}} The oldest reference to ''cristallo'' is dated May 24, 1453.&lt;ref name="Toso46"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, ''cristallo'' was considered Europe's clearest glass, and is one of the main reasons Murano became "the most important glass center".&lt;ref name="Shotwell366"/&gt; It looked like [[quartz]], which was said to have magical qualities and often used in religious objects. ''Cristallo'' became very popular.&lt;ref name="Chambers22"&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|Oldknow|Ft. Wayne Museum of Art|Tampa Museum of Art|1999|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of glass was fragile and difficult to cut, but it could be [[Enamelled glass|enameled]] and [[Glass engraving|engraved]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell110"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glass coloring and color marking#Coloring ions|Manganese]] was a key ingredient in the secret formula used to make ''cristallo''.&lt;ref name="Shotwell587"/&gt; An easy modification to ''cristallo'' made in Murano was to produce a frosted or crackle version.&lt;ref name="Dillon203"&gt;{{harvnb|Dillon|1907|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Filigrana''===
The ''filigrana'' (a.k.a. filigree) style was developed in Murano in the 1500s. By embedding glass canes (usually white but not always) in colorless glass, the glassware has a striped appearance. ''Vetro a fili'' has straight white stripes, ''vetro a retortoli'' has twisted or spiral patterns, and ''vetro a reticello'' has two sets of lines twisted in opposite directions. Francesco Zeno has been mentioned as the inventor of ''vetro a retortoli''.&lt;ref name="Page18"&gt;{{harvnb|Page|Doménech|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lattimo''===
''Lattimo'', or milk glass, began being made in Murano during the 15th century, and Angelo Barovier is credited with its re-discovery and development.&lt;ref name="Getty73"&gt;{{harvnb|Hess|Husband|J. Paul Getty Museum|1999|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This glass is opaque white, and was meant to resemble enameled porcelain.&lt;ref name="Shotwell294"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was often decorated with enamel showing sacred scenes or views of Venice.&lt;ref name="Fuga257"&gt;{{harvnb|Fuga|2006|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Millefiori''===
''Millefiori'' glass is a variation of the [[murrine]] technique made from colored [[caneworking|canes]] in clear glass, and is often arranged in flower-like patterns. The Italian word ''millefiori'' means thousand flowers.&lt;ref name="Shotwell24"/&gt; This technique was perfected in Alexandria, Egypt, and began being used in Murano in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Fuga282"&gt;{{harvnb|Fuga|2006|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mirrors===
Small mirrors were made in Murano beginning in the 1500s, and mirror makers had their own guild beginning in 1569.&lt;ref name="Shotwell351"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murano mirrors were known for the artwork on the frame that held the mirror in addition to their quality.&lt;ref name="Shotwell351"/&gt; By the 1600s, Murano mirrors were in great demand. However, by the end of the century, English-made mirrors had the best quality. Only one glass house in Murano was still making mirrors by 1772.&lt;ref name="Moore48"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1935|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murrine===
Murrine technique begins with the layering of colored liquid glass, heated to {{convert|1900|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, which is then stretched into long rods called canes. When cooled, these canes are then sliced in cross-sections, which reveals the layered pattern. Ercole Barovier, a descendent of Murano's greatest glassmaker Angelo Barovier, won numerous awards during the 1940s and 1950s for his innovations using the murrine technique.&lt;ref name="AC19990219P123"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sommerso''===
''Sommerso'' ("submerged" in Italian), is a form of artistic Murano glass that has layers of contrasting colors (typically two), which are formed by dipping colored glass into another molten glass and then blowing the combination into a desired shape. The outermost layer, or casing, is often clear. ''Sommerso'' was developed in Murano during the late 1930s. [[Flavio Poli]] was known for using this technique, and it was made popular by Seguso Vetri d'Arte and the Mandruzzato family in the 1950s. This process is a popular technique for vases, and is sometimes used for sculptures.&lt;ref name="AC19990219P123"/&gt;

==Golden age, decline, and revival==
{{See also|Fall of the Republic of Venice}}
[[File:Coupe avec cortège allégorique (Louvre, OA 7564).jpg|thumb|right|alt=jar on stand with lid, multiple colors|Barovier enameled glass]]The [[16th century]] was the golden age for glassmaking in Murano. Major trading partners included the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Indies]], Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the German-speaking states.&lt;ref name="Toso61"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 28 glassmaking furnaces were in Murano in 1581.&lt;ref name="Toso62"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous leaders and dignitaries visited Murano during this century, including the queen of France, dukes, princes, generals, cardinals, archbishops, and ambassadors.&lt;ref name="Toso64"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectors of Murano glass included [[Henry VIII of England]], [[Pope Clement VII]], [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand of Hungary]], [[Francis I of France]], and [[Phillip II of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Toso66"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the dominance of ''cristallo'' came to an end. In 1673, [[England|English]] glass merchant [[George Ravenscroft]] created a clear glass he called ''crystalline''—but it was not stable. Three years later, he improved this glass by adding lead oxide, and [[lead glass]] (a.k.a. crystal) was created.&lt;ref name="Toso102"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravenscroft, who had lived for many years in Venice, made lead crystal that was less breakable than ''cristallo''.&lt;ref name="Zerwick65"&gt;{{harvnb|Zerwick|1990|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1674, [[Bohemia]]n glassmaker Louis Le Vasseur made crystal that was similar to Ravenscroft's.&lt;ref name="Toso103"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1678, Johan Friedrich Kunkel von Lowenstein produced a ''cristallo''-like glass in [[Potsdam]].&lt;ref name="Toso105"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bohemian and [[Prussia]]n-style glass was later modified by the addition of lime and chalk. This new glass is attributed to Bohemian glassmaker Michael Müller in 1683.&lt;ref name="Toso105"/&gt; The Bohemian glass was not suitable to the Murano-style artwork on the glass. However, this harder glass was produced as a thicker glass suitable for engraving and grinding. The Bohemian and English glass eventually became more popular than ''cristallo'' made in Murano.&lt;ref name="Toso105"/&gt; By the 1700s, Murano glass was traded mostly with Italian states and the Turkish empire. Small quantities were traded with England, Flanders, the Netherlands and Spain.&lt;ref name="Toso109"&gt;{{harvnb|Toso|2000|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]] conquered Venice during May 1797, and the Venetian Republic came to an end.&lt;ref name="Madden17"&gt;{{harvnb|Madden|2012|p=Ch. 17 of e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the Venetian Republic caused hard times for glassmaking in Murano, and some of the Murano methods became lost. Controlled by France and Austria, Venetian glassmaking became unprofitable because of tariffs and taxes—and glassmakers that survived were reduced to making mostly beads.&lt;ref name="CE19980911P15"&gt;{{cite news

==Making glass==
[[File:Making a Glass Horse (7251890544).jpg|thumb|right|alt=tools holding glass horse being shaped|Glassmaking tools in use]]
From its beginning until the fall of the Venetian Republic, Murano glass was mostly a very high quality [[Soda-lime glass|soda lime glass]] (using today's terminology) that had extra attention focused on its appearance. Glass from that time typically contained 65 to 70 percent [[Silicon dioxide|silica]].&lt;ref name="Janssens26"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flux, usually [[Sodium oxide|soda]] (sodium oxide as 10 to 20 percent of the glass composition) was added to enable the silica to melt at a lower temperature. A stabilizer, usually [[Calcium oxide|lime]] (calcium oxide as about 10 percent of the glass) was also added for durability and to prevent solubility in water. Small quantities of other ingredients were added to the glass, mostly to affect appearance.&lt;ref name="Janssens528"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sand is a common source for silica. For certain types of glass, the Murano glassmakers used quartz as their source for silica. Quartz pebbles were crushed into a fine powder. Two sources for sand were [[Crete|Creta]] and [[Sicily]]. Quartz pebbles were selected from the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] and [[Adige]] rivers in [[Northern Italy]].&lt;ref name="Janssens524"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their source for soda was what they called [[Salsola soda|''allume catina'']]—plant ash found in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] countries of the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Janssens26"/&gt; Beginning in the 16th century, ''allume catina'' was also imported from Mediterranean coastal regions of Spain and France.&lt;ref name="Janssens524"/&gt;
 
The mixing and melting of the batch of ingredients was a two-stage process. First, nearly equal amounts of silica and flux were continuously stirred in a special furnace. The furnace was called a ''calchera'' furnace, and the mix was called ''fritta''. In the second stage, the ''fritta'' was mixed with selected recycled waste glass (cullet) and melted in another furnace.&lt;ref name="Janssens523"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type and color of glass, other additives were used. [[Lead]] and [[tin]] were added for white opaque glass (''latimo''). [[Cobalt]] was used for blue glass. [[Copper]] and [[iron]] were used for green and for various shades of green, blue, and yellow.&lt;ref name="Janssens531-532"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|pp=531–532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese was used to remove colors.&lt;ref name="Janssens526"&gt;{{harvnb|Janssens|2011|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although natural gas is the furnace fuel of choice for glassmaking today, the fuel mandated in Murano during the 13th century was [[alder]] and [[willow]] wood.&lt;ref name="Toso25"/&gt; During this second stage, the surface of the molten glass was skimmed to remove undesirable chemicals that affected the appearance of the glass.&lt;ref name="Janssens523"/&gt; Additional techniques were used as glassmaking evolved. To improve clarity, molten glass was put in water and then re-melted. Another technique was to purify the flux by boiling and filtering.&lt;ref name="Janssens528"/&gt;

===Tools===
The Venetian glassmakers had a set of tools that changed little for hundreds of years. A ''ferro sbuso'', also called a ''canna da soffio'', is the [[Glassblowing|blowpipe]] essential for extracting molten glass and beginning the shaping process.&lt;ref name="Mentasti188"&gt;{{harvnb|Mentasti|1992|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''borselle'' is a tong-like tool of various sizes used to shape glass that has not hardened. A ''borselle puntata'' is a similar tool, only it has a pattern that an be imprinted on the glass.&lt;ref name="Shotwell48"&gt;{{harvnb|Shotwell|2002|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''pontello'' is an iron rod that holds the glass while work is done on the edge of the glass.&lt;ref name="Toso45"/&gt;  A ''tagianti'' is a large scissors used to cut glass before it has hardened. A ''scagno'' is the workbench used by the glassmaker.&lt;ref name="Dorigato31"&gt;{{harvnb|Dorigato|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Good tools are nice, but good hands are better," is an old Murano saying that reinforces the idea that the glassmakers of Murano rely on their skills instead of any advantage caused by special tools.&lt;ref name="CMOGtools"&gt;{{cite web

Some of Murano's historical glass factories remain well known [[brand]]s today, including De Biasi, Gabbiani, [[Paolo Venini|Venini]], [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]], [[Barovier &amp; Toso]], [[Pauly &amp; C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]], [[Berengo Studio]], [[Seguso]], Formia International, Simone Cenedese, Alessandro Mandruzzato, Vetreria Ducale, Estevan Rossetto 1950 and others. The oldest glass factory is Antica Vetreria Fratelli Toso, founded in 1854.&lt;ref name="Gable44"&gt;{{harvnb|Gable|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the industry has been shrinking as demand has waned. Imitation works (recognizable by experts but not by the typical tourist) from Asia and Eastern Europe take an estimated 40 to 45 percent of the market for Murano glass, and public tastes have changed while the designs in Murano have largely stayed the same. To fight the imitation problem, a group of companies and concerned individuals created a trademark in 1994 that certifies that the product was made on Murano. By 2012, about 50 companies were using the Artistic Glass Murano® trademark of origin.&lt;ref name="TheGuardianMuranoWeb"/&gt;

Glassmaking is a difficult and uncomfortable profession, as glassmakers must work with a product heated to extremely high temperatures. Unlike 500 years ago, children of glassmakers do not enjoy any special privileges, extra wealth, or marriage into nobility. Today, it is difficult to recruit young glassmakers.&lt;!--One Murano glassmaker, who had worked in the business for generations, told the author that his son would rather play soccer and had no interest in glass.--&gt; Foreign imitations, and difficulty attracting young workers, caused the number of professional glassmakers in Murano to decrease from about 6,000 in 1990 to fewer than 1,000 by 2012.&lt;ref name="TheGuardianMuranoWeb"&gt;{{cite web

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by [[latitude]] and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/pastcc.html|title = Past Climate Change|publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hugh Anderson|author2=Bernard Walter|date = March 28, 1997|url = http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/land/global/climchng.html |title = History of Climate Change|publisher = NASA|accessdate = January 7, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123130745/http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/land/global/climchng.html |archivedate = January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Weart|first = Spencer|date=June 2006|url = http://www.aip.org/history/climate/|title = The Discovery of Global Warming|publisher = American Institute of Physics|accessdate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity produced the primordial atmosphere.

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] which broke apart about 540&amp;nbsp;million years ago, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Murphy |author2=R.D.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W. Schopf |editor2=C. Klein |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=51–52 |isbn=978-0521366151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raup |first=David M. |author2=J.

Over the past 66&amp;nbsp;million years, mammalian life diversified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Dorian Sagan |date=1995 |title=What is Life? |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0684813264 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], produced by the proliferation of [[algae]] during the [[Siderian]] period, required about 300&amp;nbsp;million years to culminate.

The present era is classified as part of a mass [[extinction event]], the [[Holocene extinction]] event, the fastest ever to have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Diamond J|title = The present, past and future of human-caused extinctions|journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|volume = 325|issue = 1228|pages = 469–76; discussion 476–77|date = 1989|pmid = 2574887|doi = 10.1098/rstb.1989.0100|last2 = Ashmole|first2 = N.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.

Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water on Earth==
[[File:44 - Iguazu - Décembre 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Iguazu Falls]] on the border between [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]]]
{{Main|Water}}
'''Water''' is a [[chemical substance]] that is composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and is vital for all known forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |title=Water for Life |publisher=Un.org |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In typical usage, ''water'' refers only to its liquid form or [[States of matter|state]], but the substance also has a solid state, [[ice]], and a [[gas]]eous state, [[water vapor]], or [[steam]]. &lt;!--About 1.460 [[Tonne#Multiples|petatonnes]]&amp;nbsp;(Pt) (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of water--&gt;Water covers 71% of the [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=World|work=CIA – World Fact Book|accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in [[aquifer]]s and 0.001% in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds, and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System], Special Report, American Geophysical Union, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080220070111/http://www.unep.org/dewa/assessments/ecosystems/water/vitalwater/ Vital Water]. [[UNEP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [[glacier]]s, and polar [[ice cap]]s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}". [http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spilhaus | first1 = Athelstan F | year = 1942 | title = Maps of the whole world ocean | url = | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 431–35 | doi=10.2307/210385| jstor = 210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake
|author=Britannica Online
|accessdate=June 25, 2008
|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Definition|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lake|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.
[[File:PenasBlancas, part of the Bosawas Reserve, Jinotega Department, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|left|Peñas Blancas, part of the [[Bosawás Biosphere Reserve]]. Located northeast of the city of [[Jinotega]] in Northeastern Nicaragua.]]
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|[[Old-growth forest|Old growth]] [[European Beech]] forest in [[Biogradska Gora]] National Park, [[Montenegro]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons).

Once life had appeared, the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and [[DNA]] evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.&lt;ref name=Line/&gt;

When basic forms of plant life developed the process of [[photosynthesis]] the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EiDRcB90pWMC&amp;pg=PA24|title=Nature|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant [[oxygen]] accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the [[ozone layer]].

With the ozone layer absorbing harmful [[ultraviolet radiation]], life colonized the surface of Earth.

These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Szewzyk U|author2 = Szewzyk R|author3 = Stenström T|title = Thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria isolated from a deep borehole in granite in Sweden|doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1810|journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume = 91|issue = 5|pages = 1810–13|date = 1994|pmid = 11607462|pmc = 43253|bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.1810S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some microorganisms are [[pathogenic]] and can post health risk to other organisms.

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

==Human interrelationship==
{{Human timeline}}
[[File:Na Pali Coast - Kauai.jpg|thumb|left|Despite their natural beauty, the secluded valleys along the [[Na Pali Coast]] in Hawaii are heavily modified by introduced [[invasive species]] such as [[She-oak]].]]
Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]
{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I. Overview of products and scientific results – Table 9. |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=P. A. R. |last1=Ade |first2=N. |last2=Aghanim |first3=C. |last3=Armitage-Caplan |last4=et al.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

==Beyond Earth==
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] ''(Sizes to scale, distances and illumination not to scale)'']]
[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

'''Nectar''' is a [[sugar]]-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called '''nectaries''', either within the [[flower]]s with which it attracts [[pollination|pollinating]] animals, or by '''extrafloral nectaries''', which provide a nutrient source to animal [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualists]], which in turn provide [[plant defense against herbivory#Indirect defenses|antiherbivore protection]].  Common nectar-consuming [[pollinator]]s include [[mosquito]]es, [[hoverfly|hoverflies]], [[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and [[Bat#Fruits and flower nectar|bats]]. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, [[African bee|''A. m. scutellata'']] and the [[western honey bee]].

Nectar is an ecologically important item, the sugar source for [[honey]]. It is also useful in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]] because the adult stages of some predatory insects feed on nectar. For example, the social wasp species ''[[Apoica flavissima]]'' relies on nectar as a primary food source. In turn, these wasps then hunt agricultural pest insects as food for their young. For example, thread-waisted wasps ([[genus]] ''[[Ammophila (Sphecidae)|Ammophila]]'') are known for hunting [[caterpillar]]s that are destructive to crops. Caterpillars however, do eventually become butterflies and moths, which are very important pollinators. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Nectar secretion increases as the flower is visited by pollinators. After pollination, the nectar is frequently reabsorbed into the plant.&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;

==Etymology==

''Nectar'' is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''nektar'', the [[fable|fabled]] drink of [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]].&lt;ref name="eol"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/nectar|title=Nectar|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|date=2018|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived as a compound of ''nek'', meaning death, and ''tar'', meaning the ability to overcome.&lt;ref name=eol/&gt; The common use of nectar refers to the "sweet liquid in flowers", first recorded in [[AD]] 1600.&lt;ref name=eol/&gt;

==Floral nectaries==
 
A nectary is floral [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] found in different locations in the flower.  The different types of floral nectaries include septal nectaries found on the [[sepal]], [[petal]] nectaries, staminal nectaries found on the [[stamen]], and gynoecial nectaries found on the [[ovary]] tissue.  The nectaries also may vary in color, number, and symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Willmer, Pat. Pollination and floral ecology. Princeton University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nectaries can also be categorized as structural or non-structural.  Structural nectaries refer to specific areas of tissue that exude nectar, such as the types of floral nectaries previously listed.  Non-structural nectaries secrete nectar infrequently from non-differentiated tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Susan W., Massimo Nepi, and Ettore Pacini, eds. Nectaries and nectar. Vol. 4. Dordrecht: Springer, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The different types of floral nectaries [[coevolved]] depending on the pollinator that feeds on the plant's nectar.   Nectar is secreted from [[epidermal]] cells of the nectaries by means of [[trichomes]] or modified [[stomata]].   The nectar comes from [[phloem]] with additional [[sugars]] that are secreted from the cells through [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]s packaged by the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahn, Abraham. “On the Structure of Floral Nectaries.” Botanical Gazette, vol. 113, no. 4, 1952, pp. 464–470. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2472434.&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers that have longer nectaries sometimes have a [[vascular]] strand in the nectary to assist in transport over a longer distance.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Gary D. "Studies of the Monotropoideae (Ericaceae). Floral nectaries: anatomy and function in pollination ecology." American Journal of Botany (1977): 199-206.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Floral nectaries are used by plants to attract [[pollinators]] such as [[insects]], [[hummingbirds]], and other [[vertebrates]].  The pollinators feed on the nectar and depending on the location of the nectary the pollinator assists in [[fertilization]] and [[outcrossing]] of the plant as they brush against the reproductive organs, the [[stamen]] and [[pistil]], of the plant and pick up or deposit [[pollen]].&lt;ref&gt;Heil, Martin. "Nectar: generation, regulation and ecological functions." Trends in plant science 16.4 (2011): 191-200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nectar from floral nectaries is sometimes used as a reward to insects, such as [[ants]], that protect the plant from predators.  Many floral families have evolved a nectar [[spur]].  These spurs are projections of various lengths formed from different tissues, such as the petals or sepals.  They allow for pollinators to land on the elongated tissue and more easily reach the nectaries and obtain the nectar reward.&lt;ref&gt;Willmer, Pat. Pollination and floral ecology. Princeton University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Different characteristics of the spur, such as its length or position in the flower, may determine the type of pollinator that visits the flower.&lt;ref&gt;Pacini, E. N. M. V. J., M. Nepi, and J. L. Vesprini. "Nectar biodiversity: a short review." Plant Systematics and Evolution 238.1-4 (2003): 7-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Defense from [[herbivory]] is often one of the roles of extrafloral nectaries.  Floral nectaries can also be involved in defense.  In addition to the [[sugars]] found in nectar, certain [[proteins]] may also be found in nectar secreted by floral nectaries.  In [[tobacco]] plants, these proteins have [[antimicrobial]] and [[antifungal]] properties and can be secreted to defend the [[gynoecium]] from certain pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburg, Robert W., et al. "A major function of the tobacco floral nectary is defense against microbial attack." Plant Systematics and Evolution 238.1-4 (2003): 211-218.&lt;/ref&gt;     

Floral nectaries have [[evolved]] and diverged into the different types of nectaries due to the various pollinators that visit the flowers.  In [[Melastomataceae]], different types of floral nectaries have evolved and been lost many times.  Flowers that ancestrally produced nectar and had nectaries may have lost their ability to produce nectar due to a lack of nectar consumption by pollinators, such as certain species of [[bees]].  Instead they focused on energy allocation to [[pollen]] production.  Species of [[angiosperms]] that have nectaries use the nectar to attract pollinators that consume the nectar, such as [[birds]] and [[butterflies]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Bruce A., and Hiroshi Tobe. "Floral nectaries in Melastomataceae and their systematic and evolutionary implications." Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden (1989): 519-531.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bromeliaceae]], septal nectaries are common in species that are insect or bird pollinated.  In species that are wind pollinated, nectaries are often absent because there is no pollinator to provide a reward for.&lt;ref&gt;Floral anatomy of Bromeliaceae, with particular reference to the evolution of epigyny and septal nectaries in commelinid monocotSajo, M. G., P. J. Rudall, and C. J. Prychid. "Floral anatomy of Bromeliaceae, with particular reference to the evolution of epigyny and septal nectaries in commelinid monocots." Plant Systematics and Evolution 247.3-4 (2004): 215-231.&lt;/ref&gt; In flowers that are generally pollinated by long-tongued organism such as certain [[flies]], [[moths]], butterflies, and birds, nectaries in the ovaries are common because they are able to reach the nectar reward when pollinating.  Septal and petal nectaries are often more common in species that are pollinated by short-tongued insects that cannot reach so far into the flower.&lt;ref&gt;Rudall, Paula J., John C. Manning, and Peter Goldblatt. "Evolution of floral nectaries in Iridaceae." Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden (2003): 613-631.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Myrmecophily|Plant defenses against herbivory}}
Extrafloral nectaries (also known as extranuptial nectaries) are nectar-secreting plant glands that develop outside of flowers and are not involved in [[pollination]].&lt;ref name="Heil"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heil | first1 = M.| last2 = Fiala | first2 = B.| last3 = Baumann | first3 = B. | last4 = Linsenmair | first4 = K.E. | title = Temporal, spatial and biotic variations in extrafloral nectar secretion by ''Macaranga tanarius'' | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2435.2000.00480.x | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 749 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are highly diverse in form, location, size, and mechanism.

In contrast to floral nectaries, nectar produced outside the flower generally have a defensive function. The nectar attracts predatory insects which will eat both the nectar and any [[herbivore|plant-eating]] insects around, thus functioning as 'bodyguards'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521819415 Plant-Provided Food for Carnivorous Insects - Cambridge University Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Foraging predatory insects show a preference for plants with extrafloral nectaries, particularly some species of [[ant]]s and [[wasp]]s, which have been observed to directly defend the plants.&lt;ref name="Heil"/&gt; Among [[Passiflora|passion flowers]], for example, extrafloral nectaries prevent herbivores by attracting ants and deterring two species of butterflies from laying eggs.&lt;ref name="sezen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezen|first=Uzay|title=Ants defending extrafloral nectaries of the passion flower (''Passiflora incarnata'')|url=http://vimeo.com/34448448|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[carnivorous plant]]s, extrafloral nectaries are also used to attract insect [[prey]].&lt;ref&gt;Merbach, M. 2001. Nectaries in ''Nepenthes''. In: C.M. Clarke ''[[Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia]]''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin understood that extrafloral nectar "though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects" but believe the "their visits do not in any way benefit the plant".&lt;ref name="mancuso"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mancuso | first1 = S. | title = Federico Delpino and the foundation of plant biology | doi = 10.4161/psb.5.9.12102 | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 1067–1071 | year = 2010 | pmid =  21490417| pmc = 3115070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he believed that extrafloral nectaries were [[Excretion|excretory]] in nature ([[hydathode]]s). Their defensive functions were first recognized by the [[Italian people|Italian]] [[botanist]] [[Federico Delpino]] in his important [[monograph]] ''Funzione mirmecofila nel regno vegetale'' (1886). Delpino's study was inspired by a disagreement with  [[Charles Darwin]], with whom he corresponded regularly.&lt;ref name="mancuso"/&gt;

Extrafloral nectaries have been reported in over 3941 species of [[vascular plant]]s belonging to 745 [[genus|genera]] and 108 [[family (biology)|families]], 99.7% of which belong to [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms), comprising 1.0 to 1.8% of all known species. They are most common among [[eudicot]]s, occurring in 3642 species (of 654 genera and 89 families), particularly among [[rosids]] which comprise more than half of the known occurrences. The families showing the most recorded occurrences of extrafloral nectaries are [[Fabaceae]], with 1069 species, [[Passifloraceae]], with 438 species, and [[Malvaceae]], with 301 species. The genera with the most recorded occurrences are ''[[Passiflora]]'' (322 species, Passifloraceae), ''[[Inga]]'' (294 species, Fabaceae), and ''[[Acacia]]'' (204 species, Fabaceae).&lt;ref name="weber&amp;keeler2012"/&gt; Other genera with extrafloral nectaries include ''[[Salix]]'' ([[Salicaceae]]), ''[[Prunus]]'' ([[Rosaceae]]) and ''[[Gossypium]]'' ([[Malvaceae]]).&lt;ref name="sezen"/&gt;

Foliar nectaries have also been observed in 39 species of [[fern]]s belonging to seven genera and four families of [[Cyatheales]] and [[Polypodiales]].&lt;ref name="weber&amp;keeler2012"/&gt; They are absent, however, in [[bryophyte]]s, [[gymnosperm]]s, early [[angiosperm]]s, [[magnoliids]], and members of [[Apiales]] among the eudicots.&lt;ref name="weber&amp;keeler2012"/&gt; [[Phylogenetic]] studies and the wide distribution of extrafloral nectaries among vascular plants point to multiple independent [[evolution]]ary origins of extrafloral nectaries in at least 457 independent lineages.&lt;ref name="weber&amp;keeler2012"/&gt;

==Components==
The main ingredients in nectar are sugars in varying proportions of [[sucrose]], [[glucose]], and [[fructose]].&lt;ref name="Chalcoff Ann.

The ''Nicotiana attenuata'', a tobacco plant native to the US state of [[Utah]], uses several [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] aromas to attract pollinating birds and moths. The strongest such aroma is [[benzylacetone]], but the plant also adds bitter [[nicotine]], which is less aromatic, so may not be detected by the bird until after taking a drink. Researchers speculate the purpose of this addition is to discourage the forager after only a sip, motivating it to visit other plants, therefore maximizing the pollination efficiency gained by the plant for a minimum nectar output.&lt;ref name=swn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], Vol. 86 No. 35, 1 Sept. 2008, "Two-Faced Flowers", p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Neurotoxins such as [[aesculin]] are present in some nectars such as that of the [[California buckeye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=82383 C.Michael Hogan (2008) ''Aesculus californica'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14124">'''Network Centric Product Support (NCPS)''' is an early application of an [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) computer architecture developed to leverage new information technologies and global networks to assist in managing maintenance, support and supply chain of complex products made up of one or more complex systems, such as in a mobile aircraft fleet or fixed location assets such as in building systems. This is accomplished by establishing digital threads connecting the physical deployed subsystem with its design [[Digital Twins]] virtual model by embedding intelligence through networked micro-[[web servers]] that also function as a computer [[workstation]] within each subsystem component (i.e. [[Engine control unit]] on an aircraft) or other controller and enabling 2-way communications using existing [[Internet]] technologies and communications networks - thus allowing for the extension of a [[product lifecycle]] management (PLM) system into a mobile, deployed product at the subsystem level in real time. NCPS can be considered to be the support flip side of [[Network-centric warfare]], as this approach goes beyond traditional logistics and aftermarket support functions by taking a [[complex adaptive system]] management approach and integrating field maintenance and logistics in a unified factory and field environment. Its evolution began out of insights gained by CDR Dave Loda (USNR) from Network Centric Warfare-based fleet battle experimentation at the US Naval Warfare Development Command (NWDC) in the late 1990s, who later lead commercial research efforts of NCPS in aviation at United Technologies Corporation. Interaction with the MIT [[Auto-ID Labs]], [[EPCglobal]], the Air Transport Association of America [[ATA Spec 100/iSpec 2200]] and other consortium pioneering the emerging machine to machine [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) architecture contributed to the evolution of NCPS.

==Purpose==
Simply put, this architecture extends the existing World Wide Web infrastructure of networked web servers down into the product at its subsystem's controller level using a [[Systems engineering|Systems Engineering]] "system of systems" nested approach. Its core is an embedded dual function webserver/computer workstation connected to the product controller's test ports (as used in retrofit applications, or integrated directly into the controller for new products), hence providing access to operational cycles, sensor and other information in a clustered, internet addressable node that allows for local or remote access, and the ability to host remotely reconfigurable software that can collect and process data from its mated subsystem controller onboard and pull in other computing resources throughout the network. It can then establish a localized wireless World Wide Web in and around the product that can be securely connected to by a mechanic with any web browser-equipped handheld independent of the greater World Wide Web, as well as seamlessly integrate into global networks when external wireless communications is available - thus creating data [[Digital Twins]] at the factory, connecting deployed product usage in the [[Product lifecycle]] with constantly updated digital threads. This allows for an integrated approach which enables both offline and online updates to occur. Legacy systems usually require a human to physically connect a laptop to the system controller or a [[Telematics|telematic]] solution to manually collect data and carry it back to a location where it can be later transferred to the factory or to restricted webserver-based download sites for offboard analysis.

The architecture also enables communications with other micro-webservers in its [[Computer cluster]] (i.e. in an aircraft), or to higher level clusters (such as an internet portal managed fleet and flight operations managers), thus enabling access to data resources and personnel and factory engineers at remote office computers through the World Wide Web. As stated previously, the system operates asynchronously, in that it does not have to be always connected to the World Wide Web to function; rather it simply operates locally, then synchronizes two-way information relevant to the subsystem, acting as a [[Gateway (telecommunications)]] on board that connects with other gateways within the network, which can be airborne or on the ground, on an as-needed basis when communications is available. This can be accomplished through a [[Wireless LAN Network]], [[satellite]], [[cellular network]] or other wireless or wired communications capabilities.

Security of the network is critical, and the architecture can utilize standard web security protocols, from [[Public-key cryptography]] to embedded hardware encryption devices.

==Typical Usage==
The extension of the World Wide Web architecture into the product is important to understand, as all decisions for manufacturing of spare parts, scheduling for flights, and other factory OEM and airline operator functions, are driven primarily by what happens to the product in the field (rate of wear and impending failure, primarily). Predicting the rate of wear, and hence the impact on operations and forecasting for producing spare parts in the future, is critical for optimizing operations for all involved. Managing a complex system such as a fleet of aircraft, vehicles or fixed location products can be accomplished in this manner. For example, coupled with technologies such as [[RFID]], the system could track parts from the factory to the aircraft on board, then continue to read the configuration of the subsystem’s replaceable tagged parts, map their configuration to hours run and duty cycles, then process/communicate the projected wear rate through the World Wide Web back to the operator or factory. In this way mechanical wear rates and future failures can be predicted more accurately and the forecasting of spare parts manufacturing and shipment can be significantly improved. This is called [[Prognostics]] Health Monitoring (PHM), which has become possible in recent years with the advent of electronic controllers, and is a recent evolutionary step in aircraft support and maintenance management that began as individual processes prior to World War II and solidified into a manual tracking system to support aircraft fleets in the Korean War. Support for the mechanic comes in local wireless access to technical information stored and remotely updated on board the micro-webserver component relevant to that product, such as service bulletins, factory updates, fault code driven, intelligent 3D computer game-like maintenance procedures, and social media applications for sharing of product issues and maintenance procedure improvements in the field to include collaborative 2-way voice, text and image communications. Note that this architecture can be utilized on any system that requires monitoring and trending, to include mobile medical applications for monitoring functionality of human systems when the subject is equipped with data sensors.

==Background and Other Examples==
The original micro-webserver component (i. e. the onboard unit) that is key to enabling the NCPS architecture was first prototyped and demonstrated in 2001 by David Loda, Enzo Macchia, Sam Quadri and Bjorn Stickling at United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney division and initially tested on board a [[Fairchild-Dornier 328]] (later AvCraft 328) regional jet in January 2002. It was introduced to the public and demonstrated at the [[Farnborough Airshow|Farnborough Air Show]] in July 2002 in prototype form and again in 2004 as a flight certified product offering marketed by United Technologies as the DTU and later FAST data management units for service in a number of aircraft and helicopter fleets.

A similar complex systems approach in a completely different application is successfully embodied in the Eisenhower [[Interstate Highway System]], though what is transported in NCPS is information, not cars and trucks. Network Centric Product Support, or net-centric product support, is an architectural concept, and merely connects the major avenues already existing in global communications and the internet down into the mobile product, extending maintenance and supply chain processes into an integrated product centric system with a real time [[Feedback|feedback loop]] to the designers, factory and maintainers as to product performance and reliability. For example, to gain information about a particular engine on a mobile aircraft, it is most efficient to send the inquiry to the engine directly and host all information generated and relevant to that system there, as well synchronize in a twin remote database for access and queuing when the engine system is not in communications. Other examples where this can be applied include shipping containers, automobiles, spacecraft, appliances, human medical monitoring, or any other complex product with sensors and subsystems that require maintenance support and monitoring.

Many organizations are beginning to see the value of a [[netcentric]] (also spelled "net-centric") approach to managing complex systems, including the [[Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium]] (NCOIC), which is an association of leading aerospace and defense contractors in the Network Centric Warfare arena. Network Centric thinking for aircraft operations, including Network Enabled Operations (NEO) demonstrations, also figure prominently in the commercial [[Next Generation Air Transportation System]] (NextGen) approach being made by the US Government to revamping air transportation management in the 21st Century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">A '''pan-region''' is a [[geographic region]] or state’s sphere of economic, political and cultural influence extending beyond that state's borders. For example, the pan-region of the [[United States of America]] (USA) regions both bordering the USA and its close neighbors including, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and many [[South American|South America]] other states.

==Origin of term==
The idea of pan-regions or spheres of economic and cultural influence was first developed by [[Karl Ernst Haushofer]] (8/27/1869-3/10/1946), a German General, [[Geography|geographer]] and [[Geopolitics|geo-politician]]. Pan-regions contributed to Geopolitik or the German theories of [[foreign policy]] during the interwar period (1918–1939) or the time from the end of [[World War I]] and the beginning of [[World War II]]. Haushofer’s pan-regions divided the world under three supreme leading states in [[economy]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Those three states included the USA who controlled [[North America]] and much of South America, [[Germany]] who controlled [[Europe]], much of [[Africa]] and [[western Asia]] and [[Japan]] who controlled central, eastern, and the islands of southern Asia. These leading states could expect their regions to develop economic and [[political alliance]] with their leading state as well as yield to [[International sanctions|sanctions]] and major cultural designations.

==Historical examples==
Historically, the world was divided into three spheres of control, however after the end of World War II, Germany and Japan’s control over their various regions have diminished with the success of other nations. For example, German control over Europe has suffered with the development of the [[Europe]]an Union and emergence of other foreign powers. Japan also is beginning to lose economic dominance over its pan-region with the emergence of a thriving [[Chinese economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter, and Colin Flint.

==Discovery==
At the end of the 1990s with the European project "Picodiv" it would be clarified which [[organism]]s occur in [[picoplankton]]. In addition, for a period of two years, samples were taken in the Atlantic, in the Mediterranean, before the coast of Scotland, Alaska and Norway. Picobiliphyta were found particularly within the nutrient-poor ranges from cold coastal seas, where they can constitute up to 50 percent of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].

==Affinities to other organisms==
[[Research]]ers investigated gene sequences of the [[18S ribosomal RNA]] gene, common to all [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. The identity of new organisms can be deduced from a comparison of familiar and unfamiliar gene sequences. “The gene sequences found in these algae could not be associated with any previously known group of organisms”, explain Dr Klaus Valentin and Dr. Linda Medlin, co-authors of the study and [[Molecular biology|molecular biologists]] at the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]] in [[Bremerhaven]]. The algae in this study were found in plankton samples originating from various regions of the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The scientists have discovered a group of organisms which, despite being completely new to science, have a wide distribution. “This is a good indication for how much there is still to discover in the oceans, especially using molecular tools”, says Valentin.

Apart from the unfamiliar gene sequences, the researchers also detected [[phycobiliprotein]]s.&lt;ref name="urlBizarre New Form of Life Found in Arctic Ocean, Scientists Announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/01/070111-new-lifeform.html |title=Bizarre New Form of Life Found in Arctic Ocean, Scientists Announce |website= |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[red algae]], for example, these proteins occur as pigments. But in this newly discovered group of algae, the phycobiliproteins appear to be contained inside the [[plastid]]s,&lt;ref name="isbn3-540-68692-4"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Henrik Aronsson |author2=Anna Stina Sandelius |title=The Chloroplast: Interactions with the Environment (Plant Cell Monographs) |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2008 |pages=9 |isbn=978-3-540-68692-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[photosynthesis]] occurs. Hence, it provides a clear indication that the researchers are dealing with previously unidentified group of algae. Referring to their small size and the presence of phycobiliproteins, the researchers named the new group "Picobiliphyta".

Two studies published in 2011 found the hypothesis that biliphytes, or picobiliphytes, were photosynthetic was likely to be false. A 2011 study by an international team from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Dalhousie University and the Natural History Museum London found that cells in the Pacific Ocean did not have fluorescence indicative of photosynthetic pigments, and concluded "...biliphytes are likely not obligate photoautotrophs but rather facultative mixotrophs or phagotrophs, whereby transient detection of orange fluorescence could represent ingested
prey items (e.g., the cyanobacterium Synechococcus)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Some sources group picobiliphytes within the [[cryptomonads-haptophytes assemblage]].&lt;ref name="urlEukaryotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Eukaryotes/3 |title=Eukaryotes |format= |website= |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, Dr. Seenivasan working in conjunction with Professors [[Michael Melkonian]] (University of Cologne) and Linda Medlin (Marine Biological Association of the UK) formally described the picobiliphytes as the heterotrophic nanoflagellate phylum, Picozoa, and published thin sections of the cells.  Several unique features in the cell, such as a feeding organelle, substantiate their unique phylogenetic position, an unusual movement, and heterotrophic mode of nutrition.  No traces of viral or bacterial particles were found inside these heterotrophic cells, which prompted these authors to suggest that they feed on organic particles. see link to Picozoa

*Picobiliphytes have been considered autotrophic algae; there is, however, a strong question mark over this fact. In a recent study there has been a thorough search for genes from plastid origin in three different picobiliphytes that has been unsuccessful. In this analysis several sequencing techniques have been applied and, with the help of comparative genomic tools, the authors have demonstrated that Picobilihytes have complex relationships with other microorganisms including virus, but they could not find any trace of plastid encoded genes.  These results strongly suggest that Picobiliphytes are most likely heterotrophic rather than autotrophic.  They have now been formally described as a heterotrophic nanoflagellate phylum, PIcozoa.

'''Population fragmentation''' is a form of population segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Proctor |first=Michael F. |last2=McLellan |first2=Bruce N. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Strobeck |first3=Curtis |year=2002 |title=Population Fragmentation of Grizzly Bears in Southeastern British Columbia, Canada |journal=Ursus |volume=8 |issue= |pages=153–160 |doi= |jstor=3873196 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often caused by [[habitat fragmentation]]. 

==Fragmentation causes==
Fragmentation can be natural or caused by human actions. In modern times, human activity is the most common cause.
* development of land around a protected area, sometimes by just a single road or fence line
* capture or killing of species in an area that links populations
* movement of a population away from other individuals of that species, such as the natural introduction of [[wolves and moose on Isle Royale]]
* geologic processes, such as landslides or volcanoes, dividing a habitat
* rising sea levels can separate islands from what was once a common landmass
* global warming, especially when coupled with mountains, can reduce movement from one habitat to another

==Genetic effects==
Population fragmentation causes [[inbreeding depression]], which leads to a decrease in genetic variability in the species involved.&lt;ref name="ProctorMcLellan"&gt;{{Citation |last=Proctor |first=M. F. |last2=McLellan |first2=B. N. |last3=Strobeck |first3=C. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Barclay |first4=R. M. R. |year=2005 |title=Genetic analysis reveals demographic fragmentation of grizzly bears yielding vulnerably small populations |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=272 |issue=1579 |pages=2409–2416 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3246 |pmid=16243699 |pmc=1559960 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decreases the fitness of the population for several reasons. First, inbreeding forces competition with relatives, which decreases the [[evolutionary fitness]] of the species.&lt;ref name="ProctorMcLellan"/&gt; Secondly, the decrease in genetic variability causes an increased possibility a lethal homozygous recessive trait may be expressed; this decreases the average litter size reproduced, indirectly decreasing the population.&lt;ref name="KrebsCJ"&gt;{{Citation |last=Krebs |first=C. J. |year=2009 |title=Ecology: The Experimental Analysis of Distribution and Abundance |edition=6th |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-321-50743-3 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; When a population is small, the influence of genetic drift increases, which leads to less and/or random fixation of alleles. In turn, this leads to increased homozygosity, negatively affecting individual fitness. The performance of plants may be compromised by less effective selection which causes an accumulation of deleterious mutations in small populations. Since individuals in small populations are more likely to be related, they are more likely to inbreed. A reduction in fitness may occur in small plant populations because of mutation accumulation, reduced genetic diversity, and increased inbreeding. Over time, the evolutionary potential and a species’s ability to adapt to a changing environment, such as climate change, is decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Leimu, R., Vergeer, P., Angeloni, F., &amp; Ouborg, N. J. 2010. Habitat fragmentation, climate change, and inbreeding in plants. The Year in Ecology and Conservation Biology 1195:84-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sonic soot blowers''' offer a cost-effective and non-destructive means of preventing [[Incinerator bottom ash|ash]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] build-up within the [[power generation]] industry. They use high energy – low frequency [[sound wave]]s that provide 360° particulate de-bonding and at a speed in excess of 344 metres per second. Because they employ non-destructive sound waves, unlike steam [[soot blower]]s they eliminate any concerns over [[corrosion]], [[erosion]] or mechanical damage and do not produce an [[effluent stream]].



The sonic soot blower can in some ways be compared to a musical [[Reed (instrument)|reed instrument]] such as an [[oboe]], where the ‘base tone’ is created by blowing air over a reed and then converting this ‘base tone’ into a particular high or low note, depending on how far the sound wave has to travel along inside the body of the instrument.

The sonic soot blower operates in the same manner, the ‘base tone’ being produced by passing [[compressed air]] into a wave generator which houses a [[titanium]] diaphragm causing it to oscillate rapidly. This ‘base tone’ is then converted into a range of selected frequencies ranging from 350&amp;nbsp;Hz down to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz by the design and length of the [[horn section]], producing the desired [[sound frequency]] at a sound level approaching 200 dB. The sonic soot blower is usually ‘sounded’ for a few seconds at intervals of between 3 and 10 minutes. This ‘sounding’ pattern is normally controlled via the plant’s PLC. However, it may also be operated by such means as a [[SCADA]] system, individual timers on each [[solenoid valve]] or via a manual [[ball valve]].

==Construction==

Sonic soot blowers are normally constructed from fabricated, 316 grade [[stainless steel]] as opposed to some [[sonic horn]]s which are manufactured from heavy [[cast iron]].   For installations in harsher environments, such as high temperature or acidic gas streams, other types of stainless steels are used such as 310, 316 and 825.

==Performance==

Sonic soot blowers create a rapid series of very powerful sound induced pressure fluctuations which when transmitted into the ash or particulate, cause them to de-bond from other particles and from the [[heat transfer]] surface to which they are bonded and so carried away in the gas stream. This prevents the ash from building up and [[sintering]] onto the [[boiler]] tubes thus significantly reducing [[thermal efficiency]]. This is in contrast to the operating principles of steam soot blowers which are usually only employed at most once every eight hours by which time the ash has built up and baked hard onto the heat transfer surfaces. The steam soot blower then tries to blast away his hard deposit, usually only from the leading edge of the steam tubes.

==Advantages==

Sonic soot blowers are a proven alternative to conventional steam soot blowers in power generation plants which burn a range of [[fossil fuel]]s and other waste fuels including [[biofuel]]s. Depending on the application and boiler plant design, sonic soot blowers usually totally replace existing high maintenance steam soot blowers whether of the retractable or rotary type. In a few cases, sonic soot blowers can be used to supplement steam soot blowers.
Sonic soot blower cleaning technologies can be applied in [[superheater]]s, generating sections, [[economizer]]s, and airheaters as well as downstream equipment such as [[electrostatic precipitator]]s, [[Baghouse#Fabric_filters|baghouse filters]] and fans.

The main advantages of sonic soot blowers over [[Soot blower|steam soot blowers]] are:-

•	Elimination of opacity spikes due to more regular, more efficient cleaning
•	No structural damage to tube bundles or boiler structure
•	Elimination of tube corrosion and erosion problems
•	360° cleaning of all tube surfaces – not harsh leading edge tube cleaning as with steam soot blowers
•	Prevention of ash build up and sintering on steam tubes due to sonic soot blowers regular operation
•	Extremely low maintenance or operational costs
•	Eco-friendly – helps to combat global [[climate change]] and the effect of [[global warming]]

In [[computer science]], '''unbounded nondeterminism''' or '''unbounded indeterminacy''' is a property of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] by which the amount of delay in servicing a request can become unbounded as a result of arbitration of contention for shared resources ''while still guaranteeing that the request will eventually be serviced''.  Unbounded nondeterminism became an important issue in the development of the [[denotational semantics#Denotational semantics of concurrency|denotational semantics of concurrency]], and later became part of research into the theoretical concept of [[hypercomputation]].

==Fairness==
Discussion of unbounded nondeterminism tends to get involved with discussions of ''fairness''. The basic concept is that all computation paths must be "fair" in the sense that if the machine enters a state infinitely often, it must take every possible transition from that state. This amounts to requiring that the machine be guaranteed to service a request if it can, since an infinite sequence of states will only be allowed if there is no transition that leads to the request being serviced. Equivalently, every possible transition must occur eventually in an infinite computation, although it may take an unbounded amount of time for the transition to occur. This concept is to be distinguished from the local fairness of flipping a "fair" coin, by which it is understood that it is possible for the outcome to always be heads for any finite number of steps, although as the number of steps increases, this will [[almost surely]] not happen.

An example of the role of fair or unbounded nondeterminism in the merging of strings was given by William D. Clinger, in his 1981 thesis. He defined a "fair merge" of two strings to be a third string in which each character of each string must occur eventually. He then considered the set of all fair merges of two strings {{mono|''merge''(S, T)}}, assuming it to be a monotone function. Then he argued that {{mono|''merge''(⊥,1&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;)⊆ ''merge''(0,1&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, where {{mono|⊥}} is the empty stream. Now {{mono|''merge''(⊥,1&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;) {{=}} {1&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;}}}, so it must be that {{mono|1&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an element of {{mono|''merge''(0,1&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, a contradiction. He concluded that:
:It appears that a fair [[merge algorithm|merge]] cannot be written as a nondeterministic data flow program operating on streams.

==On the possibility of implementing unbounded nondeterminism==
[[Edsger Dijkstra]] [1976] argued that it is impossible to implement systems with unbounded nondeterminism. For this reason, [[Tony Hoare]] [1978] suggested that "an efficient implementation should try to be reasonably fair."

==Nondeterministic automata==
[[Nondeterministic Turing machine]]s have only bounded nondeterminism.  Likewise sequential programs containing guarded commands as the only sources of nondeterminism have only bounded nondeterminism ([[Edsger Dijkstra]] [1976]).  Briefly, choice nondeterminism is bounded.  [[Gordon Plotkin]] gave a proof in his original 1976 paper on powerdomains:

:Now the set of initial segments of execution sequences of a given nondeterministic program {{mono|P}}, starting from a given state, will form a tree.  The branching points will correspond to the choice points in the program.  Since there are always only finitely many alternatives at each choice point, the branching factor of the tree is always finite.  That is, the tree is finitary.  Now [[Kőnig's lemma]] says that if every branch of a [[finitary]] tree is finite, then so is the tree itself.  In the present case this means that if every execution sequence of {{mono|P}} terminates, then there are only finitely many execution sequences.  So if an output set of {{mono|P}} is infinite, it must contain [a nonterminating computation].

==Indeterminacy versus nondeterministic automata==
William Clinger [1981] provided the following analysis of the above proof by Plotkin:
:This proof depends upon the premise that if every node {{mono|x}} of a certain infinite branch can be reached by some computation {{mono|c}}, then there exists a computation {{mono|c}} that visits every node {{mono|x}} on the branch. ... Clearly this premise follows not from logic but rather from the interpretation given to choice points.  This premise fails for arrival nondeterminism [in the arrival of messages in the Actor model] because of finite delay [in the arrival of messages].  Though each node on an infinite branch must lie on a branch with a limit, the infinite branch need not itself have a limit.  Thus the existence of an infinite branch does not necessarily imply a nonterminating computation.

==Unbounded nondeterminism and noncomputability==
Spaan et al. [1989] have argued that it is possible for an unboundedly nondeterministic program to solve the [[halting problem]]; their algorithm consists of two parts defined as follows:

The first part of the program requests a natural number from the second part; after receiving it, it will iterate the desired Turing machine for that many steps, and accept or reject according to whether the machine has yet halted.

The second part of the program nondeterministically chooses a natural number on request. The number is stored in a variable which is initialized to 0; then the program repeatedly chooses whether to increment the variable, or service the request. The fairness constraint requires that the request eventually be serviced, for otherwise there is an infinite loop in which only the "increment the variable" branch is ever taken.

Clearly, if the machine does halt, this algorithm has a path which accepts. If the machine does not halt, this algorithm will always reject, no matter what number the second part of the program returns.

==Arguments for dealing with unbounded nondeterminism==
Clinger and [[Carl Hewitt]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} have developed a model (known as the [[Actor model]]) of concurrent computation with the property of unbounded nondeterminism built in [Clinger 1981; Hewitt 1985; Hewitt and Agha 1991; Hewitt 2006b]; this allows ''computations'' that cannot be implemented by Turing Machines, as seen above. However, these researchers emphasize that their model of concurrent computations {{Citation needed span|text=cannot implement any functions that are outside the class of [[recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s|date=July 2017|reason=WP link doesn't support this claim}} defined by Church, Kleene, Turing, ''etc.''  (See [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]].)

Hewitt [2006] justified his use of unbounded nondeterminism by arguing that there is no bound that can be placed on how long it takes a computational circuit called an [[Arbiter (electronics)|''arbiter'']] to settle (see [[metastability in electronics]]).  Arbiters are used in computers to deal with the circumstance that computer clocks operate asynchronously with input from outside, ''e.g..'', keyboard input, disk access, network input, ''etc.''  So it could take an unbounded time for a message sent to a computer to be received and in the meantime the computer could traverse an unbounded number of states.

He further argued that [[Electronic mail]] enables unbounded nondeterminism since mail can be stored on servers indefinitely before being delivered, and that [[Channel (communications)|Communication links]] to [[Server (computing)|server]]s on the [[Internet]] can likewise be out of service indefinitely. This gave rise to the [[Actor model#Unbounded nondeterminism controversy|Unbounded nondeterminism controversy]].

==Hewitt's analysis of fairness==

Hewitt argued that issues in fairness derive in part from the global state point of view.  The oldest models of computation (e.g.. [[Turing machines]], Post productions, the [[lambda calculus]], etc.) are based on mathematics that makes use of a global state to represent a computational ''step''.  Each computational step is from one global state of the computation to the next global state.  The global state approach was continued in [[automata theory]] for [[Finite state machine|finite state]] machines and [[stack machine|push down stack]] machines including their [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic]] versions.  All of these models have the property of bounded nondeterminism: if a machine always halts when started in its initial state, then there is a bound on the number of states in which it can halt.

Hewitt argued that there is a fundamental difference between choices in global state nondeterminism and the arrival order indeterminacy (nondeterminism) of his [[Actor model]].  In global state nondeterminism, a "choice" is made for the "next" global state.  In arrival order indeterminacy, arbitration locally decides each arrival order in an unbounded amount of time. While a local arbitration is proceeding, unbounded activity can take place elsewhere.  There is no global state and consequently no "choice" to be made as to the "next" global state.

'''VBS2''' ('''Virtual Battlespace 2''') is the successor of the battlefield simulation system [[VBS1]]. It was developed in close cooperation with the [[USMC]], [[Australian Defence Force]] and other military customers of VBS1. VBS2 was officially launched on 17 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbs2.com/site/press_vbs_lch.html Bohemia Interactive announces the official release of VBS2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

VBS2 offers realistic [[virtual battlefield|battlefield simulations]] and the ability to operate land, sea, and air vehicles. Instructors may create new scenarios and then engage the simulation from multiple viewpoints. The squad-management system enables participants to issue orders to squad members.

VBS2 was designed for federal, state, and local government agencies and can be specifically tailored to meet the individual needs of military, law enforcement, [[homeland defense]], [[loadmaster]], and [[first responder]] training environments.

VBS2 may be used to teach doctrine, [[military tactics|tactics]], techniques, and procedures during [[squad]] and [[platoon]] [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], [[Defense (military)|defensive]], and [[patrolling]] operations. VBS2 delivers a synthetic environment for the practical exercise of the [[leadership]] and organizational behavior skills required to successfully execute unit missions.

VBS2 is suitable for training small teams in urban tactics, entire combat teams in [[combined arms]] operations or even non-military usage such as emergency response procedures in lethal and non-lethal environments or terrain visualization.

VBS2 is based on the VBS2[[Real Virtuality (engine)|Real Virtuality]] 2, also used in the video game [[Arma 2]].

==Technology==

The simulation engine driving VBS2 is [[Real Virtuality (engine)|Real Virtuality]] 2, developed by [[Bohemia Interactive]]. VBS2 allows a user to develop large terrain areas, over {{convert|10,000|km2}} in size (at any terrain resolution) and populate the terrain area with millions of objects in accordance with VMAP shape data, and then texture-map the entire representation with high-resolution satellite imagery or aerial photography.

Once the terrain representation is exported into VBS2, the simulation engine will provide a simulation of the real world, incorporating moving trees and grass, ground clutter, ambient animal life, shadows, dynamic lighting, weather and time of day.

A new streaming capability provides an efficient means of loading complex terrain areas as object and texture data is processed only when required. View distances are now typically five times greater than in [[VBS1]] (depending on [[CPU|processor]] speed) – [[culling (computer graphics)|level of detail cull]]ing has been improved to allow [[attack helicopter]]s and armoured vehicles to engage at realistic ranges, and [[forward observer]]s to call [[artillery]] fire from greater distances.

==Features==

VBS2 supports large [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] network sessions allowing [[join-in-progress]] and improved administrator functionality. VBS2 provides improved simulation of complex urban areas, including destructible buildings, round penetration through walls and operable and destructible doors. Weapon platforms are capable of thermal imaging, simulation of fire control systems and turret override. Multiple vehicle turrets are possible. Weapon [[ballistics]] have been improved.

The After-Action-Review module allows detailed review of a completed training mission, with every player, AI, vehicle movement being recorded, as well as any bullet path and any destruction to objects or terrain.

The VBS2 terrain editing tool, Visitor 3, will support direct import of terrain and shape data to recreate any area of operation in the simulation. VBS2 also includes real-time [[command and control]] functionality for large numbers of AI or human participants.

The VBS1 [[High level architecture (simulation)|HLA]]/[[Distributed Interactive Simulation|DIS]] gateway is updated and improved for VBS2 to meet HLA and DIS compliance.

==History==

In 2001, Bohemia Interactive Australia (BIA) was formed to take Operation Flashpoint and develop a militarised version suitable for Tactical training. By late 2001, the US Marine Corps was provided an alpha version of VBS1 and from their feedback, the after actions review (AAR) tool was added. The Australian Army used VBS1 for experimentation in 2003 and training trials in 2004 with the software being accepted, in 2005, as an Infantry and combined arms operations training tool.
In 2006 Calytrix Technologies developed LVCGame as a HLA and DIS gateway for VBS to allow constructive simulation entities and VBS entities to interact in wider exercises. VBS2 was released in beta in early 2007 and trialed as part of the ADF's Combined Arms Tactical Training (CATT) events. BIA then used feedback from both the ADF and USMC to finalize VBS2 throughout 2007 with the Virtual Tool Kit addition being released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simulationaustralia.org.au/archive/simtect/2007/Abstracts/97.html |title=SimTecT 2007 - The Evolution of 1st-Person Trainers: A Case-Study with VBS and HLA Integration |publisher=Simulationaustralia.org.au |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2009 the [[United States Army]] announced a new training program of record called Games for Training (GFT).  VBS2 was selected as the first person simulation flagship for the GFT program.  This announcement replaced a DARPA initiative known as [[DARWARS Ambush! Convoy Simulator]] which was subsequently retired as a training tool. Games for Training is currently managed by the TRADOC Capability Manager Gaming, located at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

An '''X-ray astronomy satellite''' studies [[X-ray]] emissions from celestial objects, as part of a branch of [[space science]] known as [[X-ray astronomy]]. Satellites are needed because X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites.

A detector is placed on a [[satellite]] which is then put into [[orbit]] well above the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Unlike balloons, instruments on satellites are able to observe the full range of the [[Dispersion (optics)|X-ray spectrum]]. Unlike sounding rockets, they can collect data for as long as the instruments continue to operate. For example, the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] has been operational for more than fifteen years.

==Active X-ray observatory satellites==
Satellites in use today include the [[XMM-Newton|XMM-Newton observatory]] (low to mid energy X-rays 0.1-15 keV) and the [[INTEGRAL]] satellite (high energy X-rays 15-60 keV). Both were launched by the [[European Space Agency]]. [[NASA]] has launched the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] and [[Chandra observatory|Chandra]] observatories. One of the instruments on Swift is the [http://www.swift.psu.edu/xrt/ Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT)].

[[Image:Goes14 firstimage.png|thumb|300px|This SXI image of the Sun was a first test of the imager taken on August 13, 2009, at 14:04:58 UTC.]]
The [[GOES 14]] spacecraft carries on board a Solar X-ray Imager to monitor the Sun's X-rays for the early detection of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other phenomena that impact the geospace environment.&lt;ref name=NOAAGOES&gt;{{cite web |title=GOES Solar X-ray Imager |url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sxi/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched into orbit on June 27, 2009, at 22:51 GMT from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|Space Launch Complex 37B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].

On January 30, 2009, the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] successfully launched the [[Koronas-Foton]] which carries several experiments to detect X-rays, including the TESIS telescope/spectrometer FIAN with SphinX soft X-ray spectrophotometer.

[[ISRO]] launched the multi-wavelength space observatory [[Astrosat]] in 2015. One of the unique features of ASTROSAT mission is that it enables the simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of various astronomical objects with a single satellite. ASTROSAT observes universe in the optical, Ultraviolet, low and high energy X-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, whereas most other scientific satellites are capable of observing a narrow range of wavelength band.

The [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI) gamma-ray observatory satellite Astro-rivelatore Gamma ad Imagini Leggero ([[AGILE (spacecraft)|AGILE]]) has on board the Super-AGILE 15-45 keV hard X-ray detector. It was launched on April 23, 2007, by the Indian [[PSLV]]-C8.&lt;ref name=ItalianWade&gt;{{cite web|author=Wade M |title=Chronology - Quarter 2 2007 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/20072.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118143515/http://astronautix.com/chrono/20072.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A soft X-ray solar imaging telescope is on board the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES-13]] weather satellite launched using a [[Delta IV]] from [[Cape Canaveral]] LC37B on May 24, 2006.&lt;ref name=WadeGOES&gt;{{cite web |author=Wade M |title=Chronology - Quarter 2 2006 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/20062.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been no GOES 13 SXI images since December 2006.

Although the [[ASTRO-E|Suzaku]] X-ray spectrometer (the first micro-calorimeter in space) failed on August 8, 2005, after launch on July 10, 2005, the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) are still functioning.

==Past X-ray observatory satellites==

Past observatories include [[SMART-1]], which contained an X-ray telescope for mapping lunar [[X-ray fluorescence]], [[ROSAT]], the [[Einstein Observatory]] (the first fully imaging X-ray telescope), the [[Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics|ASCA observatory]], [[EXOSAT]], and [[BeppoSAX]]. [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] was the first satellite launched specifically for the purpose of X-ray astronomy. [[Copernicus - Orbiting Astronomical Observatory-3|Copernicus]] which carried an X-ray detector built by [[University College London]]'s Mullard Space Science Laboratory made extensive X-ray observations. [[Astronomical Netherlands Satellite|ANS]] could measure X-ray photons in the energy range 2 to 30 keV. [[Ariel 5]] was dedicated to observing the sky in the X-ray band. [[High Energy Astronomy Observatory 1|HEAO-1]] scanned the X-ray sky over 0.2 keV - 10 MeV. [[Hakucho]] was Japan's first X-ray astronomy satellite. [[ISRO]]'s [[IRS-P3]] launched in 1996 with the Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE) on board which  aimed to study the time variability and spectral characteristics of cosmic X-ray sources and for detection of transient X-ray sources. IXAE instruments consisted of three identical pointed mode proportional counters (PPCs) operated in the energy range 2-20 keV, FOV of 2° x 2° and effective area of 1200 cm2, and an X-ray sky monitor (XSM) operating in the energy range 2-10 keV.

===Array of low-energy X-ray imaging sensors===
The [[Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors]] (ALEXIS) featured curved mirrors whose multilayer coatings reflect and focus low-energy X-rays or extreme ultraviolet light the way optical telescopes focus visible light. The launch of ALEXIS was provided by the [[United States Air Force]] Space Test Program on a [[Pegasus rocket|Pegasus]] Booster on April 25, 1993. The spacing of the [[molybdenum]] (Mo) and [[silicon]] (Si) layers on each telescope's mirror is the primary determinant of the telescope's photon energy response function. ALEXIS operated for 12 yr.

===OSO-3===
[[Image:Oso3 small.gif|300px|thumb|The [[Third Orbiting Solar Observatory]], OSO 3, carried a hard X-ray experiment (7.7 to 210 keV) and an MIT gamma-ray instrument (&gt;50 MeV), besides a complement of solar physics instruments.]]
The third Orbiting Solar Observatory ([[OSO 3]]) was launched on March 8, 1967, into a nearly circular orbit of mean altitude 550&amp;nbsp;km, inclined at 33° to the equatorial plane, deactivated on June 28, 1968, followed by reentry on April 4, 1982. Its XRT consisted of a continuously spinning wheel (1.7 s period) in which the hard X-ray experiment was mounted with a radial view. The XRT assembly was a single thin NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal plus phototube enclosed in a howitzer-shaped CsI(Tl) anti-coincidence shield. The energy resolution was 45% at 30 keV. The instrument operated from 7.7 to 210 keV with 6 channels. OSO-3 obtained extensive observations of solar flares, the diffuse component of cosmic X-rays, and the observation of a single flare episode from [[Scorpius X-1]], the first observation of an extrasolar X-ray source by an observatory satellite. Among the extrasolar X-ray sources OSO 3 observed were [[Luyten 726-8|UV Ceti]], [[YZ Canis Minoris]], [[EV Lacertae]] and [[AD Leonis]], yielding upper soft X-ray detection limits on flares from these sources.&lt;ref name=Tsikoudi&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tsikoudi V |author2=Hudson H |title=Upper limits on stellar flare X-ray emission from OSO-3 |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=1975 |volume=44|page=273|bibcode=1975A&amp;A....44..273T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ESRO 2B (Iris)===
[[Image:Esro-2b small.gif|300px|thumb|Iris was mainly intended to study X-ray and particle emissions from the Sun, however, it is credited with some extra-solar observations.]]

[[ESRO 2B]] (Iris) was the first successful [[ESRO]] satellite launch. Iris was launched on May 17, 1968, had an elliptical orbit with (initially) apogee 1086&amp;nbsp;km, perigee 326&amp;nbsp;km, and inclination 97.2°, with an orbital period of 98.9 minutes. The satellite carried seven instruments to detect high energy cosmic rays, determine the total flux of solar X-rays, and measure trapped radiation, Van Allen belt protons and cosmic ray protons. Of special significance for X-ray astronomy were two X-ray instruments: one designed to detect wavelengths 1-20 Å (0.1-2&amp;nbsp;nm) (consisting of proportional counters with varying window thickness) and one designed to detect wavelengths 44-60 Å (4.4-6.0&amp;nbsp;nm) (consisting of proportional counters with thin [[Mylar]] windows).&lt;ref name=heasarc2B&gt;{{cite web |title=The European Space Research Organization satellite 2B |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/esro2b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (WDS) is a method used to count the number of X-rays of a specific wavelength [[Diffraction|diffracted]] by a crystal. WDS only counts X-rays of a single wavelength or wavelength band. In order to interpret the data, the expected elemental wavelength peak locations need to be known. For the ESRO-2B WDS X-ray instruments, calculations of the expected solar spectrum had to be performed and were compared to peaks detected by rocket measurements.&lt;ref name=Mewe&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mewe R |title=Calculations on the Solar Spectrum from 1 TO 60 Å |journal=Space Sci Rev|date=1972|page=666 |issue=4-6|doi=10.1007/BF00213502 |volume=13|bibcode = 1972SSRv...13..666M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early X-ray detecting satellites==
[[Image:Polar line drawing.jpg|thumb|100px|The Polar satellite (line drawing) is the sister ship of the [[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND satellite]].]] 
The Global Geospace Science (GGS) [[Polar (satellite)|Polar Satellite]] was a [[NASA]] science [[spacecraft]] launched at 06:23:59.997 EST on February 24, 1996, aboard a [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[Delta II]] 7925-10 rocket from launch pad 2W at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[Lompoc]], [[California]], to observe the [[Earth]]'s polar [[magnetosphere]]. Polar is in a highly elliptical orbit, at an 86° [[inclination]] with an [[orbital period]] of ~18 hrs.  It gathers multi-wavelength imaging (including X-ray) of the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], and measures the entry of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] into the polar magnetosphere and the geomagnetic tail, the flow of plasma to and from the [[ionosphere]], and the deposition of particle energy in the ionosphere and upper [[atmosphere]]. Polar Mission Operations were terminated at 14:54:41 EDT on April 28, 2008.&lt;ref name=polarsat&gt;{{cite web|title=Lockheed Martin Press Release |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2008/4-30-polarsat.html |date=April 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104024248/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2008/4-30-polarsat.html |archivedate=January 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later satellite of the [[Intercosmos]] series, [[Intercosmos 26]], (launched on March 2, 1994) as part of the [[Intercosmos 26|Coronas-I]] international project may have conducted X-ray studies of the Sun.

On March 23, 1983, at 12:45:06 UTC, the [[Astron (spacecraft)|Astron]] spacecraft is launched into an orbit around the Earth with an [[apogee]] of 185,000&amp;nbsp;km allowing it to make observations with an onboard [[X-ray]] [[spectroscope]] outside the Earth's [[umbra]] and [[radiation belt]].

Bhaskara was the second [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO) satellite. It was launched on June 7, 1979, with a modified [[SS-5 Skean]] IRBM plus upper stage from [[Kapustin Yar]] in the Soviet Union. A secondary objective was to conduct X-ray astronomy investigations. Bhaskara 2 was launched on November 20, 1981, from Kapustin Yar like its predecessor also in size, mass and design may have conducted X-ray astronomy investigations.

Orbiting Solar Observatory ([[OSO 8]]) was launched on June 21, 1975. While OSO 8's primary objective was to observe the Sun, four instruments were dedicated to observations of other celestial X-ray sources brighter than a few milliCrab. A sensitivity of 0.001 of the Crab nebula source (= 1 "mCrab"). [[OSO 8]] ceased operations on October 1, 1978.
[[Image:Signe3.gif|thumb|200px|The Signe 3 spacecraft is operated by the Centre D'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, Toulouse, France.]]
[[Signe 3]] (launched on June 17, 1977) was part of the [[Soviet Union]]'s Intercosmos program.

Almost from the beginning of satellite X-ray studies the Soviet Union began placing a large number of solar X-ray satellites into orbit, including those of the [[Intercosmos]] series.

The third US [[Third Small Astronomy Satellite|Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-3)]] was launched on May 7, 1975, with 3 major scientific objectives: 1) determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds; 2) study selected sources over the energy range 0.1-55 keV; and 3) continuously search the sky for X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena. It was a spinning satellite with pointing capability. SAS 3 was the first to discover X-rays from a highly magnetic WD binary system, AM Her, discovered X-rays from Algol and HZ 43, and surveyed the [[Diffuse X-ray background#Soft diffuse X-ray background|soft X-ray background]] (0.1-0.28 keV).

To conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy and solar physics among others the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO) built [[Aryabhata (satellite)|Aryabhata]]. It was launched by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1975, from [[Kapustin Yar]]. A power failure halted experiments after 4 days in orbit.

Following on the success of [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] (SAS 1), NASA launched the [[Second Small Astronomy Satellite]] SAS 2. It was launched from the San Marco platform off the coast of Kenya, Africa, into a nearly equatorial orbit.
[[Image:Thor Delta-1A small.gif|thumb|200px|The satellites launched with the Thor-Delta rocket system became known as the TD satellites. TD-1A was successfully launched on March 11, 1972, from Vandenberg Air Force Base (March 12 in Europe).]]
[[TD-1A]] was put in a nearly circular polar sun-synchronous orbit, with apogee 545&amp;nbsp;km, perigee 533&amp;nbsp;km, and inclination 97.6°. It was ESRO's first 3-axis stabilized satellite, with one axis pointing to the Sun to within ±5°. The optical axis was maintained perpendicular to the solar pointing axis and to the orbital plane. It scanned the entire celestial sphere every 6 months, with a great circle being scanned every satellite revolution. After about 2 months of operation, both of the satellite's tape recorders failed. A network of ground stations was put together so that real-time telemetry from the satellite was recorded for about 60% of the time. After 6 months in orbit, the satellite entered a period of regular eclipses as the satellite passed behind the Earth—cutting off sunlight to the solar panels. The satellite was put into hibernation for 4 months, until the eclipse period passed, after which systems were turned back on and another 6 months of observations were made. [[TD-1A]] was primarily a UV mission however it carried both a cosmic X-ray and a gamma-ray detector. TD-1A reentered on January 9, 1980.

To continue the intensive X-ray investigation of the Sun and the [[Diffuse X-ray background|cosmic X-ray background]], [[OSO 7]] was launched on September 29, 1971. [[OSO 7]] made the first observation of solar gamma-ray line emission, due to electron/positron annihilation at 511 keV, from a solar flare in April 1972.

[[Cosmos 428]] was launched by the USSR into Earth orbit on June 24, 1971, and recovered July 6, 1971. The orbit characteristics: apogee/perigee/inclination 208&amp;nbsp;km, 271&amp;nbsp;km, and 51.8°, respectively. It was a military satellite on which X-ray astronomy experiments had been added. There was a scintillation spectrometer sensitive to X-rays &gt;30 keV, with a 2° × 17° field of view. In addition, there was an X-ray telescope which operated in the range 2-30 keV. Cosmos 428 detected several X-ray sources which were correlated to already identified [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] point sources.

Like the previous Vela 5 satellites, the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela 6]] nuclear test detection satellites were part of a program run jointly by the Advanced Research Projects of the U. S. Department of Defense and the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, managed by the U. S. Air Force. The twin spacecraft, [[Vela (satellite)#Vela 6A and 6B|Vela 6A and 6B]], were launched on April 8, 1970. Data from the Vela 6 satellites were used to look for correlations between gamma-ray bursts and X-ray events. At least 2 good candidates were found, GB720514 and GB740723. The X-ray detectors failed on Vela 6A on March 12, 1972, and on Vela 6B on January 27, 1972.

[[OSO 6]] was launched on August 9, 1969.&lt;ref name=Hoff&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoff HA |title=Exosat - the new extrasolar X-ray observatory |journal=J Brit Interplan Soc |date=Aug 1983 |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=363–7 |bibcode=1983JBIS...36..363H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its orbital period was ~95 min.&lt;ref name=LochnerGibb&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sixth Orbit Solar Observatory (OSO-6) |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/sats_n_data/missions/oso6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft had a spin rate of 0.5 rps. On board was a hard X-ray detector (27-189 keV) with a 5.1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; NaI(Tl) scintillator, collimated to 17° × 23° FWHM. The system had 4 energy channels (separated 27-49-75-118-189 keV). The detector spun with the spacecraft on a plane containing the Sun direction within ± 3.5°. Data were read with alternate 70 ms and 30 ms integrations for 5 intervals every 320 ms.&lt;ref name=LochnerGibb/&gt;

The Vela satellites 5A and 5B, launched on May 23, 1969, are responsible for significant discoveries of [[gamma-ray burst]]s and [[astronomical X-ray sources]] including [[V 0332+53]].

[[OSO 5]] was launched on January 22, 1969, and lasted until July 1975. It was the 5th satellite put into orbit as part of the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] program. This program was intended to launch a series of nearly identical satellites to cover an entire 11-year solar cycle. The circular orbit had an altitude of 555&amp;nbsp;km and an inclination of 33°. The spin rate of the satellite was 1.8 s. The data produced a spectrum of the diffuse background over the energy range 14-200 keV.

[[Cosmos 215]] was launched April 19, 1968 and contained an X-ray experiment. Orbit characteristics: 261 × 426&amp;nbsp;km, at an inclination of 48.5°. The orbital period was ~ 91 minutes. It was intended primarily to perform solar studies, but did detect some non-solar X-ray events. It reentered the atmosphere on June 30, 1968.

OGO 5 was launched on March 4, 1968. The satellite, primarily devoted to Earth observation, was in a highly elliptical initial orbit with a 272&amp;nbsp;km perigee and a 148,228&amp;nbsp;km apogee. The orbital inclination was 31.1°. The satellite took 3796 minutes to complete one orbit. The Energetic Radiations from Solar Flares experiment was operational from March 1968 - June 1971. Primarily devoted to solar observations, it detected at least 11 cosmic X-ray bursts in time coincidence with gamma-ray bursts seen by other instruments. The detector was a 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm thick NaI(Tl) crystal with a 9.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area. Data were accumulated into energy ranges of: 9.6-19.2, 19.2-32, 32-48, 48-64, 64-80, 80-104, 104-128, and &gt; 128 keV. The data were sampled for 1.15 seconds once every 2.3 seconds.

The fourth successful [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]], [[OSO 4]], was launched on October 18, 1967. The objectives of the OSO 4 satellite were to perform solar physics experiments above the atmosphere and to measure the direction and intensity over the entire celestial sphere in UV, X, and gamma radiation. The OSO 4 platform consisted of a sail section (which pointed 2 instruments continuously toward the Sun) and a wheel section which spun about an axis perpendicular to the pointing direction of the sail (which contained 7 experiments). The spacecraft performed normally until a second tape recorder failed in May 1968. OSO 4 was put into a "standby" mode in November 1969. It could be turned on only for recording special events in real-time. One such event occurred on March 7, 1970, during a solar eclipse. The spacecraft became totally inoperable on December 7, 1971.

The first USA satellite which detected cosmic X-rays was the Third Orbiting Solar Observatory, or [[OSO-3]], launched on March 8, 1967. It was intended primarily to observe the Sun, which it did very well during its 2-year lifetime, but it also detected a flaring episode from the source Sco X-1 and measured the [[Diffuse X-ray background|diffuse cosmic X-ray background]].

Solar X-ray bursts were observed by [[OSO 2]] and an effort was made to map the entire celestial sphere for direction and intensity of X-radiation.
[[Image:Galactic Radiation and Background satellite 1.jpg|thumb|100px|This is a display model of the [[Galactic Radiation and Background|GRAB]] 1 satellite, which carried two sets of instruments: [[Solrad 1]] and Tattletale.]]
OGO 1, the first of the [[Orbiting Geophysical Observatory|Orbiting Geophysical Observatories]] (OGOs), was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy on September 5, 1964, and placed into an initial orbit of 281 × 149,385&amp;nbsp;km at 31° inclination. A secondary objective was to detect gamma-ray bursts from the Sun in the energy range 80 keV - 1 MeV. The experiment consisted of 3 CsI crystals surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence shield. Once every 18.5 seconds, integral intensity measurements were made in each of 16 energy channels which were equally spaced over the 0.08-1 MeV range. OGO 1 was completely terminated on November 1, 1971. Although the satellite did not achieve its goals due to electrical interference and secular degradation, searching back through the data after the discovery of cosmic gamma-ray bursts by the Vela satellites revealed the detection of one or more such events in the OGO 1 data.

The first in a series of 8 successfully launched [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|Orbiting Solar Observatories]] ([[OSO 1]], launched on March 7, 1963) had as its primary mission to measure solar electromagnetic radiation in the UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regions.

The SOLar RADiation satellite program (SOLRAD) was conceived in the late 1950s to study the Sun's effects on Earth, particularly during periods of heightened solar activity.&lt;ref name=Calderwood&gt;{{cite web |author=Calderwood TD |title=Highlights of NRL's First 75 Years |url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/NewsRoom/images/75highlights.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solrad 1]] is launched on June 22, 1960, aboard a [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor Able]] from [[Cape Canaveral]] at 1:54&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT.&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite web |author=Dick SJ |title=June 2005 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/chronologies/jun%202005.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the world's first orbiting astronomical observatory, [[Solrad 1]] determined that radio fade-outs were caused by solar X-ray emissions.&lt;ref name=Calderwood/&gt;

[[Hitomi (satellite)|Hitomi]], formerly known as Astro-H, was a Japanese satellite which attempted to re-fly the microcalorimeter that failed on the Suzaku mission, along with hard-X-ray and soft-gamma instruments. It launched successfully on February 17, 2016.  However, spacecraft controllers lost communications with Hitomi on March 26, and declared the spacecraft lost April 28.

==Proposed (future) X-ray observatory satellites==

===eROSITA and ART-XC===
Among the contracts negotiated in August 2009 at the MAKS International Aviation and Space Salon there was an agreement signed by the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The contract details the creation of the Orbital Astrophysics Observatory [[Spectrum-X-Gamma]] (SXG) initially planned to be launched in 2012.&lt;ref name="russianspaceweb.com"&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/spektr_rg.html Spektr-RG to expand horizons of X-ray astronomy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302085013/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/spektr_rg.html |date=March 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015 plans call for a 2016 launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA eROSITA], 26.05.2015&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|February 2016}} it is planned to launch in Sept 2017.&lt;ref name="russianspaceweb.com"/&gt;

According to Mikhail Pavlinsky, deputy head of the Space Research Institute (SPI), the total project cost nears €50 million. Under the agreement, Germany will provide the main of the two X-ray telescopes (eROSITA), while Russia will install it on its platform, prepare the spacecraft, and take care of all related issues. Russia will also install an additional telescope (ART-XC) on this platform.

The new observatory will help scientists perform an all-sky scan survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/science/tech/16-09-2009/109313-telescope-0 New X-Ray Telescopes Search for Galaxy Clusters and Massive Black Holes], 16.09.2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATHENA===
[[Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics]] was selected in 2013 as a second large mission of the [[Cosmic Vision]] programme.&lt;ref name="l2mission"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ESA's new vision to study the invisible universe| publisher = ESA | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ESA_s_new_vision_to_study_the_invisible_Universe |accessdate = 8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be one hundred times more sensitive than the best of existing X-ray telescopes.&lt;ref name="BBCAthenaBuild"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28053831|title=Athena: Europe plans huge X-ray space telescope|first1=Jonathan|last1=Amos|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Orbiter===
The [[Solar Orbiter]] (SOLO) will approach to 62 solar radii to view the solar atmosphere with high spatial resolution in visible, XUV, and X-rays. The nominally 6 yr mission will be from an elliptical orbit around the Sun with perihelion as low as 0.28 AU and with increasing inclination (using gravity assists from Venus) up to more than 30° with respect to the solar equator. The Orbiter will deliver images and data from the polar regions and the side of the Sun not visible from Earth.&lt;ref name=solarorbiter&gt;{{cite web |title=ESA Science &amp; Technology: Solar Orbiter |url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch date, if selected, could be Jan 2017.

===Astro-H2===
In July 2016 there were discussions between JAXA and NASA on launching a satellite to replace the Hitomi telescope lost in 2016.  The launch goal is 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foust|first1=Jeff|title=NASA may build replacement instrument for Japanese astronomy mission|url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-may-build-replacement-instrument-for-japanese-astronomy-mission/|website=SpaceNews|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruesi|first1=Liz|title=JAXA may remake its X-ray observatory Hitomi for a 2020 launch|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2016/07/jaxa-may-remake-its-x-ray-observatory-hitomi-for-a-2020-launch|website=Astronomy.com|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International X-ray Observatory===
[[International X-ray Observatory]] (IXO) was a cancelled observatory. a result of the merging of NASA's [[Constellation-X]] and ESA/JAXA's [[XEUS]] mission concepts. It was planned to feature a single large X-ray mirror with a 3 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; collecting area and 5" angular resolution, and a suite of instrumentation, including a wide field imaging detector, a hard X-ray imaging detector, a high-spectral-resolution imaging spectrometer (calorimeter), a grating spectrometer, a high timing resolution spectrometer, and a polarimeter.

===Constellation-X===
[[Constellation-X]] was early proposal that was superseded by IXO. It was to provide high resolution X-ray spectroscopy to probe matter as it falls into a black hole, as well as probe the nature of dark matter and dark energy by observing the formation of clusters of galaxies.
