He is considered to be closely involved with, if not a part of, the [[abstract expressionist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10051&amp;texttype=2 Abstract Expressionism - Museum of Modern Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

Siskind was a grade school English teacher in the New York Public School System for 25 years, and began photography when he received a camera as a wedding gift and began taking pictures on his honeymoon. Early in his career Siskind was a member of the New York [[Photo League]], where he produced several significant socially conscious series of images in the 1930s, among them "Harlem Document".

Siskind's work focuses on the details of nature and [[architecture]]. He presents them as flat surfaces to create a new image which stands independent of the original subject. For some his work has been described as crossing the line between photography and painting, his photographs are works unique to the art form of photography.

== Life ==
Born in [[New York City]], Siskind grew up on the Lower East Side. Shortly after graduating from [[City College of New York|City College]], he became a public school English teacher. In 1950 Siskind met [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]] when both were teaching at [[Black Mountain College]] in the summer. Later, Callahan persuaded Siskind to join him as part of the faculty of the [[IIT Institute of Design]] in Chicago (founded by [[László Moholy-Nagy]] as the [[New Bauhaus]]). In 1971 he followed Callahan (who had left in 1961) by his invitation to teach at the Rhode Island School of Design, until both retired in the late 1970s. Siskind's monumental work includes works done in Rome in 1963 and 1967, Mexico in the 1970s, and in the 1980s works such as the Tar Series in Providence, Vermont, and Route 88 near Westport, Rhode Island. He continued making photographs until his death on February 8, 1991.

[[File:Octopod by syntopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|"Octopod" by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen. An example of algorithmic art produced with the software ''Structure Synth''.&lt;ref name=Hvidtfeldt&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hvidtfeldt Christensen |first1=Mikael |title=Hvitfeldts.net |url=http://hvidtfeldts.net/ |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Algorithmic art''', also known as ''algorithm art'', is art, mostly [[visual art]], of which the design is generated by an [[algorithm]]. Algorithmic artists are sometimes called '''algorists'''.

==Overview==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}
Algorithmic art, also known as [[computer-generated art]], is a subset of [[generative art]] (generated by an autonomous system) and is related to [[systems art]] (influenced by systems theory). [[Fractal art]] is an example of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=UCSB&gt;{{cite web |title=Approximating Reality with Interactive Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/brentYokota/200a_fin.html |publisher=University of California Santa Barbara |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=7 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an image of reasonable size, even the simplest [[algorithm]]s require too much calculation for manual execution to be practical, and they are thus executed on either a single computer or on a cluster of computers.  The final output is typically displayed on a [[computer monitor]], printed with a [[wikt:raster|raster]]-type printer, or drawn using a [[plotter]].  Variability can be introduced by using [[pseudo-random]] numbers.  There is no consensus as to whether the product of an algorithm that operates on an existing image (or on any input other than pseudo-random numbers) can still be considered computer-generated art, as opposed to computer-assisted art.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Islamic geometric patterns]] such as this [[girih]] tiling in the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]], are precursors of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;]]

[[Roman Verostko]] argues that [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are constructed using algorithms, as are [[Italian Renaissance]] paintings which make use of [[mathematics and art|mathematical techniques]], in particular [[linear perspective]] and proportion.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

[[File:San Romano Battle (Paolo Uccello, London) 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--width for very low image--&gt;|[[Paolo Uccello]] made innovative use of a geometric algorithm, incorporating [[linear perspective]] in paintings such as ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances run along perspective lines.]]

Some of the earliest known examples of computer-generated algorithmic art were created by [[Georg Nees]], [[Frieder Nake]], [[A. Michael Noll]], [[Manfred Mohr]] and [[:fr:Vera Molnár|Vera Molnár]] in the early 1960s. These artworks were executed by a [[plotter]] controlled by a [[computer]], and were therefore computer-generated art but not [[digital art]]. The act of creation lay in writing the [[Computer program|program]], which specified the sequence of actions to be performed by the [[plotter]]. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early work with copier and telematic art focused on the differences between the human hand and the algorithm.&lt;ref name="MF1"&gt;Flanagan, Mary. "An Appreciation on the Impact of the work of Sonia Landy Sheridan." The Art of Sonia Landy Sheridan. Hanover, NH: [[Hood Museum of Art]], 2009, pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Aside from the ongoing work of Roman Verostko and his fellow algorists, the next known examples are [[fractal art]]works created in the mid to late 1980s. These are important here because they use a different means of execution. Whereas the earliest algorithmic art was "drawn" by a [[plotter]], [[fractal art]] simply creates an image in [[computer memory]]; it is therefore [[digital art]]. The native form of a [[fractal art]]work is an image stored on a [[computer]]&amp;nbsp;–this is also true of very nearly all equation art and of most recent algorithmic art in general. However, in a stricter sense "fractal art" is not considered algorithmic art, because the algorithm is not devised by the artist.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

In light of such ongoing developments, pioneer algorithmic artist [[Ernest Edmonds]] has documented the continuing prophetic role of art in human affairs by tracing the early 1960s association between art and the computer up to a present time in which the algorithm is now widely recognized as a key concept for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/3|author=Ernest Edmonds|date=15 January 2018|title=Algorithmic Art Machines|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7010003|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The role of the algorithm==
[[File:Judson Rosebush Visions 15101 Computer Art April 22, 1978 JGR19780422 100.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|''Letter Field'' by Judson Rosebush, 1978. [[Calcomp plotter]] computer output with liquid inks on rag paper, 15.25 x 21 inches. This image was created using an early version of what became [[Digital Effects]]' Vision software, in [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[Fortran]] on an [[IBM 370]]/158. A database of the Souvenir font; [[Statistical randomness|random number]] generation, a statistical basis to determine letter size, color, and position; and a hidden line algorithm combine to produce this scan line [[raster image]], output to a plotter.]]

From one point of view, for a work of art to be considered algorithmic art, its creation must include a process based on an [[algorithm]] devised by the artist. Here, an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include [[computer code]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]], or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt; This input may be [[mathematical]], [[computation]]al, or generative in nature. Inasmuch as algorithms tend to be [[deterministic]], meaning that their repeated execution would always result in the production of identical artworks, some external factor is usually introduced. This can either be a random number generator of some sort, or an external body of data (which can range from recorded heartbeats to frames of a movie.) Some artists also work with organically based gestural input which is then modified by an algorithm. By this definition, [[fractal]]s made by a fractal program are not art, as humans are not involved. However, defined differently, algorithmic art can be seen to include fractal art, as well as other varieties such as those using [[genetic algorithm]]s. The artist [[Kerry Mitchell]] stated in his 1999 ''Fractal Art Manifesto'':&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Kerry |title=Selected Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QUyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |date=24 July 2009| publisher=Lulu.com&lt;!--This book is published by the artist himself, and can be relied on only for his own point of view.--&gt;|isbn=978-0-557-08398-5|pages=7–8}} This artist is notable for his place in the Fractal Art movement, as is his opinion and manifesto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitchell, Kerry |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |publisher=Fractalus.com |accessdate=27 December 2015 |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is not..Computer(ized) Art, in the sense that the computer does all the work. The work is executed on a computer, but only at the direction of the artist. Turn a computer on and leave it alone for an hour. When you come back, no art will have been generated.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009/&gt;}}

==Algorists==
"Algorist" is a term used for [[digital artist]]s who create algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verostko |first1=Roman |title=Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.verostko.com/algorithm.html |date=1999 |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorists formally began correspondence and establishing their identity as artists following a panel titled "Art and Algorithms" at [[SIGGRAPH]] in 1995. The co-founders were [[Jean-Pierre Hébert]] and [[Roman Verostko]]. Hébert is credited with coining the term and its definition, which is in the form of his own algorithm:&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

 if (creation &amp;&amp; object of art &amp;&amp; algorithm &amp;&amp; one's own algorithm) {
      return * an algorist *
 } else {
      return * not an algorist *
 }

[[Cellular automata]] can be used to generate artistic patterns with an appearance of randomness, or to modify images such as photographs by applying a transformation such as the stepping stone rule (to give an impressionist style) repeatedly until the desired artistic effect is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoke |first1=Brian P. |title=Cellular Automata and Art |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.pattern/FinalProject/Hoke.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=24 December 2015 |date=21 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use has also been explored in music.&lt;ref name="Burraston Edmonds 2005 pp. 165–185"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Burraston | first=Dave | last2=Edmonds | first2=Ernest | title=Cellular automata in generative electronic music and sonic art: a historical and technical review | journal=Digital Creativity | volume=16 | issue=3 | year=2005 | doi=10.1080/14626260500370882 | pages=165–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fractal art]] consists of varieties of computer-generated [[fractals]] with colouring chosen to give an attractive effect.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the western world, it is not drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], [[iteration|iterating]] through three phases: setting [[parameter]]s of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Conner, Elysia |date=25 February 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic or evolutionary art makes use of [[genetic algorithm]]s to develop images iteratively, selecting at each "generation" according to a rule defined by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eberle |first1=Robert |title=Evolutionary Art - Genetic Algorithm |url=http://www.saatchiart.com/art/New-Media-Evolutionary-Art-Genetic-Algorithm/57335/1837679/view |publisher=Saatchi Art |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Craig |title=Evolutionary Computation and its application to art and design |url=http://www.red3d.com/cwr/evolve.html |publisher=Reynolds engineering &amp; Design |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=27 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithmic art is not only produced by computers. Wendy Chun explains:&lt;ref name=Chun2011/&gt;

{{quote|Software is unique in its status as metaphor for metaphor itself. As A universal imitator/machine, it encapsulates a logic of general substitutability ; a logic of ordering and creative, animating disordering. Joseph Weizenbaum has argued that computers have become metaphors for "effective procedures," that is, for anything that can be solved in a prescribed number of steps, such as gene expression and clerical work.&lt;ref name=Chun2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Chun, Wendy Hui Kyong |year=2011 |title=Programmed Visions: Software and Memory |page=2 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0262518512}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American artist, [[Jack Ox]], has used algorithms to produce paintings that are [[music visualization|visualizations of music]] without using a computer. Two examples are ''visual performances'' of extant scores, such as [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Bruckner)|Eighth Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Ox, Jack |year=1990 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35788162/The_Systematic_Translation_of_Anton_Bruckners_Eighth_Symphony_into_a_Series_of_Thirteen_Paintings |title=The Systematic Translation of Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony into a Series of Thirteen Paintings |conference=Bruckner Symposium 1990 |location=Linz, Austria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intermediaprojects.org/pages/Bruckner.html |title=Bruckner: Eighth Symphony visualized themes |publisher=Intermedia Projects |accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Ursonate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ox, Jack |year=1993 |title=Creating a Visual Translation of Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate |journal=Leonardo Music Journal |volume=3 |pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jackox.net/pages/Ursonate/UrPaintMv1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she and her collaborator, Dave Britton, created the 21st Century Virtual Color Organ that does use computer coding and algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ox |first1=Jack |last2=Britton |first2=Dave |year=2000 |url=https://www.academia.edu/785266/The_21st_century_virtual_reality_color_organ |title=The 21st Century Virtual Reality Color Organ |journal=Journal of IEEE Computer Society |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AmericanGhosts.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Chatto &amp; Windus]])]]

'''''American Ghosts and Old World Wonders''''' is a [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously published]] anthology of [[short fiction]] by [[Angela Carter]]. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1993 by Chatto &amp; Windus Ltd. and contains a collection of nine stories, one half of which deal with American folklore and the other with older myths and fairytales. It is introduced by [[Susannah Clapp]].

The book is divided into two parts, the first (concerned with [[United States|America]]) consists of "Lizzie's Tiger", "John Ford's '''Tis Pity She's a Whore''", "Gun for the Devil" and "The Merchant of Shadows".&lt;br /&gt; 

Part two (concerned with [[Europe]]: the "[[Old World]]") contains "The Ghost Ships", "In Pantoland", "Ashputtle ''or'' The Mother's Ghost", "Alice in Prague ''or'' The Curious Room" and "Impressions: The Wrightsman Magdalene".

The anthology's contents are also reprinted in the volume ''[[Burning Your Boats]]'', which features all of Carter's short fiction.

Art of the Olympians was founded in 2006 by Olympic gold medalist discus thrower and artist [[Al Oerter]], who died in 2007.&lt;ref name=ut/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{Cite news|title = Al Oerter, 71; discus thrower won gold medals in four consecutive Games|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/02/local/me-oerter2|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2007-10-02|access-date = 2015-10-14|issn = 0458-3035|first = Diane|last = Pucin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the organization put on a touring exhibition of Art by Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/olympic-greats-exhibit-their-art/ Olympic Greats Exhibit Their Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Art of the Olympians put on an exhibition at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://roaldbradstock.com/images/AOTO/Beijing-2008-2.jpg|title = Beijing 2008|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  AOTO also held a 2008 exhibition at the Rauschenberg Gallery, [[Florida SouthWestern State College|Edison College]] in Fort Myers, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2008 Exhibition Archives {{!}} Bob Rauschenberg Gallery|url = http://www.rauschenberggallery.com/2013/11/2008-exhibition-archives/|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2013, CEO Bob Beamon released an open letter directed to the museum's board announcing his resignation.  On July 17, after 3 and a half years, the Art of the Olympians museum and the Al Oerter Center for Excellence closed its doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Art of the Olympians Museum closed|url = http://www.nbc-2.com/story/22861433/the-art-of-the-olympians-closed#.Vh5uC36rQeN|website = NBC-2.com|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.news-press.com/article/20140223/NEWS0110/302230034/Former-Art-Olympians-building-won-t-anything-anytime-soon&lt;/ref&gt; On the AOTO website they posted an announcement: "It's time to reorganize and restructure the foundation.  A new direction focused on National and International Exhibitions programs will further the vision of the founder." Cathy Oerter, Al Oerter's widow, is currently the CEO of Art of the Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art of the Olympians {{!}}   Executives|url = http://artoftheolympians.org/board/executives/|website = artoftheolympians.org|accessdate = 2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, [[Roald Bradstock]] became the Executive Director of the Al Oerter Foundation (AOF) and Art of the Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art of the Olympians {{!}}   Executives|url = http://artoftheolympians.org/board/executives/|website = artoftheolympians.org|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And on December 2, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert ll of Monaco]] became the Trustee of the Al Oerter Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art of the Olympians {{!}}   Trustee|url = http://artoftheolympians.org/board/trustees/|website = artoftheolympians.org|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Art of the Olympians.

In March 2016, Bradstock was interviewed on BBC Radio Two and then [http://edition.cnn.com/videos/sports/2016/03/14/olympic-picasso-roald-bradstock-intv.cnn CNN International] World Sport.  He announced that AOTO was marking their ten-year anniversary by launching a global campaign and search for new Olympian and Paralympian artists.

[[Image:Burgher House, Stellenbosch.JPG|thumb|Typical Cape Dutch styled house in [[Stellenbosch]]]]

'''Cape Dutch architecture''' is a traditional [[Afrikaner]] [[architecture|architectural]] style found mostly in the [[Western Cape]] of South Africa, but also other places where the Dutch settled, e.g. (Western) Australia. The style was prominent in the early days (17th century) of the [[Cape Colony]], and the name derives from the fact that the initial settlers of the Cape were primarily Dutch. The style has roots in medieval Netherlands, Germany, France and Indonesia.

==Architectural Features==

Houses in this style have a distinctive and recognizable design, with a prominent feature being the grand, ornately rounded gables, reminiscent of features in townhouses of [[Amsterdam]] built in the [[Dutch architecture|Dutch style]]. Whilst this feature is probably the most recognizable, it is ''not'' a defining feature of the style. The manor house on the "Uitkyk" Wine Estate, Stellenbosch, for example does not have a gable at all, but remains clearly in the Cape Dutch Style. In the late 18th century, Georgian influenced neoclassical Cape Dutch architecture was very popular however only three houses in this style remain &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.uitkyk.co.za/the-manor-house/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109134508/https://www.uitkyk.co.za/the-manor-house/# |archive-date=9 November 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The houses are also usually H-shaped, with the front section of the house usually being flanked by two wings running perpendicular to it. 

The Cape Dutch architectural style is defined by the following characteristics:
* Whitewashed walls
* Thatched roofing
* Large wooden sash cottage panes
* External wooden shutters
* Long horizontal structures, usually single or double story, often with dormer windows
* Green detailing is often used

Most Cape Dutch buildings in [[Cape Town]] have been lost to new developments – particularly to high-rises in the [[City Bowl]] during the 1960s. However, the Cape Dutch tradition can still be seen in many of the farmhouses of the [[Cape Winelands|Wine Route]], and historical towns such as [[Stellenbosch]], [[Paarl]], [[Swellendam]], [[Tulbagh]] and [[Graaff-Reinet]].

One characteristic feature of South African colonial architecture which has attracted the attention of many observers is the extensive use of gables. Earlier research has repeatedly sought to justify the term `Cape-Dutch' solely by comparing the decorative form of these gables to those of Amsterdam. However, in the second half of the 18th century, the period in which, the entire development of the South African gable tradition occurs, gable architecture had gradually ceased to be built in Amsterdam. North of Amsterdam, along the river Zaan, however, gable design remained vigorous until the capture of the Cape. South African gables have many features in common with gables along the river Zaan, in spite of the different materials used.&lt;ref&gt;Jona Schellekens, "Dutch Origins of South-African Colonial Architecture," Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 56 (1997), pp. 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cape Dutch Revival==

By the middle of the 19th century the style had fallen out of popularity and many of the buildings were left to decay. In 1893 [[Cecil John Rhodes]] purchased the farm [[Groote Schuur]] (Big Barn) and hired architect [[Sir Herbert Baker]] to redesign the manor house. Baker looked for a Cape vernacular style and drew influence from Cape Dutch buildings. In reality he created an English country home with Cape Dutch style Gables. This led to the Cape Dutch Revival style&lt;ref&gt; http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/style_det.php?styleid=37 &lt;/ref&gt;. In 1902, Baker was brought to Johannesburg by the [[Randlords]] following the British victory in the [[Anglo-Boer War]] and included the Cape Dutch Gable on many homes on the Rand. Following Union in 1910, the Cape Dutch Revival style became very popular as a South African vernacular style. Unlike real Cape Dutch Architecture, the Cape Dutch Revival style is defined almost exclusively by ornate gables. The rise in popularity of the Cape Dutch Revival style led to a renewed interest in Cape Dutch architecture and many original Cape Dutch buildings were restored during this period.

'''Claus Friedrich Bergen''' (April 18, 1885–October 4, 1964) was a German illustrator and painter, best known for his depictions of naval warfare in [[World War One]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/mag/pages/mnuInDepth/Biography.cfm?biog=93&amp;search=bergen Biography and illustration of pictures by Bergen held at NMM, Greenwich.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818135530/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/mag/pages/mnuInDepth/Biography.cfm?biog=93 |date=18 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Claus Bergen|German Wikipedia article on Claus Bergen.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:The Harbor of Polperro, Cornwall, C. Bergen.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Harbor of Polperro, Cornwall. C. Bergen, ca. 1907]]

Bergen was born April 18, 1885, in [[Stuttgart]], Germany, the first son of Fritz Bergen, a popular painter and illustrator of the Imperial era. He was raised in [[Munich]], where, starting in 1904, he attended  Moritz Weinhold's painting school and the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Art]], studying under [[Carl von Marr]].&lt;ref&gt;website Munich Submariners Association 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1907, Bergen created more than 450 illustrations for [[Karl May]]'s popular adventure tales. Continually printed and re-printed in books and periodicals, Bergen's depictions of the Old West, India, Arabia, and other exotic locales came to be widely associated with May's stories. In 1910 his illustrations were exhibited at the [[Brussels International 1910|Wereldtentoonstelling]] in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;.http://schikelgruber.net/bergen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled extensively, visiting Norway, England, the Mediterranean and America while exhibiting and furthering his training. He developed a specialty of painting naval subjects, as well as fishing scenes and coastal views. A series of paintings of the Cornish fishing village of [[Polperro]] attracted particular attention.

==Wartime painting==
In 1914 Bergen was appointed Marine Painter to [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]. After the 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] there was enormous demand for depictions of the action, both from the public and the captains of ships which had participated; to satisfy it, [[Admiral Scheer]], the [[High Seas Fleet]] commander, took the fleet into the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] with Bergen aboard his flagship and went through a replay of the battle complete with blank firing of the guns. In the 1930s many of these paintings were included in the [[Laboe Naval Memorial]] at [[Kiel]], and were later placed in the [[Internationales Maritimes Museum Hamburg|Tamm Museum]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany.

[[File:U-boat WWI by C. Bergen.jpg|thumbnail|U-Boat, World War One, C. Bergen]]

[[File:Battle of Jutland, 1916, C. Bergen.jpg|thumbnail|right|Battle of Jutland, 1916, C. Bergen]]

In June and July 1917, Bergen took the unprecedented step of joining the crew of the submarine {{SMU|U-53||2}}, under Kapitänleutnant [[Hans Rose]], on an Atlantic combat patrol.&lt;ref&gt;website Munich Submariners Association 1926&lt;/ref&gt; The series of paintings that resulted is often considered to be among his finest work.

In the [[interwar period]] he painted numerous officially-commissioned large scale land- and seascapes, while his friendship with commanders such as [[Erich Raeder]] and [[Karl Doenitz]] led to continuing work for the German Navy.

Bergen's brother Otto was an aviator in the Great War, and the two were childhood friends of [[Ernst Udet]], one of Germany's top fighter pilots. These associations led to Bergen painting many aviation scenes, and commissions within Germany's aviation industry. Several of his works were used to decorate the interior of the giant [[Dornier Do X]] luxury [[flying boat]], which first flew in 1929.

Claus Bergen joined the [[NSDAP]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War he was placed on the Nazis' "[[Gottbegnadeten list|God-gifted list]]", which gave him protected status as a cultural asset, thereby exempting him from military service. Several of his works appeared in the Nazi-sponsored Great German Art Exhibitions, held annually at the [[Haus der Kunst|House of German Art]] in Munich from 1937 to 1944. His painting ''Against England'' (1940) was purchased by [[Adolf Hitler]] for 12,000 reichmarks, and other works of his were purchased by other top Nazi officials;&lt;ref&gt; GermanArtGallery guide, product descriptions for 'Gegen England' &amp; 'Im Atlantik'; http://www.germanartgallery.eu/en/Webshop/0/product/info/Claus_Bergen,_Gegen_England&amp;id=155&lt;/ref&gt; however, none of Bergen's work displays anti-Semitic or exaggeratedly pro-Aryan themes. At the war's end, he was not prosecuted for his Nazi associations.

==Later life==

After the Second World War Bergen continued painting, with more emphasis on his career-long interest in smaller paintings of landscapes and historic sailing ships.

In 1963 he gave his painting ''The Atlantic'' to President Kennedy (now displayed at the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|Kennedy Library]] in Boston) and donated a painting of Admiral Nelson's flagship {{HMS|Victory}} to the British Admiralty. The following year, his paintings illustrated the naval section of ''Life'' magazine's series on the First World War.

In the late 1970s a dramatic Bergen painting was used on the box of the popular [[Bismarck (board game)|board game ''Bismarck'']].&lt;ref&gt;Bergen is credited on game box; https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/76436/bismarck-second-edition rtvd 3 5 17&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He continued painting until his death on October 4, 1964, in [[Lenggries]], Bavaria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">A '''closet drama''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is "a quite legitimate product of literary art." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25106077|title = The Legitimacy of the Closet-Drama|journal = The North American Review|volume = 187|issue = 627|pages = 213–223|last1 = Matthews|first1 = Brander|year = 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== Definition ==
A closet drama (or closet play) is a [[play (theatre)|play]] created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, [[playwright]]s might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid [[censorship]] of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-5|[4]]] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including ''dramatis personae'' and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[[Closet drama#cite note-6|[5]]] This created an "unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-:1-2|[1]]]

Marta Straznicky describes the form as "part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Privacy, playreading, and women's closet drama, 1500-1700|last=Straznicky|first=Marta|publisher=Cambridge University Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: "a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere" through this medium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Women in closet drama ==
In the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to "engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.

[[Margaret Lucas Cavendish]], author of fourteen folio volumes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. [[Closet drama#cite note-:0-1|[1]]] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.

Other notable women involved in closet drama include [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Jane Lumley, Baroness Lumley|Jane Lumley]], and [[Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]].

==History==
The philosophical [[dialogue]]s of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as [[Plato]] (see [[Socratic dialogue]]) were written in the form of conversations between "characters" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1998|title=Recent Studies in Closet Dramas|jstor=43447570|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=28|issue=1|pages=142–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], many have argued that the [[tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger]] in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1994|title=Profane Stoical Paradoxes': 'The Tragedie of Mariam' and Sidnean Closet Drama|jstor=43447747|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume= 24|issue=1|pages=104–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor [[Nero]], a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the [[Middle Ages]] was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of [[Hrosvit|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] and [[Medieval debate poetry|debate poems]] in quasi-dramatic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Elizabethan and Jacobean ===
[[Fulke Greville]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]], and [[Mary Sidney]] wrote closet dramas in the age of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Randall, Dale J. B. ''Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642&amp;#x2013;1660.'' Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a "substitute" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on "propagandist aims" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. [[Thomas Killigrew]] is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kennedy, Dennis. ''Theatre &amp; Performance''. Oxford University Press, 2003 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form "served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[John Milton]]'s play ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', written in 1671, is an example of [[early modern]] drama never intended for the stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Several closet dramas in [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse]] were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''[[Faust, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Faust, Part 2]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of [[German literature]], were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Alexander Pushkin]] devoted much time to the closet drama.

The popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse [[tragedy]] on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward [[melodrama]] and [[comedy]] and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Robert Browning]], and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.

The '''Panamanian coat of arms''' is a [[heraldic]] symbol for [[Panama]]. These arms were adopted provisionally and then definitively by the same laws that adopted the [[Flag of Panama|Panamanian flag]].

==Description==

The center section contains the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. The chief or top part of the coat of arms comprises two quarters. The top left over a field of silver a sword and a rifle. In 1904, the arms were made official by Law 64 of 4 June 1904 signed by the President of Assembly [[Genaro Ortega]], and sanctioned by the [[President]] the Republic, [[Manuel Amador Guerrero]].

The official description of the heraldic design is as follows:

*"It rests on a green field, symbol of the vegetation; it is of pointed form and it is intervened as far as the division. The center shows the Isthmus with its seas and sky, in which the moon begins to rise above the waves and the sun begins to hide behind the mountain, marking thereby the solemn hour of the declaration of our independence. The head is divided in two quarters: in the one of the right hand, in the silver field, a sword and a gun are hung meant as abandonment for always to the civil wars, causes of our ruin; in the one of the left-hand side, and on field of gules, a crossed shovel and a grub hoe are shown shining, to symbolize the work "
*"The end of the [[coat of arms]] also is divided in two quarters: the one of the right-hand side, in blue field, shows a [[cornucopia]], emblem of the wealth; and the one of the left-hand side, in field of silver, the winged wheel, symbol of the progress. Behind the shield and covering it with his opened wings, is the eagle, emblem of the sovereignty, the head turned towards the left, and takes in the tip a silver tape, which hangs from right to left. On the tape the following motto is printed "Pro Mundi Beneficio " 
"On the eagle, in arc form, ten gold stars go in representation of the provinces in which the Republic is divided. Like decorative accessories, to each side of the coat of arms two gathered national flags go on the other hand below"

*For thirty-seven years the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Panama was not changed until the Constitution of 1941 was promulgated. The National Assembly dictated in March of this year Law 28 on the Coat of Arms, in which the following reforms were introduced: the saber and the gun are meant as attitude of alert in defense of our sovereignty, in the place of "abandonment to mean good bye to the civil wars ".   311 projects appeared to change the motto and the Jury named to make the selection decided for: "Solo Dios sobre Nosotros" (Only God Above Us). Nevertheless, the National Assembly when approving the Law 28 already referred to, rejected it and preferred the one of "Justice, Honor and Freedom ".  Five years later, in 1946, Panama returned to the old symbol with the well-known motto of "Pro Mundi Beneficio ".

The formal adoption and regulation of the use of the national flag, anthem and coat of arms were decreed by law 34 of 1949.

==Harpy Eagle Law==
[[File:Coat of arms of Panama (green background).svg|thumb|Green background]]
Law 34 of 1949 stated, as noted above, that an eagle was to be on the top of the coat of arms. However, it did not specify what species of eagle, even though in most schools the harpy eagle was the eagle species on top of the coat of arms. Law 18 of 2002 made the [[harpy eagle]] (''Harpia harpyja'') the national bird; and to specify what species of eagle was to be on the coat of arms, on May 17, 2006, law 50 was approved by the national Assembly to modify law 18 of 2002, and add that the harpy eagle (''Harpia harpyja'') was the species of eagle that appears on the coat of arms of the Republic of Panama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asamblea.gob.pa/actualidad/2004_P_050.

[[File:Colin Graham director.jpg|thumb|Colin Graham]]
'''Colin Graham''' [[OBE]] (22 September 1931 in [[Hove]], England – 6 April 2007 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]) was a  stage director of opera, theatre, and television.
 
Graham was educated at Northaw School (Hertfordshire),&lt;ref name="Blyth"&gt;{{cite news | author=Alan Blyth | title=Colin Graham | url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2053228,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=10 April 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stowe School]] and [[RADA]]. Early in his career, he began a long association with [[Benjamin Britten]], for whom he directed all but one of the composer's stage works, including all of the world premieres after 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/04/09/db0901.xml Obituary for Colin Graham, ''Telegraph'', 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; He became associated with the English Opera Group in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/arts/09graham.html Vivien Schweitzer, "Colin Graham, 75, Director of St. Louis Opera Company, Dies."  ''New York Times'', 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, he also worked for the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]] in London and later at [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]] and at the [[English National Opera]] in the 1970s.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Graham was associated with several recordings of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas conducted by Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]] with the Glyndebourne Festival Chorus and principals including [[George Baker (record singer)|George Baker]].  He enhanced these recordings with movement for the performers that makes the recordings sound more like a live staged performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/tbjsarg.htm Information from the G&amp;S Discography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620064531/http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/tbjsarg.htm |date=2008-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham made his American debut as a stage director at [[Santa Fe Opera]] in 1974 with his staging of Britten's ''[[Owen Wingrave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1629548.ece%20 Obituary for Colin Graham, ''The Times'', 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Graham later became Director of Productions for [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]] (OTSL) in 1978, until 1985, when he became OTSL's Artistic Director.  He held this position until his death.

Graham directed the world premieres of [[John Corigliano]]'s opera, ''[[The Ghosts of Versailles]]'', for the [[Metropolitan Opera]]; ''[[The Dangerous Liaisons]]'' and André Previn's ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (opera)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' for [[San Francisco Opera]]; ''The Song of Majnun'' for [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]]; and a series of three operas by [[Miki Minoru]]. In addition, he directed productions for the [[Santa Fe Opera]], notably [[Bright Sheng]]'s ''Madame Mao'' in 2003, continuing his association with general director [[Richard Gaddes]], which had begun during the latter's tenure at OTSL. Collectively, he directed 55 world premieres of operas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/6288.html Matthew Westphal, "Colin Graham, Opera Director and Head of Opera Theatre of St. Louis, Dies at 75".  ''Playbill Arts'', 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham also wrote libretti for several operas, including:
* [[Benjamin Britten]], ''The Golden Vanity''
* [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], ''Penny for a Song''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metoperafamily.org/operanews/news/pressrelease.aspx?id=1393 "Colin Graham, 75, Celebrated Opera Director and OTSL Artistic Director, Has Died".  ''Opera News'' (on-line), 9 April 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Deux fillettes, fond jaune et rouge (Two Girls in a Yellow and Red Interior)''''' (1947), oil on canvas, 61 x 49.8&amp;nbsp;cm (24 x 19 5/8&amp;nbsp;inches) is a painting by [[Henri Matisse]] in the collection of the [[Barnes Foundation]], [[Merion, Pennsylvania]]. Albert Barnes became one of Matisse's most important patrons. In addition to a commissioned mural in 1932 ''Dance II, 1932'' Barnes acquired many paintings and drawings by Matisse. [[Pierre Matisse]] who was Matisse's son living in [[New York City]] was instrumental in facilitating Barnes in purchasing works from his father. During the early-to-mid-1940s Matisse was in poor health. Eventually by 1950 he stopped painting in favor of his paper cutouts. This painting in the Barnes collection is an example of one of the final group of oil paintings in Matisse's career.

'''Developing Lives''' is a photography program run for residents of the [[New York City Housing Authority]] or [[New York City Housing Authority|NYCHA]], a [[government agency]] that provides [[public housing]] for low and moderate residents throughout the [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Studio&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives: Studio NYCHA|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/|publisher=NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program provides workshops by NYCHA using privately donated film cameras and laptops along with discounted film development.&lt;ref name=Studio /&gt;  Private support of NYCHA programs is welcome given the agency experiencing huge shortfalls in operating and capital funding.&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Public Housing|title=Testimony from NYCHA Chairman John B.

== History ==

Developing Lives began in the Housing Authority’s Manhattanville Development in fall 2010 with a handful of participants.&lt;ref name="Nguyen"/&gt; The program has by now included residents of 15 of the agency’s 334 developments. Meanwhile, over 10,000 viewers have seen the photographs online.&lt;ref name=Brochure&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives Brochure|url=http://seeingforourselves.org/media/developing-lives-brochure.pdf|publisher=Seeing for Ourselves|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing Lives was brought to NYCHA by former [[New York City Transit Authority|MTA]] executive [[George Carrano]] of the non-profit [[Seeing For Ourselves]], which also arranged the private partnerships behind the program.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives: Meet the Team|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/developing-lives-class-information/meet-the-team/|publisher=Studio NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Carrano had served as curator of photography exhibits of war [[photojournalism]] and participatory photography that were lauded in the media as poignant&lt;ref name=Salamon&gt;{{cite news|last=Salamon|first=Julie|title=Child Photographers Show Lives of Hardship and Hope|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/10/arts/child-photographers-show-lives-of-hardship-and-hope.html|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and not to be missed.&lt;ref name=Art&gt;{{cite news|last=The New York Time|title=Art Listings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/arts/design/30art.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Chelsea Davis, founder of two participatory arts programs and with family roots in NYC public housing, directs the program. Lily Randall, former art instructor in St. Louis public housing, also helped run Developing Lives.&lt;ref name="Kodak Blog" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team /&gt;

== Developing Lives as Photography ==

Developing Lives belongs to the school of participatory photography. This school turns the traditional photography paradigm on its head. Those whose normal role is limited to their function as objects of photography receive training to document their own lives. The movement originated in American efforts two decades ago to aid rural Chinese women, who had never used a camera, but now encompasses all efforts to take charge of one's own narrative using photography.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;  Milestones include the NYC exhibit Unbroken by [[Photovoice|PhotoVoice]], a group dedicated to this school of photography.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salamon"/&gt; George Carrano served as the show’s curator.&lt;ref name="Kodak Blog" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team /&gt;

== The Program ==

Developing Lives includes weekly sessions in which instructors present a new [[Photography|photography technique]] (light, shadow, camera language, etc.) and introduce a well-known photographer whose work exemplifies that technical style. The program distributes single-use Kodak cameras at the start of every class which are returned the following week. The [[film]] is then processed and photographs reviewed and returned. Participants are asked to bear in mind the new photography technique when documenting their lives throughout the week.&lt;ref name=Class&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives Class Information|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/developing-lives-class-information/|publisher=Studio NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to teaching technical skills, Developing Lives also helps participants become [[Documentary film|documentary]] photographers. The classes discuss the art of [[storytelling]] through a photograph. All photographs are paired with handwritten captions from the photographer.&lt;ref name=Class /&gt;

The Developing Lives photographs were combined with a narrative explaining the challenges faced by residents, and published as [[Project Lives]] in April 2015.

'''''Dubgaill''''' and '''''Finngaill''''', or '''''Dubgenti''''' and '''''Finngenti''''', are [[Middle Irish]] terms used to denote different rival groups of [[Viking]]s in Ireland and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Literally, ''Dub-/Finngaill'' is translated as "dark and fair foreigners"&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf"&gt;[[#Downham07|Downham (2007)]], pp. xv–xviii&lt;/ref&gt; or "black and white foreigners",&lt;ref name="Smyth 1974, p. 101"&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly, ''Dub-/Finngenti'' as "dark/black" and "fair/white heathens". Similar terms are found in Welsh chronicles, probably derived from Gaelic usage.&lt;ref name="Dumville08355" /&gt; The first known use of these terms in the chronicles is from 851, when it is noted that "The Dubhghoill arrived in Ath Cliath [Dublin], and made a great slaughter of the Finnghoill".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[#AFM|AFM 849.9]] [=851], similar [[#AU|AU 851.3]] "Tetact Dubgennti du Ath Cliath co ralsat ár mór du Fhinngallaibh", translated as "The dark heathens came to Áth Cliath, made a great slaughter of the fair-haired foreigners"&lt;/ref&gt; The terms appear, with various spellings, in entries in [[Irish annals]] from the 9th and 10th century, and are also used and interpreted in later [[historiography]].

There have been different interpretations of the terms. Traditionally, historians have speculated whether these distinctions refer to physical features such as skin or hair-colour, weaponry or outfits.&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt; [[Alfred P. Smyth]] suggested a new interpretation of ''dub'' and ''finn'' as "new" and "old".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long tradition of understanding ''Dubgaill'' as Danish Vikings and ''Finngaill'' as Norwegian Vikings. This interpretation has recently been challenged by [[David N. Dumville]] and [[Clare Downham]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Downham09|Downham (2009)]], p. 139 note 2&lt;/ref&gt; who, building on Smyth's conclusions, propose that the terms may not be related to ethnicity or origin of the different groups of Vikings.

In later times, centuries after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], the [[Hiberno-Normans]] or so-called [[Old English (Ireland)]] were also referred to as Dubgaill and Finngaill.

==Etymology==
The word ''Gaill'' (plural of ''Gall'') etymologically originates from "[[Gauls]]", who in pre-Viking Gaelic history were the archetypal "foreigners". Dumville says that "what [the Gauls] had done in Gaelic prehistory to gain that status is unknown and was probably unpleasant."&lt;ref name="Dumville08355"&gt;[[#Dumville08|Dumville (2008)]], p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; During the Viking age, it came to denote Scandinavians or those of Scandinavian descent or speech. From the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in the late 12th century, this appellation was passed on to foreigners of French speech and then to the English at large.&lt;ref name="Dumville08355" /&gt; The word did not denote "foreigner" in the sense "anyone not Irish (Gaelic)", but the [[Saxon]]s, [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[Picts]] are identified as such in the Irish annals, and there are also terms used which may identify the Scandinavians based on nationality, like ''Dene'', ''Northmanni'' and ''[[Lochlainn]]''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The accuracy of the early references to the homelands of the Scandinavians are controversial, for a thorough discussion on the identification of such terms in insular chronicling with later national entities like Norway and Denmark, see [[#Downham09|Downham (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another word frequently used by the chroniclers in the early phase of the [[Viking Age#Ireland|Viking age]] was ''Gen(n)ti'', meaning "foreigner of a different religion". This was derived from the biblical usage of the Latin phrase ''gentes'' or ''gentiles'', the latter form common in traditional English translations of the Bible. This terminology was abandoned, which has been taken as recognition of eventual conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Dumville08355" /&gt;

The literary meaning of [[Old Irish]] and [[Old Welsh]] ''Dub'' is normally given as "dark" or "black", while Middle Irish ''finn'' (Old Irish ''find'', Modern Irish ''fionn'') is given as "light" or "white".&lt;ref name="Dumville08355" /&gt; Smyth, referring to the [[Dictionary of the Irish Language]] by the [[Royal Irish Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DIL |title=dub; 1 finn; 1 Gall |pages=Letter D, columns 425–30; Letter F, columns 141–3; Letter G, columns 38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adds that ''Dub'' can mean "gloomy" or "melancholy" in a moral sense, and has the intensive meaning of "great" or "mighty". For ''finn'' there are the additional meanings of "handsome", "just" and "true".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation history==

===The meaning of ''Finn-'' and ''Dub-''===
Historians have offered various explanations to account for the fact that terms associated with colour denote two separate factions of Vikings. The explanation which has been most widely accepted is that it either relates to hair-colour or armour.&lt;ref name="Smyth103f"&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], pp. 103–106&lt;/ref&gt; The view that it relates to colour was held, for instance, by the Danish antiquary [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae]]&lt;ref name="Smyth103f" /&gt; and [[James Henthorn Todd]];&lt;ref&gt;[[#Todd|Todd (1869)]], p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; but it also occurs in more modern historical works like in Mac Airt &amp; Mac Niocaill's 1983 edition of [[Annals of Ulster]] where ''Fhinngallaibh'' is translated "fair-haired foreigners".&lt;ref&gt;[[#AU|AU 851.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smyth, the most bizarre explanation of the terms was put forward by [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]]. He suggested that the "Black foreigners" were [[Moorish]] slaves, carried off to Ireland in a Viking raid on North Africa.&lt;ref name="Smyth103f" /&gt;

Jón Steffensen, while rejecting the fair- and dark-haired hypothesis, suggested that the terms originated from the colours on the shields of the Vikings, the ''finngaill'' carrying white shields and the ''dubgaill'' red.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steffensen|Steffensen (1970)]], pp. 59, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Smyth gives arguments against all colour-related distinctions.&lt;ref name="Smyth103f" /&gt; Referring to Steffensen,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Steffensen|Steffensen (1970)]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; he dismisses the assumption that "any large Scandinavian host could be composed exclusively and over a long period of dark-haired individuals" as being unrealistic. As an argument against Steffensen theory of shield-colour, as well as other theories based on colour of armour, he asserts that regular uniform and equipment were unknown in early medieval Germanic armies, and that "Norwegian pirates could afford the luxury of carrying nothing but white shields is fanciful to the extreme". As a final argument against distinction in colour between Viking factions, Smyth notes that even though these Vikings were active elsewhere, no Anglo-Saxon or Frankish chroniclers have mentioned any particular colour-distinction.&lt;ref name="Smyth103f" /&gt;

Smyth concludes that in this context,  ''finn'' and ''dub'' should not be related to colour or brightness, but must be translated as "old" and "new". He finds precedent for this in part on Mageoghagan's translations of the [[Annals of Clonmacnoise]] from the early 17th century, where [[Sihtric Cáech|Sihtric (Sigtrygg) Cáech]] in his epitaph is called "prince of the new&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;old Danes".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], pp 108f. [[#Murphy|Murphy (1896)]], p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegians and Danes?===
The identification of ''Finngaill'' as Norwegian and ''Dubgaill'' as Danish has had a long tradition, but it was first made long after the terms fell out of contemporary use.&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt; According to Smyth, the oldest Irish source that equates the ''Dub''- with Danes is the 12th-century ''[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib]]'', who speaks of "Danish Black Gentiles" (''Duibgeinti Danarda'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (74)]], p. 102, [[#Todd|Todd (1869)]], p.18-ch.XX, p.229 (trans)&lt;/ref&gt; Downham points out that the last contemporary use of the terms may be ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'' ''sub anno'' 941.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CS|CS 941]], [[#Downham07|Downham (2007)]], p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; According to Smyth, medieval Irish writers and later Gaelic antiquaries such as [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] and [[Geoffrey Keating]] "were clear on overall Norwegian origin of the ''Finn Gaill'' and the Danish origin of the ''Dub Gaill''".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Smyth also states that "it is clear from references to Scandinavian activity of the ninth and tenth century within Ireland that the 'White Foreigners' had a predominantly Norwegian origin, and that their opposite number were Danes", without giving any further references for this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Smyth 1974, p. 101"/&gt;

Smyth argued that ''Finn-'' and ''Dub-'' did not imply an ethnic distinction but rather "old" and "new", and also pointed out that "large viking armies were not exclusively either Danish or Norwegian".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smyth74|Smyth (1974)]], p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; He still did not question the identification as Norwegian/Danish. Downham has pointed out that by the time the first sources equating these terms with Norwegian/Danish were written down, changes in Scandinavia had made the Irish aware of a distinction between Norwegians and Danes,&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt; a distinction the Irish (or for that matter the "Norwegian" or "Danes") would not have been aware of in the middle of the 9th century. Downham argues that a "new interpretation was interposed on the earlier terms 'Fair Foreigner' and 'Dark Foreigner'".&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt;

Downham, with reference to a suggestion made by Dumville, offers the alternative interpretation that ''finngaill'' and ''dubgaill'' identified Viking groups under different leadership. The ''dubgaill'' may identify Vikings under the leadership of the [[Uí Ímair]], while the ''finngaill'' were those "old" Vikings present in Ireland before the middle of the 9th century.&lt;ref name="Downham07xvf" /&gt; The rivalry between the Uí Ímair and other groups persisted long after the Uí Ímair had gained control over Dublin, and their hegemony over the Viking settlements in Ireland was established when [[Amlaíb mac Gofraid (died 941)|Amlaíb mac Gofraid]] defeated the Vikings of Limerick. After the death of Ámlaib, the label ''finngaill'' fell out of contemporary use in Irish chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Downham07|Downham (2007)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;36–37, note 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial style==
The style ''King of the Dubgaill and Finngaill'' (or vice versa) was an imperial one held only by three or four dynasts of the [[Uí Ímair]].

* [[Ragnall ua Ímair]], the first
* [[Sitric Cáech]], the most celebrated
* ([[Gofraid ua Ímair]]), styled simply ''Rí Gall'' (King of the Foreigners) in the surviving sources
* [[Amlaíb mac Gofraid (died 941)|Amlaíb mac Gofraid]], his son and the last, styled also ''King of Ireland'' in Anglo-Saxon sources

'''EN 13402 Size designation of clothes''' is a European [[standardisation|standard]] for labelling [[Clothing sizes|clothes sizes]]. It is based on body dimensions, measured in [[centimetre]]s. It replaces many older national dress-size systems in popular use before the year 2007. Acceptance of this form of standardisation varies from country to country.  For example, the [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs]] has commissioned a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consumo-inc.es/Noticias/Notasdeprensa/2008/tallasIngles.htm |title=The anthropometric study of the female population has revealed the existence of three generalised body types, which should serve as a more accurate basis for sizing |publisher=Consumo-inc.es |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203153017/http://www.consumo-inc.es/Noticias/Notasdeprensa/2008/tallasIngles.htm |archivedate=3 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to categorise female body types with a view to harmonising Spanish clothing sizes with EN-13402.  Few other countries are known to have followed suit. For children's clothing it is the de facto standard in most of Europe already.

==Background==
There are three approaches for size-labelling of clothes:

; Body dimensions: The label states the range of body measurements for which the product was designed. (For example: bike helmet label stating "head girth: 56–60 cm")
; Product dimensions: The label states characteristic dimensions of the product. (For example: jeans label stating inner leg length of the jeans in centimetres or inches (not inner leg measurement of the intended wearer))
; Ad hoc size: The label states a size number or code with no obvious relationship to any measurement. (For example: Size 12, XL)

Traditionally, clothes have been labelled using many different ad hoc size systems.
This approach has led to a number of problems:
* For many types of garments, size cannot be adequately described by a single number because a good fit requires a match between two (or sometimes three) independent body dimensions. This is a common issue in sizing [[jeans]].
* Ad hoc sizes have changed with time due to changing demographics and increasing rates of obesity. This is often portrayed in media as [[vanity sizing]].
* Scalar ad hoc sizes based on 1950s anthropometric studies are no longer adequate, as changes in nutrition and life style have shifted the distribution of body dimensions.
* Mail order requires accurate methods for predicting the best-fitting size.
* Country-specific and vendor-specific labels incur additional costs.

Therefore, the European standards committee [[European Committee for Standardisation|CEN]]/TC 248/WG 10 started in 1996 the process of designing a new modern system of labelling clothes sizes, resulting in the standard EN 13402 "Size designation of clothes".

It is based on:
* body-dimensions
* the [[metric system]] ([[SI]])
* data from new [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]] studies of the European population performed in the late 1990s
* similar existing [[international standards]] ([[International Organisation for Standardisation|ISO]] 3635, etc.)

==EN 13402-1: Terms, definitions and body measurement procedure==
[[File:EN-13402-pictogram.png|thumb|right|European Standard (EN 13402-1) pictogram example for some cloting type (jacket?) with primary and secondary measurements.]]
The first part&lt;ref&gt;BSI, 2001. BS EN 13402-1:2001, Size Designation of Clothes - Part 1: Terms, definitions and body measurement procedure, London, UK: British Standards Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; of the standard defines the list of body dimensions to be used for designating clothes sizes, together with an anatomical explanation and measurement guidelines. All body dimensions are measured, preferably without or as few as possible clothes, in centimetres, except for the body mass.

The standard also defines a pictogram that can be used in language-neutral labels to indicate one or several of the following body dimensions.

; {{anchor|head}} '''head girth''' : maximum [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] girth (circumference) of the [[Human head|head]] measured above the [[ear]]s
; {{anchor|neck}} neck girth : girth of the neck measured with the [[tape measure]] passed 2&amp;nbsp;cm below the [[Adam's apple]] and at the level of the 7th [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]] [[vertebra]]
; {{anchor|chest}} chest girth (♂ men): maximum horizontal girth measured during normal breathing with the subject standing erect and the tape-measure passed over the [[shoulder blade]]s (scapulae), under the [[armpits]] (axillae), and across the [[chest]]
; {{anchor|bust}} bust girth (♀ women): maximum horizontal girth measured during normal breathing with the subject standing erect and the tape-measure passed horizontally, under the armpits (axillae), and across the bust prominence (preferably measured with moderate tension over a [[brassiere]] that shall not deform the [[breast]] in an unnatural way and shall not displace its volume)
; {{anchor|underbust}} underbust girth (♀ women): horizontal girth of the body measured just below the [[breast]]s
; {{anchor|waist}} waist girth : girth of the natural [[waist]]line between the top of the [[hip bone]]s (iliac crests) and the lower [[rib]]s, measured with the subject breathing normally and standing erect with the [[human abdomen|abdomen]] relaxed
; {{anchor|hips}} hip girth (♀ women): horizontal girth measured round the [[buttocks]] at the level of maximum circumference
; {{anchor|height}} [[Human height|height]] : vertical distance between the crown of the head and the soles of the feet, measured with the subject standing erect without shoes and with the feet together (for infants not yet able to stand upright: length of the body measured in a straight line from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet)
; {{anchor|legs}} inside leg length : distance between the [[crotch]] and the soles of the feet, measured in a straight vertical line with the subject erect, feet slightly apart, and the weight of the body equally distributed on both legs
; {{anchor|arms}} arm length: distance, measured using the tape-measure, from the armscye/shoulder line intersection ([[acromion]]), over the elbow, to the far end of the prominent wrist bone ([[ulna]]), with the subject's right fist clenched and placed on the hip, and with the arm bent at 90°
; {{anchor|hands}} hand girth: maximum girth measured over the knuckles ([[metacarpal]]s) of the open right hand, fingers together and thumb excluded
; {{anchor|feet}} foot length: horizontal distance between perpendiculars in contact with the end of the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel, measured with the subject standing barefoot and the weight of the body equally distributed on both feet
; {{anchor|mass}} body mass: measured with a suitable balance in kilograms

==EN 13402-2: Primary and secondary dimensions==

The second part&lt;ref&gt;BSI, 2002. BS EN 13402-2:2002, Size Designation of Clothes - Part 2: Primary and secondary dimensions, London, UK: British Standards Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; of the standard defines for each type of garment one "primary dimension".
This is the body measure according to which the product must be labelled.
Where men’s garments use the chest girth, women’s clothes are designed for a certain bust girth.

For some types of garment, a single measure may not be sufficient to select the right product. In these cases, one or two "secondary dimensions" can be added to the label.

The following table shows the ''primary'' (in bold) and ''secondary dimensions'' listed in the standard, leaving out the redundant words ''girth'', ''length'' and ''size'' for better overview.

==EN 13402–3: Measurements and intervals==

The third part&lt;ref&gt;BSI, 2004. BS EN 13402-3:2004, Size Designation of Clothes - Part 3: Measurements and Intervals.&lt;/ref&gt; of the standard defines [[preferred number]]s of primary and secondary body dimensions.

The product should not be labelled with the average body dimension for which the garment was designed (i.e., not "height: 176 cm."). Instead, the label should show the range of body dimensions from half the step size below to half the step size above the design size (e.g., "height: 172–180 cm.").

For heights, for example, the standard recommends generally to use the following design dimensions, with a step size of 8&amp;nbsp;cm:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Height
| … || 160 || 168 || 176 || 184 || 192 || 200 || …
|-
! Range
| … || 156–164 || 164–172 || 172–180 || 180–188 || 188–196 || 196–204 || …
|}

For trousers, the recommended step size for height is 4&amp;nbsp;cm:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Height
| … || 156 || 160 || 164 || 168 || 172 || 176
| 180 || 184 || 188 || 192 || 196 || 200 || …
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| … || 154–158 || 158–162 || 162–166 || 166–170 || 170–174 || 174–178
| 178–182 || 182–186 || 186–190 || 190–194 || 194–198 || 198–202 || …
|}

The standard defines similar tables for other dimensions and garments, only some of which are shown here.

===Men===

The standard sizes and ranges for chest and waist girth are defined in steps of 4&amp;nbsp;cm:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Men’s standard sizes for ''drop'' = −12&amp;nbsp;cm
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Chest girth
| 84 || 88 || 92 || 96 || 100 || 104 || 108 || 112
| 116 || 120 || 126 || 132 || 138 || 144
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| 82–86 || 86–90 || 90–94 || 94–98 || 98–102 || 102–106 || 106–110 || 110–114
| 114–118 || 118–123 || 123–129 || 129–135 || 135–141 || 141–147
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Waist girth
| 72 || 76 || 80 || 84 || 88 || 92 || 96 || 100
| 104 || 108 || 114 || 120 || 126 || 132
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| 70–74 || 74–78 || 78–82 || 82–86 || 86–90 || 90–94 || 94–98 || 98–102
| 102–106 || 106–111 || 111–117 || 117–123 || 123–129 || 129–135
|}

: ''drop'' = ''waist girth'' − ''chest girth''.
Example: While manufacturers will typically design clothes for ''chest girth'' = 100&amp;nbsp;cm such that it fits ''waist girth'' = 88&amp;nbsp;cm, they may also want to combine that ''chest girth'' with neighbouring ''waist girth'' step sizes 84&amp;nbsp;cm or 92&amp;nbsp;cm, to cover these drop types (−16&amp;nbsp;cm and −8&amp;nbsp;cm) as well.

The standard also suggests that neck girth can be associated with chest girth:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Association of neck and chest girth
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Neck girth
| 37 || 38 || 39 || 40 || 41 || 42 || 43 || 44

|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| 36.5–37.5 || 37.5–38.5 || 38.5–39.5 || 39.5–40.5 || 40.5–41.5 || 41.5–42.5 || 42.5–43.5 || 43.5–44.5
| 44.5–45.8 || 45.8–47.3 || 47.3–48.8 || 48.8–50.3 || 50.3–51.1
|- style="text-align:center;"

| 88 || 92 || 96 || 100 || 104 || 108 || 112 || 116
| 120 || 126 || 132 || 138 || 144
|}

The standard further suggests that arm length can be associated with height:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Association of arm length and body height
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Height
| 156 || 160 || 164 || 168 || 172 || 176 || 180 || 184 || 188 || 192 || 196 || 200
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Arm length

|}

===Women===
[[Image:EN-13402-dress.png|thumb|EN 13402–1 pictogram example for dress size 88–72–96]]

====Dress sizes====
The standard sizes and ranges for bust, waist and hip girth are mostly based on a step of 4&amp;nbsp;cm, for larger sizes 5&amp;nbsp;cm (hip) or 6&amp;nbsp;cm (bust and waist):

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Women’s standard sizes for drop = &amp;minus;16&amp;nbsp;cm
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Bust girth
| 76 || 80 || 84 || 88 || 92 || 96 || 100 || 104 || 110

| 113–119 || 119–125 || 125–131 || 131–137 || 137–143 || 143–149 || 149–155
|- style="text-align:center;"

| 97–103 || 103–109 || 109–115 || 115–121 || 121–127 || 127–133 || 133–139
|- style="text-align:center;"

| 120–125 || 125–130 || 130–135 || 135–140 || 140–145 || 145–150 || 150–155
|}

====Bra sizes====
[[Image:EN-13402-bra.png|thumb|EN 13402–1 pictogram for bra size 70B]]
{{See also|Bra size}}

The European standard EN 13402 also defines bra sizes based on the "bust girth" and the "underbust girth". Bras are labeled with the under bust girth (rounded to the nearest multiple of 5&amp;nbsp;cm), followed by a letter code that indicates the "cup size" defined below, according to this table defined by the standard.

The standard sizes for brassiere are based on a step of 5&amp;nbsp;cm:
{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Underbust girth
| 60 || 65 || 70 || 75 || 80 || 85 || 90 || 95
| 100 || 105 || 110 || 115 || 120 || 125
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| 58–62 || 63–67 || 68–72 || 73–77 || 78–82 || 83–87 || 88–92 || 93–97
| 98–102 || 103–107 || 108–112 || 113–117 || 118–122 || 123–127
|}

The secondary dimension ''cup size'' can be expressed in terms of the difference
: ''cup size'' = ''bust girth'' − ''underbust girth''
and can be labelled compactly using a letter code appended to the ''underbust girth'':

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Code
| AA|| A || B || C || D || E || F || G || H
|-
! Cup size range
| 10–12 || 12–14 || 14–16 || 16–18 || 18–20 || 20–22 || 22–24 || 24–26 || 26–28
|}

;Example 1: Bra size 70B is suitable for women with ''underbust girth'' 68–72&amp;nbsp;cm and ''bust girth'' from 82–84&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;!--for 68cm--&gt; to 86–88&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;!--for 72cm--&gt;.
;Example 2: A woman with an ''underbust girth'' of 89&amp;nbsp;cm and a ''bust girth'' of 108&amp;nbsp;cm has ''cup size'' 19&amp;nbsp;cm (= 108&amp;nbsp;cm – 89&amp;nbsp;cm) or "D". Her underbust girth rounded to the nearest multiple of 5&amp;nbsp;cm is 90&amp;nbsp;cm. Therefore, her bra size according to the standard is 90D.

===Letter codes===

For clothes where a larger step size is sufficient, the standard also defines a letter code. This code represents the bust girth for women and the chest girth for men. The standard does not define such a code for children.
Each range combines two adjacent size steps. The ranges could be extended below XXS or above 3XL if necessary.

{{update|part 4 of the standard|date=September 2011}}&lt;!--it feels it has been abandoned completely--&gt;
The fourth part of the standard is still under review. It will define a compact coding system for clothes sizes. This was originally intended primarily for industry use in databases and as a part of stock-keeping identifiers and catalogue ordering numbers, but later users have also expressed a desire to use compact codes for customer communication. Writing out all the centimetre figures of all the primary and secondary measures from EN 13402-2 can – in some cases – require up to 12 digits. The full list of centimetre figures on the pictogram contains a lot of redundancy and the same information can be squeezed into fewer [[character (computing)|character]]s with lookup tables. EN 13402-4 will define such tables.

An earlier draft of this part of the standard attempted to list all in-use combinations of EN 13402-3 measures and assigned a short 2- or 3-digit code to each. Some of the industry representatives involved in the standardization process considered this approach too restrictive. Others argued that the primary dimension in centimetres should be a prominent part of the code. Therefore, this proposal, originally expected to be adopted in 2005, was rejected.

Since then, several new proposals have been presented to the CEN working group. One of these, tabled by the [http://www.aedt.org/ European Association of National Organisations of Textile Traders (AEDT)], proposes a 5-character alphanumeric code, consisting of the 3-digit centimetre figure of the primary body dimension, followed by one or two letters that code a secondary dimension, somewhat like the system already defined for bra sizes.&lt;ref&gt;CEN/TC 248/WG 10 N 285&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an item designed for 100&amp;nbsp;cm bust girth, 104&amp;nbsp;cm &lt;!--(B): (104-100)/4=1, 0=&gt;A, …?--&gt; hip girth and 176&amp;nbsp;cm &lt;!--(G): A=152, step=4cm--&gt;height could bear the compact size code "100BG". This proposal was agreed upon in 2006, but later disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aedt.org/resources/aedt-publications/doc_download/108-study-on-labelling-of-textile-products#page=39 |title=Study on labelling of textile products |publisher=AEDT |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by Bogusławska-Bączek published in 2010 showed that there were still significant difficulties in identifying clothing sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

[[File:Edward Solomon photo.jpg|thumb|Edward Solomon]]
'''Edward Solomon''' (25 July 1855 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1895) was an English composer, as well as a conductor, orchestrator and pianist. He died at age 39 by which time he had written dozens of works produced for the stage, including several for the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], including ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'' (1891). Early in his career, he was a frequent collaborator of [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]].  He had a bigamous marriage with [[Lillian Russell]] in the 1880s.

==Life and career==
Edward ("Teddy") Solomon was born in [[Lambeth]], London, to a Jewish family. He had ten siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobsuniverse.com/BOW/Books/Bergh-Opera-4/Bergh-4-23.htm Profile of Solomon at the Opera World site]&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Charles Solomon (1817–1890), a [[music hall]]  pianist, conductor and composer, and his wife, Cesira "Sarah" Marinina, née Mirandoli (1834–1891). He picked up music by working with his father.

Aged 17 or 18, Solomon married 15-year-old Jane Isaacs in 1873, and the two had a daughter, Claire Romaine (1873–1964), who became an actress, but Solomon soon deserted Isaacs and, over the years, took a series of mistresses. Isaacs later sang under the stage name Lily Grey.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Tomes, Jason. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/53516 Edward Solomon], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, October 2007; accessed 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
His first [[comic opera]] was ''A Will With a Vengeance'' (1876), a one-act work with a libretto by Frederick Hay, based on ''La Vendetta''.  This was produced at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].  In 1879, he met [[Henry Pottinger Stephens|Henry Pottinger "Pot" Stephens]] while he was the musical director at the [[Royalty Theatre]] conducting, among other works, [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Zoo]]''.&lt;ref name=Who&gt;Stone, David. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/S/SolomonEdward.htmn Edward Solomon], ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte'', 17 February 2002; accessed 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  With Stephens, he produced his first successes, ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' (1880), a "nautical comedy opera" in two acts; and ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' (1881, celebrating a well known 18th century highwayman),&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/09/11/102758235.pdf Review of ''Claude Duval'']&lt;/ref&gt; both of which remained popular for many years in both the UK and US.  Other Solomon and Stephens pieces were ''Lord Bateman, or Picotee's Pledge'' (1882), ''Virginia and Paul, or Ringing the Changes'' (1883)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=sZkQAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22edward+solomon%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dxhgHYMd_V&amp;sig=bvKnaXM2mjGWwEgZcGcX0n8BiBg Libretto to ''Virginia'']&lt;/ref&gt; and later ''[[The Red Hussar]]'' (1889), a "comedy opera" in three acts.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt; Together, they would also write ''Popsy Wopsy'', a "musical absurdity" (1880) and ''Pocahontas'' (1884).

Solomon also wrote the music for the short companion pieces ''[[Quite an Adventure]]'' (1881; [[Olympic Theatre]]; revived in 1894 at the [[Savoy Theatre]]) and ''Round and Square'' (1885), each with a libretto by [[Frank Desprez]], and each produced on tour by D'Oyly Carte companies in the 1880s and 1890s.  Other early shows included ''Love and Larceny'' in 1881, a farce, ''Through the Looking-Glass'' (1882), ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', a [[comic opera]] with a libretto by [[Sydney Grundy]] (1882; revived 1892 at the Savoy),&lt;ref&gt;''Reynolds's Newspaper'', 23 July  1882, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the successful ''Polly, or The Pet of the Regiment'' (1884) and ''[[Pepita; or, the Girl with the Glass Eyes]]'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Deshler. [https://books.google.com/books?id=s-URAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA150  - ''The Theatre''], vol. 1, 1886, p. 150, accessed June 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Thomas Alston. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EzELAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA176  ''A History of the New York Stage''], 1903, p. 176, accessed June 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote ballads like "I Should Like To" and "Over the Way", and numerous salon piano solos and arrangements.  For instance, he arranged [[George Grossmith]]'s "See Me Dance the Polka" for piano.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Later career===
[[File:Carte-solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of Solomon (r) with [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], 1891]]
With [[F. C. Burnand]], Solomon wrote ''Pickwick'' (1889), which also had a run in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of 1894 production,] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Domestic Economy'' (1890), and "The Tiger" (1890).  Burnand's contribution to the last of these was so unacceptable that the work was hissed off the stage on its opening night.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn. "The Nautch Girl", article in centenary book for ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]''. Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, 1992, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pickwick'' was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with [[George Grossmith]]'s ''[[Cups and Saucers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, David. [http://www.retrospectopera.org.uk/CD_catalogue.html "''Pickwick'' by Burnand &amp; Solomon and ''Cups and Saucers'' by George Grossmith"],  Retrospect Opera, 2016, accessed 13 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1891-93, after [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] had temporarily separated, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] mounted a number of non-G&amp;S pieces to keep the [[Savoy Theatre]] open, including a revival of ''The Vicar of Bray'' in 1892.  Solomon's most famous work produced by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] was probably ''[[The Nautch Girl]] or, The Rajah of Chutneypore'' (1891), an "Indian comic opera" in two acts with a libretto by [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], and lyrics by Dance and [[Frank Desprez]]. It initially ran for 200 performances at the [[Savoy Theatre]] and then toured. The company also toured ''The Vicar of Bray''.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;

His last stage work was ''On the March'' (1896), a musical comedy in two acts, with John Crook and [[Frederic Clay]], to a libretto by [[William Yardley (cricketer)|William Yardley]], [[B. C. Stephenson]] and Cecil Clay, based on ''In Camp'' by Victoria Vokes.

===Bigamous marriage and personal information===
Solomon has been described as "a diminutive clean-shaven young man ... whimsical, flamboyant, superstitious, hardly to be trusted with money or women, but brimming with melodic invention and able to compose at speed."&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He met the American actress [[Lillian Russell]], in 1882 at [[Tony Pastor]]'s New York Casino Theatre where he was the season's musical director and she became the star. Unaware of his first marriage she became his mistress. Subsequently, they sailed together to London, where she starred in several of his works, written specifically for her, including ''Virginia'', ''Billee Taylor'', ''Polly'' and ''Pocahontas''.  These were not highly successful in Britain, so they returned to America, where Russell was very well received in these works. They had a daughter together, Dorothy, in 1884, and married in New Jersey in 1885. The relationship soured, mostly due to Solomon's poor finances, and their last show, ''The Maid and the Moonshiner'' (1886) was a flop. When creditors sued Solomon, he fled the country.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Solomon was arrested in London in 1886 for bigamy, but the case against him collapsed, as no American witnesses came forward. When she learned of his previous marriage, Russell sued for divorce, finally obtaining it in 1893.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valentinetheatre.com/mural/bios/Lillian_Russell.html "Lillian Russell"], Valentine Theatre, accessed 16 July 2014; Bergh, Albert Ellery. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ProvAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA173 ''Drama and Opera: The opera''], Athenian society (1909), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Solomon's first wife divorced him in 1887.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; In 1889 he married an actress, Kate Everleigh. His brother Frederick Solomon sang in ''Billee Taylor'' in the provinces (1883) and was the composer of the comic opera ''Captain Kidd, or The Bold Buccaneer,'' produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, [[Liverpool]], on 10 September 1883.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Solomon died in London of typhoid fever in 1895 at the age of 39.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16445">The '''Firestone Collection of Canadian Art''' is a collection of over 1600 works of twentieth-century Canadian art amassed by Ottawa residents O.J. and Isobel Firestone beginning in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Text Panels|last=Basciano|first=Rebecca|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2017|isbn=|location=Ottawa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a public collection owned by the [[City of Ottawa]], and under the custodianship of the [[Ottawa Art Gallery]]. There are dedicated gallery and storage spaces at the Ottawa Art Gallery for the Collection. Furthermore, the original marble and brass staircase from the Firestone home&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is now located as the main feature of the lobby of the new Ottawa Art Gallery building at 50 Mackenzie King Bridge.

== History ==
Otto Jack Firestone immigrated to Canada from Austria in 1938, moving to Ottawa to work as an economist for the Federal Government after completing his master's degree in the subject at [[McGill University]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by visits to the [[National Gallery of Canada]], in the following years Firestone and his wife, concert pianist Isobel Torontow, visited artists’ studios and began collecting their art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Through their avid collecting the couple formed bonds with well-known members of the Canadian art world including [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] member, [[A. Y. Jackson|A.Y. Jackson]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Firestones began constructing their new three-storey, 8,000-square-foot home in [[Rockcliffe Park, Ontario|Rockcliffe Park]] at 375 Minto Place in 1960.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Named for Isobel, "Belmanor" was a new larger home constructed to accommodate the Firestone’s growing art collection with temperature and humidity control and exhibition lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modernist building became a social hub for friends of the Firestones and members of the arts community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
The Firestone family made the decision to donate their collection (at that time numbering around 1200 works of art), their home, and a $100,000 endowment fund for art conservation and maintenance to the Ontario Heritage Foundation (now the [[Ontario Heritage Trust]]) in 1972.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The artwork remained on display in the home, and O.J. Firestone conducted regular tours for the visiting public by appointment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; O.J. and Isobel Firestone divorced in 1978, and Firestone remarried, to Barbara McMahon.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Barbara Firestone spearheaded two tours of the Collection to Western and Eastern Europe in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 1991, the Ontario Heritage Foundation decided the Collection, now numbering 1600 works of art, needed a new home as O.J. Firestone, now in his senior years and divorced from his second wife Barbara, was moving out of his home at Minto Place.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A joint bid was submitted by the City of Ottawa and the newly incorporated Ottawa Art Gallery to acquire the "Firestone Art Collection," as it was then known. [[Firestone Collection of Canadian Art#cite note-:1-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] They won the bid, and the City obtained ownership of the nationally important Collection by promising new spaces dedicated to its maintenance and display within the Ottawa Art Gallery.[[Firestone Collection of Canadian Art#cite note-:1-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
June 6, 1992 marked the inaugural exhibition ''Treasures from the Firestone Art Collection'' at the Ottawa Art Gallery, and it was attended by both O.J. and Isobel Firestone, Glenn McInnes the first chair of the board of directors, and Mayo Graham, the first director of the Gallery.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Revealing the new gallery spaces and the newly acquired Firestone Art Collection, the exhibition emphasized its size and breadth and included works by prominent Canadian artists [[Maurice Cullen (artist)|Maurice Cullen]], [[Lawren Harris|Lawren S. Harris]], [[Emily Carr]], [[Paul-Émile Borduas]], and [[David Milne (artist)|David Milne]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This 1992 exhibition was part of the Ottawa Art Gallery’s re-opening after renovations to the gallery spaces including the creation of the Firestone Gallery, marking a pivotal moment in the history of both the Firestone Art Collection and the Ottawa Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="The Founders Lobby"|last=Graham|first=Mayo|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=1993|isbn=|location=Ottawa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; O.J. Firestone commented on the significance of the relocation himself at the event when he declared, "The collection is now standing on its own feet…here it has room to breathe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds from the sale of the Firestone home went towards renovating Arts Court, including the creation of the Firestone Gallery, and maintaining the collection.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the art collection, now known as the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art (FCCA) has been featured in rotating displays at the Ottawa Art Gallery, including thematically curated exhibitions as well as a permanent exhibition.

After being sold and rented for several years, the Firestone home was eventually demolished in 2007 by the owner due to the amount of repairs needed (heating issues and moisture damage).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The new home built in place of the Firestone home maintains some stylistic elements of the original architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20061209/282424164730550|title=The house that Jack built|last=Dare|first=Patrick|date=2006-12-06|work=Ottawa Citizen|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner invited the Ottawa Art Gallery to document and retrieve features of the home before demolishing it, however, and the Gallery then stored those items (the staircase, paneling, coffers, and brass screens) in archival storage with plans to incorporate them into a new building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20070127/282733402392111|title=Art Collection Going Home|last=Enman|first=Charles|date=2007|work=Ottawa Citizen|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Ottawa Art Gallery building opening early 2018 provides larger gallery spaces for the Firestone Gallery as well as the marble staircase from the Firestone home, acquired in 2007, which will lead visitors from the lobby to the Firestone Gallery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to the original staircase from the Firestone home, the new Firestone Gallery also has brass and teak wood elements reminiscent of the interior design of the home to re-contextualize the Collection in the new space.

== Inside the Collection ==

Including paintings, drawings, prints and sculpture from across Canada, the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art contains a variety of mediums and styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=We'll All Become Stories|last=Basciano|first=Rebecca|publisher=Figure 1|year=2017|isbn=978-1-77327-031-9|location=Vancouver|pages=42|chapter=Regional Art Collectors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1600 artworks in the Collection 1059 are works on paper, including charcoal and graphite sketches, watercolour and acrylic washes as well as collage.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before it was handed over to the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa Art Gallery, O.J. Firestone organized his collection into historical, regional, and subject matter categories.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Art Collection|last=Firestone|first=O.J.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson Ltd.|year=1978|isbn=0-07-082747-8|location=Toronto|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the historical category Firestone distinguished three time periods, the first being 1867-1914 representing the period of domestic landscape painting, the second being 1919-1939 representing the period of nationalistic art and work by the Group of Seven, and the third being 1945–present representing non-figurative and "internationally oriented" art.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to Firestone, there were two main groups in the Canadian art scene represented in his art collection: the Group of Seven and French Canadian artists.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For some artists in the Collection, the Firestones acquired a piece from every year of their artistic career or from key years.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Art Collection|last=Firestone|first=O.J.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson Ltd.|year=1978|isbn=0-07-082747-8|location=Toronto|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Firestone Collection of Canadian Art represents art collected from the 1950s, through until 1985.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
Before being relocated to the Ottawa Art Gallery, the Firestone Art Collection was on display in the Firestone home and viewed by the public during tours led by O. J. Firestone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Among the conditions of the donation of the collection to the Ontario Heritage Foundation was that the collection was to be on display and accessible to the public in the Ottawa area.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Firestone Collection of Canadian Art has been exhibited and re-interpreted in many ways since its arrival at the Ottawa Art Gallery, including shows focusing on single artists in the Collection and shows arranged around particular themes drawn from the Collection.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After the inaugural exhibition in 1992, the Ottawa Art Gallery regularly exhibited selections of thirty to forty artworks from the Firestone Collection, presenting themes such as landscapes and cityscapes, waterways, the impact of the Group of Seven, and the influence of European art movements on Canadian Art.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibitions of works from the Firestone Collection were also enhanced by loans of artworks from other Canadian institutions, as well as being placed in dialogue with contemporary artwork from the Ottawa Art Gallery’s permanent collection.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; An educational program started in 1996 called ''Students Interpret the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art'' gave local high school students studying visual arts an opportunity to create and display artwork inspired by the Collection.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Upon arriving at the Ottawa Art Gallery the Firestone Art Collection was catalogued with files created on each artist, a resource library created to house relevant art-historical texts, and publications and promotional material circulated to other Canadian art institutions since that time.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=Gianni|first=Benjamin|last2=Sinclair|first2=Catherine|publisher=Ottawa Art Gallery|year=2008|isbn=978-1-894906-32-6|location=Ottawa|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lectures and panel discussions regarding exhibited works from the Firestone Art Collection have also drawn scholarly attention, as O.J. Firestone had wished for.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; To increase the accessibility of the Collection, pieces from the collection have toured overseas as well as continuing to travel throughout Canada to art institutions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The 2004 exhibition ''Full Space: Modern Art from the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art'' curated by Emily Falvey, was the Ottawa Art Gallery’s first national touring exhibition of the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art. The 2005 exhibition ''Private Eye: Choosing Ottawa for a National Collection'' curated by Catherine Sinclair and coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the City of Ottawa aimed to display never before seen works from the Collection. The 2008 exhibition ''Le Salon: Celebrating 35 Years of the Firestone Collection of Canadian'' ''Art'' also curated by Catherine Sinclair celebrated the history of the Collection and the contribution of the Firestones to the local art community. More recent exhibitions showing the breadth of the collection and artworks relating to geographic locations from across Canada include the 2010 exhibition ''At Land’s End'' showing artworks that explore the relationship between land and sea&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.akimbo.ca/akimbos/?id=20018|title=At Land's End|last=|first=|date=|website=Akimbo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2016 exhibition ''Coast to Coast: Features from the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art'' exploring works from artists across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/exhibitions/coast-to-coast-features-from-the-firestone-collection-of-canadian-art/|title=Coast to Coast: Features from the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregory House''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] (born 1959) is the [[title character]] of the American [[medical drama]] series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. Created by [[David Shore]] and portrayed by English actor [[Hugh Laurie]], he leads a team of diagnosticians as the Head of [[Medical diagnosis|Diagnostic Medicine]] at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tioti.com/show/housemd |title=House, M.D. |publisher=Tioti.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012015231/http://www.tioti.com/show/housemd |archivedate=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

House's character has been described as a [[misanthropy|misanthrope]], [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], [[Narcissism|narcissist]], and [[wikt:curmudgeon|curmudgeon]], the last of which was named one of the top television words of 2005 in honor of the character.&lt;ref name="top words"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/tv/tv |title=‘Refugee’ Tops ‘Desperation’ and ‘Camp Cupcake’ as Top Television Buzzword of the 2005 |publisher=The Global Language Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=March 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515104011/http://www.languagemonitor.com/tv/tv/ |archivedate=May 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; House is the only character to appear in all 177 episodes and, except for [[James Wilson (House)|Wilson]]'s brief appearance, is the only regular character to appear in the season six premiere.

In the series, the character's unorthodox diagnostic approaches, radical therapeutic motives, and stalwart rationality have resulted in much conflict between him and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kristine|first=Diane|publication-date=April 23, 2007| title=Ending Season Three With a Bang?

==Character history==
Gregory House was born to [[List of House characters#John and Blythe House|John and Blythe House]] on June 11, 1959,&lt;ref&gt;''No Reason'', S02E24 - after being shot, House is hospitalized. His hospital bracelet displays DOB as 06/11/1959, which is Hugh Laurie's birthdate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--His NJ driver's licence in "Two Stories" seems to trump any other claim...--&gt; or May 15, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;S07E22 a medicine bottle lists his DOB as 05/15/1959&lt;/ref&gt; House is a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military brat]]; his father served as a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[United States Marine Corps Aviation|aviator]] and transferred often to other bases during House's childhood.&lt;ref name="daddy's boy"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Daddy's Boy| episodelink = Daddy's Boy (House episode)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = November 8, 2005| season = 2| number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; House presumably picked up his affinity for languages during this period and shows a level of understanding of Chinese, Greek,&lt;ref&gt;S06E19, "The Choice", while interacting with a patient.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;His knowledge of Mandarin is evidenced in "Risky Business", S08E04, in conversation with his patient.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--"enough to count to ten", according to "Sleeping Dogs Lie"--&gt; One place in which his father was stationed was Egypt, where House developed a fascination with [[archaeology]] and treasure-hunting, which led him to keep his treasure-hunting tools well into adulthood.&lt;ref name="clueless"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Clueless| episodelink = Clueless (House episode)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = March 28, 2006| season = 2| number = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another station was Japan, where a 14-year-old House discovered his vocation after a rock climbing incident with his friend. He witnessed the respect given to a [[Burakumin|''buraku'']] doctor who solved the case no other doctor could.&lt;ref name="comaguy"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Son of Coma Guy| episodelink = Son of Coma Guy| series = House, M.D.|airdate = November 14, 2006| season = 3| number = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spent some time in the Philippines, where he received dental surgery.

House loves his mother but hates his father, who he claims has an "insane moral compass", and deliberately attempts to avoid both parents.&lt;ref name="daddy's boy" /&gt; At one point, House tells a story of his parents leaving him with his grandmother, whose punishments constituted [[Child abuse|abuse]].&lt;ref name="oneday" /&gt; However, he later confesses it was his father who abused him.&lt;ref name="oneday"&gt;{{cite episode| title = One Day, One Room| episodelink = One Day, One Room| series = House, M.D.|airdate = January 30, 2007| season = 3| number = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this abuse, House never believed John was his biological father; at the age of 12, he [[Abductive reasoning|inferred]] that a friend of the family with the same birthmark as himself was his real father.&lt;ref name="birthmarks"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Birthmarks| episodelink = Birthmarks (House) | series = [[House (TV series)|House, M.D.]]|airdate = October 14, 2008| season = 5| number = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "Birthmarks", House discovers that John is not his biological father after ordering a [[DNA profiling|DNA test]].&lt;ref name="birthmarks" /&gt; After a second DNA test was performed in the episode "Love is Blind", House discovers that the man he assumed to be his biological father, Thomas Bell, was not either.&lt;ref name="love"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Love Is Blind| episodelink = Love Is Blind (House)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = March 19, 2012| season = 8| number = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identity of his real father remains unknown.

[[File:JHU15.jpg|thumb|right|House studied both as an undergraduate earning a BSc in physics and a medical student at [[Johns Hopkins University]]]]

House first attended [[Johns Hopkins University]] as an undergraduate. Before fully committing to medicine as his discipline, he considered getting a [[Ph.D.]] in physics, researching [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="vicodin" /&gt; He was accepted to the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] and excelled during his time there. He was a frontrunner for a prestigious and competitive internship at the [[Mayo Clinic]],&lt;ref name="distractions"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Distractions| episodelink = Distractions (House episode)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = February 14, 2006| season = 2| number = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but another student, Philip Weber, caught him cheating, resulting in his expulsion from Johns Hopkins and rejection from the internship.&lt;ref name="distractions" /&gt; While appealing his expulsion, he studied at the [[University of Michigan Medical School]] and worked at a bookstore, where he met his future employer and love interest [[Lisa Cuddy]],&lt;ref name="humpty"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Humpty Dumpty| episodelink = Humpty Dumpty (House episode)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = September 27, 2005| season = 2| number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he shared a night where "he gave her everything she asked for"&lt;ref name="Top Secret"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Top Secret | episodelink = Top Secret (House episode)| series = House, M.D.| airdate = March 27, 2007| season = 3| number = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;; years later, Cuddy noted that by that time, House, although still a student, had already become "a legend" due to his diagnostic brilliance. After the appeal process, he was denied re-entry into Johns Hopkins. During a medical convention in [[New Orleans]], House first saw his eventual best friend [[James Wilson (House)|Dr. James Wilson]]. Wilson, who was going through his first divorce at the time,&lt;ref name="birthmarks" /&gt; broke a mirror in frustration and started a bar fight after a man repeatedly played "[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]" on a jukebox.&lt;ref name="birthmarks" /&gt; Out of sheer boredom with the convention and to "have somebody to drink with", House paid for the damage, bailed him out, and hired an attorney to clear Wilson's name (who failed to do so), starting their professional and personal relationship.&lt;ref name="birthmarks"/&gt; House says multiple times during the series that he is a "[[Board certified|board-certified]] diagnostician with a double specialty in [[infectious disease]] and [[nephrology]]."&lt;ref name="razor"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Occam's Razor| episodelink = Occam's Razor| series = House, M.D.|airdate = November 30, 2004| season = 1| number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately ten years before the beginning of the series, House entered into a relationship with [[Stacy Warner]], a [[constitutional law]]yer, after she shot him during a "Lawyers vs. Doctors" [[paintball]] match.&lt;ref name="comaguy" /&gt; Five years later, during a game of golf, he suffered an [[infarction]] in his right leg which went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns. House would eventually diagnose the infarction himself.&lt;ref name="threestories" /&gt; An [[aneurysm]] in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become [[necrosis|necrotic]].&lt;ref name="threestories" /&gt; House had the dead muscle bypassed to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name="threestories" /&gt; He was unwilling to allow an amputation opting instead to endure excruciating post-operative pain to retain the use of his leg.&lt;ref name="threestories" /&gt; However, after he was put into a chemically induced coma to sleep through the worst of the pain, Stacy, House's [[medical proxy]], and Cuddy, who was House's doctor at the time, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle.&lt;ref name="threestories" /&gt; This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="threestories" /&gt;

House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision after he obviously didn't want it, and this was the reason Stacy eventually left him.&lt;ref name="threestories"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Three Stories| episodelink = Three Stories (House episode)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = May 17, 2005| season = 1| number = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; House now suffers [[chronic pain]] in his thigh and uses a [[Assistive cane|cane]] to aid his walking, though he often wields the cane for protection, pushing aside privacy curtains, stopping elevator doors, or knocking on doors. He also frequently takes [[Vicodin]], a moderate to severe painkiller, to relieve his pain.&lt;ref name="pilot" /&gt; House does briefly break his dependency with psychiatric help, after he suffers a [[psychotic break]]. When Stacy makes her first appearance in season 1, she is married to a high school guidance counselor named Mark Warner.&lt;ref name="honeymoon"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Honeymoon| episodelink = Honeymoon (House episode)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = May 24, 2005| season = 1| number = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she and House have a brief, intimate encounter during the second season, House eventually tells Stacy to go back to her husband, devastating her. In the season two finale "[[No Reason (House)|No Reason]]" one of House's former patients shoots him twice.

At the beginning of season three, House temporarily regains his ability to walk and run after receiving [[ketamine]] treatment for his gunshot injuries.&lt;ref name="meaning"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Meaning | episodelink = Meaning (House)| series = House, M.D.| airdate = September 5, 2006| season = 2| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the chronic pain in his leg comes back and House, who seems [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] because of the returning pain, takes painkillers and uses his cane once again.&lt;ref name="consent"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Informed Consent | episodelink = Informed Consent (House)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = September 19, 2006| season = 3| number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other doctors speculate his cane and [[opiate]] re-usage are due to his psychological tendencies.&lt;ref name="consent" /&gt;

On a routine clinic visit, a police detective, [[Michael Tritter]], is seen by House. Tritter observes House taking Vicodin for his pain and blames this for House's being rude and a bully. Tritter, believing doctors should be more responsible while practicing medicine, decides to take it upon himself to take legal action to free House of his addiction by launching an investigation into suspected drug abuse. The investigation slowly involves Cuddy, Wilson and House's diagnostics team, with Tritter using extreme measures to get information. House, being forcibly weaned off Vicodin to take a deal where he would keep his medical license, goes to extreme lengths to manage his pain by stealing Oxycodone from a cancer patient of Wilson's who had just died, giving Tritter what he needed to bring House to trial. At the pretrial hearing, the Judge decides House is not a danger to society and that his pain management for his leg is not as serious as Tritter made it seem. This conclusion is reached when Cuddy manufactures evidence and perjures herself to keep House out of jail.

During season five, House once again regains his ability to walk without pain after taking [[methadone]] but soon stops after nearly killing a patient due to an uncharacteristic medical error. At the end of season five, House's use of Vicodin reaches a level in which House starts hallucinating about a former fellowship candidate who is also Wilson's dead girlfriend Amber Volakis and a relationship with Cuddy. When House comes to the conclusion Vicodin is making him hallucinate and taking over his life, he checks himself into Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital. At the start of season six, after spending time in Mayfield, House stops taking pain medications and with the help of Dr. Darryl Nolan, finds other ways to deal with his pain and other aspects of his life. During his stay it is revealed by Dr. Nolan that House suffers from [[clinical depression]], has antisocial tendencies, an inflated ego and severe trust issues. Dr. Nolan at one point even took House to a gathering in an effort to make House open up to people. To help manage his pain House finds a short-lived hobby in cooking. Thirteen (Remy Hadley), Cuddy, and Wilson discover House is very good at his new hobby, attributing this to House thinking of ingredients in terms of chemistry.

House eventually finds the one thing that seems to help the pain go away: practicing medicine. After he diagnoses a patient online for his team (without their knowledge), and shows Dr. Nolan how this reduces his pain, Nolan suggests House resume his practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/house/epic-fail/episode/1296797/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap TV Guide House recaps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003020339/http://www.tv.com/house/epic-fail/episode/1296797/recap.html?tag=episode_recap%3Brecap |date=October 3, 2009 }} episode 5,15&lt;/ref&gt;

In season seven, when Cuddy, who is House's girlfriend at this point, has a brush with death, House goes back on Vicodin in order to cope with the fear of losing her. Near the end of season seven, House finds out the experimental drug he had been using caused fatal cancerous tumors in all of the lab rats in the experiment. He gets a [[CT scan]] of his leg and finds three tumors close to the surface of the skin in his leg. He goes home, cleans his bathroom, and attempts to perform surgery on himself to extract the tumors in his bathtub.&lt;ref name="hours"&gt;{{cite episode|title=After Hours| episodelink = After Hours (House)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = May 16, 2011| season = 7| number = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season eight, House finds himself in jail after running his car into Cuddy's house, which was shown in the ending of the season finale of season seven. There he finds his need for Vicodin is a weakness when an inmate makes House steal twenty pills of Vicodin or be killed. Throughout season eight, House's therapeutic use of Vicodin becomes more habitual, similar to his use before season five.

The final season's opening episode partly explores what path an imprisoned House would take aside from practicing medicine, revealing [[physics]] as his other forte.&lt;ref name="vicodin"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Twenty Vicodin| episodelink = Twenty Vicodin| series = House, M.D.|airdate = October 3, 2011| season = 8| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode "Body &amp; Soul" makes a nod to this with a reference to a [[particle physics]] text amongst his books, as mentioned by his then-wife [[Dominika Petrova]].&lt;ref name="body&amp;soul"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Body &amp; Soul| episodelink =| series = House, M.D.|airdate = April 23, 2012| season = 8| number = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; House fakes his own death in the series finale, thus giving up his ability to practice medicine again, in order to spend time with Wilson, who has five months left to live. He does this in order to avoid being sent back to prison for destroying an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machine in a prank gone wrong. The series ends with House and Wilson riding off into the countryside on motorcycles, as [[Robert Chase|Dr. Robert Chase]] takes over House's department.&lt;ref name="everybody dies"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Everybody Dies| episodelink = Everybody Dies (House)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = May 21, 2012| season = 8| number = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

House speaks [[Multilingualism|multiple languages]], demonstrating fluency in English, Spanish,&lt;ref name="humpty" /&gt; [[Russian language|Russian]],&lt;ref name="FallFromGrace"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Fall From Grace | episodelink = Fall from Grace (House)| series = House, M.D.|season = 7| number = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]],&lt;ref name="fidelity"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Fidelity| episodelink = Fidelity (House)| series = House, M.D.| season = 1| number = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]],&lt;ref name="distractions"/&gt; and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]].&lt;ref name="SleepingDogsLie"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Sleeping Dogs Lie |episodelink = Sleeping Dogs Lie (House)|series = House, M.D.|season = 2|number = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He listens to [[jazz]], plays the [[piano]] ([[Hugh Laurie#Music|as does Hugh Laurie]]) and has an interest in vintage [[electric guitar]]s. House has often credited guitarist/songwriter [[Eric Clapton]] and composer [[Giacomo Puccini]] as his biggest musical influences, drawing parallels to those of [[Hugh Laurie]]'s. He is an avid [[video game|gamer]] with a preference for [[handheld game console|handhelds]] (owning two Sony PSPs and three Nintendo handhelds, two Game Boys and a DS), is known to attend [[monster truck]] [[truck pulling|pulls]] with Wilson, and watch the soap operas ''[[General Hospital]]'' and the fictional ''Prescription Passion''. House is a fan of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. He is also (as is Laurie) a motorcyclist, riding a [[Honda CBR1000RR]] Repsol Edition, license plate Y91, as seen in "Swan Song", "Help Me", "Deception" and "Post Mortem"; otherwise, he drives a [[Dodge Dynasty]] sedan.

House is an [[atheist]]. He openly and relentlessly mocks colleagues and patients who express any belief in religion, deeming such beliefs as illogical. He does not believe in an afterlife because he finds it is better to believe life "isn't just a test".&lt;ref name="threestories" /&gt; However, in the season four episode "[[97 Seconds]]", he expresses sufficient interest in the possibility of an afterlife to electrocute himself in an effort to find out; he is dissatisfied with the results and denounces the possibility of an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = 97 Seconds | episodelink = 97 Seconds (House)|series = House, M.D.|airdate = October 9, 2007| season = 4| number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also an example of House's tendency to self-experiment and submit to risky medical procedures in the name of truth. Over the course of the series, he disproves the effectiveness of a [[migraine]] cure by self-inducing a migraine and controlling the effects through drugs,&lt;ref name="distractions" /&gt; undergoes a blood transfusion to assist with a diagnosis, and overdoses on [[physostigmine]] to improve his memory after sustaining head injuries, subsequently causing his heart to stop beating, then undergoes deep brain stimulation soon after.&lt;ref name="YDWTK"&gt;{{cite episode| title = You Don't Want To Know| episodelink = You Don't Want To Know (House episode)|credits=[[David Shore|Shore, David]]; Hass, Sara|series = House, M.D.|airdate = November 20, 2008| season = 4| number = 8|accessdate=November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HH"&gt;{{cite episode| title = House's Head| episodelink = House's Head|credits=[[David Shore|Shore, David]]; [[Peter Blake (writer)|Blake, Peter]]; [[Doris Egan|Egan, Doris]]; Friend, Russel; Lerner, Garett; [[David Foster (writer)|Foster, David]]|series = House, M.D.|airdate = May 12, 2008| season = 4| number = 15|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WH"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Wilson's Heart| episodelink = Wilson's Heart (House)|series = House, M.D.|airdate = May 19, 2008| season = 4| number = 16|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Fix (House)|The Fix]]", he steals experimental medicine only tested in rats to try and regrow his thigh muscle, eliminating his pain. In the following episode, "[[After Hours (House)|After Hours]]", he finds out that the medicine cause tumors, and operated on himself in his bathtub based on a CT scan. Ultimately he is unable to continue and eventually brought in Cuddy, who sends him to the hospital.

===Social behavior===
House does not have much of a social life, and his only real friend is Dr. James Wilson.&lt;ref name="romantic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="badmood" /&gt; Wilson knew House before the infarction and looked after him when House's relationship with Stacy ended.&lt;ref name="needtoknow"/&gt; Dr. Wilson's moving into House's apartment after his failed marriage in "Sex Kills" symbolizes his taking emotional refuge in his friend.&lt;ref name="Katie"&gt;{{cite news| last =Ryan| first =Maureen| title ='House'-a-palooze, Part 3: Katie Jacobs|newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]]| date =May 1, 2006| url =http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/05/houseapalooze_p.html| accessdate =October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they frequently analyze and criticize each other's motives, Wilson has risked his career to protect House, including having his job terminated in the first season as an effort of Edward Vogler to dismiss House, and having his practice damaged by Detective Michael Tritter in an investigation of House's narcotics consumption.&lt;ref name="Babies" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Whac-a-Mole". House, M.D.. November 21, 2006. No. 8, season 3.&lt;/ref&gt; House has quietly admitted, at several instances, that he is grateful for Wilson's presence, including referring to Wilson as his best friend. When Wilson resigns and moves away from both New Jersey and House's friendship in the season 5 premiere, House is desperate to have his friend back, and hires a private investigator ([[Michael Weston]]) to spy on him.&lt;ref name="notcancer"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Not Cancer| episodelink = Not Cancer| series = House, M.D.|airdate = September 23, 2008| season = 5| number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two ultimately reconcile at House's father's funeral in a scene similar to their first meeting, only this time Wilson breaks a stained glass window with what appears to be a bottle of wine or alcohol in a moment of anger directed at House.&lt;ref name="birthmarks" /&gt; In the series finale, House fakes his death both to get out of going to prison and to spend five remaining months with Wilson before he dies of cancer, after having spent the past third of the season helping him through difficult, risky and ultimately unsuccessful treatments and reckless "bucket list" wishes.

Lisa Edelstein has said that despite his sardonic personality, House is a character who is reliant on people surrounding him.&lt;ref name="fullhouse" /&gt; Edelstein says this characteristic is portrayed on several occasions in the third season, during which House's medical career is in jeopardy due to investigations by Det. [[Michael Tritter]] ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), who arrests him for possessing narcotics.&lt;ref name="FFL"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Fools for Love|episodelink=Fools for Love|series=House, M.D.|serieslink=House (TV series)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|airdate=October 31, 2006|season=3|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; House's legal trouble ends when Edelstein's character, Lisa Cuddy, commits [[perjury]] during his hearing.&lt;ref name="WAD"/&gt; In Season 5, a relationship with Cuddy begins to blossom, as they are unable to deny feelings between each other.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Joy| episodelink = Joy (House)| series = House, M.D.|airdate = October 28, 2008| season = 5| number = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They share a kiss in episode six "Joy" which sparked an ongoing romantic tension between them.&lt;ref name="Joy" /&gt; When Cuddy's office is destroyed by a gunman and is being renovated, she moves into House's office in what Wilson believes to be an attempt to get closer to House. The two try to drive each other away, doing things to each other's office to make them worse, but in an uncharacteristically nice move, House has Cuddy's mother send her medical school desk for her new office as a surprise. Cuddy is touched by what he did, but is devastated when she spots him with a prostitute he hired, not knowing he had done so only to mess with Kutner and Taub. In the season finale "[[Both Sides Now (House)|Both Sides Now]]" it is confirmed that House wishes to pursue a romantic relationship with Cuddy. In this same episode he believes he has slept with Cuddy and informs Dr. James Wilson the following morning. This however is revealed to be a psychosis, which is a side effect of his Vicodin abuse. The House-Cuddy story culminates in the [[House (season 6)|season 6]] finale, "[[Help Me (House)|Help Me]]", when Cuddy cancels her engagement to [[Lucas Douglas|Lucas]] to face the inevitable realization of her loving House all along;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Help Me|episodelink=Help Me (House)|series=House, M.D.|credits=Yaitanes, Greg|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|airdate=2010-05-17|season=6|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; they share a passionate kiss, thus hinting on mutual willingness to try to develop a real relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/05/18/house-huddy-spoilers-season-finale/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520165516/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/05/18/house-huddy-spoilers-season-finale/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 20, 2010 |title='House' exclusive: Huddy fans – your time has come! |author=Michael Ausiello |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=August 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in season 7, this relationship is ended when House starts taking Vicodin again when he is faced with Cuddy possibly having a terminal illness. The season 6 finale “[[Help Me (House)|Help Me]]” shows that despite his personality, he cares a lot about his patients, especially those who he has formed an emotional bond. He cares to the point of relapsing his addiction to Vicodin.

House has also been known to act as a mooch at times, frequently stealing food from Wilson. In "[[You Don't Want to Know]]", while House is searching for the cause of Thirteen's twitching, he claims to have stolen money from her wallet.&lt;ref name="YDWTK"/&gt; In the same episode, Wilson later observes that House's blood type is AB, the universal recipient, reflecting his desire to take whatever he can. In another episode, he reveals to Wilson that he's been borrowing larger and larger sums of money from him without paying him back, just to see at what point Wilson would turn him down.

While the show was originally set to be a medical [[Procedural drama|procedural]], the idea changed when the writers started to explore the possibilities of a curmudgeonly title character.&lt;ref name="Variety110eps" /&gt; Shore traced the concept for the title character to his background as a patient at a teaching hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1043940,00.html|title=Dr. Feelbad|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 8, 2005|author=Jensen, Jeff|accessdate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shore recalled that "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness...] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room".&lt;ref name="hulu-developing the concept" /&gt; Shore also based the character partly on himself: in a 2006 interview with ''[[Macleans]]'' he explained that he has a "cynical and cold attitude lurking within" him, and almost always agrees with House's point of view.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt; A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way.&lt;ref name="int-disability" /&gt; The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, inspired by the 1960s [[police drama]] ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful).&lt;ref name="Variety110eps" /&gt;&lt;ref name="int-disability" /&gt; The wheelchair became a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating the use of a cane.&lt;ref name="int-disability"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Shore, David |author2=Jacobs, Katie |year=2006|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/21680/house-house---houses-disability#s-p2-st-i1|title=House's Disability|work=[[Hulu.com]]|publisher=[[The Paley Center for Media]]|accessdate=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; House usually holds his cane on the same side as his injured leg; Shore explained: "Some people feel more comfortable with the cane in the dominant arm, and that is acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Challen| first = Paul| title = The House that Hugh Laurie Built| publisher = [[ECW Press]]| date = October 2008| page = 106| isbn = 1-55022-803-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cane tricks that are seen throughout the series are created by Laurie himself.&lt;ref name="messed up"&gt;{{cite news| last =Ryan| first =Maureen| title ='House'-a-palooza: On Omar Epps' Emmy bid, Wilson's messed-up life and stupid cane tricks|newspaper=Chicago Tribune| date =May 1, 2006|url =http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/05/house_isnt_wait.html| accessdate =October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When casting for the part started, Shore was afraid that in "the wrong hands", House would "just be hateful".&lt;ref name="macleans" /&gt; The casting directors were looking for someone who could, as Shore described, "do these horrible things and be somehow likable without just, you know, petting a kitten".&lt;ref name="offbeatHouse"/&gt; When Laurie was asked to audition for the role of House, he was filming ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]'' in [[Namibia]].&lt;ref name="Casting"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Hugh Laurie|Laurie, Hugh]]|title=[[List of House episodes|House, Season 1]], Casting Session with Hugh Laurie|medium=DVD|publisher=Universal|date=2004|accessdate=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie had no big expectations for the show, thinking that it would only "run for a few weeks".&lt;ref name="p38"&gt;Challen, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man about the House |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22657520-5009160,00.html |author=Clune, Richard |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |date=October 28, 2007 |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401170200/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0%2C22049%2C22657520-5009160%2C00.html |archivedate=April 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He planned to audition for the roles of both James Wilson and Gregory House.&lt;ref name="offbeatHouse" /&gt; However, when he read that Wilson was a character with a "handsome open face", he decided to audition solely for the role of House.&lt;ref name="offbeatHouse"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Byrne |first=Bridget |publication-date=November 23, 2004 |title=British actor set for U.S. fame with offbeat M.D. role |periodical=[[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Press Enterprise]] |publication-place=[[Riverside, California]] |publisher=Press-Enterprise Company |url=http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Fea_Ent_housestar.a1444.html |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207000325/http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Fea_Ent_housestar.a1444.html |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie chose not to change his clothing, but to remain in the costume he wore for the film; he also decided not to shave his beard.&lt;ref name="p38" /&gt; He put together an audition tape of his own in a Namibian hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light,&lt;ref name="lauriegetshouse"/&gt; while his ''Flight of the Phoenix'' co-stars [[Jacob Vargas]] and Scott Michael Campbell held the camera.&lt;ref name="p38" /&gt; He improvised by using an [[umbrella]] for a cane.&lt;ref name="BTVLaurie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/house/how-hugh-laurie-got-into-house-20722.aspx|title=How Hugh Laurie Got into 'House'|publisher=[[BuddyTV]]|date=June 24, 2008|author=DeLeon, Kris|accessdate=December 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie initially believed that James Wilson would be the protagonist of the show after reading the brief description of the character and did not find out that House was the main character until he read the full script of the pilot episode.&lt;ref name="Inside"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hugh Laurie Interview|series=[[Inside the Actor's Studio]]|network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|BRAVO Network]]|airdate=2006-07-31|season=12|number=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.starmagazine.com/news/13242|title=House's Hugh Laurie Battling "Mild Depression"|newspaper=[[Us Weekly]]|date=October 30, 2007|author=Cina, Mark|accessdate=December 19, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080214103243/http://www.usmagazine.com/houses_hugh_laurie_battling_minor_depression |archivedate = February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he had watched casting tapes for the [[Pilot (House)|pilot episode]], [[Bryan Singer]] grew frustrated and refused to consider any more British actors because of their flawed American accents.&lt;ref name="badmood" /&gt; Although Singer compared Laurie's audition tape to an "[[Osama Bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]] video",&lt;ref name="torontosun-laurie"&gt;{{cite news|author=Brioux, Bill|date=November 14, 2004|title=Compelling 'House' Doctor|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|page=TV2}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was impressed with Laurie's acting and, not knowing who he was, Singer was fooled by his American accent.&lt;ref name="lauriegetshouse"&gt;{{cite news|author=Keveney, Bill|date=November 16, 2004|title=Hugh Laurie gets into 'House'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-11-15-hugh-laurie_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented on how well the "American actor" was able to grasp the character, not knowing about Laurie's British nationality.&lt;ref name="hulu-developing the concept" /&gt; Although Laurie's appearance was very different from the way Shore pictured House, when he watched the audition tape, he was equally impressed as Singer.&lt;ref name="macleans"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frum |first=Linda |title=Q&amp;A with 'House' creator David Shore |work=[[Macleans]] |publisher=Rogers Publishing |date=March 14, 2006 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20060320_123370_123370 |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052544/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20060320_123370_123370 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More famous (in the American market) actors such as [[Denis Leary]], [[Rob Morrow]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]] were also considered, but Singer, Shore, and executive producers [[Paul Attanasio]] and [[Katie Jacobs]] all thought Laurie was the best option and decided to cast him for the part.&lt;ref name="p39"&gt;Challen, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie was the final actor to join the cast of ''House''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=June 12, 2006|author=Richmond, Ray|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|pages=S18–S24|title=Casting About}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was chosen for the part, Laurie, whose father [[Ran Laurie]] was a doctor himself, said he felt guilty for "being paid more to become a fake version of my own father".&lt;ref name="lauriegetshouse" /&gt; While Laurie has used an American accent before in the ''[[Stuart Little (film series)|Stuart Little]]'' films, he found it difficult to adopt for his role, saying that words such as "coronary artery" are particularly tricky to pronounce.&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt;

===Parallels to Sherlock Holmes===
[[File:Paget holmes.png|thumb|right|House and Wilson's relationship mirrors Holmes and Watson's (pictured) relationship.]]
Similarities between House and the famous fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] appear throughout the series;&lt;ref name="EmmysHousecall"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emmys.tv/events/2006/house-wrap.php |title=Hugh Laurie and Cast Make a House Call |last=Slate |first=Libby |work=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] |date=April 17, 2006 |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209065302/http://www.emmys.tv/events/2006/house-wrap.php |archivedate=February 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shore explained that he was always a Sherlock Holmes fan, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique.&lt;ref name="hulu-developing the concept"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shore, David |year=2006 |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/21606/house-house---developing-the-concept#s-p2-st-i1 |title=Developing The Concept |work=[[Hulu.com]] |publisher=[[The Paley Center for Media]] |accessdate=September 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913031621/http://www.hulu.com/watch/21606/house-house---developing-the-concept |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resemblance is evident in various elements of the series' plot, such as House's reliance on [[psychology]] to solve a case, his reluctance to accept cases he does not find interesting and House's home address, [[221B Baker Street]], which is the same as Holmes'.&lt;ref name="fullhouse" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Remorse (House)|Remorse]]". [[House (TV series)|House, M.D]]. January 25, 2010. No. 12, season 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other similarities between the two characters are drug use (House battled a [[Vicodin]] addiction for years and Holmes was a recreational user of [[cocaine]]), successful detoxification (which proves to be only temporary in House's case), &lt;!-- the use of a cane, --&gt; playing an instrument (Holmes plays the [[violin]] and House plays the guitar, piano, organ and [[harmonica]]) and a talent for accurately deducing people's motives and histories from aspects of their personality and appearance.&lt;ref name="HousewithoutHolmes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/10/31/you-cant-have-house-without-a-holmes/|title=You can't have House without a Holmes|last=Ward | first=Julia|work=[[TV Squad]]|date=October 31, 2006|accessdate=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shore has also explained that the name "House" is a play on the name "Holmes" via its phonetic similarity to the word "homes". The pun does not extend to the meaning of the names, as the [[Holmes (surname)|surname "Holmes"]] actually denotes that its initial bearers lived near or worked with holly or holm-oak trees, such that "Holl[e]y" or "Oak[e]s" would be a more literal equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Wendell|last= Wittler|title= Living in a 'House' built for one|url= http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7518037|date=April 18, 2005|work=[[msnbc.com]]|accessdate=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Holmes and House each have one true friend, [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]] and Dr. James Wilson, respectively.&lt;ref name="House-Holmes"&gt;{{cite news|title=House and Holmes parallels |date=January 2006 |work=[[Radio Times]] |publisher=[[BBC Magazines]] |page=57 |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msfesWep?url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/ |archivedate=January 18, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard has said that House and his character were originally intended to play the roles of Holmes and Watson in the series although he believes that House's team has assumed the Watson role.&lt;ref name="RSL"&gt;{{cite news| last =Ryan| first =Maureen| title ='House'-a-palooza, part 2: Robert Sean Leonard|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]| date =May 1, 2006| url =http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/05/houseapalooza_p.html| accessdate =October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shore has also said that Dr. House draws inspiration from Dr. Marc Chamberlain, a professor of neurology at the University of Washington, Seattle, and Dr. [[Joseph Bell]] (who was a teacher of Arthur Conan Doyle's and thus a chief source of inspiration for the creation of Holmes), who could "walk into a waiting room and diagnose people without speaking to them".&lt;ref name="House-Holmes" /&gt; In the season two finale "No Reason", House is shot by a man named Jack Moriarty, a name that coincides with Sherlock Holmes' adversary, [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]];&lt;ref name="HousewithoutHolmes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristine |first=Diane |date=May 24, 2006 |title=TV Review: House Season Finale – "No Reason" |work=Blog Critics |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/24/011244.php |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911051928/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/24/011244.php |archivedate=September 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, in the fifth season, Wilson uses [[Irene Adler]] as the name for an imaginary love interest of House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Joy to the World|episodelink=Joy to the World (House)|series=House|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|airdate=2008-11-09|season=5|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same name as the only female adversary Holmes ever encountered.&lt;ref name="HousewithoutHolmes" /&gt;

==Reception==
Throughout the series' run, the character received positive reviews.&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph-postrev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-review"/&gt; [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called House "the most electrifying character to hit television in years".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost-review"/&gt;

The '''Handspring Puppet Company''' is a [[puppetry]] performance and design company established in 1981 by Adrian Kohler and Basil Jones, situated in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. Thys Stander is the company's chief puppet maker.&lt;ref name="ww"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Hone-onna'''|[[wiktionary:骨女|骨女]]||literally: ''bone woman''}} is a being from [[Japan]]ese [[legend]]s. In some versions, it is thought to be a female [[yōkai]] who kills men by extracting their lifeforce or by grabbing their hands and holding them until the victim becomes a skeleton himself.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dylan Foster: ''Morphologies of Mystery: Yôkai and Discourses of the Supernatural in Japan, 1666–1999''. Stanford University, Stanford, 2003, S. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Can't find this source, but none of the JA materials I've seen that mention this describe the hone-onna as making others into skeletons.--&gt;  In others, the ''hone onna'' manifests as a skeletal woman.

==Description==
The ''hone-onna'' appears for the first time in a yōkai [[encyclopedia]] called ''Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki'', written in 1779 by [[Toriyama Sekien]]. The story in which the bone woman is mentioned is named ''Botan Dōrō'' (牡丹燈籠; "The Peony Lantern"). It tells about a beautiful, but very skinny lady carrying a red lantern in shape of a [[peony]] flower and visiting men in attempt to sleep with them. ''Botan Dōrō'' itself is derived from a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[China|Chinese]] tale collection named ''Otogibōko'' (御伽ばうこ), written by [[Asai Ryōi]] in 1666. The collection was composed as some kind of [[moral]]-free version of the Chinese work ''Jiandeng Xinhua'' written in 1378 by [[Qu You]].&lt;ref&gt;Murakami Kenji: 妖怪事典. Mainichi Shimbun-sha, Tokyo, 2000, {{ISBN|4-620-31428-5}}, page 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legends ==
''Botan Dōrō'' tells about a young man named ''Ogiwara Shinnojō'', who is wandering around at night and who meets a young woman named O-Tsuyu. She carries a red peony lantern and Shinnojō immediately falls in love with her. Every evening now they meet each other for love and to sleep together. The overly curious neighbour sneaks secretly to the bedroom of the couple to observe them. When the light of the bedroom falls onto the couple the neighbour nearly dies in shock, when he recognizes that the sleeping Shinnojō shares his bed with a moving skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;Takada Mamoru: 鳥山石燕 画図百鬼夜行. Kadokawa Shoten, Tokyo, 2005, {{ISBN|978-4-336-03386-4}}, page 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

An orally traditioned legend from [[Akita prefecture]] tells the story of a young man who became lost during a heavy snow storm. Suddenly he saw a young woman, carrying a red peony lantern. The woman waved at him and guided the man to her house. When the man wanted to thank her for help, the light of the house and the lantern fell onto her face and the shocked man recognized her face as a blank skeleton skull.&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi Bintarō: とうほく妖怪図鑑.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}

An '''index''' (plural: usually '''indexes''', more rarely '''indices'''; see below) is a list of words or phrases ('headings') and associated pointers ('locators') to where useful material relating to that heading can be found in a document or collection of documents. Examples are an index in the [[back matter]] of a [[book]] and an index that serves as a [[library catalog]]. 

In a traditional back-of-the-book index, the headings will include names of people, places, events, and concepts selected by the '''indexer''' as being relevant and of interest to a possible reader of the book. The indexer may be the author, the editor, or a professional indexer working as a third party. The pointers are typically page numbers, paragraph numbers or section numbers. 

In a [[library catalog]] the words are authors, titles, subject headings, etc., and the pointers are call numbers. Internet [[Web search engine|search engines]] (such as [[Google]]) and full-text searching help provide access to information but are not as selective as an index, as they provide non-relevant links, and may miss relevant information if it is not phrased in exactly the way they expect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexers.org.uk/index.php?id=463 |title=''Human or computer produced indexes?'' |publisher=Indexers.org.uk |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most advanced investigation of problems related to book indexes is made in the development of [[topic maps]], which started as a way of representing the knowledge structures inherent in traditional back-of-the-book indexes. The [[concept]] embodied by book indexes lent its name to [[database index]]es, which similarly provide an abridged way to look up information in a larger collection, albeit one for computer use rather than human use.

== Earliest examples in English ==
In the English language, indexes have been referred to as early as 1593, as can be seen from lines in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' of that year:

''Therefore, even as an index to a book''&lt;br /&gt;
''So to his mind was young Leander's look.''

A similar reference to indexes is in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s lines from ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' (I.3.344), written nine years later:

''And in such indices, althougo small pricks'' &lt;br /&gt;
''To their subsequent volumes, there is seen'' &lt;br /&gt;
''The baby figure of the giant mass'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Of things to come at large.''

But according to G. Norman Knight, "at that period, as often as not, by an 'index to a book' was meant what we should now call a table of contents."&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;Knight, G. Norman (1979) ''Indexing, the Art of: A Guide to the Indexing of Books and Periodicals'' (HarperCollins), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first indexes – in the modern sense – to a book in the English language was one in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', in Sir [[Thomas North]]'s 1595 translation.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt; A section entitled "An Alphabetical Table of the most material contents of the whole book" may be found in [[Henry Scobell]]'s ''Acts and Ordinances of Parliament'' of 1658. This section comes after "An index of the general titles comprised in the ensuing Table".&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt; Both of these indexes predate the index to [[Alexander Cruden]]'s ''Concordance'' (1737), which is erroneously held to be the earliest index found in an English book.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;

== Etymology and plural ==
The word is derived from [[Latin]], in which ''index'' means "one who points out", an "indication", or a "[[Index finger|forefinger]]".

In Latin, the plural form of the word is ''indices''. In English, the plural "indices" is commonly used in [[Indexed family|mathematical]] and [[Database index|computing contexts]], and sometimes in bibliographical contexts – for example, in the 17-volume ''[[Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia]]'' (1999–2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Commire |editor-first=Anne |editor-link=Anne Commire |title=[[Women in World History: a biographical encyclopedia]] |date=1999–2002 |publisher=Yorkin Publications |place=Detroit |ISBN=0-7876-3736-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this form is now seen as an archaism by many writers and commentators, who prefer the anglicised plural "indexes". "Indexes" is widely used in the publishing industry; in the International Standard [[ISO 999]], ''Information and documentation – Guidelines for the content, organization and presentation of indexes''; and is preferred by the ''[[Hart's Rules|Oxford Style Manual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=R. M. |editor-last=Ritter |title=[[Hart's Rules|The Oxford Style Manual]] |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=772 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' allows both forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Chicago Manual of Style]] |chapter=7.6: Alternative plural forms |edition=16th |place=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2010 |ISBN=978-0-226-10420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

G. Norman Knight quotes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s lines from ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' (I.3.344) – "And in such indexes ..." – and comments:

"But the real importance of this passage is that it establishes for all time the correct literary plural; we can leave the Latin form "indices" to the mathematicians (and similarly "appendices" to the anatomists)."&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt;

== Indexing process ==

[[File:Atlas maior 1655 - vol 10 - Novus Atlas Sinensis - index - P1080375.JPG|thumb|The first page of the index of ''Novus Atlas Sinensis'' by [[Martino Martini]] (published as a section of Volume 10 of [[Joan Blaeu]]'s [[Atlas Maior]] in 1655)]]

=== Conventional indexing ===

The indexer reads through the text, identifying indexable concepts (those for which the text provides useful information and which will be of relevance for the text's readership). The indexer creates index headings to represent those concepts, which are phrased such that they can be found when in alphabetical order (so, for example, one would write 'indexing process' rather than 'how to create an index'). These headings and their associated locators (indicators to position in the text) are entered into specialist indexing software which handles the formatting of the index and facilitates the editing phase. The index is then edited to impose consistency throughout the index.

Indexers must analyze the text to enable presentation of concepts and ideas in the index that may not be named within the text. The index is intended to help the reader, researcher, or information professional, rather than the author, find information, so the professional indexer must act as a liaison between the text and its ultimate user.

In the United States, according to tradition, the index for a non-fiction book is the responsibility of the author, but most authors don't actually do it. Most indexing is done by freelancers hired by authors, publishers or an independent business which manages the production of a book,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asindexing.org/about-indexing/what-is-indexing/#FAQ1004&lt;/ref&gt; publishers or [[Book-packaging|book packagers]]. Some publishers and database companies employ indexers.

Before indexing software existed, indexes were created using slips of paper or, later, [[index card]]s. After hundreds of such slips or cards were filled out (as the indexer worked through the pages of the book proofs), they could then be shuffled by hand into alphabetical order, at which point they served as [[manuscript]] to be typeset into the printed index.

== Indexing software ==
Commercial software is available to aid the indexer in building a book index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asindexing.org/reference-shelf/software/ |title=Software |publisher=The American Society for Indexing |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several dedicated, [[Indexing Software|indexing software programs]] available to assist with the special sorting and copying needs involved in index preparation. The most widely known include [[Cindex]], [[Macrex]], [[PDF Index Generator]] and [[SkyIndex]].  [[TExtract]] is a hybrid semi-automatic program combining conventional manual indexing with automated indexing features and text linking.

=== Embedded indexing ===

Embedded indexing involves including the index headings in the midst of the text itself, but surrounded by codes so that they are not normally displayed. A usable index is then generated automatically from the embedded text using the position of the embedded headings to determine the locators. Thus, when the pagination is changed the index can be regenerated with the new locators.

[[LaTeX]] documents support embedded indexes primarily through the [[MakeIndex]] package. Several widely used [[XML]] [[Document Type Definition|DTDs]], including [[DocBook]] and [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]], have elements that allow index creation directly in the XML files. Most [[Word processor|word processing software]], such as [[StarOffice Writer|StarWriter]]/[[OpenOffice.org Writer]], [[Microsoft Word]], and [[WordPerfect]], as well as some desktop publishing software (for example, [[FrameMaker]] and [[InDesign]]), as well as other tools ([[MadCap Software|MadCap Software's]] [[Flare (software)|Flare]])) have some facility for embedded indexing as well. [[TExtract]] and [[IndeXExploit]] support embedded indexing of Microsoft Word documents.

An embedded index requires more time to create than a conventional static index; however, an embedded index can save time in the long run when the material is updated or repaginated. This is because, with a static index, if even a few pages change, the entire index must be revised or recreated while, with an embedded index, only the pages that changed need updating or indexing.

== Purpose ==

Indexes are designed to help the reader find information quickly and easily. A complete and truly useful index is not simply a list of the words and phrases used in a publication (which is properly called a [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]]), but an organized map of its contents, including [[cross-reference]]s, grouping of like concepts, and other useful intellectual analysis.

Sample back-of-the-book index excerpt:

:sage, 41-42. ''See also'' Herbs ← directing the reader to related terms
:Scarlet Sages. ''See'' ''Salvia coccinea'' ← redirecting the reader to term used in the text
:shade plants ← grouping term (may not appear in the text; may be generated by indexer)
::hosta, 93 ← subentries
::myrtle, 46
::Solomon's seal, 14
:sunflower, 47 ← regular entry

In books, indexes are usually placed near the end (this is commonly known as "BoB" or back-of-book indexing). They complement the [[table of contents]] by enabling access to information by specific subject, whereas contents listings enable access through broad divisions of the text arranged in the order they occur. It has been remarked that, while "[a]t first glance the driest part of the book, on closer inspection the index may provide both interest and amusement from time to time."&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

Some principles of good indexing include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/robohelp/articles/online_help_pt2_06.html|title=Creating Online Help (Part 2): Strategies and Implementation|publisher=Adobe.com|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419113301/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/robohelp/articles/online_help_pt2_06.html|archivedate=2009-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ensuring each topic/section includes a variety of relevant index entries; use two or three entries per topic
* Understanding the audience and understand what kind of index entries they're likely to look for
* Use the same form throughout (singular vs. plural, capitalisation, etc.), using standard indexing conventions

Indexing pitfalls:
* Significant topics with no index entries at all
* Indexing 'mere mentions' --- "But John Major was no Winston Churchill..." indexed under 'Churchill, Winston'
* Circular cross-references: 'Felidae. ''See'' Cats' --- 'Cats. ''See'' Felidae'
* References to discussions of a single topic scattered among several main headings: 'Cats, 50-62' --- 'Felidae, 175-183'
* Inconsistently indexing similar topics
* Confusing similar names: Henry V of England, Henri V of France
* Incorrect alphabetization: 'α-Linolenic acid' under 'A' instead of 'L'
* Inappropriate inversions: 'processors, word' for 'word processors'
* Inappropriate subheadings: 'processors: food, 213-6; word, 33-7'
* Computer indexing from section headings: e.g. 'Getting to know your printer' under 'G'

== Indexer roles ==
Some indexers specialize in specific formats, such as scholarly books, microforms, [[web indexing]] (the application of a back-of-book-style index to a [[website]] or [[intranet]]), [[search engine indexing]], [[Index (database)|database indexing]] (the application of a pre-defined [[controlled vocabulary]] such as [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] to articles for inclusion in a database), and [[periodical indexing]]&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Carolyn. "[http://www.asindexing.org/site/Weaver.pdf The Gist of Journal Indexing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029145224/http://www.asindexing.org/site/Weaver.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}", ''Key Words'' 10.1 (Jan./Feb. 2002), 16–22.&lt;/ref&gt; (indexing of newspapers, journals, magazines).

Some indexers with expertise in controlled vocabularies also work as [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomists]] and [[ontology|ontologists]].

Some indexers specialize in particular subject areas, such as anthropology, business, computers, economics, education, government documents, history, law, mathematics, medicine, psychology, and technology. An indexer can be found for any subject.

== References in popular culture ==

In  "[[The Library of Babel]]", a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], there is an index of indexes that catalogues all of the books in the library, which contains all possible books.

[[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' includes a character who is a professional indexer and believes that "indexing [is] a thing that only the most amateurish author [undertakes] to do for his own book." She claims to be able to read an author's character through the index he created for his own history text, and warns the narrator, an author, "Never index your own book."

[[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'' includes a parody of an index, reflecting the insanity of the narrator.

[[Mark Danielewski]]'s novel ''[[House of Leaves]]'' contains an exhaustive 41 page index of words in the novel, including even large listings for inconsequential words such as ''the'', ''and'', and ''in''.

== Standards ==
* [[ISO 999]]:1996 Guidelines for the Content, Organization, and Presentation of Indexes (this is also the national standard in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand)

== Societies ==
The [[American Society for Indexing]], Inc. (ASI) is a national association founded in 1968 to promote excellence in indexing and increase awareness of the value of well-designed indexes. ASI serves indexers, librarians, abstractors, editors, publishers, database producers, data searchers, product developers, technical writers, academic professionals, researchers and readers, and others concerned with indexing. It is the only professional organization in the United States devoted solely to the advancement of indexing, abstracting and related methods of information retrieval.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7366">The '''inverted spectrum''' is the [[wikt:hypothetical|hypothetical]] concept of two people sharing their [[color]] vocabulary and discriminations, although the colors one sees &amp;mdash; one's [[qualia]] &amp;mdash; are systematically different from the colors the other person sees. 

[[Image:Inverted qualia of colour strawberry.jpg|thumb|250px|Inverted qualia]]

The concept dates back to [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;(In this passage, Locke uses "idea" to mean something like "mental image", rather than its modern meaning. He also uses "texture" to mean the physical property that gives rise to a color-sensation) "Neither would it carry any Imputation of ''Falshood'' to our simple ''Ideas'', if by the different Structure of our Organs, it were so ordered, That ''the same Object should produce in several Men's Minds different'' Ideas at the same time; v.g. if the ''Idea,'' that a ''Violet'' produced in one Man's Mind by his Eyes, were the same that a ''Marigold'' produces in another Man's, and vice versâ. For since this could never be known: because one Man's Mind could not pass into another Man's Body, to perceive, what Appearances were produced by those Organs; neither the ''Ideas'' hereby, nor the Names, would be at all confounded, or any ''Falshood'' be in either. For all Things, that had the Texture of a ''Violet'', producing constantly the ''Idea'', which he called ''Blue'', and those that had the Texture of a ''Marigold'', producing constantly the ''Idea'', which he as constantly called ''Yellow'', whatever those Appearances were in his Mind; he would be able as regularly to distinguish Things for his Use by those Appearances, and understand, and signify those distinctions, marked by the Names ''Blue'' and ''Yellow'', as if the Appearances, or ''Ideas'' in his Mind, received from those two Flowers, were exactly the same, with the Ideas in other Men's Minds." Locke, J., 1689/1975, Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It invites us to imagine that we wake up one morning, and find that for some unknown reason all the colors in the world have been inverted. Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon. Supporters of the hypothesis of qualia as [[Non-physical entity|non-physical entities]] argue that, since we can imagine this happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us, but that has no physical basis. In more detail:

#Metaphysical [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] holds of necessity
#[[Modal logic|If something is possibly false, it is not necessary]]
#It is conceivable that qualia could have a different relationship to physical brain-states
#If it is conceivable, then it is [[Logical possibility|possible]]
#Since it is possible for qualia to have a different relationship with physical brain-states, they cannot be identical to brain states (by 1).
#Therefore, qualia are non physical.

The argument thus states that if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an "armchair argument" can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve many assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. Perhaps it is not possible for a given brain state to produce anything other than a given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.

The idea that an inverted spectrum would be undetectable is also open to criticism on more scientific grounds:&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-inverted/ ''Inverted Qualia'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C. L., 1987, “Qualia and Materialism: Closing the Explanatory Gap”, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 48: 281-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|...there are more perceptually distinguishable shades between red and blue than there are between green and yellow, which would make red-green inversion behaviorally detectable. And there are yet further asymmetries. Dark yellow is brown (qualitatively different from yellow), whereas dark blue is blue[..] Similarly, desaturated bluish-red is pink (qualitatively different from saturated bluish-red), whereas desaturated greenish-yellow is similar to saturated greenish-yellow. Again, red is a “warm” color, whereas blue is “cool” — and perhaps this is not a matter of learned associations with temperature.}}

Inverted spectrum arguments have applications to [[behavioralism]], [[physicalism]], [[representationalism]], [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[skepticism]] and the [[hard problem of consciousness]].

Vincent Conitzer has illustrated the possibility of an inverted spectrum using the following scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone is observing a [[simulated reality]] through a [[virtual reality|VR]] headset, and is not aware that she is wearing a headset or that what she is observing is a simulation.  Conitzer argues that the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation can be separated from the code that determines ''in which colors'' the simulation is displayed by the headset (as well as determining ''which perspective'' in the simulation to display).  So, it would be possible to change that additional code, inverting the displayed colors, without changing anything about the simulated physics.  Hence, which (real-world) colors are displayed is a [[further facts|further fact]] over and above the facts of the simulated physics.

In his book ''[[I Am A Strange Loop]]'', [[Douglas Hofstadter]] argues that the inverted spectrum argument entails a form of [[solipsism]] in which people can have no idea about what goes on in the minds of others—contrary to the central theme of his work. He presents several variants to demonstrate the absurdity of this idea: the "inverted [[political spectrum]]", in which one person's concept of [[liberty]] is identical to another's concept of [[imprisonment]]; an [[Voice inversion|inverted "sonic spectrum"]] in which low [[musical notes]] sound like "high" ones and vice versa (which he says is impossible because low sounds can be felt physically as vibrations); and a version in which random, complex [[qualia]] such as riding a roller coaster or opening presents are reversed, so that everyone perceives the world in radically different, unknowable ways.

'''Jane Rosen''' (born 1950) is an American artist, working in sculpture, drawing and printmaking. While Rosen's career was established in her native New York in the 1970s and 80s, with well received exhibitions and a teaching position at the [[School of Visual Arts]], "a trip to Northern California provided an unexpected pivot for her aesthetic vision and her life."&lt;ref name="michaelklein"&gt;[http://michaelkleinarts.com/thelittle.gallery/?page_id=19 Jane Rosen Profile, The Little Gallery, Sharon Springs, New York]&lt;/ref&gt; She lived on both coasts and subsequently began a teaching position at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Rosen "made the break from her urban existence as an artist in New York to a life as an artist on her ranch in California."&lt;ref name="michaelklein"/&gt;

Rosen exhibits in New York, California and across the country. Rosen's work has been reviewed in the [[New York Times]], [[ArtForum]], [[Art in America]], and [[Art News]].&lt;ref name="tayloepiggottgallery"&gt;[http://www.tayloepiggottgallery.com/artist/Jane_Rosen/biography/ Jane Rosen | Biography, Tayloe Piggott Gallery, Jackson, Wyoming]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Since the mid-1970s, Rosen's work has been shown in numerous group and solo exhibitions across the country at venues such as the [[National Museum of Wildlife Art]], [[Randolph College#Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College|Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College]], Edward Thorp Gallery, Grace Borgenicht Gallery, Mincher-Wilcox Gallery, Sears-Peyton Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Rosen at Sears-Peyton Gallery|url=http://www.searspeyton.com/artist/Jane_Rosen/|website=Sears-Peyton Gallery|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traver Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Rosen at Traver Gallery|url=http://www.travergallery.com/gallery_artist_details/Jane-Rosen.aspx|website=Traver Gallery|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gail Severn Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Rosen at Gail Severn Gallery|url=http://www.gailseverngallery.com/jane-rosen.html|website=Gail Severn Gallery|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MoMA PS1|P.S.1]].  Her work was also selected by the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] for inclusion in their 2010 and 2015 Annual Invitational exhibits in New York.  Notable exhibitions include "[[Judy Pfaff]] and Jane Rosen," Braunstein/Quay Gallery (2005);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Kenneth|title=Reviews:  National, Judy Pfaff and Jane Rosen|journal=ARTnews|date=November 2005|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[James Charles Castle|James Castle]] and Jane Rosen," Tayloe Piggott Gallery (2010);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piggott|first1=Tayloe|title=J Crist Gallery and Tayloe Piggott Gallery introduce James Castle and Jane Rosen|url=http://janerosen.net/gallery/d/8262-1/DallasArtFairTrifold.pdf|website=janerosen.net|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "A Gathering" with Dozier Bell, Catherine Hamilton, Jane Rosen, and [[Kiki Smith]], Georgia State University's Welch School Gallery (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClure |first1=Faith |title=Review: Four artists transform GSU’s Welch School Gallery into an aviary of metaphors in "A Gathering" |url=http://www.artsatl.com/2014/02/review-65/ |website=ArtsATL |publisher=ArtsATL |accessdate=April 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125745/http://www.artsatl.com/2014/02/review-65/ |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Rosen's work has been acquired by a variety of public and private collections, including the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], [[Aspen Art Museum]], [[Brooklyn Museum]], Chevron Corporation, Grace Borgenicht, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Luso American Foundation, Mallin Collection, Mitsubishi Corporation, and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]].  Through the [[Art in Embassies Program]], her work can also be found in the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China, and the U.S. Embassies in Baghdad and Tunis.

==Awards==
Between 1980–1983, Rosen received grants in sculpture from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the Creative Artists Public Service Program (CAPS).  Then, in 1988 she traveled to Portugal through a Luso-American Foundation grant, where she began carving stone.  Her art making and materials further expanded to include glass after being awarded artist residencies in 1999 and 2008 at the [[Pilchuck Glass School]] in Washington.&lt;ref name="Jane Rosen"&gt;[http://janerosen.com/resume/ Jane Rosen, Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Rosen is also the recipient of the 2015 Arts and Letters Award in Art from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vankin|first1=Deborah|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-american-academy-of-arts-and-letters-announces-2015-art-awards20150326-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|title=American Academy of Arts and Letters announces 2015 art awards|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Rosen has taught art at a number of institutions, including the School of Visual Arts in New York (1978–1989); Maryland Institute College of Art (1985); University of California, Davis (1990–1992); Stanford University (1993); Bard College (1995–1996); LaCoste School of the Arts (1998); and the University of California, Berkeley (1994–1995, 1996–2005).&lt;ref name="Jane Rosen Teaching "&gt;[http://www.janerosen.com/resume/#teaching/ Jane Rosen, Teaching]&lt;/ref&gt; She takes her role as an instructor and mentor very seriously.  Many of her students have gone on to become successful artists in their own regard.
At the heart of Rosen's teaching is the idea of connecting the tactile with the visual.  She calls her method "Seeing through Touch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trevenson|first1=Stacy|title=Seeing through touch leads to better skill, better human nature|url=http://www.janerosen.com/workshop/hmbreview.pdf|accessdate=February 21, 2015|publisher=Half Moon Bay Review|date=April 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stems in part from the work of her drawing teacher, [[Robert Beverly Hale]], who wrote "Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters."  Rosen's technique incorporates elements of Renaissance drawing and Asian calligraphy and engages what is sensed by the body with what is seen by the eye.  Rosen believes that when you connect the sensation of touch to your line of sight, it activates a feeling of wonder and discovery as you draw.  Her drawing method encourages direct observation of nature and the translation of sensory responses into lines.

==In popular culture==
Rosen's print "Pescadero Lamb" appears in Renesmee's bedroom in the movie ''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Webb|first1=Joni|title=The Cottage|url=http://cotedetexas.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-cottage.html|website=Cote de Texas|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''João José Vaz''' (9 March 1859, in [[Setúbal]] &amp;ndash; 17 February 1931, in [[Lisbon]]) was a Portuguese painter and decorator who specialized in maritime subjects.

==Biography==
In 1872, he enrolled at the "Academia das Belas-Artes" (now part of the [[University of Lisbon]]), where he studied under [[António da Silva Porto]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.parlamento.pt/VisitaParlamento/Paginas/BiogJoaoVaz.aspx Brief biography] @ the Assemblea da República website.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated six years later. In 1881, he held his first exhibition at the [[Lisbon Geographic Society]]. Later, he exhibited more widely, including displays at the "Sociedade Promotora de Belas-Artes", the Artists' Guild and the "Sociedade Nacional de Belas-Artes". He was also a member of the "Lion's Group",&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; an informal association of artists and writers who met in the Golden Lion Tavern with the goal of promoting [[Naturalism (art)|Naturalism]] in the arts. 
[[File:João Vaz - A praia.jpg|thumb|325px|On the Beach (date unknown)]]
He was especially well known for his maritime paintings and provided illustrations for several magazines, including ''Branco e Negro''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/Periodicos/BrancoeNegro/BrancoeNegro.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004024350/http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/Periodicos/BrancoeNegro/BrancoeNegro.htm |archivedate=2014-10-04 |df= }} Branco e Negro : semanario illustrado  (1896-1898)  (digital copy, Hemeroteca Digital)&lt;/ref&gt; (1896-1898), ''Atlantida''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Rita Correia |date=19 February 2008 |title=Ficha histórica: Atlantida: mensário artístico, literário e social para Portugal e Brasil |url= http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/FichasHistoricas/Atlantida.pdf|format=pdf |publisher=Hemeroteca Municipal de Lisboa}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1915-1920) and ''Contemporânea''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/CONTEMPORANEA/Contemporanea.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006144957/http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/CONTEMPORANEA/Contemporanea.htm |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }} Contemporânea (1915-1926, digital copy, Hemeroteca Digital)&lt;/ref&gt; (1915-1926).

In 1884, he became a Professor at the "Escola Industrial Afonso Domingues" (named after a 14th-century architect), where he was later promoted to Director. In 1912, he served on a government commission to establish new curricula for commercial and industrial education in the primary and secondary schools. Two years later, he inaugurated the new system at the "Escola de Desenho Industrial de Setúbal".

In addition to his canvases, he provided decorations for many public and private buildings, including the meeting room of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], the [[Garcia de Resende]] Theater in [[Évora]], the [[Buçaco Palace|Buçaco Palace Hotel]] and the [[Belém Palace]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He also created designs for commemorative postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Kullberg, Carlos.

A '''lead paragraph''' (sometimes shortened to '''lead'''; also spelled '''lede''') is the opening [[paragraph]] of an article, essay, book chapter, or other written work that summarizes its main ideas.&lt;ref name=mavensword20001128/&gt;

==Types of leads==
[[News style#Lead|Journalistic leads]] emphasize grabbing the attention of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peha &amp; Lester |title=Be a Writer: Your Guide to the Writing Life!: Proven Tips and Powerful Techniques to Help Young Writers Get Started |page=125 |publisher=Leverage Factory |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFMagLZx2vIC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=lede+newspaper&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=swajR-7mHI3azATIk7DzCA&amp;sig=01ouafTz7WfhQLt1up7epCRZ1JU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In journalism, the failure to mention the most important, interesting or attention-grabbing elements of a story in the first paragraph is sometimes called "burying the lead". Most standard news leads include brief answers to the questions of [[5 Ws|who, what, why, when, where, and how]] the key event in the story took place. In newspaper writing, the first paragraph that summarizes or introduces the story is also called the "blurb paragraph", "teaser text" or, in the United Kingdom, the "standfirst".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spark |first1=David |last2=Harris |first2=Geoffrey |title=Practical Newspaper Reporting |date=2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=9781473903340 |pages=89, 90, 94, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leads in essays summarize the outline of the argument and conclusion that follows in the main body of the essay. [[Encyclopedia]] leads tend to define the subject matter as well as emphasize the interesting points of the article. [[feature story|Features]] and general articles in [[magazine]]s tend to be somewhere between journalistic and encyclopedian in style and often lack a distinct lead paragraph entirely. Leads and [[book]] [[foreword]]s vary enormously in length, intent and content.

==Other introductions==
In [[journalism]], there is the concept of an introductory or summary line or brief paragraph, located immediately above or below the headline, and typographically distinct from the body of the article.&lt;ref name=Standfirst&gt;{{cite web|title=Standfirst|url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/standfirst/|work=[[Double-Tongued Dictionary]]|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be referred with a variety of terms, including: the ''standfirst'' (UK),&lt;ref name=Standfirst/&gt; ''rider'',{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ''kicker'' (US),&lt;ref name=Standfirst/&gt; ''bank head(line)'', ''deck'', ''dek'', or ''subhead'' (US).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} (See {{slink|News style|Terms and structure}}.)

==Spelling==
The term is sometimes spelled "lede",&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lede |title=Lede |work=Merriam-Webster Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |location=Chicago, IL, US |date=2012|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a claim it was a historical spelling intended to distinguish it from the [[homograph]] [[lead]], a metal commonly used in typesetting in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=mavensword20001128&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20001128 |title=The Mavens' Word of the Day: lede |author="Carol" (author unidentifiable) |work=RandomHouse.com |at="Maven's Word of the Day" blog (defunct as of 2012) |publisher=Random House/Bertelsmann |location=New York |date=November 28, 2000 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219122848/http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20001128 |archivedate=19 February 2012 }}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the spelling "lede" first appears in journalism manuals in the [[1980]]s, well after lead typesetting's heyday.&lt;ref name=Owens20110918&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howardowens.com/lede-vs-lead/ |title=lede-vs-lead |author="Owens, Howard" |work=HowardOwens.com |publisher=Owens Press |location=New York |date=September 18, 2011 |accessdate=2016-06-28 |deadurl=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metz1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Metz|title=Newswriting: from lead to "30"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IxbAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-617514-8|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyons1965"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Martin Lyons|title=Reporting the news: selections from Nieman reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VuJZAAAAMAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyde2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant Milnor Hyde|title=Newspaper Editing - A Manual for Editors, Copyreaders and Students of Newspaper Desk Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9n381QZO_qYC|date=November 2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4437-2632-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl G.

By a lot of people, the term '''[[Brick Gothic]]''' is used for what more specifically is called  '''Baltic Brick Gothic''' or '''North German Brick Gothic'''. That part of [[Gothic architecture]], widespread in [[Northern Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Poland]] and the [[Baltic states]], is commonly identified with the sphere of influence of the [[Hanseatic League]]. But there is a continuous mega-region of Gothic brick architecture, or '''Brick Gothic''' in a sense based on the facts, from the [[Strait of Dover]] to [[Finland]] and [[Lake Peipus]] and to the Sub[[Carpathian Mountains|carpathian]] region of southeastern [[Poland]] and southwestern [[Ukraine]].

Out of northern Germany and the Baltic region, the term "Brick Gothic" is adequately applied as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/31213 Official Flemish portal on architectural heritage – on churches in Poperinge, "Baksteengotiek van de kuststreek" (Brick Gothic of the coastal region) in Flanders]&lt;br /&gt;[https://cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/25809 Official Dutch portal on architectural heritage – on a village church, "markant stuk baksteengotiek" (striking example of Brick Gothic) in the Netherlands]&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.schnell-und-steiner.de/artikel_6467.ahtml Book on a Bavarian brick church "eines der bedeutendsten Werke der Backsteingotik in Bayern" (one of the most important works of Brick Gothic in Bavaria)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The region around the Baltic Sea, including Northern Germany, has some typical characteristics, but there are also regional and social differences, such as between the churches of medieval big cities and those of the neighbouring villages. On the other hand, a significant number of Gothic brick buildings erected near the Baltic Sea could also have been built in the [[Netherlands]] or in [[Flanders]], and vice versa.

Furthermore, Gothic brick structures have also been erected in other regions, such as northern Italy, southwestern and central France, and in the [[Danube|Danubian]] area of southern Germany. The particular architectural styles of some regions differ very much from the others, these are Italian Gothic (with [[Lombard Gothic]], [[Venice|Venetian]] Gothic and [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] Gothic), French [[Gothique Méridional]]. Quite late began the medieval use of brick in England, with the [[Tudor Style]].

The true extent of northern  Brick Gothic and  other Gothic brick architecture is shown by this almost complete list.
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Lists ==
&lt;!--3309 items on 2018-05-20--&gt;
&lt;!--
* Countries in the main list: 797 examples on 2018-06-06
* List on Germany 990 items on 2018-06-06
* List on the Netherlands 775 items on 2018-06-06
* List on Poland 782 items on 2018-06-06
In all, 3,344  items on 2018-06-06--&gt;
This list will never be complete. But it aims to be almost complete to give an unbiased survey as well on the variance as on the geography of Gothic brick buildings.

The dates given here refer to the present extant Gothic structures. Predecessors or post-Gothic alterations are not normally mentioned, but can be assessed by following up the literature. The most influential structures are indicated by bold print. Romanesque and Renaissance structures are not listed. Gothic Brick structures from outside the Baltic or North German regions, e.g. the [[Danube|Danubian]] ones, are also included, while [[Neogothic]] edifices are not listed.

Most of the Gothic brick architecture in Belgium can be found in [[West Flanders]], some in a narrow strip along the border with the Netherlands. Many Gothic brick churches in the Province of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] have been lost in the 19th century, as they were displaced by Gothic Revival churches.

''See [[List of Gothic brick buildings in Germany]]''

===[[Hungary]]===
– In Hungary, there is much more hidden than visible medieval brick. During the 145 years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation, many churches fell in ruins. At about 1700 they were restored, inclusively of plastering, which need not necessary have existed before. In ruins of the Turkish wars and of World War II, brick can be visible, though these buildings had been plastered in their time of function. –

{{nihongo|'''Living National Treasure'''|人間国宝|Ningen Kokuhō}} is a Japanese popular term for those individuals certified as {{nihongo|'''Preservers of Important Intangible Cultural Properties'''|重要無形文化財保持者|Jūyō Mukei Bunkazai Hojisha}} by the [[MEXT|Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] as based on Japan's {{nihongo|[[Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties]]|文化財保護法|Bunkazai Hogohō}}. The term "Living National Treasure" is not formally mentioned in the law, but is an informal term referencing the cultural properties designated as the [[National Treasure (Japan)|National Treasures]].

== History ==
Before 1947, a system for {{Nihongo|[[Imperial Household Artist]]s|帝室技芸員|Teishitsu Gigei-in}} was in place. 

Under the 1950 Law for Protection of Cultural Properties, intangible cultural properties are defined as dramatic, musical, artistic, and other intangible cultural artifacts of high value in terms of Japanese history or art (Article 2, Section 1, Part 2).  Those intangible cultural properties of especial importance can be designated as "Important Intangible Cultural Properties" by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Article 71, Section 1). 

In other words, intangible cultural properties are certain artistic skills. Those individuals or groups who have attained high levels of mastery in those certain skills can be designated as preservers of them by the Japanese government for the purpose of ensuring their continuation. Living National Treasure is a term for those designated as keepers of important intangible cultural properties.

== Types of Certification ==
There are three types of certification: 
* {{nihongo|'''Individual Certification'''|各個認定|Kakko Nintei}}:  this designation is for individuals who "have attained high mastery" of an art or craft.
* {{nihongo|'''Collective Certification'''|総合認定|Sōgō Nintei}}: this designation is for groups of 2 or more who as a group working in common have attained high mastery of an art or craft.
* {{nihongo|'''Preservation Group Certification'''|保持団体認定|Hoji Dantai Nintei}}: this designation is for large groups who have mastered an art or craft in which individual character is not emphasized.

Of the three types, generally only those to have received "Individual Certification" are referred to as Living National Treasures. Those working in artistic fields such as drama and music receive Individual and Collective Certifications, while those working in the crafts receive Individual or Preservation Group Certifications.

==Support System==
The [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]], with the goal of preserving important intangible cultural assets, provides a special annual grant of 2 million yen to Living National Treasures. In the case of groups, the government helps defray the costs of public exhibitions and activities necessary to continue the group. The [[National Theater of Japan]] provides training programs to help train successors in such arts as [[Noh]], [[Bunraku]], and [[Kabuki]].

Many of the craft artisans are also members of the [[Japan Kōgei Association]].

==Categories==
To date Living National Treasures have been certified for 16 categories of Intangible Cultural Properties:
* Performing Arts: [[Gagaku]], [[Noh]], [[Bunraku]], [[Kabuki]], [[Kumi Odori]], [[Traditional Japanese Music|Music]], [[Japanese traditional dance|Dance]], and [[Theatre of Japan|Drama]]
* [[Japanese craft]]s: [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|Ceramics]], [[Textiles]], [[Japanese lacquerware|Lacquerware]], [[Metalworking]], [[Japanese traditional dolls|Dollmaking]], [[Woodworking]], [[Papermaking]], and Miscellaneous Crafts

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33356">The style of architecture and design under King [[Louis Philippe I]] (1830–1848) was a more eclectic development of [[French neoclassicism]], incorporating elements of [[neo-Gothic]] and other styles.  It was the first French decorative style imposed not by royalty, but by the tastes of the growing French upper class. In painting, neoclassicism and romanticism contended to became the dominant style. In literature and music, France had a golden age, as the home of [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and other major poets and artists.

Much of the style was taken from the personality of the King himself.  Unlike his Bourbon predecessors, he wore business dress, not formal robes, he lived in Paris, and he shunned ceremonies; he carried his own umbrella, and imposed no official styles.

Louis Philippe furniture had the same types and forms as the earlier [[French Restoration]] style, but with less decoration;  comfort was the primary consideration.  The Louis Philippe commode, with a marble top and a marquetry covering, was a popular example of the style.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The style of public buildings under Louis-Philippe was determined by the ''Academie des Beaux-Arts'', or Academy of Fine Arts, whose Perpetual Secretary from 1816 to 1839 was [[Quatremère de Quincy]], a confirmed neoclassicist. The architectural style of public buildings and monuments was intended to associate Paris with the virtues and glories of ancient Greece and Rome, as it had been under Louis XIV, Napoleon and the Restoration.  Under Louis Philippe, the monuments begun by Napoleon, including the Arc de Triomphe were completed.{{Sfn|Renault|2006|page=104}}  New monuments, such as the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde and the column in Place de la Bastille to commemorate the victims of the 1830 Revolution, were purely classical. Following the return to Paris of the [[Retour des cendres|ashes of Napoleon]] from [[Saint Helena]] in 1840, they were placed with great ceremony in a tomb designed by [[Louis Visconti]] beneath the church of [[Les Invalides]].  Another Paris landmark, the [[July Column|column]] on the [[Place de la Bastille]], was inaugurated on 28 July 1840, on the anniversary of the July Revolution, and dedicated to those killed during the uprising.

The reign of Louis-Philippe also saw the beginning of a movement to preserve and restore some of the earliest landmarks of Paris, inspired in large part by Victor Hugo's hugely successful novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (''Notre-Dame de Paris''), published in 1831. The leading figure of the restoration movement was [[Prosper Mérimée]], named by Louis-Philippe as the Inspector-General of [[Monument historique|Historic Monuments]].  The Commission of Public Monument was created in 1837, and in 1842, Mérimée began compiling the first official list of classified historical monuments, now known as the [[Base Mérimée]].

The first structure to be restored was the nave of the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés|church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], the oldest in the city. Work also began in 1843 on the cathedral of Notre Dame, which had been badly damaged during the Revolution, and stripped of the statues on its façade. Much of the work was directed by the architect and historian [[Viollet-le-Duc]], who sometimes, as he admitted, was guided by his own scholarship of the "spirit" of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] architecture, rather strict historical accuracy. The other major restoration projects were [[Sainte-Chapelle]] and the Hôtel de Ville, dating to the 17th century; the old buildings which pressed up against the back of the Hôtel de Ville were cleared away; two new wings were added, the interiors were lavishly redecorated, and the ceilings and walls of the large ceremonial salons were painted with murals by [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Unfortunately, all the interiors were burned in 1871 by the [[Paris Commune]].{{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1959|page=325}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the same period, a small revolution was taking place at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], led by four young architects; [[Joseph-Louis Duc]], [[Félix Duban]], [[Henri Labrouste]] and [[Léon Vaudoyer]], who had first studied Roman and Greek architecture at the Villa Medici in Rome, then in the 1820s began the systematic study of other historic architectural styles; including French architecture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.  They instituted teaching about a variety of architectural styles at the École des Beaux-Arts,  and installed fragments of Renaissance and Medieval buildings in the courtyard of the school so students could draw and copy them. Each of them also designed new non-classical buildings in Paris inspired by a variety of different historic styles;   Labrouste built the [[Sainte-Geneviève Library]] (1844–50);  Duc designed the new [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]] and [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] on the Île-de-la-Cité (1852–68);  Vaudroyer designed the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] (1838–67), and Duban designed the new buildings of the École des Beaux-Arts.  Together, these buildings, drawing upon Renaissance, Gothic, romanesque and other non-classical styles, broke the monopoly of neoclassical architecture in Paris.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=76–77}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Finely-crafted inlaid furniture in the traditional fashion continued to be made in Paris by craftsmen such as Georges-Alphonse Jacob-Desmalter (1799–1870), the grandson of [[Georges Jacob]], the royal cabinet maker for Louis XVI. He designed and made new furniture for the [[Tuileries Palace]] when it became the new residence of Louis Philippe in the 1830s, including a cabinet for the concert room decorated with an incrustation of ebony, red seashell and gilded bronze sculptural decoration (see gallery).

During the reign of Louis Philippe, forms of furniture changed little from the French Restoration period;  comfort became a greater priority. Furniture became darker and heavier.  The forms of chairs became rounded, with curving legs, and the backs of armchairs curved slightly in inward.  In the gondola armchairs and chairs, the curved back and arms curved around and enfolded the person sitting. The Voltaire armchair had a high slightly curving back, padded armrests, and short legs.

The Louis Philippe commode was solid and heavy, and had a marble top and a front covered with a thin layer of light wood, often with an inlay of designs of dark wood, usually rosewood or mahogany, in patterns of oak leaves, palmettes, or other floral or vegetal decoration.  Over the course of the period, the coloring was reversed;  the darker woods were used more commonly to cover the furniture, with lighter woods like [[sycamore]], [[holly]] and lemon wood used for inlays.

Tables were usually round or oval, often mounted on a pedestal, with cut-off or slanting corners.  A variety of small tables became popular:  writing tables, work tables, and the ''coiffeuse'', or dressing table, equipped with an oval mirror.  The legs of these tables were often in the shape of an S or of a [[lyre]].{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=184}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The most prominent sculptor of the Louis Philippe style was the Swiss-born [[James Pradier]], who made one of the most important monumental works of the period, a group of statues of ''The Victories'' that surround the tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte.  He also made other neoclassical works that often approached eroticism and romanticism. Gustave Flaubert wrote of him: "This is a great artist, a true Greek, the most antique of all the moderns; a man who is distracted by nothing, not by politics, nor socialism, and who, like a true workman, sleeves rolled up, is there to do his task morning til night with the will to do well and the love of his art."  He was largely forgotten after the Louis Philippe period.

Another notable sculptor from the older generation was [[David d'Angers]] (1788-1856) who had studied with [[Jacques-Louis David]]. He worked largely in an expressive neoclassical style, illustrated in his statue of ''Philopoemen hurt'' (1837), now in the Louvre.

Other sculptors with more enduring fame were [[François Rude]], who made his celebrated ''La Marseillaise'' sculpture (formally known as ''The departure of the volunteers''), a ten-meter high bas-relief for the [[Arc de Triomphe]] (1833-36), a project begun by Napoleon and completed by Louis Philippe.  Rude also made the romantic ''Napoleon awakening to immortality'' in 1845-47. This illustrated popular movement to restore the reputation of Napoleon and the revolutionary spirit, which had been suppressed under the Restoration, but which reappeared with the return of the ashes of Napoleon to France under Louis Philippe.  The Napoleonic spirit emerged triumphant in the 1848 Revolution, and the election of [[Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]] as the first President of France.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=300}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The two most important painters of the Louis Philippe period, [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] were completely opposite in style, philosophy and temperament;  Delacroix, the champion of romanticism, painted his celebrated ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' in 1830, shortly after the 1830 revolution that brought Louis Philippe to power, personifying the figure of Liberté as a bare-breasted classical goddess in the [[baroque]] style. The painting was acquired by the government of Louis Philippe for the Luxembourg Palace, but was soon returned to the painter because of its controversial political message, and was not shown again in public again until 1855, under [[Louis Napoleon]].  Thereafter it entered the collection of the Louvre.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=403}}

Ingres was the champion of the French neoclassical style, and in addition the master of the portrait. However, his ''Martyrdom of Saint-Symphorien'' in 1834 was very badly received by French critics, who preferred Delacroix, and he departed Paris in disgust to become director of the French Academy in Rome, where he remained until 1841.  In Rome he painted the first of his Odalisque paintings, scenes of slaves in Turkish baths.

From 1833 onwards, Delacroix received major commissions to decorate government buildings in Paris. In 1833 he began work for the Salon du Roi in the Chambre des Députés, [[Palais Bourbon]], which was not completed until 1837, For the next ten years he painted in both the Library at the Palais Bourbon and the Library at the Palais du Luxembourg. In 1843 he decorated the Church of St. Denis du Saint Sacrement with a large ''Pietà''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
None of the other painters of the Louis Philippe era had the ability or status of Ingres or Delacroix, but they did have great ambitions. They included [[Paul Delaroche]] (1797-1856), a classicist in the Ingres tradition, who painted ceiling murals for the redecoration of Louvre in 1831, and for the murals of the hemicycle of the École des Beaux Arts in 1837, which included the sixty-six most famous painters since antiquity.  He was considered the dean of historical paintings, specializing in executions and martyrdoms.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=403}}
Another notable painter of the period was [[Thomas Couture]] (1815-1879), a student of [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], a muralist in the style called "Theatrical Romanticism".  He received a commission for an eight-meter long painting for the Luxembourg Palace, titled "The Romans in their decadence".  The finished painting borrowed from the old masters, the classicists, and the romantics, crowding dozens of figures into a single canvas depicting Roman decadence.{{Sfn|Toman|2007|pages=408-409}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The reign of Louis Philippe was a golden age for French literature; many of France's most famous writers published major works.  The movement of [[romanticism]] became dominant in French literature.

[[Victor Hugo]] published four volumes of poetry, and in 1831 published ''Notre-Dame de Paris'' (''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]''), which was quickly translated into English and other European languages. The novel led to the restoration of the cathedral and other medieval monuments in Paris. In 1841, Louis-Philippe made Hugo a peer of France, a ceremonial position with a seat in the upper house of the French parliament. Hugo spoke out against the death penalty and for freedom of speech. While living in his house on the ''Place Royale'' (now [[Place des Vosges]]), he began working on his next novel, ''[[Les Misérables]]''.

[[François-René de Chateaubriand]] refused to swear allegiance to Louis-Philippe, and instead secluded himself in his apartment at 120 [[Rue du Bac]] and wrote his most famous work, ''[[Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe|Mémoires d'outre-tombe]]'', which was not published until after his death. He died in Paris on 4 July 1848, during the [[French Revolution of 1848]].

in 1832 [[Honoré de Balzac]] conceived the idea of a series of books that would paint a panoramic portrait of "all aspects of society;" eventually called ''[[La Comédie Humaine]]''. He declared to his sister, "I am about to become a genius."  He published ''[[Eugénie Grandet]]'', his first bestseller, in 1833, followed by ''[[Le Père Goriot]]'' in 1835, the two-volume  ''[[Illusions perdues]]'' in 1843, ''[[Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes]]'' in 1847, ''[[Le Cousin Pons]]'' (1847) and ''[[La Cousine Bette]]'' (1848). In each of the novels, Paris is the setting and a major participant.

[[Alexandre Dumas]] published ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' (1844); ''[[Twenty Years After]]'' (1845); ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'' (1847); ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1845–1846); ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1845); ''[[La Dame de Monsoreau]]'' (1846); and many more novels, in addition to many theatrical versions of his novels for the Paris stage.

[[Stendhal]] published his first major novel, ''[[The Red and the Black|Le Rouge et le Noir]]'', in 1830, and his second, ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma|La Chartreuse de Parme]]'', in 1839.

Other major Paris writers who produced important works included [[George Sand]], [[Alfred de Musset]], and [[Alphonse de Lamartine]]. The poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], born in Paris, published his first works, essays of art criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Fierro, Alfred, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Paris was the musical capital of Europe between 1830 and 1848.  It was the home of [[Chopin]], [[Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Berlioz]], and [[Verdi]] at various times during the period.  Romanticism was unchallenged as the dominant movement. Music played an important part in the regime from the very beginning, during the 1830 revolution that overthrew Charles&amp;nbsp;X.  The famed tenor [[Adolphe Nourrit]], who had starred in the operas of Rossini, went onto the stages of Paris and emotionally sang the [[Marseillaise]], which had been forbidden during the First Empire and the Restoration.

The most famous musical exile in Paris was [[Frédéric Chopin]], who arrived in September 1831 at the age of twenty-one, and did not return to [[Congress Poland]] because of the crushing of the [[November Uprising|Polish uprising against Russian rule in October 1831]]. Chopin gave his first concert in Paris at the [[Salle Pleyel]] on 26 February 1832, and remained in the city for most of the next eighteen years. He gave just thirty public performances during these years, preferring to give recitals in private [[Salon (gathering)|salons]]. On 16 February 1838 and on 2 December 1841,&lt;ref&gt;''Selected Correspondence of Fryderyk Chopin'', collected &amp; annotated by Bronislaw Edward Sydow, translated by Arthur Hedley, McGraw-Hill Book Company, inc. New York, 1963, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 62-1770327815, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; he played at the Tuileries for [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis-Philippe]] and the royal family. (He also gave a recital for the royal family in October 1839 in the ''[[Château de Saint-Cloud]]''). He earned his living from commissions given by wealthy patrons, including the wife of [[James Mayer de Rothschild]], from publishing his compositions and giving private lessons.

[[Franz Liszt]] also lived in Paris during this period, composing music for the piano and giving concerts and music lessons.  The two men were friends, but Chopin did not appreciate the manner in which Liszt played variations on his music.  Liszt wrote in 1837 in ''La Revue et Gazette musicale'':  "Paris is the pantheon of living musicians, the temple where one becomes a god for a century or for an hour; the burning fire which lights and then consumes all fame."{{Sfn|Vila|2007|pages=136-137}}  The violinist [[Niccolò Paganini]] was a frequent visitor and performer in Paris. In 1836, he made an unfortunate investment in a Paris casino, and went bankrupt. He was forced to sell his collection of violins to pay his debts. [[Richard Wagner]] came to Paris in 1839, hoping to present his works on the Paris opera stages, with no success. Some interest was finally shown by the director of the Paris Opera; he rejected Wagner's music but wanted to buy the synopsis of his opera, ''Le Vaissau fantôme'', to be put to music by a French composer, Louis-Philippe Dietsch. Wagner sold the work for five hundred francs, and returned home in 1842.

Of the French composers during the period [[Hector Berlioz]] was the most prominent. He had come to Paris from [[Grenoble]] in 1821 to study medicine, which he abandoned for music in 1824, attending the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatory]] in 1826, and won the ''[[Prix de Rome]]'' for his compositions in 1830. He was working on his most famous work, the ''[[Symphonie Fantastique]]'', at the time of the [[July Revolution|July 1830 revolution]]. It had its premiere on 4 December 1830.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|pages=133-166}}

Three Paris theaters were permitted to produce operas under Louis Philippe:  The Royal Academy of Music on rue Le Peletier; the [[Opéra-Comique]]; and the [[Théâtre-Italien]], nicknamed "Les Bouffes".  The Royal Academy, financed by the government, was in dire financial difficulties.  In February, the government handed over management of the theater to a gifted entrepreneur, Doctor Véron, who had become wealthy selling medicinal ointments. Véron targeted the audience of the newly-wealthy Parisian businessmen and entrepreneurs;  he redesigned the theater to make the loges smaller (six seats reduced to four seats), installed gas lights to improve visibility, and launched a new repertoire to make the Paris Opera "both brilliant and popular".  The first great success of the new regime was ''[[Robert le Diable]]'' by the German composer [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], which premiered on November 21, 1831. Meyerbeer wrote a succession of popular operas. At the end of his four-year contract, Doctor Véron retired, leaving the opera in an admirable financial and artistic position.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|pages=138-139}}
[[File:La Juive Act1 set 1835 - NGO2p927.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Set for Act 1 of ''La Juive'' at the Opéra-Comique (1835)]]
The Opéra-Comique also enjoyed great success, largely due to the talents of the scenarist [[Eugène Scribe]], who wrote ninety works for the theater, put to music by forty different composers, including [[Daniel Auber]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], [[Fromental Halévy]] ([[La Juive]] (1835)), [[Cherubini]], [[Donizetti]], [[Gounod]] and [[Verdi]] (for whom he wrote ''[[Les vêpres siciliennes]]''). Scribe left behind the grand mythological themes of earlier French opera,  and wrote stories from a variety of historical periods which, with a mixture of strong emotion, humor and romanticism,  exactly suited the taste of Parisian audiences.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|pages=140-143}}

The Théâtre-Italien completed the grand trio of Paris opera houses. After the fire at the Salle Favart, it moved briefly to the Odéon Theater and then permanently to the Salle Ventadour.  In their repertoire, the ballet played a very small part, the costumes and sets were not remarkable, and the number of works was small; only a dozen new operas were staged between 1825 and 1870;  but they included several famous works of  ''[[Bel canto|Bel Canto]]'' opera, including  ''[[I Puritani]]'' by [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and ''[[Marino Faliero]]'' and ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' by [[Donizetti]]. [[Verdi]] lived primarily in Paris between 1845 and 1847, and staged four of his operas at the Théâtre-Italien:  ''[[Nabucco]]'', ''[[Ernani]]'', ''[[I due Foscari]]'', and ''[[Jérusalem]]''. The leading Italian singers also came regularly to sing at the Théâtre-Italien, including [[Giovanni Rubini]], the creator of the role of Arturo in Bellini's ''I Puritani'', [[Giulia Grisi]], [[Fanny Persiani]], [[Henriette Sontag]] and [[Giuditta Pasta]], who created the role of ''Norma'' in Bellini's opera.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|pages=143-144-139}}

French composers including [[Hector Berlioz]] struggled in vain against the tide of Italian operas. Berlioz succeeded in getting his opera  ''Benvenuto Cellini''  staged at the Royal Academy in 1838, but it closed after just three performances, and was not staged again in France during his lifetime.  Berlioz complained in the ''Journal des Debats'' that there were six operas by Donizetti in Paris playing in one year. "Monsieur Donizetti has the air to treat us like a conquered country," he wrote, "it is a veritable war of invasion. We can no longer call them the lyric theaters of Paris, just the lyric theaters of Monsieur Donizetti."{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=144}}

With the growing popularity of classical music and the arrival of so many talented musicians, Paris encountered a shortage of concert halls. The best hall in the city was that of the Paris Conservatory on rue Bergére, which had excellent acoustics and could seat a thousand persons.  Berlioz premiered his ''[[Symphonie Fantastique]]'' there on December 30, 1830; on December 29, 1832, Berlioz presented the Symphony again, along with two new pieces, ''Lelio'' and ''Harold en Italie'', which he wrote specially for [[Paganini]] to play. At the end of the performance,  with [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]] in the audience, Paganini bowed down humbly before Berlioz in tribute.

The Concert Society of the Paris Conservatory was founded in 1828, especially to play the symphonies of Beethoven&amp;nbsp;– one at each performance, along with works by Mozart, Hayden and Handel. It was the first professional symphonic association in Europe.  A second symphony association, the Societé de Sainte-Cecile, was founded shortly afterwards, which played more modern music; it presented the Paris premieres of Wagner's ''[[Tannhäuser]]'' overture, works by Schubert, the ''Symphonie Italienne'' of [[Mendelssohn]],  the ''Fuite en Égypte'' of Berlioz, and the first works of [[Charles Gounod]] and [[Georges Bizet]].{{Sfn|Vila|2007|pages=157-158}}

==Ballet and dance==
[[File:Sylphide -Marie Taglioni -1832 -2.jpg|thumb|[[Marie Taglioni]] in ''[[La Sylphide]]'' (1832)]]

The ballet had been an integral part of the Paris Opera since the time of Louis XIV the 17th century.  A new style, [[Romantic ballet]], was born on March 12, 1832 with the premiere of ''[[La Sylphide]]''  at the [[Salle Le Peletier]], with choreography by [[Filippo Taglioni]] and music by [[Jean-Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer]].&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.the-ballet.com/sylphide.php | title=La Sylphide | work=Ballet Encyclopedia | publisher=The Ballet | accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taglioni designed the work as a showcase for his daughter [[Marie Taglioni|Marie]]. ''La Sylphide'' was the first ballet where dancing ''[[en pointe]]'' had an aesthetic rationale and was not merely an acrobatic stunt. Other romantic ballets that had their first performances at the Opera were ''[[Giselle]]'' (1841), ''[[Paquita]]'' (1846)  and ''[[Le Corsaire]]'' (1856).
Among the great [[ballerina]]s to grace the stage of the Opéra during this time were [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Carolina Rosati]], [[Fanny Elssler]], [[Lucile Grahn]], and [[Fanny Cerrito]].

[[Lucien Petipa]] danced the male lead in ''Giselle'' at its premiere, and his younger brother [[Marius Petipa]] also danced for a time at the Paris Opera.  Marius Petipa moved from Paris to Saint Petersburg, where he became the ballet-master for the Russian Imperial ballet and created many celebrated ballets, including ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[La Bayadère]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.

==Balls, concerts-promenades and the romance==
The Champs-Élysées was redeveloped in the 1830s with public gardens at either end, and became a popular place for Parisians to promenade.  It was soon lined with restaurants, cafes-chantants. and pleasure gardens where outdoor concerts and balls were held. The Café Turc opened a garden with a series of concert-promenades in the spring of 1833, which alternated symphonic music with quadrilles and airs for dancing. The 17-year-old [[Jacques Offenbach]] wrote his first compositions for the dance orchestra at the Café Turc.  The Tivoli, the Bazar of rue Saint-Honoré and the Casino Paganini competed with the Café Turc.  In 1837, the King of the Viennese waltz, [[Johann Strauss&amp;nbsp;I]], came in person to in Paris, competing with the French waltz king, [[Philippe Musard]]. The outdoor concerts and balls did not stay in fashion for long; most of the gardens began to close after 1838, and Musard took charge instead of the famous masked balls at the Paris Opera.  The romance, a song with a simple, tender melody, sentimental words, accompanied on the piano, became the fashion in the Paris salons. Thousands of copies were sold by Paris publishers.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|pages=147-148}}

==Street music, ''goguettes''  and the cabaret==
At the beginning of the 1830s, the Paris police counted 271 wandering street musicians, 220 ''saltimbanques'', 106 players of the barbary organ, and 135 itinerant street singers.  The ''goguettes'', or working class singing clubs, continued to grow in popularity, meeting in the back rooms of cabarets. The repertoire of popular songs ranged from romantic to comic and satirical, to political and revolutionary, especially in the 1840s.  In June 1848 the musical clubs were banned from meeting, as the government tried, without success, to stop the political unrest, which finally exploded into the [[1848 French Revolution]].{{Sfn|Vila|2007|pages=147-148}}

'''Marbleizing''' or '''faux marbling''' is the preparation and finishing of a surface to imitate the appearance of polished [[marble]]. It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive. Faux marbling is a special case of faux painting used to create the distinctive and varied patterns of marble - the most imitated stone by far.

[[Image:Marble fresco - Capella dei Scrovegni - Padua 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Giotto]], [[Scrovegni Chapel]].]]

==History==
Faux stone painting was widely used in [[Pompeii]], but it really took off in Europe during the [[Renaissance]] with two schools of faux painting developing. The Italian school was loose and artistic, the French school was formal and realistic. It typically took an apprentice 10 years or more to fully master the art.

The sophistication of the techniques are such that visitors are frequently unable to distinguish between false and real marble in many churches, palaces and public buildings in Europe. The techniques were perfected by the 17th century and have been used in all styles of construction well into the 20th century, including [[Baroque]], [[palladian]], [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] and historical [[revival style]]s as well as [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] buildings. Craftsmen who are able to replicate this work are still available, as evidenced, for example, by the extensive restorations of faux marble surfaces in important Eastern Europe buildings since 1990.

The art of marbling and graining reached its apogee in Britain between 1845 and 1870, and during this period the acknowledged master was [[Thomas Kershaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stewartmcdonald.co.uk/kershaw/kershaw.html| title = Thomas Kershaw 1819-1898 "Prince of Grainers &amp; Marblers"|accessdate = 2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomas Kershaw==
Kershaw was born in Standish, Lancashire England in April 1819. At the age of 12 he was apprenticed to Mr. John Platt of Bolton who was paid the sum of £23 by Kershaw’s father in order that his son could be instructed in the craft of house painting. He worked 10 hours a day for six days a week. He completed his apprenticeship at the age of 21.
 
He achieved international fame, winning a number of the most prestigious awards at the major exhibitions of the age; The Great Exhibition, London, 1851 - a first prize medal; Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1855 - a first class medal; London Exhibition, 1862 - first prize.

Kershaw's work was so good that it was often considered to be indiscernible from the original. He undertook work in many large houses, mansions and stately homes throughout [[England]] and [[Wales]] and once declined an offer from the Russian Ambassador to imitate marbles on the interior of the Imperial Palace in [[St Petersburg]]. In 1858 he produced one of his important works in the Blue Room in [[Buckingham Palace]] where all the pillars were done in imitation marble.

==William Holgate==
In modern times, William Holgate (1931-2002) from Clitheroe, [[Lancashire]], was possibly the finest grainer and  marbler in the world since Thomas Kershaw held the title 150 years before.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} His achievements include the prestigious award known as the "Freedom of the City and Guilds of London" and he was very proud to be made "A Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter Stainers of Trinity Lane, London," on March 14, 1995. He was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2001 Paris Salon. His apprentice and protégé, Andrew Johnstone continues his tradition.

==Techniques==
[[image:sch_mar_2.jpg|thumb|Example of a faux painting in antique verde marble]]
Other techniques for producing faux marble include [[Scagliola]], a costly process which involves the use of specially pigmented plasters, and [[terrazzo]]. For flooring, marble chips are imbedded in cement, then ground and polished to expose the marble aggregate.

Some professional faux finishers are very skilled and will use a variety of techniques to reproduce the colors, veining and luster of real marble or other building materials. However, many decorators will merely suggest the appearance of marble rather than accurately imitate a particular stone.

[[File:Harmonyoftheworld.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Harmony of the world, 1806&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Musica universalis''' (literally '''universal music'''), also called '''Music of the spheres''' or '''Harmony of the Spheres''', is an ancient [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept that regards proportions in the movements of [[celestial bodies]]—the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s—as a form of ''musica'' (the [[Medieval]] [[Latin]] term for [[music]]). This "music" is not usually thought to be literally audible, but a [[harmonic]], [[mathematics|mathematical]] or [[religious]] concept.  The idea continued to appeal to thinkers about music until the end of the [[Renaissance]], influencing scholars of many kinds, including [[humanism|humanists]].  Further scientific exploration has determined specific proportions in some orbital motion, described as [[orbital resonance]].

== History ==
[[File:The music of the spheres.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Engraving from Renaissance Italy (Gafurius's ''Practica musice'', 1496) showing Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical modes]]
{{See also|Pythagoreanism#Music and harmony}}

The discovery of the precise relation between the pitch of the musical note and the length of the string that produces it is attributed to Pythagoras.
The Music of the Spheres incorporates the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or "tones" of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. [[Pythagoras]]  first identified that the [[Pitch (music)|pitch of a musical note]] is in inverse proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Weiss-2008|Weiss and Taruskin (2008)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=q1eobgND8H4C&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;  In a theory known as the Harmony of the Spheres, Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Pliny-77|Pliny the Elder (77)]] pp. 277–8, (II.xviii.xx): "…occasionally Pythagoras draws on the theory of music, and designates the distance between the Earth and the Moon as a whole tone, that between the Moon and Mercury as a semitone, .... the seven tones thus producing the so-called diapason, ''i.e.''. a universal harmony".&lt;/ref&gt; and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2000|Houlding (2000)]] p. 28: 

For [[Philolaus]], mathematician and Pythagorean astronomer, working around 400 BC, the world was 'harmony and numbers'; everything is ordered according to proportions that correspond to three basic musical intervals: 2:1 (harmony), 3:2 (fifth), 4:3 (fourth). Nicomachus of Gerasa (also a Pythagorean, towards the year 200 BC) assigns the notes of the octave to the celestial bodies, so that they generate a music.
"The doctrine of the Pythagoreans was a combination of science and mysticism… Like Anaximenes they viewed the Universe as one integrated, living organism, surrounded by Divine Air (or more literally 'Breath'), which permeates and animates the whole cosmos and filters through to individual creatures … By partaking of the core essence of the Universe, the individual is said to act as a microcosm in which all the laws in the macrocosm of the Universe are at work".&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as "twinned" studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Davis-1901|Davis (1901)]] p. 252. Plato's ''Republic'' VII.XII reads: "As the eyes, said I, seem formed for studying astronomy, so do the ears seem formed for harmonious motions: and these seem to be twin sciences to one another, as also the Pythagoreans say".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] criticised the notion&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, On the Heavens, J.L. Stocks' translation, http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.2.ii.html&lt;/ref&gt; that celestial bodies make a sound in moving in the context of his own cosmological model. &lt;blockquote&gt;From all this it is clear that the theory that the movement of the stars produces a harmony, i.e. that the sounds they make are concordant, in spite of the grace and originality with which it has been stated, is nevertheless untrue. Some thinkers suppose that the motion of bodies of that size must produce a noise, since on our earth the motion of bodies far inferior in size and in speed of movement has that effect. Also, when the sun and the moon, they say, and all the stars, so great in number and in size, are moving with so rapid a motion, how should they not produce a sound immensely great? Starting from this argument and from the observation that their speeds, as measured by their distances, are in the same ratios as musical concordances, they assert that the sound given forth by the circular movement of the stars is a harmony. Since, however, it appears unaccountable that we should not hear this music, they explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence, since sound and silence are discriminated by mutual contrast. What happens to men, then, is just what happens to coppersmiths, who are so accustomed to the noise of the smithy that it makes no difference to them. But, as we said before, melodious and poetical as the theory is, it cannot be a true account of the facts. There is not only the absurdity of our hearing nothing, the ground of which they try to remove, but also the fact that no effect other than sensitive is produced upon us. Excessive noises, we know, shatter the solid bodies even of inanimate things: the noise of thunder, for instance, splits rocks and the strongest of bodies. But if the moving bodies are so great, and the sound which penetrates to us is proportionate to their size, that sound must needs reach us in an intensity many times that of thunder, and the force of its action must be immense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The three branches of the Medieval concept of musica were presented by [[Boethius]] in his book ''De Musica'':&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, De institutione musica, I.2 (p. 187 Friedlein ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''musica mundana'' (sometimes referred to as ''musica universalis'')
* ''musica humana'' (the internal music of the human body)
* ''musica quae in quibusdam constituta est instrumentis'' (sounds made by singers and instrumentalists)

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, the heavenly "music of the spheres" is heard in the ''Region of Concrete Thought'', the lower region of the [[mental plane]], which is an ocean of harmony.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The scales of each of the six known planets, and the moon, placed on five-line staffs.]]
''Harmonices'' is split into five books, or chapters. The first and second books give a brief discussion on [[regular polyhedron]] and their [[Congruence (geometry)|congruences]], reiterating the idea he introduced in ''Mysterium'' that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits of the planets and their distances from the sun. Book three focuses on defining musical harmonies, including [[consonance and dissonance]], intervals (including the problems of just tuning), their relations to string length, and what makes music pleasurable to listen to. In the fourth book Kepler presents a metaphysical basis for this system, along with arguments for why the harmony of the worlds appeals to the intellectual soul in the same manner as the harmony of music appeals to the human soul. Here he also uses the naturalness of this harmony as an argument for [[heliocentrism]]. In book five, Kepler describes in detail the orbital motion of the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies. Finally, after a discussion on [[astrology]] in book five, Kepler ends ''Harmonices'' by describing his [[Third law of planetary motion|third law]], which states that for any planet the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the square of its orbital period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the final book of ''Harmonices'', Kepler explains how the ratio of the maximum and minimum [[Angular velocity|angular speeds]] of each planet (its speeds at the perihelion and aphelion) is very nearly equivalent to a consonant musical interval. Furthermore, the ratios between these extreme speeds of the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These speeds explain the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the orbits of the planets in a natural way that appealed to Kepler’s religious beliefs in a heavenly creator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While Kepler did believe that the harmony of the worlds was inaudible, he related the motions of the planets to musical concepts in book four of ''Harmonices''. He makes an analogy between comparing the extreme speeds of one planet and the extreme speeds of multiple planets with the difference between [[Monophonic music|monophonic]] and [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] music. Because planets with larger eccentricities have a greater variation in speed they produce more “notes.” Earth’s maximum and minimum speeds, for example, are in a ratio of roughly 16 to 15, or that of a semitone, whereas Venus’ orbit is nearly circular, and therefore only produces a singular note. Mars, which has the largest eccentricity, has the largest interval, a minor tenth, or a ratio of 12 to 5. This range, as well as the relative speeds between the planets, led Kepler to conclude that the solar system was comprised of two basses ([[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]]), a tenor ([[Mars]]), two altos ([[Venus]] and [[Earth]]), and a soprano ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), which had sung in “perfect concord,” at the beginning of time, and could potentially arrange themselves to do so again.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was certain of the link between musical harmonies and the harmonies of the heavens and believed that “man, the imitator of the Creator,” had emulated the polyphony of the heavens so as to enjoy “the continuous duration of the time of the world in a fraction of an hour.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kepler was so convinced in a creator that he was convinced of the existence of this harmony despite a number of inaccuracies present in ''Harmonices''. Many of the ratios differed by an error greater than simple measurement error from the true value for the interval, and the ratio between Mars’ and Jupiter’s angular velocities does not create a consonant interval, though every other combination of planets does. Kepler brushed aside this problem by making the argument, with the math to support it, that because these [[elliptical]] paths had to fit into the regular solids described in ''Mysterium'' the values for both the dimensions of the solids and the angular speeds would have to differ from the ideal values to compensate. This change also had the benefit of helping Kepler retroactively explain why the regular solids encompassing each planet were slightly imperfect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Use in recent music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The connection between music, mathematics, and astronomy had a profound impact on history. It resulted in music's inclusion in the Quadrivium, the medieval curriculum that included arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy, and along with the Trivium (grammar, logic,and rhetoric) made up the seven liberal arts, which are still the basis for higher education today. A small number of recent compositions either make reference to or are based on the concepts of Musica Universalis or Harmony of the Spheres. Among these are ''[[Music of the Spheres (Mike Oldfield album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' by [[Mike Oldfield]], ''[[Om (The Moody Blues song)|Om]]'' by [[the Moody Blues]], ''[[The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi]]'' album by [[The Receiving End of Sirens]], ''[[Music of the Spheres (Ian Brown album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' by [[Ian Brown]]'','' and [[Björk]]'s single ''[[Cosmogony (song)|Cosmogony]]'', included in her 2011 album ''[[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]]''. Earlier, in the 1910s, Danish composer [[Rued Langgaard]] composed a pioneering orchestral work titled ''[[Music of the Spheres (Langgaard)|Music of the Spheres]]''. ''Music of the Spheres'' was also the title chosen for the musical foundation of the video-game [[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]], and was composed by Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori, and Paul McCartney. [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote an Opera (1957), and a Symphony using the same music, called 'Die Harmonie der Welt' based upon the life of the Astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630).

The '''Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act''' ('''NAGPRA'''), Pub. L. 101-601, 25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq., 104 Stat. 3048, is a [[United States federal law]] enacted on 16 November 1990.

The Act requires [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]] and institutions that receive federal funding&lt;ref&gt;The [[Smithsonian Institution]] is exempt from this act, but rather must comply with similar requirements under the [[National Museum of American Indian act|National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; to return [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] "cultural items" to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. Cultural items include human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. A program of federal grants assists in the [[repatriation]] process and the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] may assess civil penalties on museums that fail to comply.

NAGPRA also establishes procedures for the inadvertent discovery or planned excavation of Native American cultural items on federal or tribal lands. While these provisions do not apply to discoveries or excavations on private or state lands, the collection provisions of the Act may apply to Native American cultural items if they come under the control of an institution that receives federal funding.

Lastly, NAGPRA makes it a criminal offense to traffic in Native American human remains without right of possession or in Native American cultural items obtained in violation of the Act. Penalties for a first offense may reach 12 months imprisonment and a $100,000 fine.

==Background==
The intent of the NAGPRA legislation is to address long-standing claims by [[federally recognized tribes]] for the return of human remains and cultural objects unlawfully obtained from prehistoric, historic, former, and current Native American homelands. Interpretation of human and [[indigenous rights]], prehistoric presence, cultural affiliation with antiquities, and the return of remains and objects can be controversial and contested. It includes provisions that delineate the legal processes by which museums and federal agencies are required to return certain Native American cultural items—human remains, gravesite materials, and other objects of cultural patrimony—to proven lineal descendants, culturally related Native American tribes, and Native Hawaiian groups.

Outcomes of NAGPRA repatriation efforts are slow and cumbersome, leading many tribes to spend considerable effort documenting their requests; collections' holders are obliged to inform and engage with tribes whose materials they may possess. NAGPRA was enacted primarily at the insistence and by the direction of members of Native American nations.&lt;ref name=CARRILLO&gt;Carrillo, Jo (1998).

===Tribal concerns===
Tribes had many reasons based in law that made legislation concerning tribal grave protection and repatriation necessary.
*State [[Statutory Law]]: Historically, states only regulated and protected marked graves. Native American graves were often unmarked and did not receive the protection provided by these statutes.
*[[Common Law]]: The colonizing population formed much of the legal system that developed over the course of settling the United States. This law did not often take into account the unique Native American practices concerning graves and other burial practices. It did not account for government actions against Native Americans, such as removal, the relationship that Native Americans as different peoples maintain with their dead, and sacred ideas and myths related to the possession of graves.
*[[Equal Protection]]: Native Americans, as well as others, often found that the remains of Native American graves were treated differently from the dead of other races.
*[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]: As in most racial and social groups, Native American burial practices relate strongly to their religious beliefs and practices. They held that when tribal dead were desecrated, disturbed, or withheld from burial, their religious beliefs and practices are being infringed upon. Religious beliefs and practices are protected by the first amendment.
*[[Sovereignty]] Rights: Native Americans hold unique rights as sovereign bodies, leading to their relations to be controlled by their own laws and customs. The relationship between the people and their dead is an internal relationship, to be understood as under the sovereign jurisdiction of the tribe.
*[[Treaty]]: From the beginning of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government and tribe relations, the tribe maintained rights unless specifically divested to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government in a treaty. The U.S.&amp;nbsp;government does not have the right to disturb Native American graves or their dead, because it has not been granted by any treaty.

==Description==
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is a law that establishes the ownership of cultural items excavated or discovered on federal or tribal land after November 16, 1990.  The act also applies to land transferred by the federal government to the states under the Water Resources Department Act.&lt;ref name="William C. American Indian Law 2004. Page 276"&gt;[[William C. Canby, Jr.|Canby&amp;nbsp;Jr., William&amp;nbsp;C.]] (2004). ''American Indian Law in a Nutshell''. St. Paul: West,. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the provisions of the legislation do not apply to private lands.  The Act states that Native American remains and associated funerary objects belong to [[lineal descendants]].  If lineal descendants cannot be identified, then those remains and objects, along with associated funerary and sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony belong to the tribe on whose lands the remains were found or the tribe having the closest known relationship to them.&lt;ref name="William C. American Indian Law 2004. Page 276"/&gt; Tribes find the burden of proof is on them, if it becomes necessary to demonstrate a cultural relationship that may not be well-documented or understood.  Nowhere has this issue been more pronounced than in California, where many small bands were extinguished before they could be recognized, and only a handful, even today, have obtained federal recognition as Native Americans and descendants of Native American bands.

Congress attempted to "strike a balance between the interest in scientific examination of skeletal remains and the recognition that Native Americans, like people from every culture around the world, have a religious and spiritual reverence for the remains of their ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/03justice/NALR007.htm |title=Native American Graves Protection Act |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011231023931/http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/03justice/NALR007.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act also requires each federal agency, museum, or institution that receives federal funds to prepare an inventory of remains and funerary objects and a summary of sacred objects, cultural patrimony objects, and unassociated funerary objects. The act provides for repatriation of these items when requested by the appropriate descendant of the tribe.  This applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before November 16, 1990.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/Nagpra/FAQ/INDEX.HTM Frequently Asked Questions - NAGPRA], U.S.&amp;nbsp;Park Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the legislation passed, the human remains of approximately 32,000 individuals have been returned to their respective tribes.  Nearly 670,000 funerary objects, 120,000 unassociated funerary objects, and 3,500 sacred objects have been returned.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; 

[[Image:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|thumb | right | 350px | Map of [[Native American reservations]]]]
The statute attempts to mediate a significant tension that exists between the tribes' communal interests in the respectful treatment of their deceased ancestors and related cultural items and the scientists' individual interests in the study of those same human remains and items. The act divides the treatment of American Indian human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony into two basic categories.  Under the inadvertent discovery and planned excavation component of the act and regulations, if federal officials anticipate that  activities on federal and tribal lands after November 16, 1990 might have an effect on American Indian burials—or if burials are discovered during such activities—they must consult with potential lineal descendants or American Indian tribal officials as part of their compliance responsibilities.  For planned excavations, consultation must occur during the planning phase of the project.  For inadvertent discoveries, the regulations delineate a set of short deadlines for initiating and completing consultation.  The repatriation provision, unlike the ownership provision, applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before the effective date of the act, whether or not discovered on tribal or federal land.  The act allows [[archaeology|archaeological]] teams a short time for analysis before the remains must be returned.  Once it is determined that human remains are American Indian, analysis can occur only through documented consultation (on federal lands) or consent (on tribal lands).

A criminal provision of the Act prohibits trafficking in Native American human remains, or in Native American "cultural items." Under the inventory and notification provision of the act, federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funds are required to summarize their collections that may contain items subject to NAGPRA. Additionally, federal agencies and institutions must prepare inventories of human remains and funerary objects. Under the act, funerary objects are considered "associated" if they were buried as part of a burial ceremony with a set of human remains still in possession of the federal agency or other institution. "Unassociated" funerary objects are artifacts where human remains were not initially collected by—or were subsequently destroyed, lost, or no longer in possession of—the agency or institution. Consequently, this legislation also applies to many Native American [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, especially burial items and religious artifacts. It has necessitated masscataloguing of the Native American collections in order to identify the living heirs, culturally affiliated Indian tribes, and [[Native Hawaiian]] organizations of remains and artifacts. NAGPRA has had a dramatic effect on the day-to-day practice of [[archaeology]] and [[physical anthropology]] in the United States. In many cases, NAGPRA helped stimulate interactions of archaeologists and museum professionals with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that were felt to be constructive by all parties.

==History==

===Background===
The late 19th century was one of the most difficult periods in Native American history in regards to the loss of cultural artifacts and land.  With the founding of museums and scholarly studies of Native American peoples increasing with the growth of [[anthropology]] and [[archeology]] as disciplines, private collectors and museums competed to acquire artifacts, which many Native Americans considered  ancestral assets, but others sold. This competition existed not only between museums such as the [[Smithsonian Institution]] (founded in 1846) and museums associated with universities, but also between museums in the United States and museums in Europe. In the 1880s and 1890s, collecting was done by untrained adventurers.  As of the year 1990, federal agencies reported having the remains of 14,500 deceased Natives in their possession, which had accumulated since the late 19th century.  Many institutions said they used the remains of Native Americans for anthropological research, to gain more information about humans. At one time, in since discredited comparative racial studies, institutions such as the Army Medical Museum sought to demonstrate racial characteristics to prove the inferiority of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Carrillo, Jo, ed. ''Readings In American Indian Law.'' Temple University Press, 1998. Pg 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maria Pearson===
[[Maria Pearson]] is often credited with being the earliest catalyst for the passage of NAGPRA legislation; she has been called "the Founding Mother of modern Indian repatriation movement" and the "[[Rosa Parks]] of NAGPRA".&lt;ref name="Still Running" /&gt; In the early 1970s, Pearson was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in [[Glenwood, Iowa]]. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, the remains of a Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Governor [[Robert D. Ray]], finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. "You can give me back my people's bones and you can quit digging them up", she responded when the governor asked what he could do for her. The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the United States that specifically protected Native American remains.

Emboldened by her success, Pearson went on to [[Lobbying|lobby]] national leaders, and her efforts, combined with the work of many other activists, led to the creation of NAGPRA.&lt;ref name="Still Running"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gradwohl|first=David M. |author2=Joe B.

===Slack Farm and Dickson Mounds===
The 1987 looting of a 500-year-old burial mound at the [[Slack Farm]] in [[Kentucky]], in which human remains were tossed to the side while relics were stolen, made national news and helped to galvanize popular support for protection of Native American graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Battle over Athlete Jim Thorpe's burial site continues |newspaper=Washington Post |date=17 March 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/battle-over-athlete-jim-thorpes-burial-site-continues/2012/02/21/gIQAn5DLES_story_4.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic Magazine'', March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, several protests at the [[Dickson Mounds]] site in [[Illinois]], where numerous Indian skeletons were exposed on display, also increased national awareness of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neighbors Mourn Dickson Mounds` Demise |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 26, 1991 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-11-26/news/9104170045_1_native-americans-jim-edgar-archeologists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Return to the Earth'' is an inter-religious project whose goal is to inter unidentified remains in regional burial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.return2theearth.org|title=Return to the Earth|accessdate=2008-04-24|publisher=Religions for Peace|quote=Mission: The Return to the Earth project supports Native Americans in burying unidentifiable ancestral remains now scattered across the United States and enables a process of education and reconciliation between Native and Non-Native peoples.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 110,000 remains that cannot be associated with a particular tribe are held in institutions across the United States, as of 2006.&lt;ref name='mcc'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcc.org/news/news/2006/2006-04-19_returntotheearth.html|title=Return to the Earth|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=[[Mennonite Central Committee]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061120234305/http://www.mcc.org/news/news/2006/2006-04-19_returntotheearth.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project seeks to enable a process of reconciliation between Native and non-Native peoples, construct cedar burial boxes, produce burial cloths and fund the repatriation of remains. The first of the burial sites is near the Cheyenne Cultural Center in [[Clinton, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name='mcc'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonokla.org/entertainment/cheyennecenter.htm|title=Cheyenne Cultural Center|accessdate=2007-04-13|publisher=City of Clinton, Oklahoma |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407091455/http://www.clintonokla.org/entertainment/cheyennecenter.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial issues==
A few archeologists are concerned that they are being prevented from studying ancient remains which cannot be traced to any historic tribe. Many of the tribes migrated to their territories at the time of European encounter within 100–500 years from other locations, so their ancestors were not located in the historic territories.&lt;ref&gt;George Johnson, "Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists," ''New York Times'', 22 October 1996, accessed 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Such controversies have repeatedly stalled archaeological investigations, such as in the case of the [[Spirit Cave mummy]]; fears have been voiced that an anti-scientific sentiment could well have permeated politics to an extent that scientists might find their work to be continuously barred by Native Americans rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.nevadajournal.com/nj98/02/cover_story.htm|title=The Nevada Journal: Scalping Science: Sensitivity Run Amok|author=|date=|website=archive.nevadajournal.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kennewick Man===
Compliance with the legislation can be complicated.  One example of controversy is that of  [[Kennewick Man]], a skeleton found on July 28, 1996 near [[Kennewick, Washington]]. The federally recognized [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]], [[Colville (tribe)|Colville]], [[Yakima Tribe|Yakima]], and [[Nez Perce tribe]]s had each claimed Kennewick Man as their ancestor, and sought permission to rebury him.  Kennewick, Washington is classified as part of the ancestral land of the Umatilla.

Archaeologists said that because of Kennewick Man's great age, there was insufficient evidence to connect him to modern tribes. The great age of the remains makes this discovery scientifically valuable.&lt;ref name="Custred_2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Custred, Glynn|title=The Forbidden Discovery of Kennewick Man|journal=Academic Questions|volume=13|issue=3|year=2000|pages=12–30|doi=10.1007/s12129-000-1034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As archaeologists, forensic specialists, and linguists differed about whether the adult male was of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] origin, the standing law, if conclusively found by a preponderance of evidence to be Native American, would give the tribe of the geographic area where he was found a claim to the remains.&lt;ref&gt;McManamon, F.&amp;nbsp;P. [http://www.nps.gov/archeology/kennewick/ Kennewick Man.] ''National Park Service Archeology Program.'' May 2004 (retrieved 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  New evidence could still emerge in defense of tribal claims to ancestry, but emergent evidence may require more sophisticated and precise methods of determining genetic descent, given that there was no cultural evidence accompanying the remains.

One tribe claiming ancestry to Kennewick Man offered up a DNA test, and in 2015 it was found that the Kennewick man is "more closely related to modern Native Americans than any other living population." In September 2016, the US House and Senate passed legislation to return the ancient bones to a coalition of Columbia Basin tribes for reburial according to their traditions. The coalition includes the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, and the Wanapum Band of Priest Rapids. The remains were buried on February 18, 2017, with 200 members of five Columbia Basin tribes, at an undisclosed location in the area.&lt;ref name="SR2017"&gt;{{cite news |date=February 20, 2017 |title=Tribes lay remains of Kennewick Man to rest |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/feb/20/tribes-lay-remains-of-kennewick-man-to-rest/ |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=Spokane, Washington |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International policies==
[[File:Distinctive marking of cultural property in Austria-from Flickr 141273020.jpg|thumb|right|Distinctive Marking of Cultural Property, [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention]]]]

The issues of such resources are being addressed by international groups dealing with indigenous rights. For example, in 1995 the United States signed an agreement with [[El&amp;nbsp;Salvador]] in order to protect all pre‑Columbian artifacts from leaving the region. Soon after, it signed similar agreements with [[Canada]], [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Mali]] and demonstrated leadership in implementing the 1970 [[UNESCO]] Convention. The UNESCO convention had membership increase to 86 countries by 1997, and 193 by 2007. UNESCO appears to be reducing the illicit antiquities trade. It is not an easy business to track, but the scholar Phyllis Messenger notes that some antiquities traders have written articles denouncing the agreements, which suggests that it is reducing items sold to them.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Phyllis Mauch. ''The Ethics of Collecting Cultural Property Whose Culture? Whose Property?'' New York: University of New Mexico, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

An international predecessor of the UNESCO Convention and NAGPRA is the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970525145320/http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |archivedate=May 25, 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Convention was the first international convention to focus on preserving cultural heritage from the devastation of war. Looting and destruction of other civilizations have been characteristics of war recorded from the first accounts of all cultures.

[[File:Minik in New York.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minik Wallace]] ([[Kalaallit]]) in New York, 1897]]
On September 30, 1897, Lieutenant [[Robert Peary]] brought six [[Inuit]] people from [[Greenland]] to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York, at the request of the [[anthropologist]] Franz Boas, in order to "obtain leisurely certain information which will be of the greatest scientific importance" regarding Inuit culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, David H. ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity,'' p.78. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;  About two weeks after arrival at the museum, all six of the Inuit people became sick with colds and fever. They began to perform their tribal healing process and were mocked for their bizarre behavior. These people became a form of entertainment for the Americans. By November 1, 1897, they were admitted to the [[Bellevue Hospital Center]] with [[tuberculosis]], which they likely had contracted before their trip. In February, the first Inuit died and shortly after that two more followed. By the time the sickness had run its course, two men survived.  ''[[Minik Wallace|Minik]]'' was adopted by a superintendent of the museum, while ''Uissakassak'' returned to his homeland in Greenland. Later, after being lied to and being told that his father Qisuk had received a proper Inuit burial, Minik was shocked to find his father's skeleton on display in the museum.

In 1993 the museum finally agreed to [[Minik Wallace#Inuit burial|return the four Inuit skeletons]] to Greenland for proper burial. Representatives of the Museum went to Greenland that year to participate. In contrast to peoples in other areas, some local Inuit thought that the burial was more desired by the Christian representatives of the museum, and that the remains could have just as appropriately been kept in New York.&lt;ref name="Hurst218-9"&gt;[[David Hurst Thomas|Thomas, David&amp;nbsp;H.]] ''Skull Wars,'' pp. 218-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hurst Thomas]]' study of the case shows the complexity of reburial and repatriation cases, and the need for individual approaches to each case by all affected parties.&lt;ref name="Hurst218-9"/&gt;

===Protecting cultural property===
In the United States, the [[Archaeological Resources Protection Act]] (ARPA) protects archaeological sites on federally owned lands. Privately owned sites are controlled by the owners. In some areas, archaeological foundations or similar organizations buy archaeological sites to conserve associated the cultural property.

Other countries may use three basic types of laws to protect cultural remains:

*Selective export control laws control the trade of the most important artifacts while still allowing some free trade.  Countries that use these laws include Canada, [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]].
*Total [[export restriction]] laws are used by some countries to enact an embargo and completely shut off export of cultural property.  Many [[Latin America]]n and Mediterranean countries use these laws.
*Other countries, such as [[Mexico]], use national ownership laws to declare national ownership for all cultural artifacts. These laws cover control of artifacts that have not been discovered, to try to prevent looting of potential sites before exploration.

An '''online book''' is a resource in [[book]]-like form that is only available to read on the [[Internet]]. It differs from the common idea of an [[e-book]], which is usually available for users to download and read locally on a computer, [[smartphone]] or on an [[e-reader]]. "Book-like" means: information is presented in a page format; pages are normally available to read sequentially (though "flipping" to another page is possible using a mouse, keyboard or other controllers); and pages are read passively, with little or no interaction or multimedia. This contrasts with a text which a user is reading on an interactive [[Web 2.0]] website, which usually enables the user to click on online links, look up words or keywords online, etc.   "Online" means the content may only be read while the reader is connected to the Internet. Thus the reader's experience with an online book is similar to reading a printed book, except that the book is read at a computer and is only accessible while the reader is online. 

Online books are a common resource in [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs). For example, the [[Moodle]] VLE defines an online book in this way. Over the last few years, there has been an increase of online books that are being used for notable events or to commemorate the memory of someone. The fundraising industry often uses online books as a way to fundraise, as online books are also a way to collect donations and engage with their audience.

The '''Princeton Vase''' is a famous example of Late Classic [[Maya ceramics]] in codex style, first published in M.D. Coe's 'The Maya Scribe and His World' (1973), and now a key piece of the [[Pre-Columbian]] collection of the [[Princeton University Art Museum]].  Originally serving as a drinking vessel for chocolate, it depicts a throne room occupied by an aged deity wearing an owl headdress and by five young women surrounding him. In front of the throne a bound captive is being decapitated by two masked men, a scene that has long been assumed to refer to an episode in the [[Popol Vuh]]. As to the object's art-historical importance, it bears comparison to the equally famous [[Maya jaguar gods|Jaguar Baby]] vase in the New York [[Metropolitan Museum]]. 
 
==Description==
The vase, with an overall cream and incidental orange and brown-black slip, as well as traces of post-fire Maya blue pigment, dates to the [[Late Classic]] period of Maya civilization (late 7th or early 8th century), and originated in the [[Nakbé]] region, [[Mirador Basin]], [[Petén Department|Petén]], [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Princeton Vase (y1975-17)|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/fr/collections/objects/32221|website=Princeton University Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;Towards the rim of the vase, above the painted scene, formulaic texts consecrate the vessel, specifying its purpose as a drinking vessel for chocolate, and designating its owner, a lord named ''Muwaan K'uk'''. The vase would have been used in courtly feasts similar to the one depicted.{{sfn|Steward|p. 128}} The main surface of the vessel shows a calligraphic painting, executed with graceful, sure lines, of a theatrically composed mythological scene. Subtle visual devices, including one woman tapping the foot of another while her face points to the left, direct the viewer to turn the drinking vessel, allowing for a temporal unfolding as part of the viewing experience.{{sfn|Steward|p. 128}}


[[File:Maya vase.jpg|700px|center]]

==Iconography==
The scene's chief figure is known from the [[Dresden Codex]] as [[god L]], a deity of trade, shamanism, and warfare. The old, toothless man sits on a  throne within a conventional depiction of a palace, with a  pier behind him and what is likely a [[cornice]] above.  The cornice is decorated with two jawless [[jaguar]]s flanking the forward-facing face of a shark.  Curtains have been furled to reveal the seated lord. God L can be identified by his characteristic open-weave [[brocaded]] shawl as well as the broad-brimmed hat decorated with owl feathers and a stuffed owl with outstretched wings.

Five elegant female figures, perhaps concubines, and reminiscent of the [[goddess I]] from the Dresden Codex, surround the old god, who delicately ties a bracelet on one of them. The women wear loose, flowing [[sarong]]s, or tight-fitting wrap around cloths, decorated with [[batik]]-like dyed patterns rendered in a soft brown wash. Each has jewelry at the neck, ears, and wrists. One of the women behind god L is pouring chocolate from a vessel similar in shape to the Princeton Vase itself, frothing the bitter delicacy into a vessel whose figure has been lost to wear. 

Down below and sitting next to the throne, a rabbit scribe is writing in a book with jaguar-pelt covers, perhaps to record the scene in front of the throne: Two men wearing elaborate masks and wielding axes decapitate a bound, stripped figure whose winding serpent attribute, beset with death-eyes, is typical of writers, or in any case, of functionaries for whom the art of writing was essential.&lt;ref&gt;See the writers with this same attribute in Velásquez Garcia 2009: Fig. 12; cf. Houston 2016&lt;/ref&gt; One of the two men shows the features of the wind god, the other one wears an executioner's mask with a jaguar paw nose.

==Explanations==
The tendency has been to explain the vase representation mythologically, with the usual bias towards the [[Popol Vuh]], the 16th-century [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] Maya mythological narrative. Viewed within this framework, the scene has been argued to show the execution of Vucub-Hunahpu, uncle to the [[Hero Twins]], by order of god L, taken as the lord of the underworld ([[Xibalba]]).&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1973: 93&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the executioners - clad in identical jaguar skirts - are two in number and the wind god character wears a headband, it has also been asserted that the two executioners represent the Hero Twins themselves (or rather the 'Headband Twins', their Classic precursors) now decapitating a lord of the underworld instead of Vucub-Hunahpu.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Martin 2004: 58-60&lt;/ref&gt; The scene would thus offer a parallel to an episode in which these two heroes trick the underworld lords into asking for their own beheading. Iconographically, these conflicting explanations raise more questions than they answer, while remaining basically speculative. In fact, the execution scene may well involve historical characters.

It was one of the "most important collective artist groups"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicolás Kanellos|author2=Francisco A. Lomelí|author3=Claudio Esteva Fabregat|title=Handbook of Hispanic Cultures in the United States: Literature and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bC1FU07kVeoC&amp;pg=PA195|year=1993|publisher=Arte Publico Press|isbn=978-1-61192-163-2|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Chicano Movement#Chicano art|Chicano art]] movement in California during the 1970s and the 1980s and continues to be influential into the 21st century.

==History==

===Founding and name===
In 1969 [[José Montoya]] moved to Sacramento to pursue a master's degree at [[CSU Sacramento]]. He and newly hired staff member [[Esteban Villa]], both who had been active in the [[Mexican American Liberation Art Front]], a [[Chicano movement]] group founded in the San Francisco Bay Area by Montoya's brother Malaquias, became active and soon created a circle of artists and activists interested in political and cultural work.&lt;ref name=public&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Public Voice: Fifteen Years of Chicano Posters|author=Shifra M. Goldman|pages=50–57|journal=Art Journal|volume=44|number=1|date=Spring 1984|jstor=776674|doi=10.2307/776674}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Rebel [[Chicano]] Art Front (RCAF) was founded by Montoya, Villa, and student Ricardo Favela to foster the arts in the Chicano/Latino community, educate young people in arts, history and culture, promote political awareness, and foster support for [[César Chávez]] and the [[United Farm Workers]] in the heavily agricultural Sacramento-[[Davis, California|Davis]] area.&lt;ref name=accidental/&gt; As to its name, one day when someone asked if the RCAF meant the "[[Royal Canadian Air Force]]", one of the artists humorously responded, "No, it means the Royal ''Chicano'' Air Force!"&lt;ref name=accidental&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Accidental Archives of the Royal Chicano Air Force|author=Stephanie Sauer|journal=Boom: A Journal of California|volume=2|number=4|date=Winter 2012|pages=118–125|jstor=10.1525/boom.2012.2.4.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that point on, the artists used the "Air Force" motif in their artworks, programs, and activities.

===Activities===
Through the organizational framework of a collective, artists and community members established a silk screen operation to create multiples of images promoting art, cultural activities, community events, and political action. The work of Jose Guadalupe Posada, a Mexican printer of the late 1800s and early 1900s, inspired the artists for this work. At the same time, with the example of the great Mexican muralists, the artists undertook mural painting to bring cultural images and history to a larger audience. The organization grew to the point where a need for a space for artists was planned. The RCAF established the Centro de Artistas Chicanos moving from temporary quarters in homes, garages and La Raza Bookstore to Holy Angels School at 7th and T Streets. Later, a space was established on Folsom Blvd. and finally a center on Franklin Blvd. These spaces allowed for continual meetings, planning of events, workshops, studio activity and freedom to work around the clock. First, Max Garcia took on the directorship, followed by Gina Montoya and Ricardo Favela. Thousands of posters were created over the years with designs from multiple artists. Murals were painted throughout Sacramento (many now painted over) as well as Chicano Park in San Diego and in Washington and Oregon. Through the university, Jose Montoya, Esteban Villa and, later, Ricardo Favela, taught a generation of young artists the techniques of silk screen, muralism, drawing, and painting. Jose Montoya went on to establish the Barrio Art Program, representing an effort to reduce barriers between the CSU campus and the Alkalai Flats community. The Barrio Art Program brought young people and senior citizens together with aspiring teachers in the University's teacher training courses to learn to integrate the arts with education. The program continues to this day at the Washington Neighborhood Center located in downtown Sacramento at 16th and D Streets.  Other RCAF artists, like Juanishi Orosco, Armando Cid and Rudy Cuellar taught there as well as in other community settings. Armando Cid and Juan Cervantez became artist facilitators in the Arts in Corrections Program teaching art and bringing guest artists to adult inmates. The RCAF had also a history of bringing the arts to youth offenders within the California Youth Authority, specifically at the reform school known as the Preston School of Industry in Ione, CA.

===Bookstore===
Through the efforts of RCAF members and CSU students, Phillip "Pike" Santos and Louie "the Foot" Gonzalez, La Raza Bookstore was established in 1972. The absence of written works about or by Chicanos and Native Americans led to this effort. The Bookstore was established at 1228 F Street, Sacramento. Later a gallery was established and the name was changed to La Raza Bookstore/Galeria Posada (named in honor of Jose Guadalupe Posada). The RCAF was featured prominently over the years in exhibitions, but perhaps more importantly, it became the exhibition space for countless numbers of visual artists of national importance. This community bookstore and gallery became an active center for Chicano/Latino and Native American art, poetry and music. Following the administrative oversight by Phillip Santos, the bookstore has had as some of its directors: Josie S. Talamantez, Armando Cid, Tere Romo, Victoria Plata, Luis Chabolla, Marisa Gutierrez, Francisca Godinez and since 2008, Marie Acosta. La Raza/Galeria Posada is now occupying its sixth home in its 40+ years of existence.

===Music===
Through its work in organizing exhibitions, ''mercados'', dances, and cultural celebrations, the role of music became an important component of the RCAF. Freddie Rodriguez established the Royal Chicano Air Force Band, an ensemble performing a variety of genres from cumbias to blues. The RCAF Band featured lead singer Gloria Rangel who was later joined by her sister Irma "Cui Cui" Rangel. The band performed throughout Northern and Central California.  The effort was successful in crystallizing the sounds of the barrio and taking the message of the RCAF to the people.  Freddie's RCAF Band created, wrote, and performed a Chicano rock opera "Xicindio" in 1980 at the Sacramento Community Theatre for a national conference of bilingual educators that was later aired on PBS.  The band eventually broke up with Freddie Rodriguez remaining in Sacramento where illness took his life. Gloria Rangel also died shortly after the band broke up but had returned to Los Angeles. Irma Rangel continues to perform and record under her name. Others, most notably Jose Montoya and Esteban Villa continued to play corridos and ballads playing their guitars. With the arrival of maestro Rudy Carrillo, the quality of performance grew and original music was composed leading to the establishment of El Trio Casindio—a four or more sized ensemble. An album was recorded and released entitled "All Day Music". More on this below.

===Joe Serna===
Another important alliance came with the work of Joe Serna, Jr.  Joe and his family had returned to Sacramento in 1968 from service in the Peace Corps in the mountains of Guatemala. His interest in political change was in his core. He had been a child in a farmworker family and his commitment to work with Cesar Chavez and the United Farmworkers came early. He joined with the RCAF to further that work. The RCAF embraced Joe and soon thereafter worked with him to carry out the work of organizing and engaging in local political campaigns leading to the election of the first Mexican American to the City Council in a century. Joe Serna taught political courses at CSUS and eventually worked for the Lieutenant Governor, Mervyn Dymally before he embarked on his own political career. He ran for and became a Sacramento city councilman. Later he became the mayor of Sacramento until his death by cancer in November, 1999. His wife, Isabel Hernandez, also an ardent member of the RCAF circle since the 1970s died a year after Joe from cancer as well.

===Impact===
Members of the RCAF have worked as educators in all levels of education: elementary, high school, community college and university; they have taught in prisons, youth correctional facilities, neighborhood community centers and cultural facilities. They have served as artists in residence for the [[Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission]] (SMAC) and the [[California Arts Council]]. They have served as board members and trustees of many arts organizations including La Raza Galeria Posada, the SMAC, the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]], the [[Western States Arts Federation]], the [[Concilio de Arte Popular]] and the [[Commission to Study the Potential Creation of the National Museum of the American Latino]].&lt;ref name=cac&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110928055443/http://www.cac.ca.gov/artsnews/featuredetail.php?id=128 The Royal Chicano Air Force]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two special major collections of RCAF posters have been donated by Ricardo Favela to the CSU Sacramento Archives and Special Collections Department and to CSU San Jose. These Favela collections will provide academics, researchers and community members a valuable visual art resource for the future. The majority of their other posters, photographs, personal papers and organizational materials have been donated by Favela and various members of the RCAF to the California Ethnic and Multicultural Archives at the Donald Davidson Library at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Colección Tloque Nahuaque.

==Promotional activities==
The RCAF began operating out of the Washington Neighborhood Center and frequently held events at Sacramento's Southside Park. To fund their activities and to support the farmworkers, they held dances, performances, and other fundraisers, for which they created promotional posters that visually incorporated the themes of the [[Chicano Movement]]. They also received funding support from the Washington Neighborhood Center and [[California State University, Sacramento]].

The RCAF painted murals throughout Sacramento, as well as several in [[San Diego, California|San Diego's]] [[Chicano Park]] and one in [[Burley, Idaho]]. [[Community art]] workshops included the Barrio Art Program and the Anciano Art Project, for children and the elderly, respectively. For high school and college students, there were workshops in silkscreening and muralism.

The members of the RCAF did not restrict their activities to the arts. Inspired by the [[Free Breakfast for Children|free breakfast]] programs of the [[Black Panther Party]], they and other activists such as Jennie Baca and Rosemary Rasul implemented the Breakfast for Niños program for impoverished schoolchildren in the Sacramento area. Members of the RCAF also established a book store that would become La Raza Bookstore that would eventually be known as La Raza Galeria Posada still operating in Sacramento. The RCAF, under the directorship of Gilbert Gamino, ran an automotive repair cooperative called ''Aeronaves de [[Aztlán]]''.

==Cultural activities==
The RCAF organized cultural activities such as a yearly [[poetry reading]]s called "Flor y Canto", and revived [[indigenous Mexican]] practices such as celebrations of harvest ("Fiesta de Maíz") and the rainy season ("Fiesta de [[Tlaloc]]"). Tere Romo, who worked with the RCAF to re-establish the [[Día de los Muertos]] celebration in Sacramento in 1975, said that they had "an Indigenous ceremony with dance offerings, along with a [[Catholic mass]], because there were a lot of older, traditional people there, and it's a holy day of obligation for [[Catholics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Day of the Dead in the USA: the migration and transformation of a cultural Phenomenon | last = Marchi | first = Regina | year = 2009 | publisher = Rutgers University Press | isbn = 978-0-8135-4558-5}}  {{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NZgIdQeVcS8C&amp; | title = available on Google Books | accessdate = 13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They soon established the Centro de Artistas Chicanos, a workshop for the production of posters for community events. There, thousands of posters were created over the years. Out of all this activity came the music of the Royal Chicano Air Force Band established by Freddie Rodriguez and featured the vocals of Gloria Rangel and Irma Rangel. Eventually, Esteban and Jose established the Trio Casindio under the strong mentorship of Rudy Carrillo. Their first recording, All Day Music, was released in 1985.

In 1995, Steve LaRosa and [[KVIE-TV]], a public television station in Sacramento produced a film on the RCAF. Entitled, "Pilots of Aztlán: The Flights of the RCAF", the film has been shown annually throughout the region. In 2008, KVIE produced a follow up DVD entitled, "The RCAF Flies Again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kvie.org/programs/kvie/viewfinder/rcaf_flies_again/default.htm | title = Pilots of Aztlán: The RCAF Flies Again | publisher = KVIE-TV | accessdate = 13 August 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927122101/http://www.kvie.org/programs/kvie/viewfinder/rcaf_flies_again/default.htm | archivedate = 27 September 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2007, La Galeria de La Raza, San Francisco honored Juan Carrillo with the Premio Galeria for his contributions to the Latino arts community. In 2010, the RCAF was honored by the National Association of Latino Arts and Culture (NALAC) for Lifetime Achievements at its national conference in San Jose, Ca. In May, 2011, [[José Montoya]] was honored at a Sacramento concert at César Chávez Plaza as one of the "Fathers" of the Chicano Art Movement.

==Recent events==
The collective continues to operate presenting group and individual art exhibits while Villa and Montoya have added recordings to their repertoire. Recent exhibits of the RCAF members occurred at CSU Sacramento Library Gallery, 2007, Arte Americas in Fresno, 2008 and The Sacramento Central Library, 2009, the Brickhouse Gallery, La Raza Galeria Posada, Luna's Cafe and the Washington Neighborhood Center, all in Sacramento. Following his 2007 "heartaches &amp; Jalapenos" CD release of original songs, Esteban Villa released his second CD of original music in 2010 entitled ''Habanero Honey''.  In June 2013 Villa's third CD, "Holy Mole!" was released.

Prior to his death in 2009, Armando Cid was commissioned to restore his murals at the Washington Square Apartments. His family saw to it that the project was completed and installed. The unveiling took place in August, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacramento365.com/event/detail/440860165/Unveiling_of_Public_Art_Mural_by_Armando_Cid|title=Unveiling of Public Art Mural by Armando Cid|publisher=Sacramento Metropolitan Arts Commission|date=August 21, 2010|accessdate=February 4, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065716/http://www.sacramento365.com/event/detail/440860165/Unveiling_of_Public_Art_Mural_by_Armando_Cid|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late summer, 2011, the RCAF members began to restore their murals located in Chicano Park, [[Barrio Logan, San Diego]]. Jose Montoya, Esteban Villa, Juanishi Orosco and Celia Hernandez were contracted as lead artists and were responsible for the work. Teams of artists including Sam Quinones, Danny Orosco, Domingo Orosco, Juan Manuel Carrillo, Carlos Lopez, Tomas Montoya, Maceo Montoya and Irma Lerma-Barbosa participated in the work. The City of Sacramento has begun negotiations with RCAF members to restore the ?Metamorphosis" mural on the city parking lot at 4th and L Streets. Stan Padilla, Esteban Villa and Juanishi Orosco will lead these efforts. To promote the forthcoming restoration, the City of Sacramento invited the three artists to exhibit their work in the Robert T. Matsui Gallery in City Hall beginning Dec 3 2014 running through Mar 3 2015. Another RCAF exhibit will occur in the Sacramento County Supervisors Chambers beginning Jan 25, 2015 and running for six months.

[[File:"Mujer Cosmica" Full pillar view.jpg|thumb|Mujer Cósmica]] Juanishi Orosco received a commission to paint "Capaces", a mural completely covering the four exterior walls at a Chicano service center in Woodburn, Oregon in the summer of 2013.

The membership of the Royal Chicano Air Force additionally organize a scholarship fund, called the RCAF Memorial Scholarship, which awards 10 Sacramento Area students (as of the fundraising drive for the 2015 scholarship) each a $500.00 boost towards their continued educational goals.  The scholarship is funded by donations from the current RCAF membership and the surrounding community, art shows, fundraisers, raffles and the like.  The group is currently contemplating an online fundraising platform to allow the scholarship to be more accessible to qualified students.

On September 25, 2013, Jose Montoya, the co-founder of the RCAF, died of a lymphoma on his aorta. He was 81.&lt;ref name=montoya&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/10/13/5817061/an-appreciation-jose-montoyas.html |title=An appreciation: Jose Montoya’s legacy of art and activism remembered|author=Richard Montoya|publisher=Sacramento Bee|date=October 13, 2013|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Read the article from the Sacramento Bee for a greater scope of his life and contributions. Jose was a "Respected Elder" of D.Q.U., and proud of his Indigenous blood.

Sam Quiñones died of a heart attack early Friday morning, October 3, 2014 in Sacramento, CA.  He was born in San Andreas, Calaveras County, CA. He attended CSU Sacramento and graduated with a degree in Communication Studies. He was an electrician and owned his own business. His contribution to the arts was through his decades of photographing and video taping arts and culture activities of the RCAF and other artists. He leaves his partner, Lucy Rhodes Montoya and a daughter from a previous marriage.

Four days after Sam Quiñones died, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2014,  Juan Cervantes died from complications arising from a quadruple bypass. He fought for over two weeks after his surgery, but his body ran out of the energy to survive. His life was about making art and teaching. He was a printmaker, a painter and a muralist. Raised in Roseville, CA, he went on to study artmaking at Sierra College and CSU Sacramento. He worked in the CA prison system for many years (as had many RCAF artists) before his work with high school and middle school students in Elk Grove. He is survived by three adult children. His early silkscreen posters are part of the Favela Collection at CSU Sacramento and CSU San Jose archives. His contribution to the RCAF mural in Southside Park, Sacramento, remains for all to enjoy.

'''Rustin Spencer "Rust" Cohle''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[True Detective (season 1)|first season]] of the [[anthology series|anthology]] [[crime drama]] television series ''[[True Detective]]'' on [[HBO]]. He was created by series creator [[Nic Pizzolatto]] and is portrayed by [[Matthew McConaughey]]. Cohle works as a detective for the Louisiana State Homicide Unit, alongside his partner Martin "Marty" Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]). The season follows Cohle and Hart's hunt for a [[serial killer]] in Louisiana, across 17 years.

Both the character of Rust Cohle and Matthew McConaughey's performance have received critical acclaim. McConaughey won the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series]], and was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alice|last=Vincent|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10677470/True-Detective-Matthew-McConaughey-wrote-a-450-page-deconstruction-of-Rust-Cohles-life.html|title=''True Detective'': Matthew McConaughey wrote a 450-page deconstruction of Rust Cohle's life|work= ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|location=London, England|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
Cohle is introduced as a gifted, but deeply troubled, detective from [[Texas]] who is transferred from working on regional drug task force to the [[Louisiana]] State Police near the end of 1994. After three months with the LSP, in January 1995, he and his partner are tasked with investigating a series of brutal, bizarre murders. A haunted, solitary [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], Cohle believes that life is meaningless, human beings are merely "sentient meat", and hope is self-delusion.&lt;ref name="The Long Bright Dark"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Long Bright Dark|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep1|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= January 12, 2014|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohle spends his free time obsessing over every detail of the crime, hoarding evidence in a storage locker and keeping extensive notes in a ledger, which earns him the derisive nickname "The Taxman" among his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Seeing Things|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep2|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= January 19, 2014|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series gradually reveals Cohle's backstory. He was born in [[South Texas]] but raised in [[Alaska]] by his father after his parents divorced. He became a police detective in his 20s. Years before the main story arc, his two-year-old daughter, Sophia, was killed in a car accident, a tragedy that destroyed his marriage. Devastated by the loss, Cohle grew ever more unstable and unpredictable in his work, eventually killing a [[crystal meth]] addict who had injected his own child with the drug. His superiors offered him a chance to avoid prison by working as an undercover narcotics detective, which he did for four years; Cohle notes that this was twice as long as most undercover detectives are kept in rotation. During this assignment, Cohle became addicted to drugs, and eventually killed three cartel members in a shootout, while being shot multiple times himself.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things"/&gt;

During his recovery, he was committed to a mental hospital in [[Lubbock, Texas]]. Upon his release, he was offered retirement with full pension, but he declined that offer in favor of transferring to a homicide division. His superiors then transferred him to Louisiana. In Louisiana, he lives alone and has no friends, living only for his work. He tries to remain sober, but he occasionally falls off the wagon because of the stress of his job and his grief for his daughter. Cohle also has [[synesthesia]] and suffers from [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] from his drug-using years as an undercover cop.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things" /&gt;

The series takes place in two time periods: 1995–2002, in which Cohle and Hart work together to find the killer; and 2012, when Cohle, who has by now quit the police force and become an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], submits to an interview with Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough ([[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]]) and Thomas Papania ([[Tory Kittles]]) regarding the murders. Cohle sees through the detectives, and realizes that they think he is the killer.&lt;ref name="The Locked Room"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Locked Room|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep3|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=January 26, 2014|season=1|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character arc==
Cohle and Hart are assigned to investigate a murder in which the killer [[rape]]d and [[torture]]d the victim, Dora Lange, and attached a pair of antlers to her head after killing her.&lt;ref name="The Long Bright Dark" /&gt; They find Lange's diary, which contains repeated references to "[[Carcosa]]" and a "Yellow King". In the wreckage of a burnt-out church Lange attended, they find a wall painting depicting a human figure wearing deer antlers.&lt;ref name="Seeing Things" /&gt;

Cohle and Hart work the case for three months, during which they trace the murder to Reggie Ledoux ([[Charles Halford]]), a former cellmate of Lange's ex-husband.&lt;ref name="The Locked Room" /&gt; To find more information, Cohle infiltrates a biker gang with ties to Ledoux, posing as a drug dealer representing a cartel in Mexico. He assists the gang in a home invasion so he can arrest the ringleader, Ginger ([[Joseph Sikora]]), and force him to lead them to Ledoux, who cooks meth for the biker gang. During the home invasion, a shootout ensues in which several people are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Who Goes There|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep4|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=February 9, 2014|season=1|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginger takes Cohle to meet Ledoux's cousin and "cook partner", Dewall ([[Ólafur Darri Ólafsson]]). The meeting does not go well, but Hart follows Dewall to Ledoux's [[meth lab]] and calls Cohle to tell him where it is. There, Hart and Cohle discover that Ledoux has kidnapped and tortured two children, and Hart kills Ledoux in a fit of rage as Cohle looks on. Dewall, meanwhile, is killed after he runs off and blows up on one of his own homemade mines. Cohle stages evidence to support Hart's story that Ledoux opened fire on them, forcing Hart to kill him in self-defense. The two are hailed as heroes, and receive commendations and promotions.&lt;ref name="The Secret Fate of All Life"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Secret Fate of All Life|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep5|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= February 16, 2014|season=1|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Cohle interrogates a suspect who reveals that Ledoux and Dewall did not act alone.&lt;ref name="The Secret Fate of All Life" /&gt; He tells Cohle that he will give them information about the "Yellow King" in return for a plea deal. Cohle wants to investigate this lead further, but the suspect kills himself in his cell that night, after receiving a phone call. Cohle becomes obsessed with reopening the case, and pursues several leads, including a private Christian school run by Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle ([[Jay O. Sanders]]) that had been closed amid rumors of [[child molestation]]. Tuttle complains to Cohle's superiors, who suspend Cohle without pay and order him to leave the case closed. That night, Hart's wife Maggie ([[Michelle Monaghan]]) shows up at Cohle's apartment and seduces him in order to get back at Hart for repeatedly cheating on her. Hart finds out and gets into a fistfight with Cohle in front of the entire department. Cohle quits the force the same day, and becomes a drifter and an alcoholic, supporting himself as a part-time bartender.&lt;ref name="Haunted Houses"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Haunted Houses|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep6|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= February 23, 2014|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rust Cohle 2012.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cohle in 2012]]
In 2012, murders similar to those from 1995 begin again, Cohle is seen in the vicinity of the body, arousing the suspicion of Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania. They believe that Cohle was the killer in 1995, because he led Hart to every lead they had and seemed to know everything about the killer's frame of mind. Gilbough and Papania now believe that Cohle is committing the new murders as well. They interview Cohle and Hart, who both refuse to cooperate once the purpose of the interview becomes clear.&lt;ref name="Haunted Houses" /&gt;

Cohle meets with Hart and tells him that he has found evidence leading to the killer. Hart is skeptical, and still resentful of Cohle for having sex with Maggie, but Cohle convinces him to help with the investigation by showing him a videotape he stole from Rev. Tuttle's home. The video is over 20 years old, and shows numerous masked men raping and torturing Marie Fontenot, a missing child whose name had come up in their investigation 17 years earlier. Cohle and Hart track down the original case's chief investigating officer, Steve Geraci ([[Michael Harney]]), and interrogate him at gunpoint. Geraci tells them that his superior, the late Sheriff Ted Childress, ordered him to halt the investigation; Childress was one of Tuttle's relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=After You've Gone|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep7|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate=March 2, 2014|season=1|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They soon discover that the Tuttle and Childress families — to whom both Reggie and Dewall Ledoux belong — are related, and have long histories of child abuse and murder. They ultimately discover that the killer is a Childress, and go to the late sheriff's home to investigate.&lt;ref name="Form and Void"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Form and Void|episodelink=True Detective (season 1)#ep8|series=True Detective (TV series)|serieslink=True Detective (TV series)|network=HBO|airdate= March 9, 2014|season=1|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohle and Hart go to the Childress house, where they find that the sheriff's son, Errol ([[Glenn Fleshler]]), is the killer, and discover the remains of his father tied up in a shed. They also encounter Betty Childress ([[Ann Dowd]]), his mentally disabled half-sister, with whom he is having an [[incest]]uous relationship. Cohle pursues Childress into the catacombs behind the house, which Childress identifies as Carcosa. Cohle discovers an idol draped in yellow and covered in skulls — the "Yellow King" — and has a hallucination of a spiraling vortex, the same vortex that had been drawn on many of the victims over the past 17 years. Childress stabs Cohle in the gut and also attacks Hart, but Cohle saves his partner by shooting Childress in the head, killing him. Gilborough and Papania, whom Hart had called, arrive at the scene. With the evidence Hart and Cohle collected, they connect Childress to dozens of murders, including Dora Lange's.&lt;ref name="Form and Void" /&gt;

Cohle falls into a coma, during which he feels the loving presence of his father and daughter. He later wakes up in hospital and leaves with Hart, and tells him that, "Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning."&lt;ref name="Form and Void" /&gt;

'''''Saint Matthew and the Angel''''' (1602) is a painting from the Italian master [[Caravaggio]] (1571&amp;ndash;1610), completed for the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in the church of [[San Luigi dei Francesi]] in [[Rome]]. It was destroyed in 1945 and is now known only from black-and-white photographs and enhanced color reproductions.

==Style==
Caravaggio was known for painting very realistically, using models instead of standard convention and idealization.&lt;ref&gt;Spear, “Caravaggio,” 141.&lt;/ref&gt;  He made his figures lifelike and relatable, as opposed to portraying unrealistic or phony poses. In this instance, however, the patrons wanted an idealization of the beloved Saint, someone who its viewers could admire and strain to be like. They did not want a bumbling peasant who looked as if he just walked in off the street. With the [[angel]] sweeping down and the Saint’s stool teetering in movement, it is arguably one of Caravaggio’s earliest examples of his dynamic style.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, “Expressive Aspects of Caravaggio,” 642.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a much more exciting composition than the first. Even though Caravaggio changed the composition to suit the desires of the patron, you can still see his own style under the more refined subject of [[Saint Matthew]].

==History==
Saint Matthew and the Angel was completed in 1602. A part of the collection of the former [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]], it was destroyed by fire at the end of [[World War II]] while stored in an anti-aircraft bunker in Berlin. This work, by a pillar of the [[Baroque]] movement, might have provided new information about the artist and patron. Reproductions of the original still survive.

==Commission==
''Saint Matthew and the Angel'' was created  as a commission for the Contarelli Chapel. Caravaggio was previously commissioned to paint two scenes of the saint’s life, and after the patrons were satisfied with them, a third was commissioned. 

The Contarelli Chapel was [[Dedication|dedicated]] to Saint Matthew. With funds left for its building left in 1585, it was completed in 1600. Cardinal Del Monte played a major part in orchestrating the decoration of its interior, and was the one who suggested Caravaggio as the painter of the scenes of Saint Matthew’s life. The altar was to be composed of two Caravaggio paintings as well as a statue of the saint by Flemish artist [[Jacob Cobaert]].&lt;ref&gt;Hess, “Contarelli Chapel,” 197.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the church was not pleased with the statue and Caravaggio was re-hired to do another piece as the center for the altar, to show Saint Matthew writing the [[Gospel of St Matthew|Gospel]] under the guidance of an angel. Caravaggio depicted the Saint as an unlearned peasant, gaping in the presence of the angel. The church rejected Caravaggio's irreverent presentation of the saint, and Caravaggio replaced it with a more glorifying image, ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]'', which remains in the Chapel today.

==Comparison==
The comparison is not perfect because the only images available of the lost ''Saint Matthew and the Angel'' are black and white  photographs that were taken before World War II.  The lost painting showed Saint Matthew as poorly groomed, with dirty feet. Although this was the style of Caravaggio, the church leaders thought it was too crude and did not want to have what looked like a peasant hanging in their sacred altarpiece. In addition, they thought that this Matthew did not match the other two paintings that Caravaggio had already done. It was apparently disconnected and therefore had no place with the others. The second piece keeps true to the same subject, but with a few changes. Matthew looks more like the other two Matthews in the altar. The Saint is now more serious and in control in the presence of the angel. Instead of being fully controlled by the angel, Saint Matthew is only encouraged by the angel in the second one. He is working more on his own accord.

==Synopsis==
{{Main article|List of Scarlet Heart episodes}}
Zhang Xiao ([[Cecilia Liu]]), a young woman from the 21st century, suffers a near-fatal accident that sends her back in time to the [[Qing Dynasty]] during the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s ([[Damian Lau]]) reign. She finds herself trapped in the body of one of her previous incarnations: Ma'ertai Ruoxi, the teenage daughter of a [[Manchu people|Manchu]] general. In this new timeline, she has an elder sister, Ruolan ([[Annie Liu]]), who is a concubine of the Kangxi Emperor's eighth son, [[Yunsi|Yinsi]] ([[Kevin Cheng]]). Ruoxi initially tries to return to the future, but she soon adjusts to life in this era. She meets some of Kangxi's other sons, including the fourth prince [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yinzhen]] ([[Nicky Wu]]), tenth prince [[Yin'e]] (Ye Zuxin) who falls in love with her, and fourteenth prince [[Yunti, Prince Xun|Yinti]] ([[Lin Gengxin]]). She also forges a close friendship with the thirteenth prince, [[Yinxiang, Prince Yi|Yinxiang]] ([[Yuan Hong (actor)|Yuan Hong]]).

Ruoxi attracts the attention of the emperor with rumors of her brashness and bravery, and manages to charm him with her intelligence and wit. Later, at the imperial palace's "beauty draft" (during which concubines and wives are chosen for the princes or the emperor himself), conflicting arrangements are made by Yinsi and his first wife, Gogoro Minghui (Shi Xiaoqun), leading to Ruoxi being drafted into the service of the dowager empress to keep the peace. Ruoxi is given an appointment as a servant to the emperor himself, specifically to prepare and serve tea to him and those he hosts.

During Ruoxi's stay in Yinsi's house, Yinsi falls in love with her. She initially rejects him but eventually returns his feelings, and later agrees to marry him if he gives up competing for the succession to the throne. This is because Ruoxi's knowledge of history makes her aware that Yinsi's ambition will ultimately lead to his death in prison after Yinzhen becomes emperor. However, Yinsi refuses to and thus Ruoxi breaks up with him. Before leaving, Ruoxi warns Yinsi of Yinzhen's plans to usurp the throne and came up with solutions for him to prevent being taken down by Yinzhen.

Ruoxi then started to get closer to Yinzhen, and their interactions changed her unfavorable opinion of him, and she unwittingly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Yinsi and his supporters, acting on Ruoxi's advice, frame Yinzhen for plotting against the crown prince [[Yinreng]] (Zhang Lei). Yinxiang steps forward to take responsibility and is ultimately sentenced to house arrest. After this incident, Yinsi realizes that Ruoxi is now romantically involved with Yinzhen. Yinreng is deposed after his criminal ways are exposed and is imprisoned for life. Kangxi then begins showing preference for Yinti and offers Ruoxi as a concubine to him. However, Ruoxi boldly defies the emperor's order, and as a penalty, she is demoted to the laundry department.

Ruoxi works within the laundry department for a number of years, and is offered some level of protection and special treatment by ways of the princes. Kangxi falls ill during this time, and when Ruoxi is brought back to the emperor's service by Eunuch Wang to prepare pastries and help stimulate Kangxi's appetite, he pardons her and restores her to her former role as his lead tea server.

Kangxi eventually dies of his illness, and with military support from [[Longkodo]] (Zhao Jialin) and [[Nian Gengyao]] (Xing Hanqing), Yinzhen falsely claims that Kangxi named him the successor, effectively staging a coup and taking the throne from Yinti to become the [[Yongzheng Emperor]]. Yinzhen then releases Yinxiang from custody and moves Ruoxi into his quarters, eventually consummating their relationship. He does not, however, marry her, as he wants to be able to live with her and see her every day—wives and concubines have their own estates between which the emperor must divide his time. Ruoxi is pleased enough with this arrangement, as she has always been reticent about marriage and enjoys seeing Yinzhen daily as well. Ruoxi's happiness, however, is marred by Yinzhen's paranoia and his ruthless persecution of Yinsi and his followers. She is often caught between the rivaling factions of Yinzhen and Yinsi.

When Gogoro Minghui tells Ruoxi that Yinsi acted against Yinzhen years ago because of her advice based on the knowledge of the future, she is shocked, and her despair causes her to miscarry Yinzhen's child and is unable to conceive again. Enraged, Yinzhen blames Yinsi and his wife, issuing an edict forcing them to divorce, which leads her to commit suicide. Ruoxi fears Yinzhen's punitive actions against his brothers and confesses the truth to him and Yinxiang. Yinzhen is stunned when he understands why Yinsi plotted against him and starts treating Ruoxi coldly. Ruoxi is unable to withstand the mental stress and asks Yinti to help her leave the palace. Yinsi knows that Yinzhen will not allow Ruoxi to leave and decides to intervene. He discloses details of his past romance with Ruoxi, and an angered Yinzhen eventually agrees to let Ruoxi and Yinti leave the [[Forbidden City]].

Despite Yinti's excellent care, Ruoxi's emotional anguish deeply affects her health, and she begs him to send a letter to Yinzhen, requesting to see the emperor one last time before she dies. However, a misunderstanding between Yinzhen and Yinti causes the letter to be thrown aside unread. Ruoxi struggles to stay alive, but after three days, she concludes that Yinzhen's absence confirms that his love for her has ended, and she dies. When news of Ruoxi's death reaches Yinzhen, he rushes to Yinti's house, regretting his actions after learning that Ruoxi still loved him.

In the later years, Yinsi and Yintang (Han Dong) were imprisoned as Yinzhen blames them for everything that happened. Yinxiang went to visit them in prison and hands them poison, which was Ruoxi's request to him before she left the palace. Both Princes commit suicide and end their suffering. Yinxiang dies a few years later, followed shortly by Yinzhen himself, whose 12-year reign as Emperor was the shortest in Qing history. Yinti lives on but does not find another wife. Only Yin'e has a happy ending with his wife ([[Liu Yuxin]]) that he grew to love, watching [[Qianlong Emperor]] ascend the throne.

Back in 2011, Zhang Xiao regains consciousness in a hospital and is informed that she had been in a coma for weeks. She wonders if her experiences in the past were real or imaginary. After recovering, Zhang researches the Qing Dynasty era, only to find that history remains on its proper course, and there are no records on Ma'ertai Ruoxi.  However, she later visits a museum where she recognizes some Qing Dynasty-era artifacts and sees a woman in a Kangxi Emperor portrait that resembles her. Meanwhile, a man who bears a striking resemblance to Yinzhen visits the exhibition and encounters Zhang Xiao but does not recognize her. The show ends with a cliffhanger of the man walking away as Zhang Xiao's tears start to fall.

==Deviations from the novel==
[[File:Scarlet Heart's ending.jpg|200px|thumb|Zhang Xiao returns to the 21st century.]]
The show's producers have announced that the series will remain mostly faithful to ''[[Bu Bu Jing Xin]]'', the novel by Tong Hua on which it is based. However, there are some differences:

*In the novel's beginning, though in the television series Zhang Xiao remains a 25-year-old white-collar worker — her alter ego, Ma'ertai Ruoxi, was 13 years old, not 16. Another difference was that Zhang supposedly from the year 2005, not 2011.
*In the novel, Ruoxi is unable to return to her own time and ultimately succumbs to her illness, while [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yinzhen]] dies ten years later amid hopes of reuniting with Ruoxi after death.

'''''The Rape of Europa''''' is a painting by the Italian artist [[Titian]], painted ca. 1560-1562. It hangs in the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The oil-on-canvas painting measures {{convert|178|x|205|cm}}.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gardnermuseum.org/collection/artwork/3rd_floor/titian_room/europa | title=Europa | publisher=Isabells Stewart Gardner Museum | accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The title of the painting refers to the mythological story of the abduction of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] by [[Zeus]] ([[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] to the Romans),&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt;  Titian is unequivocal about the fact that this is a scene of rape (abduction): Europa is sprawled helplessly on her back, her clothes in disarray.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Campbell, "Europa," in Eye of the Beholder, edited by Alan Chong et al. (Boston: ISGM and Beacon Press, 2003): 103-107.&lt;/ref&gt; In the myth, the god assumed the form of a bull and enticed Europa to climb onto his back.  Once there, the bull rode into the sea and carried her to [[Crete]], where he revealed his real identity.  Europa became the first Queen of Crete, and had three children with Zeus. The painting depicts  Europa on the back of the bull, just off the shore of her homeland.

==Provenance==
The painting was one of the "''poesie''" painted by Titian for [[Philip II of Spain]].  With [[Diana and Callisto (Titian)|''Diana and Callisto'']] and [[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']], both now shared by London and Edinburgh, it was one of three Titian ''poesies'' given by [[Philip V of Spain]] to the French ambassador, the [[Antoine Charles IV de Gramont|Duke of Gramont]], who in turn presented them to [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], Regent of France from 1715–1723.&lt;ref&gt;Brigstocke, Hugh; ''Italian and Spanish Paintings in the National Gallery of Scotland'', p. 183, 2nd Edn, 1993, National Galleries of Scotland, {{ISBN|0-903598-22-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the 18th century it was in the [[Orleans Collection]] in Paris.  It was purchased by [[Bernard Berenson]] on behalf of art collector [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saltzman|first=Cynthia|title=Old Masters, New World: America's Raid on Europe's Great Pictures, 1880-World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8FQzgAL_aUC&amp;pg=PA77|year=2008|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-01831-4|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3310">'''The Sparrow's Lost Bean''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: चखुंचायागु तंगु कयगू, Chakhunchāyāgu Tangu Kaygu) is a Nepalese folk tale that ranks among the most popular children's stories told among the [[Newar]]s of [[Nepal Mandala]].&lt;ref&gt;Kansakar, Prem Bahadur (1966). ''Nyakan Bakhan.'' Kathmandu: Himanchal Pustak Bhavan. Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The story==
Once upon a time, there was a sparrow who was very neat and clean. Its nest was spotless and it always washed up before eating. One morning, the sparrow found a bean and was overjoyed that it didn't have to search the neighborhood for food. As was its habit, it went down to the river to wash up after putting the bean away safely on the bridge.
 
When the sparrow returned expecting to eat a fine breakfast, alas, the bean was nowhere to be found. As it was looking everywhere for its food, it saw a carpenter walking up the bridge. The sparrow went up to the carpenter and said, "I have lost my bean. Please help me find it." "Who's going to listen to you?" said the carpenter and continued on his way. 

Just then the sparrow saw a soldier walking up the bridge. It pleaded with him to help find the bean, but the soldier too was uncooperative. "Who's going to help a sparrow?" he said and walked away. Then a captain came up the bridge, but he wouldn't help the sparrow either. And then a minister, but no help from him too. He just laughed and kept walking.

The hungry sparrow became desperate. Then the king came riding on an elephant. The sparrow was certain that it would get justice from the most powerful person in the country. But the king pretended not to hear the sparrow's pleas and said nothing. As the sparrow sat there dejected, an ant came up and asked, "What's the matter? Didn't you see the king pass by?" The sparrow then told the ant how everybody from the carpenter to the king had ignored its appeals to help it find the lost bean.

"Don't worry," said the ant. "We will find the bean somehow." The ant then crawled up to the elephant's ear and said, "Tell the king to find the sparrow's bean or I will go inside your ear and bite you." The terrified elephant turned to the king and said, "You better help the sparrow, oh king, or I will throw you off my back." 

The king was startled. He immediately summoned the minister and ordered, "Help the sparrow or you are fired." The minister called the captain right away and said, "Do whatever the sparrow says or you are in trouble." The captain then called the soldier and gave him explicit orders. The soldier, in turn, found the carpenter and told him, "Find the sparrow's bean or I will hang you from this bridge itself." The carpenter searched for half a day and finally found the lost bean, and the sparrow had a satisfying breakfast that day.

==Publications==
"The Sparrow's Lost Bean" was featured in an anthology of folk tales in [[Nepal Bhasa]] published in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Kansakar, Prem Bahadur (1966). ''Nyakan Bakhan.'' Kathmandu: Himanchal Pustak Bhavan. Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt; A comic book was published by Rajman in 1991. &lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Raj (1991). ''Chakhunchiyā Tangu Kaygu.'' Kathmandu: Rajman.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Vermeer van Delft - The Glass of Wine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|''The Wine Glass'', 66.3 x 76.5 cm, 1660. [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]

'''''The Wine Glass''''' (also '''''The Glass of Wine''''' or '''''Lady and Gentleman Drinking Wine''''', {{lang-nl|'''Het glas wijn'''}}) is a 1660 painting by [[Johannes Vermeer]] now in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. It portrays a seated woman and a standing man drinking in an interior setting. The work contains the conventions of [[genre painting]] of the [[Delft School (painting)|Delft School]] developed by [[Pieter de Hooch]] in the late 1650s. It contains figures situated in a brightly lit and spacious interior, while its architectural space is highly defined. The figures are set in the middle ground, rather than positioned in the foreground.&lt;ref name="wheel68"&gt;Wheelock, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==
[[File:Pieter de Hooch 012.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Pieter de Hooch]], ''A Dutch Courtyard'', circa 1657]]
Vermeer was about 27 when he painted ''The Glass of Wine'', and according to the critic Walter Liedtke, "No analysis of artistic conventions can suggest the sheer beauty and extraordinary refinement of a painting like The Glass of Wine, which may be considered one of Vermeer's first fully mature works".&lt;ref&gt;Liedtke, 376-378&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of figures drinking around a table, and the portrayal of a woman drinking from a glass are taken directly from De Hooch's ''[[A Dutch Courtyard]]''. However, Vermeer's work breaks away from the prototypes of De Hooch in that the interior is rendered in a far more elegant and higher-class setting than the older master's works. The clothes of the figures, the patterned tablecloth, the gilded picture frame hanging on the back wall, and the coat of arms in the stained window glass all suggest a wealthier setting.&lt;ref name="wheel68" /&gt;
[[File:Jan Vermeer van Delft 006.jpg|thumb|Johannes Vermeer, ''[[The Girl with the Wine Glass]]'' (1659–1660)]]

The scene likely represents some type of courtship, but the roles being played by the two figures are not clear.&lt;ref name=essential&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glass of Wine|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/catalogue/glass_of_wine.html|work=essential vermeer.com|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;{{cite web | title =Vermeer's The Glass of Wine | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/vermeer-the-glass-of-wine.html | accessdate =January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman has just drained the glass of wine and the man seems impatient to pour her more, almost as if he is trying to get her drunk.  A musical instrument, the [[cittern]], lies on the chair with musical notebooks.&lt;ref name=essential/&gt; But the figure of Temperance is depicted in the stained glass window, adding to the tension in the scene.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;

Compared to his earlier paintings, Vermeer's brushwork in ''The Wine Glass'' is subdued, while the faces and clothes of the figures are depicted with wide smooth outlines. Only in the tapestry of the tablecloth and the window glass did the artist apply finely detailed, linear brush strokes. At the time Vermeer was not the only Dutch artist attempting to develop the ideas of De Hooch; contemporary paintings from [[Jan Steen]], [[Gerard Ter Borch]], and [[Frans van Mieris the Elder]] also display a refined technique.

The painting shares elements with other Vermeer works. ''The Girl with the Wine Glass'' (1659–1660)  portrays two men, but in common with ''The Wine Glass'' it has a woman seated at a table with a glass of wine, and the tiled floors and stained-glass windows in both are very similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vermeer: Reception and Interpretation. (Book Review)| author = Konowitz, Ellen | journal=Sixteenth Century Journal |volume=29|issue=3|date=Autumn 1998|pages=817–819|doi=10.2307/2543706|last2=Hertel|first2=Christiane|jstor=2543706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same wine pitcher appears in an earlier Vermeer, ''[[A Girl Asleep (Vermeer)|A Girl Asleep]]'' (1657).

''The Wine Glass'' is a transitional work, and as such, is not commonly viewed as one of Vermeer's finest. According to art critic [[Lawrence Gowing]], comparing the work with [[Gabriel Metsu|Gabriel Metsu's]] ''The Duet'', it "lacks the sociable fluency, the ingratiating inventiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Cite web |url=http://essentialvermeer.20m.com/catalogue/glass_of_wine.htm |title=The Glass of Wine |publisher=essentialvermeer.com|accessdate=12 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104022347/http://www.essentialvermeer.com/catalogue/glass_of_wine.html |archivedate=4 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Yangzhong Puffer Fish,''''' or the "Puffer Fish Tower" is a notable 295-foot long [[bronze]] statue in the shape of the [[puffer fish]].  Weighing 2,300 tons and reportedly costing $11 million, this statue sits on the banks of the [[Yangtze River]] in the [[Jiangsu Province]] of [[China]].  Work on this project was completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/tp/hd2011/2013/09-27/250054.shtml |title=巨型"河豚"成江苏扬中新地标 造价达7000万元-中新网 |website=Chinanews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/world/asia/as-china-vows-austerity-giant-brass-fish-devours-11-million.html?hp&amp;_r=0|title=As China Vows Austerity, Giant Brass Fish Devours $11 Million|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dz.xdkb.net/html/2013-09/27/content_296963.htm |title=现代快报多媒体数字报刊平台 |website=Dz.xdkb.net |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yinka Shonibare''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (born 1962) is a British-Nigerian artist living in the United Kingdom. His work explores cultural identity, [[colonialism]] and [[post-colonialism]] within the contemporary context of [[globalisation]]. A hallmark of his art is the brightly coloured Dutch wax fabric he uses. Because he has a physical disability that paralyses one side of his body, Shonibare uses assistants to make works under his direction.

==Life and career==
Yinka Shonibare was born in [[London]] in 1962. When he was three years old, his family moved to Lagos, [[Nigeria]], where his father practised law. At 17, he returned to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to do his A-levels at [[Redrice School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yinkashonibarembe.com/biography/|title=Yinka Shonibare, MBE (RA) - Biography|website=www.yinkashonibarembe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/7739981/Fourth-Plinth-Yinka-Shonibare-interview.html |author=Martin Gayford|location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Fourth Plinth: Yinka Shonibare interview | date=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shonibare contracted [[transverse myelitis]], an inflammation of the spinal cord, at the age of 18, which resulted in a long-term [[physical disability]] where one side of his body is paralysed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/yinka-shonibare_review%20Disability%20Arts%20Online |title=a unique journal for discussion of arts and culture |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/05/art-iculating-yinka-shonibare%E2%80%99s-hope-in-hopelessness/ |title=Art-iculating Yinka Shonibare’s hope in hopelessness |author=Japhet Alakam|work=Vanguard|location= Nigeria |date=1 May 2011 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied Fine Art first at [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] (now Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design) and then at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], where he received his MFA, graduating as part of the [[Young British Artists]] generation. Following his studies, Shonibare worked as an arts development officer for [[Shape Arts]], an organization which makes arts accessible to people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ancouk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Lucy |url=http://www.a-n.co.uk/artists_talking/artists_stories/single/63550 |title=Yinka Shonibare &amp;#124; Artists' stories &amp;#124; Artists talking |work=a-n |date=10 January 2003 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosanna|first=Greenstreet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/30/yinka-shonibare-artist-interview|title=Q&amp;A: Yinka Shonibare |work=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has exhibited at the [[Venice Biennial]] and at leading museums worldwide. He was notably commissioned by [[Okwui Enwezor]] at [[documenta]] XI in 2002 to create his most recognised work ''Gallantry and Criminal Conversation'' that launched him on an international stage.

In 2004, he was shortlisted for the [[Turner Prize]] for his ''Double Dutch'' exhibition at the [[Museum Boijmans van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]] and for his solo show at the Stephen Friedman Gallery, [[London]]. Of the four nominees, he seemed to be the most popular with the general public that year.  A BBC website poll, resulted in 64% of voters stating that his work was their favourite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop |first=Tom |url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3756514.stm?dynamic_vote=ON#vote_3756514 |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Entertainment &amp;#124; Light at end of the Turner show |publisher=Newsvote.bbc.co.uk |date=19 October 2004 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shonibare became an Honorary Fellow of Goldsmiths' College in 2003, was awarded an [[MBE]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemporary-magazines.com/profile89.htm/ |title=Yinka Shonibare, MBE in conversation with Raphael Chikukwa and Michele Robecchi |publisher=''Contemporary Magazine'' |date= May 2006 |accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received an [[Honorary Doctorate]] (Fine Artist) of the [[Royal College of Art]] in 2010. He was elected Royal Academician by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/honorary-appointments/Roll%20Honorands%20as%20at%20April%202011.pdf |title=HONORARY FELLOWS OF GOLDSMITHS’ COLLEGE |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Iniva]]'s Board of trustees in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iniva.org/library/archive/people/s/shonibare_mbe_yinka |title=Yinka Shonibare MBE |publisher=Iniva |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has exhibited at the Venice Biennial and internationally at leading museums worldwide. In September 2008, his major mid-career survey commenced at the MCA Sydney and toured to the Brooklyn Museum, New York in June 2009 and the Museum of African Art at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], Washington DC in October 2009 . In 2010, ''Nelson's Ship in a Bottle'' became his first public art commission on the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|Fourth Plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blainsouthern.com/artists/yinka-shonibare-mbe |title=Blain&amp;#124;Southern &amp;#124; Artists &amp;#124; Yinka Shonibare MBE |publisher=Blainsouthern.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2016, one of Shonibare's "Wind Sculpture" pieces was installed in front of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art in Washington, DC. The painted fiberglass work, titled "Wind Sculpture VII", is the first sculpture to be permanently installed outside of the NMAA's entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/national-museum-african-art-will-be-home-new-landmark-sculpture-national-mall|title=National Museum of African Art Will Be Home to New Landmark Sculpture on the National Mall|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disability==
"I do have a physical disability and I was determined that the scope of my creativity should not be restricted purely by my physicality. It would be like an architect choosing to build only what could be physically built by hand." says Shonibare.&lt;ref name="ancouk"/&gt;
Shonibare readily acknowledges physical disability as part of his identity but creates work in which this is just one strand of a far richer weave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org/http//http//yinka_shonibare_bursary |title=Yinka Shonibare: Adam Reynolds bursary |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his disability, he is physically incapable of carrying out the making of the work himself, and relies upon a team of assistants to realise his artistic vision for him. In this context, conceptualism takes on a new angle. "That Shonibare became a conceptual artist who delegates much of the production of his labor-intensive projects to a network of other artists is partly a result of his disabling illness."&lt;ref&gt;deborah Sontag, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/arts/design/21sont.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "Headless Bodies from a Bottomless Imagination"], ''The New York Times'', 17 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shonibare's disability has increased with age; as his mobility has become further restricted with time, he has begun to use an [[electric wheelchair]]. In later life, Shonibare has become more open to discussing his disability and its role within his work as a creative artist.&lt;ref&gt;Yinka Shonibare, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/04/what-see-mirror-yinka-shonibare "What I see in the mirror"], ''The Guardian'', 4 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Shonibare was announced as patron of the annual [[Shape Arts]] "Open" exhibition where disabled and non-disabled artists are invited to submit work in response to an Open theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/news/shape-open-exhibition-patron-announced.aspx|title=Shape Open Exhibition Patron announced|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
[[File:Nelson's Ship in a Bottle by Yinka Shonibare.jpg|thumb|''Nelson's Ship in a Bottle'' by Yinka Shonibare during its occupancy of the [[Fourth Plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]]]]

Shonibare’s work explores issues of colonialism alongside those of race and class, through a range of media which include painting, sculpture, photography, installation art, and, more recently, film and performance. He examines, in particular, the construction of identity and tangled interrelationship between Africa and Europe and their respective economic and political histories. Mining Western art history and literature, he asks what constitutes our collective contemporary identity today. Having described himself as a ‘post-colonial’ hybrid, Shonibare questions the meaning of cultural and national definitions. People always took his work seriously and he said " if love someone fight for them with your hands"

A key material in Shonibare's work since 1994 is the brightly coloured "African" fabric (Dutch wax-printed cotton) that he buys himself from Brixton market in London. "But actually, the fabrics are not really authentically African the way people think," says Shonibare. "They prove to have a crossbred cultural background quite of their own. And it’s the fallacy of that signification that I like. It’s the way I view culture – it’s an artificial construct." Shonibare claims that the fabrics were first manufactured in Europe to sell in Indonesian markets and then they were sold in Africa, when they were rejected in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Downey|first=Anthony|title=Yinka Shonibare in Conversation|journal=Wasafiri|volume=19.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the main exporters of "African" fabric from Europe are based in Manchester in the UK and [[Vlisco]] Véritable Hollandais from [[Helmond]] in the Netherlands. He has these fabrics made up into European 18th-century dresses, covering sculptures of alien figures or stretched onto canvases and thickly painted over.

Shonibare's ''Trumpet Boy'', a permanent acquisition displayed at [[The Foundling Museum]], demonstrates the colorful fabric used in his works. The sculpture was created to fit the theme of 'found', reflecting on the museum's heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/found/|title=FOUND - Foundling Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; through combining new and existing work with found objects kept for their significance.

Sometimes,  he recreates famous paintings using headless dummies with the "Africanised" clothing instead of their original costumes, for example ''[[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough's]] Mr and Mrs Andrews Without Their Heads'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/giveandtake/gallery/shonibare_pics.html |title=Give &amp; Take – Artist Information |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reverend on Ice'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yinka-shonibare.co.uk/yinkashonibare-work/reverend-on-ice.html |title=Reverend on Ice |publisher=Yinka-shonibare.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (after ''The Rev Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch'' by [[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn]]) and
''The Swing (after [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]])'' (2001).
&lt;ref name="Turner Prize 2004: Yinka Shonibare"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turner Prize 2004: Yinka Shonibare|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/turner-prize-2004/turner-prize-2004-yinka-shonibare|publisher=Tate|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An added layer to the Fragonard piece is that the fabric used is printed with the ''[[Chanel]]'' logo (though it is obviously not real Chanel fabric).

Shonibare also takes carefully posed photographs and videos recreating famous British paintings or stories from literature but with himself taking centre stage as an alternative, black British dandy, e.g., ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] which he translates into ''Diary of A Victorian Dandy'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iniva.org/exhibitions_projects/1998/diary_of_a_victorian_dandy/diary_of_a_victorian_dandy |title=Diary of a Victorian Dandy |publisher=Iniva |date=29 October 1998 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Dorian Gray'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yinka-shonibare.co.uk/yinkashonibare-work/dorian-gray-detail.html |title=Dorian Gray up close |publisher=Yinka-shonibare.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Oscar Wilde]]'s novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''.

Considerably larger than a usual [[ship in a bottle]], yet much smaller than the real [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], in fact a 1:30 scale model, Shonibare's ''[[Lord Nelson|Nelson]]'s Ship in a Bottle'', was "the first commission on the Fourth Plinth to reflect specifically on the historical symbolism of Trafalgar Square, which commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, and will link directly with Nelson’s column."&lt;ref name="london1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/fourthplinth/commissions/yinka |title=Mayor of London presents Fourth Plinth &amp;#124; Yinka Shonibare MBE |publisher=London.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was placed there on 24 May 2010 and remained until 30 January 2012. Being widely admired, in 2011 the [[Art Fund]] launched a campaign and successfully raised money for the purchase and relocation of the sculpture to the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]] where it now found its new permanent home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/ship/news/2012-april/100/campaign-closes-as-permanent-new-home-secured-for-nelsons-ship-in-a-bottle |title=Campaign closes as permanent new home secured for Nelson's Ship in a Bottle! – Captain's Log – Help bring Nelson's Ship in a Bottle to Greenwich |publisher=Artfund.org |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works include printed ceramics, and cloth-covered shoes, upholstery, walls and bowls.

In October 2013 Shonibare took part in Art Wars at the [[Saatchi Gallery]] curated by [[Ben Moore (curator)|Ben Moore]]. The artist was issued with a stormtrooper helmet, which he transformed into a work of art. Proceeds went to the Missing Tom Fund set up by Ben Moore to find his brother Tom, who has been missing for more than ten years. The work was also shown on the [[Regent's Park]] platform as part of [[Art Below]] Regents Park.

== Selected artworks/exhibitions ==
Shonibare's first solo exhibition was in 1989 at [[Byam Shaw School of Art|Byam Shaw]] Gallery, London. During 2008–09, he was the subject of a major mid-career survey in both Australia and the USA; starting in September 2008 at the MCA Sydney and toured to the [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York in June 2009 and the [[National Museum of African Art|Museum of African Art]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], Washington DC in October 2009. For the 2009 Brooklyn Museum exhibition, he created a site-specific installation titled ''Mother and Father Worked Hard So I Can Play'' which was on view in several of the Museum’s period rooms. Another site-specific installation, ''Party Time—Re-Imagine America: A Centennial Commission'' was simultaneously on view at the [[Newark Museum]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], from 1 July 2009, to 3 January 2010, in the dining room of the museum’s 1885 Ballantine House.
