{{Culture of Bhutan}}
'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to [[Tibetan art]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] and its pantheon of teachers and divine beings.

The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are the [[Drukpa Lineage]] and the [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu]] school and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment).  The Nyingma school is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]] ("Guru Rinpoche"), who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century.  According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find.  [[Tertön]]s are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

Each divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.

Bhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan because the technique of making them was originally imported from that region of Tibet. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms.  Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered.  In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.

The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive "spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom" is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the “thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan”; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the [[Folk Heritage Museum]] in Thimphu. There is also a Voluntary Artists Studio in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu. The thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan and the institutions established in Thimphu to promote these art forms are:&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"&gt;Brown, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;{{Cite web|title= Bhutan:Arts &amp; Crafts|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/arts-crafts|accessdate=2010-06-07|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan:Government of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional Bhutanese arts==
[[File:Ss460-319-070-Buddha2-1.jpg|thumb|Clay statue before painting]]
[[File:Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche, 8th century) LACMA AC1994.117.2.jpg|thumb|[[Padmasambhava]] or "Guru Rinpoche", 8th century]]

In Bhutan, the traditional arts are known as ''zorig chusum'' (''zo'' = the ability to make; ''rig'' = science or craft; ''chusum'' = thirteen).  These practices have been gradually developed through the centuries, often passed down through families with long-standing relations to a particular craft.  These traditional crafts represent hundreds of years of knowledge and ability that has been passed down through generations.
 
The great 15th century tertön, [[Pema Lingpa]] is traditionally credited with introducing the arts into Bhutan. In 1680, [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]], ordered the establishment of the school for instruction in the thirteen traditional arts.  Although the skills existed much earlier, it is believed that the ''zorig chusum'' was first formally categorized during the rule of [[Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye]] (1680-1694), the 4th [[Druk Desi]] (secular ruler).  The thirteen traditional arts are:

* ''Dezo'' - Paper Making: Handmade paper made mainly from the [[Daphne (plant)|''Daphne'' plant]] and gum from a [[Combretum indicum|creeper root]]. 
* ''Dozo'' - Stonework: Stone arts used in the construction of stone pools and the outer walls of [[Dzong architecture|dzongs]], [[gompa]]s, [[stupa]]s and some other buildings.
* ''Garzo'' - Blacksmithing: The manufacture of iron goods, such as farm tools, knives, swords, and utensils. 
* ''Jinzo'' - Clay arts: The making of religious statues and ritual objects, pottery and the construction of buildings using mortar, plaster, and rammed earth. 
* ''Lhazo'' - Painting: From the images on [[thangka]]s, walls paintings, and statues to the decorations on furniture and window-frames. 
* ''Lugzo'' - Bronze casting: Production of bronze roof-crests, statues, bells, and ritual instruments, in addition to jewelry and household items using sand casting and [[lost-wax casting]].  Larger statues are made by [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]].
* ''Parzo'' - Wood, slate, and stone carving: In wood, slate or stone, for making such items as printing blocks for religious texts, masks, furniture, altars, and the slate images adorning many shrines and altars. 
* ''Shagzo'' - Woodturning: Making a variety of bowls, plates, cups, and other containers. 
* ''Shingzo'' - Woodworking: Employed in the construction of dzongs and gompas 
* ''Thagzo'' - Weaving: The production of some of the most intricately woven fabrics produced in Asia. 
* ''Trözo'' - Silver- and gold-smithing: Working in gold, silver, and copper to make jewelry, ritual objects, and utilitarian household items. 
* ''Tshazo'' - Cane and bamboo work: The production of such varied items as bows and arrows, baskets, drinks containers, utensils, musical instruments, fences, and mats. 
* ''Tshemazo'' – Needlework: Working with needle and thread to make clothes, boots, or the most intricate of [[appliqué]] thangkas.

==Characteristics of Bhutanese arts==
[[File:Bhutanese painted thanka of Milarepa (1052-1135), Late 19th-early 20th Century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, Thimphu, Bhutan.jpg|thumb|Painted [[thangka]] of [[Milarepa]] (1052-1135), late 19th-early 20th century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, [[Thimphu]].]]
Articles for everyday use are still fashioned today as they were centuries ago.  Traditional artisanship is handed down from generation to generation.  Bhutan's artisans are skilled workers in metals, wood and slate carving, and clay sculpture.  Artifacts made of wood include bowls and dishes, some lined with silver.  Elegant yet strong woven bamboo baskets, mats, hats, and quivers find both functional and decorative usage.  Handmade paper is prepared from tree bark by a process passed down the ages.

Each region has its specialties: raw silk comes from eastern Bhutan, brocade from Lhuntshi (Kurtoe), woolen goods from [[Bumthang District|Bumthang]], bamboo wares from [[Kheng, Bhutan|Kheng]], woodwork from Tashi Yangtse, gold and silver work from [[Thimphu]], and yak-hair products from the north or the [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]].

Most Bhutanese art objects are produced for use of the Bhutanese themselves.  Except for goldsmiths, silversmiths, and painters, artisans are peasants who produce these articles and fabrics in their spare time, with the surplus production being sold.  Most products, particularly fabrics, are relatively expensive.  In the highest qualities, every step of production is performed by hand, from dyeing hanks of thread or hacking down bamboo in the forest, to weaving or braiding the final product.  

The time spent in producing handicrafts is considerable and can involve as much as two years for some woven textiles.  At the same time, many modern innovations are also used for less expensive items, especially modern dyes, and yarns - Bhutan must be one of the few places where hand-woven [[polyester]] garments can be bought.

; Textiles
Bhutanese textiles are a unique art form inspired by nature made in the form of clothing, crafts and different types of pots in eye-catching blend of colour, texture, pattern and composition. This art form is witnessed all over Bhutan and in Thimphu in the daily life of its people. It is also a significant cultural exchange garment that is gifted to mark occasions of birth and death, auspicious functions such as weddings and professional achievements and in greeting dignitaries. Each region has its own special designs of textiles, either made of vegetable dyed wool known as ''yathra'' or pure silk called ''Kishuthara''. It is the women, belonging to a small community, who weave these textiles as a household handicrafts heritage.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Paintings
Most Bhutanese art, including ‘Painting in Bhutanese art’, known as ''lhazo'', is invariably religion centric. These are made by artists without inscribing their names on them. The paintings encompass various types including the traditional [[thangkas]], which are scroll paintings made in “highly stylised and strict geometric proportions” of [[Buddhist iconography]] that are made with mineral paints. Most houses in Bhutan have religious and other symbolic motifs painted inside their houses and also on the external walls.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Sculptures
The art of making religious sculptures is unique in Bhutan and hence very popular in the Himalayan region. The basic material used for making the sculptures is clay, which is known as ''jinzob''. The clay statues of Buddhist religious icons, made by well-known artists of Bhutan, embellish various monasteries in Bhutan. This art form of sculpture is taught to students by professional artists at the Institute of Zorig Chosum in Thimphu.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Paper making
Handmade paper known as ''deysho'' is in popular usage in Bhutan and it is durable and insect resistant. The basic material used is the bark of the [[Daphne plant]]. This paper is used for printing religious texts; traditional books are printed on this paper. It is also used for packaging gifts. Apart from handmade paper, paper factories in Bhutan also produce ornamental art paper with designs of flower petals, and leaves, and other materials. For use on special occasions, vegetable dyed paper is also made.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Wood carving
[[File:Slate carving, School of Traditional Arts, Thimphu.jpg|thumb|upright|Slate carving, School of Traditional Arts.]]
Wood carving known as ''Parzo'' is a specialised and ancient art form, which is significantly blended with modern buildings in the resurgent Bhutan. Carved wood blocks are used for printing religious prayer flags that are seen all over Bhutan in front of monasteries, on hill ridges and other religious places. Carving is also done on slate and stone. The wood that is used for carving is seasoned for at least one year prior to carving.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;
[[File:Hand woven Bhutanese fabrics, Bumthang.jpg|thumb|Contemporary hand woven Bhutanese fabrics, [[Bumthang District]]]]

; Sword making
The art of sword making falls under the tradition of ''garzo'' (or blacksmithing), an art form that is used to make all metal implements such as swords, knives, chains, darts and so forth. Ceremonial swords are made and gifted to people who are honoured for their achievements. These swords are to be sported by men on all special occasions. Children, wear a traditional short knife known as the ''dudzom''. [[Terton]] Pema Lingpa, a religious treasure hunter from central Bhutan, was the most famous sword maker in Bhutan.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

;Boot Making
It is not uncommon to see Bhutan’s traditional boots made of cloth. The cloth is hand stitched, embroidered and appliquéd with Bhutanese motifs. They are worn on ceremonial occasions (mandatory); the colours used on the boot denote the rank and status of the person wearing it. In the pecking order, Ministers wear orange, senior officials wear red and the common people wear white boots. This art form has been revived at the Institute of Zorig Chosum in Thimphu. Women also wear boots but of shorter length reaching just above the ankle.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Bamboo Craft
Bamboo Craft made with cane and bamboo is known as ''thazo''. It is made in many rural communities in many regions of Bhutan. Few special items of this art form are the ''belo'' and the ''bangchung'', popularly known as the Bhutanese “Tupperware” basket made in various sizes. Baskets of varying sizes are used in the homes and for travel on horseback, and as flasks for local drink called the ''arra''.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

;Bow and Arrow Making
To meet the growing demand for bow and arrow used in the national sport of archery, bamboo bows and arrows are made by craftsmen using specific types of bamboo and mountain reeds. The bamboo used are selected during particular seasons, shaped to size and skilfully made into the bow and arrow. Thimphu has the Changlimithang Stadium &amp; Archery Ground where Archery is a special sport.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 105"&gt;Brown, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

; Jewelry 
Intricate jewelry with motif, made of silver and gold, are much sought after by women of Bhutan. The traditional jewelry made in Bhutan are heavy bracelets, ''komas'' or fasteners attached to the ''kira,'' the traditional dress of Bhutanse women, loop ear rings set with [[turquoise]] and necklaces inlaid with gem stones such as antique turquoise, coral beads and the ''zhi'' stone. The ''zhi'' stone is considered a prized possession as it is said to have “protective powers”; this stone has black and white spiral designs called “eyes”. The ''zhi'' is also said to be an [[agate]] made into beads.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

==Institutions==
; National Institute of Zorig Chusum 
The National Institute of Zorig Chusum is the centre for Bhutanese Art education. Painting is the main theme of the institute, which provides 4–6 years of training in Bhutanese traditional art forms. The curricula cover a comprehensive course of drawing, painting, wood carving, embroidery, and carving of statues. Images of Buddha are a popular painting done here.&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"/&gt;

; Handicrafts emporiums
There is a large government run emporium close to the National Institute of Zorig Chusum, which deals with exquisite handicrafts, traditional arts and jewelry; ''gho'' and ''kira'', the national dress of Bhutanese men and women, are available in this emporium. The town has many other privately owned emporiums which deal with thangkas, paintings, masks, brassware, antique jewellery, painted lama tables known as ''choektse'', drums, Tibetan violins and so forth; Zangma Handicrafts Emporium, in particular, sells handicrafts made in the Institute of Zorig Chusum.&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 114"&gt;Brown, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

; Folk Heritage Museum 
Folk Heritage Museum in Kawajangsa, Thimphu is built on the lines of a traditional Bhutanese farm house with more-than-100-year-old vintage furniture. It is built as a three storied structure with rammed mud walls and wooden doors, windows and roof covered with slates. It reveals much about Bhutanese rural life.&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"/&gt;

; Voluntary Artists Studio 
Located in an innocuous building, the Voluntary Artist Studio’s objective is to encourage traditional and contemporary art forms among the youth of Thimphu who are keen to imbibe these art forms. The art works of these young artists is also available on sale in the 'Art Shop Gallery' of the studio.&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 105"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dzongkhag&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thimphu.gov.bt/profile.php|title=Thimpu Dzongkhag|accessdate=2010-06-08|publisher=Government of Bhutan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908110431/http://www.thimphu.gov.bt/profile.php|archivedate=2010-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5745">The bilingual [[eye cup]] by the [[Andokides painter]] in the Museo Archeologico Regionale, [[Palermo]] (not illustrated), is a prime example of the transition from [[black-figure vase painting]] to the [[red-figure vase painting|red-figure style]] in the late 6th century to early 5th century that commonly resulted in [[Bilingual vase painting|"bilingual" vases]], using both styles. The Andokides painter created the [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] style of pottery as we know it today during his working years from 530-515 BC&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3258216.pdf.bannered.pdf|title=Andokides the Potter and the Andokides Painter|last=von Bothmer|first=Dietrich|date=|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Starting around 530 BC the Andokides painter produced red-figure amphorae and a bilingual kylix&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Fewer than 20 vases survive by the Andokides painter but they span 30-40 years of his career, allowing historians to trace the development of his painting styles. One of the earliest mentions of the Andokides painter was on a black-figure [[hydria]] by Timagoras around 550 BC, when the Andokides painter must have been an apprentice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Athena Herakles Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2301 B.jpg|thumb|A bilingual amphora by the Andokides Painter;Munich, Antikensammlungen 2301]]

== Red-figure technique ==
The red-figure technique was likely perfected, if not created, by the Andokides painter. This revolutionary technique made the compositions stand out more so they were easier to see from a distance. It essentially used the same materials as the black-figure, but reversed the way the image figures were created. Instead of using incision and added light colors to define figures, figures were left with light glaze then defined with black lines while the background was filled in black. This contrast of light on dark made the composition stand out as opposed to the dark, shadowy figures on a black-figure composition. This created a need, however, for even more decorations along the top, bottom, and sides of the main register in order to delineate the black of the vase from the black background of the figural scene&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  [[File:Athena Herakles Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2301 A.jpg|thumb|Red figure side of Munich, Antikensammlungen 2301]]

The introduction of the red-figure technique can be related back to the [[Siphnian Treasury]] at Delphi. The style of the Andokides painter is remarkably similar to the sculptural decorations on the treasury. This similarity can be traced through the particular details in armory and human anatomy, the use of drapery lines, and also through the subject of the struggle for the Delphic tripod. According to Dietrich von Bothmer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, only the Andokides painter has been known to emphasize calf muscles with three curved lines as is also seen on the frieze of the Siphnian Treasury. This relation shows that the Andokides painter was inspired by the sculptural decorations on the treasury and incorporated aspects of that into his own works&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

== Bilingual eye cup ==
The only bilingual kylix eye cup by the Andokides painter dates to ca. 530 BC. The figures on this kylix are of warriors around the handles, archers between the eyes on the red-figure register, and a trumpeter between the eyes on the black-figure register; most of the tondo is lost but what fragments remain are just of ray patterns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/XDB/ASP/recordDetails.asp?id=311623F9-E4A5-4E3A-997B-83DAD169D08D&amp;noResults=&amp;recordCount=&amp;databaseID=&amp;search=|title=Provenance - The Classical Art Research Centre|website=www.beazley.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The composition is simple enough, but the unique aspect of this kylix comes in the specifics dividing the painting techniques. Scholars generally attribute the black-figure compositions of the Andokides painter's vases to the [[Lysippides Painter|Lysippides painter]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. On this bilingual eye cup the demarcation between red-figure and black-figure is so specific that both of the black-figure warriors who are in supplication on the ground have red-figure shields that have fallen out of their hands&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andokides Painter - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195300826.001.0001/acref-9780195300826-e-0062|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195300826.001.0001/acref-9780195300826-e-0062}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Elite soldiers ==
The [[hoplite]] warriors depicted in the bilingual kylix were Greek warriors who fought in closed ranks, or a [[phalanx]]. Hoplites were the most common type of soldier in the 7th through 4th centuries BC. These soldiers carried long thrusting spears (doru) in their right hands and shields in their left with a short sword (xiphos) on the hip&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/hoplite/|title=Hoplite|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The shields would protect the soldier's own body and the right side of the warrior to his left. This set-up of soldiers allowed all but the ones on the ends of rows to be fully protected during battle. The phalanx formation didn't allow for much movement but the Greeks were the best warriors around regardless of any mobility issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hoplite|title=hoplite {{!}} ancient Greek soldier|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Brick Renaissance''' is the [[Northern Europe]]an continuation of [[brick]] architecture after [[Brick Romanesque]] and [[Brick Gothic]]. Although the term Brick Gothic is often used generally for all of this architecture, especially in regard to the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], the stylistic changes that led to the end of [[Gothic architecture]] did reach [[Northern Germany]] and northern Europe with delay, leading to the adoption of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements into brick building. Nonetheless, it is very difficult for non-experts to distinguish transitional phases or early Brick Renaissance, as the style maintained many typical features of Brick Gothic, such as [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gables]]. A clearer distinction only developed at the transition to [[Baroque architecture]]. In [[Lübeck]], for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von Düren, who was also active at [[Schwerin]] ([[Schwerin Castle]]) and [[Wismar]] (Fürstenhof).

More clearly recognisable as Renaissance are brick buildings strongly influenced by the [[Dutch Renaissance]] style, such as Reinbek Castle at [[Reinbek]] near [[Hamburg]], the Zeughaus at Lübeck, or [[Friedrichstadt]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]].

[[File:RogartDSCF6220.jpg|thumb|The Rogart brooch, National Museums of Scotland, FC2. [[Pict]]ish penannular brooch, Scotland, 8th century, silver with gilding and glass.  Classified as Fowler H3 type.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, no. 111, with a plate showing the decoration much better; Laing, 310&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Celtic brooch''', more properly called the '''penannular brooch''', and its closely related type, the '''pseudo-penannular brooch''', are types of [[brooch]] clothes fasteners, often rather large; penannular means formed as an incomplete ring. They are especially associated with the beginning of the [[Early Medieval]] period in the British Isles, although they are found in other times and places—for example, forming part of traditional female dress in areas in modern [[North Africa]].

Beginning as utilitarian fasteners in the [[Iron Age]] and Roman period, they are especially associated with the highly ornate brooches produced in precious metal for the elites of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] from about 700 to 900, which are popularly known as Celtic brooches or similar terms. They are the most significant objects in high-quality secular metalwork from Early Medieval [[Celtic art]], or [[Insular art]], as art historians prefer to call it.  The type continued in simpler forms such as the '''thistle brooch''' into the 11th century, during what is often known as the [[Viking]] Age in Ireland and Scotland.

Both penannular and pseudo-penannular brooches feature a long pin attached by its head to a ring; the pin can move freely around the ring as far as the terminals, which are close together.  In the true penannular type, the ring is not closed; there is a gap between the terminals wide enough for the pin to pass through. In the pseudo-penannular type, the ring is closed, but there are still two separately defined terminals, which are joined by a further element. The penannular type is a simple and efficient way of fastening loosely woven cloth (where the pin will not leave a permanent hole), but the pseudo-penannular type is notably less efficient.

The brooches were worn by both men and women, usually singly at the shoulder by men and on the breast by women, and with the pin pointing up; an Irish law code says that in the event of injury from a pin to another person, the wearer is not at fault if the pin did not project too far and the brooch was worn in these ways by the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 89, NMI, O'Floinn, 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;  The most elaborate examples were clearly significant expressions of status at the top of society, which were also worn by clergy, at least in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 72, NMI, O'Floinn, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; though probably to fasten [[cope]]s and other [[vestment]]s rather than as everyday wear.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 304&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Senchas Mhor'', an [[early Irish law]] tract, specified that the sons of major kings, when being [[fostering|fostered]], should have "brooches of gold having crystal inserted in them", while the sons of minor kings need wear only silver brooches.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 029 (2).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tara Brooch]], the most ornate of all, also decorated on the back (see below). Irish, early 8th century.]]
"Annular" means formed as a ring and "penannular" formed as an incomplete ring; both terms have a range of uses. "Pseudo-penannular" is a coinage restricted to brooches, and refers to those brooches where there is no opening in the ring, but the design retains features of a penannular brooch—for example, emphasizing two terminals. Some pseudo-penannular brooches are very similar in design to other penannular brooches, but have a small section joining the two terminals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, this brooch in the British Museum. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/silver_ring_brooch.aspx Silver ring brooch]&lt;/ref&gt; Others have fully joined terminals, and emphasize in their design the central area where the gap would be—for example the Tara Brooch. Pseudo-penannular brooches may also be described as "annular", or as "ring brooches".&lt;ref&gt;The last favoured by NMI, O'Floinn, 177 and entries.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "open brooch" or "open ring brooch" are also sometimes used for penannular brooches.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially in material aimed at the general public, to avoid the "p" word—for example, "open brooch" in the headings of the database of the National Museums of Scotland, but not in the detailed descriptions. The British Museum display captions favour "open ring".&lt;/ref&gt; There is a scheme of classification originally set out, in relation to earlier types, by Elizabeth Fowler in the 1960s, which has since been extended in various versions to cover later types.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler's two papers are in Further Reading. Laing 304–316 summarizes one version of the expanded typology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooches of either penannular or annular type, where the pin is very large in relation to the ring, so that the ring cannot play any part in the fastening of the brooch, may be called "ring brooches", "pin brooches", or "brooch-pins"; or, especially where the ring is small and plain, "ringed pins".&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 316 and 318–320, using both, but distinguishing between them. Youngs uses the second and third (no.s 90–92, 95–96), Edwards, 141 the last.&lt;/ref&gt; In these, the design of the pin head typically shows that the pin is intended to sit underneath the ring (seen from the front), rather than on top of it as in the larger brooches.&lt;ref&gt;Usually the pin is bent round to form a simple ring, and though the pin may be capable of being swivelled round to sit in front of the ring, it will then project away from the ring.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Celtic" is a term avoided by specialists in describing objects, and especially artistic styles, of the Early Middle Ages from the British Isles, but is firmly fixed in the popular mind.  The term [[Insular art]] is used to describe the distinct style of art originating in the British Isles and combining Germanic, Celtic, Pictish and Mediterranean elements.  Although some simpler and relatively early penannular brooches are found in [[Anglo-Saxon]] contexts, and some sub-types predominantly so,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; as far as is known the Anglo-Saxons did not use these brooch styles for prestige elite jewellery.  However, there are elements in the style of Irish and Scottish brooches deriving from [[Anglo-Saxon art]], and related to Insular work in other media, especially [[illuminated manuscript]]s.

''[[Fibula (brooch)|Fibula]]'' is Latin for "brooch" and is used in modern languages to describe the many types of Roman and post-Roman Early Medieval brooches with pins and catches behind the main face of the brooch. The brooches discussed here are sometimes also called ''fibulae'', but rarely by English-speaking specialists.

==Fastening the brooches==

[[File:Cashel brooch in Rock of Cashel Museum 2.jpg|thumb|Cashel Brooch, 9th or 10th century, from the [[Rock of Cashel]].]]
With a penannular brooch, the pin is pushed through folds of the cloth, which are then pulled back inside the ring; the free end of the pin passes through the gap in the ring. The pin is then rotated around the ring by 90 degrees or so, so that as long as the pin is held down by slight pressure it cannot escape over the terminals, and the fastening is secure.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2001), 229–230, with diagrams. There is a short video sequence [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ssoy95w1Fs here]. See also Johns, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

With pseudo-penannular brooches, things are not so simple and the manner in which they were used is still debated; the method was probably not the same for all brooches. One method may have been to pull folds of the cloth through the ring until they could be pierced by the pin, and then pull the cloth back until the pin rested on the ring. This would work best with brooches with a pin not much longer than the diameter of the ring, which some have, but others do not. The second method might have been simply to pin the cloth vertically, leaving the ring hanging unattached to the cloth; this does not seem very secure.  The third method relied on a length of chain or cord attached to the ring near the "terminals" (which in pseudo-penannular brooches do not actually terminate), which was used to secure the pin by tying it down, perhaps with a small pin at the end, which was also put through the cloth.  The [[Tara Brooch]] was probably fastened in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2001), 229–230, with diagram of the Tara Brooch; see also a [http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-190-001-178-C&amp;scache=73160e864v&amp;searchdb=scran series of photos from the National Museums of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the pin was fitted with a bolt or rivet to make it removable.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 310&lt;/ref&gt;  A further complication is that in some pseudo-penannular brooches the pin is fixed to lie in front of the ring, as in the [[Londesborough Brooch]] (below), but in others it crosses through the ring, starting with the head end in front of the ring, but the middle of the pin behind the ring by the point where it crosses at the other side; the Tara Brooch has been displayed set up in both ways.&lt;ref&gt;The photographs here, showing the pin lying on top, were taken at the NMI in 2010; the illustrations in "NMI" of 2002, and Youngs of 1989, show it crossing through the ring.&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter arrangement seems more common in later brooches, of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;For example the Roscrea, Ardagh, and Killamery Brooches - respectively Youngs, nos. 79, 76 &amp; 80, and also in NMI. Which brooches have removable pins, so that the arrangement can be altered, is not always clear from the sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is fair to say that scholars remain slightly puzzled that the effective and simple penannular brooch developed in this direction,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Youngs, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is presumed that the reuniting of the terminals of pseudo-penannular brooches was partly to strengthen the brooch. In many penannular brooches, the gap between the terminals is now too narrow for the pin to pass through; whether this was always the case is uncertain.

==History==

===Roman and early Insular period===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Dinas Powys Brooch.jpg|thumb|left|6th century fragment of a penannular brooch with enamel on the flared terminals, from [[Dinas Powys]], Wales, shown with an artist's reconstruction.]] --&gt;
Small and simple penannular brooches in bronze, iron, and, rarely, silver were common in the Roman period as a practical fastener, but were not used for high-status objects, and any decoration was normally limited to bands around the ring or other simple patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 150–151. Examples of Romano-British penannular broches from [http://www.darwincountry.org/explore/013338.html Darwin Country]&lt;/ref&gt; Often the extra thickness at the terminal, necessary to prevent the pin just falling off, is achieved simply by turning back the ends of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukdfd.co.uk/ukdfddata/showrecords.php?product=632&amp;cat=all Example from the UK Detector Finds Database]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late Roman period in Britain in the 3rd and 4th centuries, a type of penannular brooch with [[zoomorphic]] decoration to the terminals appeared, with human or animal heads, still not much wider than the rest of the ring.  Some examples had [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] decoration, and the pin did not extend much beyond the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 21, and no. 15. NMI, O'Floinn, 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;  These are found especially in southwestern Britain and [[Wales]], and seem to have developed in these areas. This type fell from favour in southern Britain by the 5th century,&lt;ref&gt;NMI, O'Floinn, 173; [http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/rpr/index.php/objectbiographies/74-an-irish-bronze-brooch-18847913 another summary account]&lt;/ref&gt; but was developed in Ireland by the 6–7th centuries. These types considerably extended the size of the terminals, which now presented a flattish area often decorated with enamel or glass inlay, mostly using abstracted patterns but sometimes zoomorphic decoration. The length of the pin is now often about twice the diameter of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 21–22, and catalogue nos. 16–19; NMI, no. 5:5; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/p/penannular_brooch.aspx example from the British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Irish cultural zone in this period included much of Western Scotland, and in [[Pict]]ish East Scotland a similar development took place, though the forms are somewhat different here. The decoration paralleled that on other metalwork fittings such as pieces of harness-tackle,&lt;ref&gt;See Youngs, 117–120 for examples&lt;/ref&gt; and the few remaining early Christian [[reliquaries]] and other pieces of church metalwork.

===Golden Age===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 028 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Tara Brooch]], rear view.]]

By shortly after 700, highly elaborate, large brooches in precious metal and gems were being produced. These were clearly expressions of high status for the wearer, and use the full repertoire of [[goldsmith]]'s techniques at a very high level of skill. They continued to be produced for about 200 years; the Pictish brooches are much more homogeneous in design than the Irish ones, which may indicate a shorter period of production, possibly from "the mid-eighth to the beginning of the ninth centuries".&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt; Each surviving design is unique, but the range of types established in the more modest earlier brooches are developed and elaborated upon.  There was no previous tradition of very ornate brooches in Ireland, and this development may have come from contact with Continental elites who wore large [[fibula (brooch)|''fibulae'']] as marks of status.  Such contacts were certainly made, especially by travelling monks.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2001), 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological, and some literary, evidence suggests that brooches in precious metal were a mark of royal status, along with wearing a purple cloak, and it is probably as such that they are worn by [[Christ]] on a [[high cross]] at [[Monasterboice]] and by the [[Virgin Mary]] on another.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2001), 223-226&lt;/ref&gt;  All surviving examples, numbering over 50 (not all complete) in the case of the Irish ones,&lt;ref&gt;NMI, O'Floinn, 177&lt;/ref&gt; have been recovered by excavation, or at least finding in the ground, but where the detailed circumstances of the find are known, few are from graves, and finds in hoards are much more common.  When they were in graves, the burials are often much later than the date of the brooch,&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 304,&lt;/ref&gt; as in a brooch in the Irish 8th century style found in a Norse burial in [[Westray]], [[Orkney]],&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, no. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the Kilmainham Brooch.&lt;ref&gt;Ship, Harrison, 72; Youngs, no. 74; NMI, 185&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate brooches often have one or more names—presumed to be those of owners—scratched on the reverse, often in [[rune]]s. Plainer brooches in bronze and similar alloys continue to be found in much larger numbers.

The most elaborate Irish brooches are pseudo-penannular, while the Scottish ones mostly retain true penannular forms.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;  Most are [[silver-gilt]], the gilding often partial. Some are gilded base metal, of bronze or copper-alloy;&lt;ref&gt;For example, Youngs nos.195 and 75&lt;/ref&gt; only one solid gold Irish brooch is known, a 9th-century one from Loughan, [[County Londonderry]], which is less elaborate than most of the series, though the standard of work is very high.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, no. 83; NMI, 184; [http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/brooches/derry.html photo]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some brooches have a hidden recess which may have contained small lead weights to make the precious metal used seem more valuable than it actually was.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/silver_ring_brooch.aspx British Museum], mentioning two examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, the head of the pin might be turned into a focus for decoration, sometimes using a "kite"-shaped plate, such as that on the Tara Brooch; in Scotland, the pin-heads were simple circles formed by bending the pin back on itself.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish terminals are more often distinct lobed or square shapes extending beyond the circle of the ring on both sides, while in Irish examples, the terminals typically extend inside the ring forming another curve, but not much outside it, or sometimes form a straight line across the interior of the ring.  Irish brooches may only join the two terminals by narrow strips, or not only eliminate the gap entirely, but have a central zone of decoration where the gap between the terminals would have been; the brooches found with the [[Ardagh Chalice]] show both types.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 245&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 016.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the [[Londesborough Brooch]]]]

The main body was normally cast, and a number of elements of two-piece moulds have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 170–171, 189–193; NMI, 176–177&lt;/ref&gt;  Many brooches have cells for studs or bosses that are most often round hemispheres, but may be square, lozenges or other shapes; very often the studs themselves are now missing.  These are in a variety of materials including glass, enamel, [[amber]], and gemstones found locally, although not including any of the classic modern "precious stones", or even the [[garnet]]s found in Anglo-Saxon jewellery.  However the ''[[millefiori]]'' glass rods sometimes used appear to have been imported from Italy, like those used in the Anglo-Saxon jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]]; examples of the rods have been excavated in both Ireland and England.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 202–204&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Insular chalices and other metalwork, the very ornate Irish brooches were mostly made in many pieces which are pinned or slotted together. Filigree decoration was often made on "trays" which fitted into the main ring — on the Tara Brooch many of these are now missing (most were still in place when it was found in 1850).
[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 015-crop.jpg|thumb|The [[Breadalbane Brooch]], Irish 8th century, converted from its original pseudo-penannular form in 9th century Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Techniques include [[chip-carving]], cast "imitation chip-carving", [[filigree]], [[engraving]], inlays of various types including [[niello]], glass and [[champlevé]] enamel, and various hammering and chasing techniques: "the range of materials and techniques is almost the full range known to man."&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 171–173, quote 171&lt;/ref&gt;  Two techniques that do not appear are the "true pierced openwork ''[[interasile]]'', much used in Byzantine jewellery",&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 171–173&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cloisonné]] work that typified much Western European jewellery, and especially large fibulae, at the time, whether in enamel or stone inlays like the garnets used so effectively at Sutton Hoo and in the Anglo-Saxon [[Staffordshire Hoard]]. In the gilded brooches, enamel is restricted to studs that punctuate the composition like gems; the larger areas of champlevé found on the flared terminals of earlier types perhaps continue in simpler types, though dating is difficult.

On some brooches the decoration is too detailed to be appreciated when the brooch is being worn, and some of the most elaborate brooches have their backs, invisible when worn, decorated almost as elaborately as their fronts. The Tara Brooch shows both features, and in addition, shares with some others a difference in decorative styles between front and back, with "Celtic" [[triskele]]s and other spiral motifs restricted to the back, while the front has more [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] and zoomorphic elements.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, O'Floinn, 177; Youngs, 207&lt;/ref&gt; These features are also shared by the most ornate brooches in London and Edinburgh, respectively the Londesborough and [[Hunterston Brooch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, nos. 69 and 71; [http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/results.php?offset=1&amp;no_results=12&amp;scache=73160e864v&amp;searchdb=scran&amp;sortby=&amp;sortorder=ASC&amp;field=&amp;searchterm=%2B%22Melbrigda%22 Hunterston Brooch from NMI]; see external links for the other museum pages.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be because decoration on the backs relies more on engraving than filigree, which would risk wires getting caught in the clothing on which the brooch was worn.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Few of the major brooches, or indeed other metalwork, have been found in contexts that can be easily dated, and much of the dating of at least the earlier ones comes from comparison with Insular [[illuminated manuscript]]s, though the dating of these is often itself far from certain. The Tara Brooch has long been recognised as having clear stylistic similarities to the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], thought to date to about 698–715.  Many of the similarities are to the [[carpet page]]s, highly detailed ornamental pages filled with decoration, which share with the brooch a certain ''[[horror vacui]]'' that leaves no area unembellished, and also complex decoration that is extremely small and perfectly executed, and best appreciated when seen at a larger than actual scale, whether in the original or in photographs. Both combine elements from many stylistic origins into a style that is distinctly Insular: La Tène Celtic art, Germanic [[animal style]], and classical and other Mediterranean styles.

===Later brooches, and the Vikings===
[[File:Britishmuseumpenrithhoardbrooches.jpg|thumb|[[Viking]] period pennannular brooches from the [[Penrith Hoard]], three of the "[[thistle]]" type.]]
The [[Vikings]] began to raid Ireland from 795, with catastrophic effect for the [[monastery|monasteries]] in particular.  However, although the Vikings established several [[longphort]]s, initially fortified encampments for over-wintering, and later towns like [[Dublin]], [[Wexford]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], and [[Waterford]] (the first real urban centres in Ireland), the native Irish were more successful than the English and Scots in preventing large-scale Viking takeovers of areas for settlement by farmers.  By about the year 1000, the situation was relatively stable, with a mixed population of [[Norse-Gaels]] in the towns and areas close to them, while the Gaelic Irish, whose elite had often formed political alliances, trading partnerships and inter-marriages with Viking leaders, remained in control of the great majority of the island, and were able to draw tribute from the Viking towns.&lt;ref&gt;Ship, Doherty, 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

The period is characterised by a greatly increased availability of silver, presumably the result of Viking raiding and trading, and most brooches are made from silver throughout, as gilding and decoration in other materials nearly disappears.  The brooches are often large and relatively massive, but plainer than the most elaborate earlier ones, neither using older local decorative styles nor the Viking styles that were adopted in other media.  This continues a trend that can be detected in later brooches from the preceding period, before much Viking influence can have made itself felt.  The 9th century Roscrea Brooch is one of a number of transitional brooches; though its form is highly ornate, with a large flat triangular pin head, the ring is thick plain silver, the gold filigree panels occupy relatively small areas, and their workmanship is a "coarse" or "crude" imitation of that of earlier works.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 215–216, and 230, "crude"; Youngs, no. 79, "coarse". [http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/brooches/roscrea.html Illustration here]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kilamery Brooch is a comparable example, with a marked emphasis on plain flat silver surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 215; [http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/brooches/kilamery.html photo]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are rare exceptions in which a highly decorated brooch shows Scandinavian stylistic and technical influence, notably an Irish brooch from [[Rathlin Island]], with areas stamped where the Irish tradition would have used casting.&lt;ref&gt;Ship, O'Floinn, 90;&lt;/ref&gt;

The brooches appear to have been made by "native" metalworkers, but worn by both Vikings and Gaels.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, Wallace, 213–216&lt;/ref&gt; The very popular '''thistle brooches''' have terminals and often pin-heads that are like [[thistle]] flowers, with a ball topped by a round projection, often flared; they are called by the term regardless of whether or not the ball is "brambled"—that is, formed with a regular pattern of small tapering projections, like the two lowest brooches from the [[Penrith Hoard]] illustrated here.  These, and other globular endings to terminals and pin-heads, were common, but flattened terminals continued to be made, now ornamented by round silver bosses amid simple repeated patterns, or interlace that is larger in scale than in the earlier ornate badges.  In these, the ring often ends in a "gripping beast" biting the terminal plate. The mixture of types seen in the 10th century Penrith Hoard is typical.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the very similar selections of brooches illustrated at NMI 238 and 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 036.jpg|thumb|left|Brooches made in Scandinavia, mostly in base metal]]

Insular brooches had been taken back to Scandinavia, and began to be produced there in the 10th century for wearing singly by men at the shoulder; Viking women wore pairs of characteristic oval brooches on the upper breast.&lt;ref&gt;Vikings, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Most were simpler than Insular examples, and several hundred examples in "tinned bronze rather than silver" are known.&lt;ref&gt;Ship, O'Floinn, 89&lt;/ref&gt;  The 10th century Danish Møllerløkken Brooch is the most elaborate example known, with a simple overall design with ball terminals and pin-head, but with rich detailing such as interlace panels on the ring and filigree sections on the balls.&lt;ref&gt;Vikings, 112–113, 146; Ship, O'Floinn, 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Insular types were also produced in Viking areas of England, especially [[Scandinavian York]].&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 312&lt;/ref&gt; The penannular brooch fell from common use by the end of the 11th century, a time when Ireland and Scotland, and Scandinavia, were adopting general Western European styles in many areas of both art and life.

A distinctly Irish type of brooch found at the end of the Viking period is the '''kite brooch''', whose name derives from the [[almond]] shape called a "kite" in [[heraldry]], though the shapes of the heads are actually highly variable. They were apparently worn, like the larger brooches, singly with the pin pointing upwards. Only "about half a dozen" exist in silver, including examples that are much larger than average, with pins up to 7.9&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 227&lt;/ref&gt; In these, there is no ring, but the elaborate head is connected to a pin of very variable length by a short tab of metal that can move on joints at both ends; there is also usually a cord for winding round the pin to secure it. Only 14 of these brooches have been found to date in Ireland, many incomplete, and none elsewhere;&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield (2005), 64–67; [http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/arts-literature/the-virtual-museum/waterford-museum-of-treas/personal-adornment/the-waterford-kite-brooch/index.xml The Waterford Kite brooch], plus one in the next reference.&lt;/ref&gt; five of these are from Dublin, the earliest from the 940s.

===Celtic Revival===
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 036-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Early medieval Irish brooch, bronze and glass; note the pin lies entirely in front of the ring in this example.]]
The brooches we have today have been discovered since the 17th century, and their odds on their survival once found have increased greatly over that period, as their value as artefacts has overtaken their scrap value. In the 19th century, as part of the [[Celtic Revival]], many brooches copying or inspired by earlier styles were made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=imagetext&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=0&amp;q=penannular+brooch&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch= Victorian penannular brooches from the [[V&amp;A Museum]].]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the responsibility for the fashion for high-quality Celtic Revival jewellery belongs to George Waterhouse, a jeweller from [[Sheffield]], England, who moved to [[Dublin]] in 1842.  Before the end of the decade, he and the long-established Dublin firm [[West Jewellers|West &amp; Son]] of [[College Green]] (later moving to [[Grafton Street]]) were finding it necessary to register their designs to prevent copying. Of the various types of objects made, the brooches were both the "most resonant" and those which could be sold with the least alteration to the original form and design, although the jewellers generally reduced their size and fitted them with conventional pins and catches behind, even though the [[Kashmir shawl]]s that were also fashionable at the time were often loosely woven and not unsuitable for fastening in the original way.&lt;ref&gt;Gere and Rudoe, 444.&lt;/ref&gt;  Different versions were made at different price levels, though even the most expensive struggled to recreate the full intricacy of the originals.

The [[National Museum of Ireland]] is clearly not correct in saying that the fashion began after [[Queen Victoria]] was presented with a [[replica]] of the "Cavan Brooch" on her visit to Dublin to see the [[Great Industrial Exhibition (1853)|Great Industrial Exhibition]] in 1853;&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 5:21&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal Collection]] has two brooches that [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] bought for her from West &amp; Son in 1849 on an earlier visit to Dublin, which were already being made in editions.  Albert presented them in November and at Christmas that year: "...such beautiful souvenirs, both made after those very curious old Irish ornaments we saw in [[Trinity College, Dublin|the College]] in Dublin, one a silver shawl brooch, in smaller size than the original" was her reaction to the November gift.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=12457&amp;row=15&amp;detail=about Royal Collection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042602/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=12457&amp;row=15&amp;detail=about |date=June 9, 2011 }}, Brooch given in November 1849, and [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=4833&amp;row=16&amp;detail=about Christmas 1849]. Their fabrication was sub-contracted to Edward Johnston's workshop.  See also the V&amp;A text at the link above, also dating the fashion to the 1840s.&lt;/ref&gt;  A later gift from Albert included a setting of a [[Smoky quartz|cairngorm]] he had picked up when walking in the [[Scottish Highlands]], a more authentic type of gem than the brightly coloured foreign stones used in much Celtic Revival jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=82803&amp;partid=1 British Museum] Waterhouse replica of the Tara Brooch, with text from "catalogue of Hull Grundy Gift (Gere et al 1984) no. 989" covering other replicas and the revived brooch in general&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Tunesische Berbervrouw. TMnr 60032650.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Berbers|Berber]] woman in [[Tunisia]], wearing a pair of brooches, 20th century]]

The discovery of the [[Tara Brooch]] in 1850 could therefore not have been better timed in terms of attracting public interest.  The brooch was immediately recognised as the culminating masterpiece (though early in date) of the Irish development of large and superbly worked ornate brooches, a status it has retained ever since. The brooch was soon acquired by George Waterhouse, who used it as the centre of displays of his replicas and imitations of Celtic brooches in his Dublin shop, also exhibiting it at [[The Great Exhibition]] in London in 1851 and the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1855)]], as well as the Dublin exhibition visited by the Queen in 1853 (Victoria had already seen it; it had been specially sent to [[Windsor Castle]] for her inspection).

Waterhouse had invented the brooch's name; in fact, it has nothing to do with the [[Hill of Tara]], but the true circumstances of its find still remain unclear (essentially to avoid a claim by the landowner), and Waterhouse chose to link it to the site associated with the [[High King]]s of Ireland, "fully aware that this would feed the Irish middle-class fantasy of being descended from them".&lt;ref&gt;Gere and Rudoe, 444; British Museum: Waterhouse replica of the Tara Brooch, see note above.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time the brooch passed to what is now the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in the 1870s, "Tara brooch" had become a [[Genericized trademark|generic term]] for Celtic Revival brooches, some of which were now being made by [[India]]n workshops for export to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gere and Rudoe, 455&lt;/ref&gt;  Replicas, very rarely fully accurate, and imitations of Celtic brooches have continued to be made to the present day, at varying levels of quality.

==Modern North Africa==
Penannular brooches are part of traditional dress to the present day among [[Berber people|Berber]] women in the [[Maghreb]], usually worn in pairs and apparently pinning straps of a dress to the bodice, with the pins pointing straight up.&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 151. [http://www.raqs.co.nz/me/clothing_rectangle.html Photos from Tunisia], and [http://www.trekearth.com/gallery/Africa/Tunisia/North/Zaghouan//photo128538.htm another recent one].&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually large, fairly plain, brooches, not unlike some Viking examples, though another style has a very elaborately decorated head to the pin, which can dwarf the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corbisimages.com/Enlargement/KE003039.html Elaborate Berber brooches] from Corbis.&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy necklace often hangs between the two brooches, sometimes attached to a ring hanging from the head of the pin. Most of the women are identified as Berber. Local names for the brooches apparently include ''melia'', ''melehfa'', ''bzima'', ''kitfiyya'', and ''khellala'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and ''tabzimt'', ''tizerzay'', and ''tazersit'' in [[Berber languages|Berber]].  Such styles are believed to have been in use since pre-Islamic times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O79372/penannular-brooch-unknown/ Victoria &amp; Albert Museum "Penannular brooch"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cervara Altarpiece''' or '''Cervara Polyptych''' was an oil-on-oak-panel [[altarpiece]] painted by the Flemish painter [[Gerard David]] early in the 16th century for the high altar of [[Cervara Abbey]] in [[Liguria]], [[Italy]]. 
== History ==
It was commissioned by the Genoese nobleman Vincenzo Sauli on 7 September 1506, as dated in a 17th-century document - Sauli's name is painted above the Virgin's feet in the central panel. David painted it in [[Bruges]] and it was installed in the Abbey in 1507.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} C. Di Fabio, ''Il Polittico della Cervara di Gerard David'', exhibition catalogue, Cinisello Balsamo, Genova, Musei di Strada Nuova - Palazzo Bianco, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
== Description ==
It was originally formed of seven panels, which were divided up after the monastery's suppression and requisition in 1797 by the [[Republic of Genoa]]. The separated panels were initially deposited in the [[Palazzo Ducale (Genoa)|Palais Ducal]], seat of the prefecture, and only four panels remained in Genoa. These four were the central one (measuring 153 by 89 cm and showing the Madonna and Child Enthroned or the Madonna of the Grapes), two side panels (each measuring 152.5 by 64 cm and showing [[saint Jerome]] and [[saint Maurus]]) and an upper central panel (measuring 102 by 88 cm and showing the [[Crucifixion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} AA.VV., ''Musei di Strada Nuova a Genova'', Milan, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-88-572-0433-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerard david, polittico della cervara 01.JPG|thumb|left|Panels in the Palazzo Bianco.]]
The central ''Virgin and Child'' and the upper ''Crucifixion'' panels were rediscovered in the Palazzo Ducale in 1805. In 1830 the painter [[Francesco Baratta the elder]] supervised their transfer to the mayor's officce in the Palazzo Tursi, the civic palazzo, and later into the [[Palazzo Bianco]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Locating Renaissance art|first=Carol M.|last=Richardson|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac_Bbk8dLXUC|accessdate=March 19, 2012|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The altarpiece's three remaining panels were later rediscovered in Italy. Two of these were the two upper side panels of the [[Annunciation]], now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, with one showing the angel and one the Virgin. A final semicircular panel from above the Crucifixion is now in the [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris - this shows God the Father with his hand raised in blessing, surrounded by angels. All seven panels were re-united at the Palazzo Bianco in autumn 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertozonghetti.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Il-Polittico-della-Cervara-di-Gerard-David-%E2%80%93-Genova-2005.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image|website=Albertozonghetti.it|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Charles S. Roberts Awards''' (or '''CSR Awards''') was an annual award for excellence in the historical [[wargaming]] hobby. It was named in honor of [[Charles S. Roberts]] the "Father of Wargaming" who founded [[Avalon Hill]]. The award was informally called a "Charlie" and officially called a "Charles S. Roberts Award". ''[[The Wargamer (magazine)|The Wargamer]]'' magazine called it "very prestigious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wargamer.com/article/2857/industry-news-voting-for-the-charles-s-roberts-award-now-open |title=Industry News: Voting for the Charles S Roberts Award Now Open |work=[[The Wargamer (magazine)|The Wargamer]] |author=Scott Parrino |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |quote=..the very prestigious Charles S Roberts Awards has started. |archiveurl=https://archive.is/6AqKU |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Created at the first Origins Game Convention in 1975, the awards were the "brainchild of Canadian hobbyist John Mansfield."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Origins: The National Convention af Five |journal=[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]] |author1=John Prados |date=June 1979 |volume= |number=45 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Mansfield, resident of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] and long time gamer, is manager of Pendragon Games &amp; Hobbies as of 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the awards were the [[Origins Awards]] but were informally known as the ''Charles Roberts Awards''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Origins: The National Convention af Five |journal=[[Moves (magazine)|Moves]] |author1=John Prados |date=June 1979 |volume= |number=45 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only in 1988 that Charles Roberts officially agreed to let his name be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alanemrich.com/CSR_pages/CSR_Awards_Home.htm |title=CSR Awards Authorization |publisher=CSR website |author=Charles S.

Fortress America was not considered a traditional historical wargame by the older members in the wargaming community. Prior to 2000, the awards were given at the [[Origins Game Fair]]. Since 2000, the awards were given at the [[World Boardgaming Championships]] (formerly "AvalonCon"). The Award was managed by the Charles S. Roberts Award Committee with winners chosen by votes submitted by fans.

The Awards also included the [[Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame]] which recognized game designers and producers that have made a significant and long lasting contribution to the contemporary board wargaming hobby.

The last year the awards were given was 2012.

The '''Demeter of Knidos''' is a life-size, seated ancient Greek statue that was discovered in the port of [[Knidos]], south-west [[Asia Minor]] (present-day Turkey). Now part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection, it is an impressive example of [[Hellenistic]] sculpture from around 350 BC.&lt;ref name=high&gt;British Museum Highlights [https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/marble-statue-of-demeter/iAGScv9ZxUJAJA Marble statue of Demeter], BritishMuseum.org, retrieved 10 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coll&gt;British Museum Collection [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=460416&amp;partId=1&amp;people=97012&amp;peoA=97012-1-7&amp;page=1 Statue], BritishMuseum.org, retrieved 30 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=proj&gt;British Museum Research Project at Knidos [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/projects/return_to_cnidus/excavations.aspx Return to Cnidus], BritishMuseum.org, retrieved 30 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The statue is made of [[marble]] and in its seated position is approximately {{convert|150|cm|ftin}} high. The [[goddess]] is seated on a throne and while parts of the sculpture are in excellent condition, the back and arm-rails of the [[throne]], as well as her lower arms and hands, separately carved, are missing. The head was also carved independently from the body and fixed onto the neck. Demeter is depicted in a serene, timeless manner, that unveils her motherly role in the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek pantheon of gods]].

==Sanctuary of Demeter==
[[Demeter]] was the goddess of fertility who created the [[harvest]], the grain and other crops as well as the circle of [[seasons]]. At Knidos she was worshipped with [[Hades]] and the other [[Greek underworld|underworld deities]] including her mythical daughter [[Persephone]].&lt;ref name=high/&gt; The Sanctuary of Demeter at Knidos was laid out in 350 BC, when the city was reestablished. The sanctuary consisted of a long terrace built into the side of an acropolis, overlooking the city and seascape below. Many votive sculptures were deposited within the sanctuary. Most of these were discovered by excavators in fragments, but the statue of divine Demeter herself remains relatively intact.

==Discovery==
The Demeter of Knidos was found by the British archaeologist Sir [[Charles Thomas Newton]] in 1857-58&lt;ref&gt;[http://sammlung.theologie.uni-halle.de/demeter/?lang=en Martin-Luther Universität: "Dermeter of Knidos".]&lt;/ref&gt; and was almost immediately sent to London to become part of the [[British Museum]]'s Ancient Greek and Roman collection.

A '''design change''' is the modification conducted to the [[product (business)|product]]. It can happen at any stage in the [[product development]] process.

The design changes that happen early in the [[design]] process are less expensive when compared to those that take place after it is introduced into full-scale production. The cost of the change increases with its development time. Fundamentally, the design changes can be classified into pre production and post production design changes. The pre-production changes can happen in the [[conceptual design]] stage, [[prototype]] stage, detailing stage, testing stage. The post -production stage change will happen almost immediately the product is introduced into the production. This might be due to several reasons such as [[market response]], [[design fault]]s uncovering, design mistakes, not meeting customer requirements, so on and so forth. One of the tools to minimize this type of design change is [[House of Quality]].

'''Epode''',&lt;ref&gt;From {{lang-el|ἐπῳδός}}, ''epodos'', "singing to/over, an enchanter."&lt;/ref&gt; in [[poetry|verse]], is the third part of an [[ode]], which followed the [[strophe]] and the [[antistrophe]], and completed the movement.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Epode |volume=9 |page=707 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain point in time the choirs, which had previously chanted to right of the altar or stage, and then to left of it, combined and sang in unison, or permitted the ''[[coryphaeus]]'' to sing for them all, while standing in the centre. With the appearance of [[Stesichorus]] and the evolution of [[choral poetry|choral lyric]], a learned and artificial kind of poetry began to be cultivated in [[Greece]], and a new form, the epode-song, came into existence. It consisted of a verse of iambic trimeter, followed by a verse of iambic dimeter, and it is reported that, although the epode was carried to its highest perfection by Stesichorus, an earlier poet, [[Archilochus]], was really the inventor of this form.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The epode soon took a firm place in choral poetry, which it lost when that branch of literature declined. But it extended beyond the ode, and in the early dramatists we find numerous examples of monologues and dialogues framed on the epodical system. In [[Latin]] poetry the epode was cultivated, in conscious [[archaism]], both as a part of the ode and as an independent branch of poetry. Of the former class, the epithalamia of [[Catullus]], founded on an imitation of [[Pindar]], present us with examples of strophe, antistrophe and epode; and it has been observed that the celebrated ode of [[Horace]], beginning ''Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri'', possesses this triple character.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==''Epodes'' of Horace==

The word is now mainly familiar from an experiment of [[Horace]] in the second class, for he entitled his fifth book of odes ''Epodon liber'' or the ''Book of Epodes''. He says in the course of these poems, that in composing them he was introducing a new form, at least in [[Latin literature]], and that he was imitating the effect of the iambic distichs invented by Archilochus. Accordingly, we find the first ten of these epodes composed in alternate verses of [[iambic trimeter]] and [[iambic dimeter]], as at, for example, ''Epode'' 5.1–2:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{| style="border: 0px; margin-left:100px; white-space: nowrap;"
! scope="col" width="400px" |
! scope="col" width="400px" |

|
At o Deorum quicquid in coelo regit&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Terras et humanum genus&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
|
But, o any of the gods in the heavens ruling&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the lands and the human race.
|}

In the seven remaining epodes Horace diversified the measures, while retaining the general character of the distich. This group of poems belongs mostly to the early youth of the poet, and displays a truculence and a controversial heat which are absent from his more mature writings. As he was imitating Archilochus in form, he believed himself justified, no doubt, in repeating the sarcastic violence of his fierce model. The curious thing is that these particular poems of Horace, which are really short lyrical satires, have appropriated almost exclusively the name of epodes, although they bear little enough resemblance to the epode of early [[Greek literature]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The '''Finnish National Theatre''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen Kansallisteatteri}}), established in 1872, is a theatre located in central [[Helsinki]] on the northern side of the [[Helsinki Railway Square|Helsinki Central Railway Station Square]]. The Finnish National Theatre is the oldest [[Finnish language|Finnish]] speaking professional theatre in Finland.  It was known as the '''Finnish Theatre''' until 1902, when it was renamed the Finnish National Theatre.

For the first thirty years of its existence, the theatre functioned primarily as a touring company. The theatre did not acquire a permanent home until 1902, when a purpose-built structure was erected in the heart of Helsinki, adjacent to the city's main railway station. The building hosting the Finnish National Theatre today was completed in 1902 and designed by architect Onni Tarjanne in the [[National Romantic style]], inspired by [[romantic nationalism]]. The theatre still operates in these premises today, and over the years the building has expanded from its original size to encompass another three permanent stages. In addition to the Main Stage (''Suuri näyttämö''), the theatre comprises the Small Stage (''Pieni näyttämö'') built in 1954 (by architects [[Heikki Siren]] and [[Kaija Siren]]), the Willensauna Stage built in 1976, and the Omapohja studio built in 1987. The theatre is often associated with the Finnish national romantic writer [[Aleksis Kivi]], as the [[Aleksis Kivi Memorial]] is located in front of it.

==Historical roots of the theatre==
The Finnish National Theatre is the oldest [[Finnish language|Finnish]] speaking professional theatre in Finland. The birth of the Finnish National Theatre was closely linked to the nation's political and cultural ideology during the late nineteenth century. Finland was a part of the Russian Empire, and its intellectual elite was Swedish speaking. Finnish language and art, including theatre, became the cornerstones of a cultural movement which began in the 1860s, gradually developing political ambitions by the turn of the century, and eventually leading to national independence in 1917.

The theatre was established as a touring theatre in 1872 by the name ''Suomalainen teatteri'', The Finnish Theatre. The first performance was given in 13 October 1872 in the west coast town of [[Pori]] at the [[Hotel Otava]], which today is considered to be the birthplace of the Finnish-language theatre. For the first thirty years of its existence, The Finnish Theatre functioned primarily as a touring company. Its first directors were the siblings [[Kaarlo Bergbom|Kaarlo]] and [[Emilie Bergbom]]. 

The theatre did not acquire a permanent home until 1902, when a purpose-built structure was erected prominently in the heart of Helsinki, adjacent to the city's main railway station, the [[Helsinki Central railway station]]. The building was designed by [[Onni Tarjanne]] in the [[National Romantic style]], inspired by [[romantic nationalism]]. At the same time, the name ''Finnish Theatre'' was switched into the ''Finnish National Theatre''. In 1939, the [[Aleksis Kivi Memorial]] (designed by [[Wäinö Aaltonen]]) was erected in front of the theatre, to commemorate the [[Aleksis Kivi]] and his role in Finnish theatrical art.

The Finnish National Theatre building is reportedly haunted by at least three [[ghost]]s - an unknown ''Grey Lady'' and the ghosts of actors [[Urho Somersalmi]] and [[Aarne Leppänen]].

==Stages==
[[File:Kansallisteatterinsuihkulähde.jpg|The northern side of the building, which hosts the Small Stage and the Willensauna Stage|thumb]]
The Finnish National Theatre currently houses four permanent stages:
* '''The Main Stage''' ({{lang-fi|Suuri Näyttämö}}) – since 1902 (885 seats)
* '''The Small Stage''' ({{lang-fi|Pieni Näyttämö}}) – since 1954 (309 seats)
* '''The Willensauna Stage''' – since 1976 (152 seats)
* '''The Omapohja Studio''' – since 1987 (78 seats)

===Touring stage===
The theatre established a new production unit in 2010, which was given the name of Touring Stage. This unit, which has no fixed stage, aims to take small-scale touring performances to locations throughout the country which have little or no access to theatre, such as schools, day care centres, homes for the elderly, hospitals, welfare reception centres, prisons, and so on. The Touring Stage's programme focuses on topical issues which are developed through community research and interaction, reaching out and  giving voice to marginalised sectors of society.

==Club Scene==
In January 2011 the theatre's former restaurant reopened as the Club Scene ({{lang-fi|Lavaklubi}}), transformed into a late-evening club-like entertainment spot. The space has been given a new look, refurbished in a piano-bar stroke artist's living-room style, and hosts various types of music, drama, and poetry performances as well as discussion evenings and artist soirées.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;Artist Annie Graham lives with her husband, Steve, their 16-year-old son Peter, and their 13-year-old daughter, Charlie. At the funeral of her secretive mother, Ellen, Annie delivers a [[eulogy]] explaining their fraught relationship. Steve is informed that Ellen's grave has been desecrated, while Annie thinks she sees an apparition of Ellen in her workshop. At a [[support group]] for bereaved, Annie reveals that the rest of her family suffered from [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] that resulted in their deaths.

To attend a party, Peter lies that he is going to a school event, and Annie forces him to take Charlie with him. Unsupervised, Charlie eats cake containing nuts, which she is allergic to, and falls into [[anaphylactic shock]]. As Peter drives her to a hospital, Charlie leans out of the window for air. Peter swerves to avoid a dead animal and Charlie is decapitated by a telephone pole. The family grieves following Charlie's funeral, heightening tensions between Annie and Peter. Peter is plagued by Charlie's presence around the house.

Annie is befriended by a support group member, Joan. Annie tells her she used to [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalk]], and recounts an incident in which she woke up in Peter's bedroom to find herself, Peter, and Charlie covered in paint thinner with a lit match in her hand. Joan teaches Annie to perform a [[séance]] to communicate with Charlie.

Annie wakes from a nightmare and convinces her family to attempt the séance. Objects begin to move and break, terrifying Peter, and Charlie seemingly possesses Annie until Steve douses her with water. Annie suspects that Charlie's spirit has become malevolent. She throws Charlie's sketchbook into the fireplace, but her sleeve also begins to burn. She retrieves it and heads to Joan's apartment for advice, but Joan has vanished.

Annie notices that Joan's welcome mat resembles her mother's craftwork. She goes through her mother's possessions and finds a photo album linking Joan to Ellen, and a book with information about a [[demon]] named [[Paimon]], who wishes to inhabit the body of a male host. In the attic, Annie finds Ellen's decapitated body with strange symbols on the wall written in blood.

At school, Peter becomes confused and slams his head against his desk, breaking his nose. Annie shows Steve her mother's body and the sketchbook. Annie begs Steve to burn the sketchbook so she can sacrifice herself to stop the haunting, but Steve assumes she has gone mad, accusing her of desecrating Ellen's grave herself. When Annie throws the book into the fireplace, Steve bursts into flames instead. Annie becomes possessed.

Peter awakens to find his father's body. Annie chases him into the attic, which is decorated with cult imagery. Levitating, Annie beheads herself with a piano wire as naked [[coven]] members look on. Peter jumps out of the window.&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T SAY HE DIES OR IS KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS. This is ambiguous and open for debate. This isn't the place for personal interpretation --&gt; As he lies on the ground, a light enters his body and he wakes up. He follows Annie's levitating corpse into Charlie's treehouse, where Charlie's crowned, decapitated head rests atop a mannequin. Joan, other coven members and the headless corpses of his mother and grandmother bow to him. Joan, addressing him as Charlie, swears an oath to him as Paimon, stating that he has been liberated from his female host, Charlie, and is free to rule over them.

==Production==
During pre-production, writer-director Ari Aster often referred to the film not as a horror film but rather "a tragedy that curdles into a nightmare."&lt;ref name="rs making of"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/hereditary-making-a-modern-horror-classic-interview-w520922 |title='Hereditary': Inside the Making of a Modern Horror Classic |first=David |last=Fear |date=June 12, 2018 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films said to have influenced Aster in the making of ''Hereditary'' include ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Cries &amp; Whispers|Cries and Whispers]]'', ''[[Don't Look Now]]'', ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Ordinary People]]'', and ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-to-watch-hereditary/2/ |title=Watch 'Hereditary', Then Watch These Movies |first=Christopher |last=Campbell |date=June 11, 2018 |website=Film School Rejects |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aster also noted that much of his inspiration for the film came from older Japanese horror films.

The film began shooting in February 2017 in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name="2018SDFF"/&gt; The exteriors of the Graham family house and the tree house were shot in [[Salt Lake City]], and the school scenes were shot in [[West High School (Utah)|West High School]], but all other interiors (including both versions of the treehouse) were built from scratch on a sound stage. Since each of the rooms was built on a stage, walls could be removed to shoot scenes at a much greater distance than a practical location would allow, creating the [[dollhouse]] aesthetic of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/news/how-they-did-it-hereditary-ari-aster/ |title=How They Did It: Building Hereditary's Haunted Houses From Scratch Was First-Time Helmer Ari Aster's Living Nightmare |first1=Ari |last1=Aster |first2=Caleb |last2=Hammond |date=June 6, 2018 |website=[[MovieMaker]] |access-date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 298 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Hereditary'' uses its classic setup as the framework for a harrowing, uncommonly unsettling horror film whose cold touch lingers long beyond the closing credits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hereditary/|title=Hereditary (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a [[weighted average]] score of 87 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary|title=Hereditary Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it the scariest movie of 2018, saying "it's Collette, giving the performance of her career, who takes us inside Annie's breakdown in flesh and spirit and shatters what's left of our nerves. Her tour de force bristles with provocations that for sure will keep you up nights.

Club]]'', A.A. Dowd gave the film an A−, stating that, "In its seriousness and hair-raising craftsmanship, ''Hereditary'' belongs to a proud genre lineage, a legacy that stretches back to the towering touchstones of American horror, unholy prestige-zeitgeist classics like ''The Exorcist'' and ''Rosemary's Baby''. Remarkably, it's a first feature, the auspicious debut of writer-director Ari Aster, whose acclaimed, disturbing short films were all leading, like a tunnel into the underworld, to this bleak vision."&lt;ref name="avc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://film.avclub.com/family-is-a-curse-in-the-harrowing-deeply-frightening-1826616606|title=Family Is a Curse in the Harrowing, Deeply Frightening ''Hereditary''|last=Dowd|first=A.A.|publisher=[[The Onion]]|work=[[The A.V.

Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "D+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt; Some publications noted the critics-to-audience discrepancy, comparing it to ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'' and ''[[It Comes at Night]]'', all of which were critically acclaimed but failed to impress mainstream moviegoers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/columns/how-did-hereditary-get-a-d-plus-from-cinemascore-1202839120/ |title=How Did 'Hereditary' Get a D+ From CinemaScore?

[[Image:Scroll.jpg|200px|thumb|Scroll of the [[Book of Esther]], [[Seville]], [[Spain]]]]
A '''[[scroll]]''' (from the Old French ''escroe'' or ''escroue''), is a roll of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], or [[paper]] containing writing.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Peter. (2008) "scroll" in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000'' Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''history of scrolls''' dates back to ancient Egypt.  In most ancient literate cultures scrolls were the earliest format for longer documents written in ink or paint on a flexible background, preceding bound [[book]]s; rigid media such as [[clay tablet]]s were also used but had many disadvantages in comparison. For most purposes scrolls have long been superseded by the [[codex]] book format, but they are still produced for some ceremonial or religious purposes, notably for the Jewish [[Torah scroll]] for use in [[synagogue]]s.

==Origins in Africa==

Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean [[ancient Egyptian civilization]]s.

Parchment scrolls were used by several early civilizations before the [[codex]] or bound [[book]] with pages and was invented by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the 1st century AD{{fact|date=April 2018}}.  Nevertheless, scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.

==Eastern Mediterranean, West Asia and Europe==

===Israel===

The Hebrew tradition assumes that the [[Torah]] was copied by [[Moses]] onto a scroll (in about 1200 BCE) made from skin of a [[kosher]] animal, rather than [[papyrus]] as in Dynastic Egypt. Since there is no historical evidence for Moses and the events related in the Torah, there is no reliable way to know the time when Hebrews started using scrolls for their religious books.&lt;ref name="autogenerated99"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dever, William G. | title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It? | publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-8028-2126-3}}p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Jewish tradition, since that time scrolls, which are very durable with examples known to be hundreds of years old such as the 800-year-old Sephardic [[Sefer Torah]] from Spain, are copied from one to another.

The meticulous process of hand-copying a scroll takes about 2,000 person-hours (about one year at 40 hours per week). 

The Torah scroll contains 304,805 letters (or approximately 79,000 words). &lt;br /&gt;
Other books of the [[Tanakh]] are also written in scroll form, as well as the small [[mezuzah]] scrolls found in the door frames of most orthodox, conservative and reform Jewish households. Some Jewish families own their own [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] scroll for use during [[Purim]].

There is a difference between the [[Qere and Ketiv|כְּתִיב (''Ketiv'')]], what is and must be written (in consonantal text, with vowels omitted), and the קְרֵי (''Qere''), what is read.

===Syria and Babylon===

The Jewish communities in these countries used the same techniques to manufacture scrolls, but using deer skins. The scrolls from these areas were known for their quality and durability, and were later imported into European and Indian communities.

Non-Jewish vellum manufacturing also took place after the 3rd century BC.

===Greece and Rome===
{{double image|right|Giovane con rotolo.JPG|150|MANNapoli 120620 a Fresco young man with rolls from Pompeii Italy.jpg|150|[[Roman portraiture]] [[fresco]]s from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD, depicting two different men wearing [[laurel wreath]]s, one holding the ''[[rotulus]]'', the other a ''volumen''}}
[[File:Busto maschile.JPG|thumb|[[Roman portraiture]] fresco of a young man with a [[papyrus]] [[scroll]], from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century AD]]
Scrolls were used by the ancient Greeks. In Roman usage the scrolls were written latitudinally, usually placed on podiums with roll holders from which the rolls were unwound.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Romans eventually found the scroll too cumbersome for lengthy works and developed the [[codex]], which is the formal name for the modern style of book, with individual pages bound together.

===Early Christian era===

Scrolls continued to be used at times during the Early Church era until the [[Early Middle Ages]], but Christianity was an early adopter of the codex.  It is often thought that this reflects the background in trade of many early Christians, who were used to codex notebooks, and less attached to the form that was traditional among the Roman elite and religious Jews.

===European Middle Ages===

Scrolls virtually ceased to be used for books and documents in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], and were reintroduced for rare use in official treaties and other international documents of great significance during and after the Baroque Era of the 0th century. These were usually written on high quality vellum, and stored in elaborate silver and gold cases inscribed with names of participants. Earlier examples were written in Latin.  Scrolls continued in use for administrative and accounting purposes all over Europe. In English they were often referred to as "rolls", hence the [[Pipe rolls|Great Rolls]] of the English [[Exchequer]], and titles such as [[Master of the Rolls]] (a senior judge), still used in the 21st century.  The official copy of English, now British, legislation was still printed on vellum in a roll format and stored in the [[Palace of Westminster]] until 2017, when the use of Vellum was replaced with archival paper&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/21/anger-mps-bow-peers-pressure-end-500-year-old-tradition-printing/&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Exultet Scroll]] from Southern Italy and Byzantine [[Joshua Scroll]] were prestige objects that used the old form in a revivalist spirit.

===West and Central Asia===

Scrolls continued in use longer in the Islamic world, often elaborately decorated in calligraphic writing that included use of gold embossing and pigments when used for the writing of the Qur'an.

===East Asia===
{{see also|Hanging scroll|Handscroll}}

Scrolls continued in use longer in East Asian cultures like China, Korea and Japan.

The Chinese invented and perfected 'Indian Ink' for use in writing, including scrolls. Originally designed for blacking the surfaces of raised stone-carved hieroglyphics, the ink was a mixture of soot from pine smoke and lamp oil mixed with the gelatin of donkey skin and musk. The ink invented by the Chinese philosopher, Tien-Lcheu (2697 B.C.){{fact|date=April 2018}}, became common by the year 1200 B.C.

Later other formats came into use in China, firstly the ''sutra'' or ''scripture'' binding, a scroll folded [[concertina]]-style, which avoids the need to unroll to find a passage in the middle.  By about 1,000 CE, sheet-based formats were introduced, although scrolls continued to have a place. Traditional [[painting]] and [[calligraphy]] in East Asia is often still performed on relatively short latitudinal paper scrolls displayed vertically as a [[hanging scroll]] on a wall or horizontally and flat as a [[handscroll]].

==Replacement by the ''Codex''==
The [[codex]] was a new format for reading the written word, consisting of individual pages loosely attached to each other at one side and bound with boards or cloth. It came to replace the scroll thanks to several problems that limited the scroll's function and readability. For one, scrolls were very long, sometimes as long as ten meters. This made them hard to hold open and read, a difficulty not helped by the fact that most scrolls in that era were read horizontally, instead of vertically as scrolling virtual documents are read now. The text on a scroll was continuous, without page breaks, which made indexing and bookmarking impossible. Conversely, the codex was easier to hold open, separate pages made it possible to index sections and mark a page, and the protective covers kept the fragile pages intact better than scrolls generally stayed. This last made it particularly attractive for important religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011) ''Books: A Living History.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. p. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that made the codex more attractive than the scroll was ease of copying. It was possible to hold open a codex with one hand and write notes- or copy the text- with the other. For early Christendom this was an invaluable asset, as the ability to mass reproduce their gospels was in high demand. Early Medieval Christians were some of the first to adopt the codex over the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Gary, [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v17/bp17-10.html "Adoption of the Codex Book: Parable of a New Reading Mode"], ''The Book and Paper Group Annual'', Retrieved 12/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex began to replace the scroll almost as soon as it was invented. For example, in Egypt by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll or roll by ten to one based on surviving examples, and by the sixth century the scroll had almost vanished from use as a vehicle for literature.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), ''The Birth of the Codex''. London: [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[British Academy]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other places the scroll lingered. As mentioned above, English monarchs used so called “statute rolls” to record important legislation until well into the Middle Ages. Scrolls were also commonly used in theater productions, a practice from which the term “actor’s roll” was coined.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011) ''Books: A Living History.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
[[File:Hanging scroll 7a33a8.jpg|thumb|[[Hanging scroll]]s of [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on display, [[Shanghai]]]]
Torah Scrolls are still used today in Jewish religious observance with almost insignificant changes despite the thousands of years in practice.

Some cultures use scrolls as ceremonial texts or for decoration—such as a [[hanging scroll]]—without any obvious division of the text into columns. In some scroll-using cultures painted illustrations were used as header decorations above the text columns, either in a continuous band or broken into scenes above either a single or double column of text.

One of the few modern texts the original of which was written on what is effectively a scroll is the manuscript of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'', typed onto what he called "the scroll", made of taped-together sheets of paper.

The verb "[[Scrolling|to scroll]]" is much used in the age of [[Display device|screen]] displays—[[computer]] displays, rolling [[Closing credits|credits]] in [[film]]s and so on—with the screen filled with text moving (scrolling) up or down or sideways, appearing at one edge of the display and disappearing at the other as if being unrolled from one side of a scroll and rolled up at the other.

'''''Ingress''''' is a [[location-based game|location-based]], [[augmented reality|augmented-reality]] [[mobile game]] developed by [[Niantic (company)|Niantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregory |first=Myk |url=http://www.wheninmanila.com/ingress-game-lifestyle-social-network/ |title=Ingress: A Game, Lifestyle and Social Network in One! |publisher=When In Manila |date=July 22, 2014 |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices on December 14, 2013 and for [[iOS]] devices on July 14, 2014.&lt;ref name="13magnus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iTunes Shop"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/ingress/id576505181?mt=8/ |title=iTunes official App shop |date=July 14, 2014 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Russell |first1=Jon |title=Google’s Ingress augmented reality game quietly launches for iOS devices |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2014/07/14/googles-ingress-augmented-reality-game-quietly-launches-ios-devices/ |website=TNW News |publisher=The Next Web |accessdate=August 13, 2015 |date=July 14, 2014 |quote=Google is inviting iPhone and iPad owners into its augmented reality game Ingress after it finally launched an iOS app.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has a [[science fiction]] [[back story]] with a continuous open narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nianticproject.com/ |title=What is this 'Niantic Project'? |publisher=NianticLabs@Google |date=November 1, 2012 |access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/+NianticProject/posts |title=Niantic Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ingress'' is also considered to be a location-based [[exergame]].

The competition in ''Ingress'' is primarily between the two opposing factions rather than between individual players, and players never interact directly in the game or suffer any kind of damage other than temporarily running out of "XM", the power that fuels all actions except movement and communication. The gameplay consists of capturing "portals" at places of cultural significance, such as [[public art]], landmarks, [[monuments]], etc., and linking them to create virtual triangular "control fields" over geographical areas.

Progress in the game is measured on an individual level primarily by accumulating "Access Points" (or AP), and AP are awarded for a variety of in-game actions: destroying or damaging an enemy portal, capturing, linking, or recharging a portal, creating a control field, and other actions. Players of opposing factions can "battle" indirectly in approximate real time for control of portals, with one faction attacking a portal to destroy its resources and defenses and the other faction restoring them as they are damaged, but there is no personal penalty for "losing" a portal, the destruction of a field the player created, or any other reason. The only scored competition is between the factions.

== Setting ==
The game makers' [[framing device]] for the game is as follows: Alongside the discovery of the [[Higgs Boson]] by the physicists at [[CERN]] in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Before Pokémon GO There Was Ingress |url=http://pixelkin.org/2016/07/14/before-pokemon-go-there-was-ingress/ |website=Pixelkin |accessdate=July 20, 2016 |date=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been discovered that the Earth has been seeded with "Exotic Matter" (XM). This substance has been associated with the Shapers, a mysterious phenomenon or alien race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Haahr, Mads |editor1=Koenitz, Hartmut |editor2=Ferri, Gabriele |editor3=Haahr, Mads |editor4=Sezen, Digdem |editor5=Sezen, Tonguc Ibrahim |title=Interactive digital narrative : history, theory and practice |publication-date=2015 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-138-78239-6 |chapter=Everting the Holodeck: Games and Storytelling in Physical Space |pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factions ===
Within the game, human reactions to this discovery fall into two opposing factions: the Enlightened fight believing their actions will uplift humanity and bring about the next chapter in human evolution, whereas the Resistance believes that it is protecting humanity from Shaper ingression and preserving humanity's freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ingresshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207441277-Faction-choice |title=Faction Choice |accessdate=November 7, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023323/https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/207441277-Faction-choice |archivedate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two factions are the opposing "sides" or "teams" in the game: the Resistance is represented in the game by the color blue and the Enlightened by green. Both teams have naturally tended to balance each other out in population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Andrew McMillen |title=Ingress: The friendliest turf war on Earth |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/ingress-the-friendliest-turf-war-on-earth/ |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, the Resistance are colloquially referred to as "[[The Smurfs|Smurfs]]" and lower-level Resistance players as "Smurflings". Similarly, the Enlightened in general are referred to as "Frogs" or "[[Toad]]s", lower-level Enlightened players as "[[Tadpoles]]".

In real life, the factions occasionally ignore the [[back-story]] and co-operate for the sake of real-life gameplay and [[game balance]]:  for example, by establishing neutral zones and rules of engagement; for training new players; for socializing; and occasionally for serious real-life purposes such as honoring fallen heroes.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#MIT-truce]].&lt;/ref&gt; Niantic Labs supports these activities and often arranges them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/communities/103727946232179539813 |title=Greater Boise Ingress community on Google Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ingress Live Events |url=https://www.ingress.com/events |website=Ingress |accessdate=August 13, 2015 |quote=Mission Days bring together Agents from both factions to explore cities around the world through the lens of Ingress with unique and local adventures on foot. ...  Once a month, First Saturdays are a get together of the local Ingress family, new and old, to level up new recruits, make new friends, and strengthen Cross-Faction relations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay of ''Ingress'' has been described as combining elements of [[geocaching]] with [[capture the flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=Michael |title=Ingress in Geography: Portals to Academic Success? |journal=Journal of Geography |date=October 5, 2016 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1080/00221341.2016.1227356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Play environment ===
[[File:Ingress Intel Map full-screen.png|thumb|right|An example of the Intel Map. Virtual portals ([[octagon]]s with spokes), links (lines joining portals), and control fields (colored spaces) overlay a map of real geographical and civic space via [[Google Maps]]; green represents the Enlightened faction, and blue the Resistance.|295x295px]]

A player using the mobile app is presented with a map representing the surrounding area. The map has a black background and is completely unmarked, except for buildings and roads which are outlined in grey but not labeled, and bodies of water (pale blue). These geographical features are supplied by [[OpenStreetMap]] and formerly [[Google Maps]].{{efn-ua|From the ''Sources'' button found within the Ingress app under the "Device" tab.}} Visible on the map are portals, Exotic Matter (XM), links, control fields, and items that players have dropped from their inventory. Distances from the player to in-game locations are displayed only in [[metric system|metric units]]. The app is available in sixteen languages.{{efn-ua|name=langs|Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Dutch, English (US), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. There is also an "Automatic" setting within the app.}}

Players must be physically near objects on the map to interact with them. The mobile client represents the player as a small arrowhead in the center of a circle {{convert|40|m|sp=us}} in radius, which represents the perimeter within which direct interaction is possible. A player sees only their own location, not that of any other player. The color of the arrowhead corresponds with the faction of the player (blue for Resistance, green for Enlightened), as will the XM storage. XM can be thought of as "energy" – a high amount of XM is needed to perform actions in the game, and it can be replenished by walking through an area of XM (common near portals). A player can "hack" a nearby portal to acquire in-game items, some of which can also be used to replenish XM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.google.com/ingress/answer/2808247?hl=en |title=Acquire Items via Hacking |website=Ingress Help |publisher=Google |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714104302/https://support.google.com/ingress/answer/2808247?hl=en |archivedate=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=November 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players are rewarded with Action Points (AP) for actions within the game. Accumulating AP beyond certain thresholds grants higher access levels,&lt;ref name=fevgames-ap&gt;{{cite web |title=Ingress &gt; Ingress Guide &gt; Concepts &gt; Access Points (AP) |url=https://fevgames.net/ingress/ingress-guide/concepts/access-points-ap/ |website=Fev Games |accessdate=May 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502064342/https://fevgames.net/ingress/ingress-guide/concepts/access-points-ap/ |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |date=May 16, 2016 |quote='''Access Points''' (sometimes referred to as '''Action Points''' and commonly called '''AP''') constitute your “score” in Ingress. Various actions will award you AP. Reaching certain AP thresholds is a requirement for leveling up.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  i.e., access to stronger items and longer portal recharging capabilities. The access levels are numbered 1 through 16, with 16 being the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ingress |url=https://support.google.com/ingress/ |title=Official Ingress Support Page |publisher=Google |accessdate=February 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317232234/https://support.google.com/ingress/ |archivedate=March 17, 2015 }} {{failed verification |date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because more AP are awarded for taking over enemy portals than for maintaining your own team's, if a player is outnumbered by members of the other team, they will accumulate AP at a faster rate as a way of leveling the playing field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Haahr, Mads |editor1=Koenitz, Hartmut |editor2=Ferri, Gabriele |editor3=Haahr, Mads |editor4=Sezen, Digdem |editor5=Sezen, Tonguc Ibrahim |title=Interactive digital narrative : history, theory and practice | publication-date=2015 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-138-78239-6 |chapter=Everting the Holodeck: Games and Storytelling in Physical Space |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to earning AP, certain actions within the game can earn a player a Badge. Badges are typically multi-tiered (ranked Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Onyx respectively) and become a requirement for level advancement starting with Level 9. Most badges are statistic-based: for instance, capturing portals, total MUs captured, fields and links created, various offensive actions, and even successfully discovering new portals. Some badges are exclusive and can only be obtained by attending special ''Ingress'' events.

In September 2014, Niantic Labs introduced missions to the game. A mission is a user-created set of places to visit (''[[waypoint]]s'') and interact with in specified ways. Some missions list all the waypoints from the start, while others only reveal them one at a time as the user progresses from one to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hindy |first1=Joe |title=Huge new Ingress Missions feature will forever change how we play Ingress |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/huge-new-ingress-missions-feature-will-forever-change-how-we-play-ingress-529012/ |website=Android Authority |accessdate=September 8, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927082848/http://www.androidauthority.com/huge-new-ingress-missions-feature-will-forever-change-how-we-play-ingress-529012/ |archivedate=September 27, 2014 |date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing missions reward the player with a virtual medal of the mission that is displayed on their agent profile.

=== Portals ===
In the game, Earth has a large number of "portals", made visible by the "scanner" (the mobile phone game app). They are colored green, blue, or grey, depending respectively on whether they are currently controlled by the Enlightened, by the Resistance, or are unclaimed. Players acquire portals for their faction by "deploying" at least one "resonator" on them. They can also add "mods" (modifications) to protect the portals or increase their power in various ways. A portal with no resonators is unclaimed, also called a "ghost" portal.

Players acquire game items (resonators, weapons, etc.) by maneuvering themselves, typically by walking, biking, or driving, to within {{convert|40|m}} of a portal and "hacking" it by selecting this option on their scanners. Any player can hack any portal and receive items, subject to limits on frequency: Hacking a portal starts a "cool down period", initially 5 minutes, until that player can hack that portal again; and attempting more than 4 hacks within 4 hours will cause the portal to "burn out" for that player for 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ingress FAQ |url=http://www.ingressportal.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IngressFAQ.pdf |website=Ingress Portal |accessdate=January 14, 2016 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These periods can be reduced with the "Heat Sink" and "Multi-hack" mods. Hacking a portal controlled by the opposing faction also earns the player 100 additional AP (Access Points), at the risk of being attacked by the portal in the form of losing XM. Players can also earn additional items and AP for glyph hacking a portal, where they are briefly shown several patterns and retrace them within a time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glyph Hacking |url=https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/206618698-Glyph-Hacking |website=Ingress Help |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed, difficulty and rewards of glyph hacking can be further modified with special Commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glyph Hack Command Channel is Open |url=http://decodeingress.me/2015/12/22/glyph-hack-command-channel-is-open/ |website=Decode Ingress |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/a7Nr6iCt1a7 |website=[[Google+]] |publisher=Niantic |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |title=Agents, the Simple and Complex Glyph can now be entered in the command channe...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To claim a portal for a faction, a player equips, or deploys, at least one resonator on it. If a portal is claimed by the enemy, the player must first neutralize it by destroying the opponents' resonators with weapons called XMP ("Exotic Matter Pulse") Bursters, the principal means of attacking a portal. XM itself is neutral, not aligned with either faction, but an XMP Burster fired by a player of one faction will damage any portal of the other faction within range, while having no effect on portals of the player's own faction.

Portals are typically associated with buildings and landmarks of historic or architectural significance— such as [[sculptures]], [[murals]], and other [[public art]], [[libraries]], [[post offices]], [[memorial]]s, [[places of worship]], [[public transit]] [[Transit hub|hubs]], [[parks]] and other [[recreational]] or [[Tourism|tourist]] spaces, or with business locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ingress |url=https://ingresshelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207343987-Candidate-Portal-criteria |title=Candidate Portal criteria |work=Ingress Help |publisher=Niantic Labs |accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may submit requests for the creation of new portals if they meet the level requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/207343987-Candidate-Portal-criteria |title=Candidate Portal criteria |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought upon launch that this would allow Google to generate data for its location-based services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hodson |first1=Hal |title=Why Google’s ''Ingress'' game is a data gold mine |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=November 28, 2012 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628936-200-why-googles-ingress-game-is-a-data-gold-mine/ |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2016, 15 million portals had been submitted by the Ingress community, and five million of those had been included in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bogle |first1=Ariel |title=How the gurus behind Google Earth created 'Pokémon Go' |url=http://mashable.com/2016/07/10/john-hanke-pokemon-go/#_qYBgw5Sfmq0 |accessdate=July 20, 2016 |work=[[Mashable]] |date=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Operation Portal Recon ====
In November 2016, "Operation Portal Recon" (OPR) was launched in beta in San Francisco, Tohoku and Kyushu. Operation Portal Recon is a service where high-level Ingress players can evaluate Portal candidates for the Portal Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/niantics-invite-only-portal-recon-tool-lets-players-vote-new-real-world-locations-into-ingress/ |title=Niantic’s new invite-only "Portal Recon" tool lets players vote real-world locations into Ingress |first=Greg |last=Kumparak |publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPR exited beta in May 2017 and made available for all Level 16 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/RnpJxPwdAKU |title=Starting today, Operation Portal Recon (OPR) will now be available globally t... |website=Google+ |publisher=Niantic |date=May 10, 2017 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level requirement for OPR has been reduced several times with the most recent change made in July 2017, making OPR available for all Level 12 players or above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/hPZFqa7Q4qs |title=Agents, Level 12 or above now have access to Operation Portal Recon via... |website=Google+ |publisher=Niantic |date=July 11, 2017 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portal Submissions returned to Ingress in September 2017, after a two-year hiatus, as a result of Operation Portal Recon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://plus.google.com/+Ingress/posts/7sz94RLePop |title=From the intrepid explorers who helped discover countless Portals during the... |website=Google+ |publisher=Niantic |date=September 25, 2017 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niantic announced in September 2018 the ability to submit PokéStop nominations through [[Pokémon Go]] with an initial beta test in South Korea and Brazil.

=== Portal, links, and control fields ===
Two portals that have all eight resonators deployed and are controlled by the same faction can be linked by a player from that faction who stands within range of one and has a portal key for the other. (Keys are obtained by hacking but, like most such in-game objects, can be dropped. After twelve hours they disappear, unless picked up by another player.) The maximum possible length of a link depends on the level of resonators on a portal (higher level resonators equal longer linking range) and mods (specifically, link amps and SoftBank Ultra Links). However, one cannot create a link that crosses an existing link from either faction. Both portals must have at least three resonators deployed to maintain the link. The opposing faction can destroy the link by attacking one or both portals so that one portal's resonator count falls below three.

Links between portals may range in length from meters to kilometers or hundreds of kilometers, created in operations of considerable logistical complexity.&lt;ref name=Tran /&gt; International links and fields are not uncommon, as ''Ingress'' has attracted an enthusiastic following in cities worldwide&lt;ref name="d" /&gt; amongst both young and old,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1=Wassom, Brian |editor2=Bishop, Allison |author=Wassom, Brian D. |title=Augmented reality law, privacy, and ethics : law, society, and emerging AR technologies | publication-date=2015 |publisher=Amsterdam Syngress |chapter=Chapter 6 – Real Property Rights |page=168 |isbn=978-0-12-800524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that the gameplay is itself a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] for some, including [[tattoo]]s.&lt;ref name="13magnus"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Ingress/posts/2wvNoTjd9jG |title=We, at Niantic Labs at Google, are really excited to let you know that our bi... |website=Google+ |publisher=Niantic |date=November 4, 2013 |access-date=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When three portals are linked in a triangle, they create a control field, claiming the Mind Units (MU) within that field for their faction. Portals within a field cannot originate links, but can be linked to from any portals on the perimeter (that is, any of the three portals defining the triangle). The opposing faction can destroy a control field by destroying one or more of the links that form it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/206737888-Create-Links-Control-Fields |title=Create Links &amp; Control Fields |website=Ingress Help| access-date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Mind Units" are related to the population that resides within a control field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sascha Lobo |title=S.P.O.N. - Die Mensch-Maschine: Google macht die Welt zum Spielfeld |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/google-ingress-die-ganze-welt-als-spiel-a-902267.html |accessdate=July 22, 2016 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=May 28, 2013|trans-title=SPON – The Man-Machine: Google makes the world into a playing field |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest control field formed had points between Germany, Greece and Ukraine, and took four months of planning and 200 players to create.&lt;ref name=Tran&gt;{{cite news |author1=Edmond Tran |title=Pokemon GO Devs Still Exploring Multiplayer, Say Players Will Shape The Game |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-devs-still-exploring-multiplayer-say-pl/1100-6441610/ |accessdate=July 21, 2016 |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to capture as many MUs as possible, additional fields can be created that blanket other fields. This is called layering, and each subsequent field that is created "recaptures" the MUs from the previous field(s), adding to the count. Layering is most often accomplished by utilizing one or two common portals, called anchors, to host inbound and outbound links and using a unique portal(s) each time to create each additional layered field. Periodically, faction members will coordinate large-scale layered fields that span multiple countries.

=== ''Ingress Prime'' ===
In December 2017, Niantic announced a thoroughly revamped version of the game, branded as '''''Ingress Prime''''', would be released in 2018 using a completely rewritten new client and the lessons learned from the massive popularity of ''Pokémon Go''. The new version features a subtly different back story akin to a [[superhero]] origin theme and a more florid graphic design. Technologically the new version uses Apple's [[ARKit]] and Google's [[ARCore]], and the network layer transitioned from [[JSON]] to [[Protobuf]] in keeping with the engineering style of ''Pokémon Go''.&lt;ref name="Ingress Prime"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16725884/ingress-prime-update-niantic-pokemon-go |title=Niantic’s first AR game Ingress is getting a massive overhaul in 2018 3 Ingress Prime features a new look, new story, and new tech |last=Webster |first=Andrew |date=December 2, 2017 |website=The Verge |access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Network layer details."&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fevgames.net/beginning-ingress-2-0-prime-announced/ |title=The Beginning: Ingress 2.0 (Prime) Announced |last=n/a |first=Fevenis |date=December 3, 2017 |website=Fev Games |access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update launched on November 5, 2018 as an update to the existing Ingress game.&lt;ref name="Prime"&gt;{{cite web |date=November 5, 2018 |accessdate=November 7, 2018 |title=Welcome to Ingress Prime - Niantic |url=https://www.nianticlabs.com/blog/ingress-prime/ |website=Niantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niantic also retained the older Ingress game as a separate download named ''Scanner [REDACTED]''. The intention of the older Ingress game is to help aid the transition to Prime as feature parity is reached between both games in 2019. The older game will be available until Ingress Prime offers support for Portal submissions and edits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=November 19, 2018 |title=Scanner [REDACTED] |url=https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002076527-Scanner-REDACTED- |website=Ingress Help Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Ingress (TV series)|anime based on the game]] premiered on [[Fuji TV]]'s +Ultra anime programming block on October 18, 2018.

=== Split from Google ===
On August 12, 2015, Niantic announced that it was being spun off as an independent company:&lt;ref&gt;Email to players, approximately  01:30 on August 12, 2015 (UTC)&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this operation, Google was to begin transferring user data to Niantic on September 11.

== Special events ==
In addition to the ongoing competition between the factions wherever there are players, there are several kinds of special events held on specific dates.

=== Anomalies ===
XM Anomalies are events where players from both factions compete in portal-based games in order to win points for their faction.&lt;ref name= live&gt;{{cite web |website=Ingress |title=Ingress Events— XM Anomalies |url=https://www.ingress.com/events |publisher=Niantic Labs |access-date=August 30, 2018 |quote=These events are for Ingress players of ALL levels and last approximately 4-5 hours including 3-4 hours of walking/biking gameplay and a two hour social meetup at the end.

A "series" for the XM Anomalies usually spans two different weekends. Anomaly locations may be chosen based on the player activity in a region. Players, upon registering as being part of the event, organize within each faction into squads based on player level, local knowledge, and mode of transport (for example, walking or biking).&lt;ref name=MajorekduVall&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majorek |first1=Marta |last2=du Vall |first2=Marta |title=Ingress: An Example of a New Dimension in Entertainment |journal=[[Games and Culture]] |date=March 20, 2015 |doi=10.1177/1555412015575833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest event, in Japan, attracted over 10,000 players.&lt;ref name="Recode" /&gt;

More points are awarded to the prevailing faction at Primary sites than at Satellite sites. Players who participate in an anomaly are awarded a unique badge with the emblem of that anomaly. The outcome of XM Anomalies often influences future events in the plot.

=== Criticism and incidents ===
The basic idea of ''Ingress'' is very similar to that of the older, now-defunct, augmented reality game, ''[[Shadow Cities]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Accused Of "Blatantly" Ripping Off Grey Area Games’ Shadow Cities |url=http://indiestatik.com/2012/11/27/google-accused-of-blatantly-ripping-off-grey-area-games-shadow-cities/ |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129084454/http://indiestatik.com/2012/11/27/google-accused-of-blatantly-ripping-off-grey-area-games-shadow-cities/ |work=Indiestatik | archive-date=November 29, 2012 |author=Chris Priestman |date=November 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have two factions which are fighting for the future of the world with smart phones.  Though the games have similar game mechanics and look-and-feel, there are clear differences. In ''Shadow Cities'', players are in the virtual world, which is dynamically mapped around them, and can teleport within the virtual world, whereas in ''Ingress'', the portals are real world locations that players generally have to actually move to in order to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside Ingress, Google’s Augmented Reality Android Game |url=http://www.geekosystem.com/google-ingress-review/ |work=Indiestatik |author-first=  Glen | author-last=Tickle |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Shadow Cities'' was shut down on October 7, 2013 due to lack of popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/20/shadow-cities-closing-down-october-7/ |title=Shadow Cities closing down October 7 |work=Engadget | author-first=Shawn | author-last= Schuster |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |quote=Finnish developer Grey Area has announced that they will be closing down ''Shadow Cities'' on October 7 of this year. The game has already been removed from the iTunes App Store as of today and it will not accept new Mana Potion purchases.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portals which had been approved within the [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s of [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] were removed in July 2015; Gabriele Hammermann, director of the memorial site at Dachau, told the [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] that Google's original approval of these portals was a humiliation for victims of the Nazi camps and their relatives, and Niantic Labs' founder John Hanke stated that "we apologize that this has happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/googles-niantic-labs-sorry-over-death-camps-smartphone-game-n385741 |title=Google's Niantic Labs Sorry Over Death Camps in Smartphone Game |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some players have attracted the attention of [[law enforcement]] while playing the game, and hence commentary on the interaction of augmented reality games with real life.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://readwrite.com/2012/12/11/augmented-reality-game-gets-player-arrested-the-first-of-many Augmented Reality Game Gets Player Arrested the First of Many]", ''Read Write Web'', December 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it can take some time for players to successfully "hack" a portal, they can draw the attention of law enforcement.  In addition, some players play while driving slowly around an area, which is not recommended by the game developers and attracts the attention of law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1=Wassom, Brian |editor2=Bishop, Allison |author=Wassom, Brian D. |title=Augmented reality law, privacy, and ethics : law, society, and emerging AR technologies | publication-date=2015 |publisher=Amsterdam Syngress |chapter=Chapter 8 – Criminal Law |pages=209–210 |isbn=978-0-12-800524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Center for Internet Security]] recommended that law enforcement officers be apprised of the game, and warned that it may be difficult to determine if a malicious actor is using the game as a cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google's Ingress Game Will Likely Increase Reports of Suspicious Activity |url=https://msisac.cisecurity.org/daily-tips/google-ingress-game.cfm |website=MS-ISAC Cyber Tips Newsletter |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, players have used unofficial apps to [[stalking|stalk]] each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ingress Players Use Unofficial Tools To Stalk One Another |url=https://kotaku.com/ingress-players-use-unofficial-tools-to-stalk-one-anoth-1820196357/amp |accessdate=November 9, 2017 |work=''kotaku.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Is Paris Burning?''''' Is a 1965 book by [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]] and [[Dominique Lapierre]] telling the story of the [[Liberation of Paris]] during the [[Second World War]].
The book examines the military and political actions surrounding the events of late August 1944 around Paris and how these events unfolded.
The title is taken from the question reportedly asked by [[Adolf Hitler]] following his order to destroy the city rather than let it be re-captured by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. 
The story was adapted into a feature film [[Is Paris Burning? (film)|by the same name]] in 1966.

==Layout==
The book is laid out in three parts; 

Part 1, "The Menace", examines the military and political situation at the beginning of August 1944, and the considerations of the various parties involved. 

Part 2, "The Struggle", is a day-by-day account of the actions between 19 August, when the uprising by the [[French Resistance]] in the city commenced, and 25 August, when the [[325th Security Division (Wehrmacht)|German garrison]] surrendered.

Part 3, "The Deliverance", describes the activities of 26 and 27 August, detailing particularly the consolidation by General de Gaulle of his position as leader of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|liberated French state]].

==Style==
The book is written as a series of [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] based on interviews with, and the written memoirs of, the people involved, on all sides, in the liberation of Paris. 

These include members of the various factions of the French Resistance, and of the [[Free France|Free French Forces]] and citizens of Paris;  members of the [[United States Armed Forces|American Armed Forces]];  and members of the occupying [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]].

Researchers spent nearly three years locating survivors of the Liberation of Paris, and undertook over 800 interviews of persons in France, Germany and the United States. They also had access to Allied and German action reports, war diaries, memoirs, and official records. 

Senior Allied officers who assisted the authors included Generals [[Dwight D Eisenhower]] and [[Omar Bradley]], and [[Allen Dulles]] (of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]); French interviewees included [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] and [[Henri Rol-Tanguy]] (of the French Resistance), Mme Leclerc (widow of [[Jacques Leclerc]]) and [[Alain de Boissieu]] (son-in-law of [[Charles de Gaulle]]); and from Germany, [[Dietrich von Choltitz]] (Commandant of the Paris garrison) and [[Walter Warlimont]] (of the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]]).

'''Islamic views on slavery''' represent a complex and multifaceted body of Islamic thought,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Brockopp, Jonathan E., “Slaves and Slavery”, in: Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān, General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunschvig, R., “ʿAbd”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; with various Islamic groups or thinkers espousing views on the matter which have been radically different throughout history.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis 1994, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Ch.1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010401012040/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |date=2001-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was a mainstay of life in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] and surrounding lands.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; It was in this social milieu that Islam emerged, whence the [[Quran]] and the ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) address slavery extensively, assuming its existence as part of society but viewing it as an exceptional condition and restricting its scope.&lt;ref name="eois"&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Dror Ze’evi|title=Slavery|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/214|date=|accessdate=2017-02-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125519/http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/214|archivedate=2017-02-23|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Islamic dogma forbade enslavement of free members of Islamic society, including non-Muslims (''[[dhimmis]]''), and set out to improve conditions of human bondage. The sharīʿah (divine law) regarded as legal slaves only those non-Muslims who were imprisoned or bought beyond the borders of Islamic rule, or the sons and daughters of slaves already in captivity.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; In later [[Sharia|classical Islamic law]], the topic of slavery is covered at great length.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Slaves, be they Muslim or those of any other religion, were equal to their fellow practitioners in religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;See: Martin (2005), pp.150 and 151; Clarence-Smith (2006), p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, slavery in Islamic law does not have a racial or color component, although this has not always been the case in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''Race and Color in Islam,'' Harper and Row, 1970, quote on page 38. The brackets are displayed by Lewis.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves played various social and economic roles, from domestic worker to high-ranking positions in the government like [[Emir]]. Moreover, slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, and the army. Some rulers even relied on military and administrative slaves to such a degree that they seized power. In some cases, the treatment of slaves was so harsh that it led to uprisings, such as the [[Zanj Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarence-Smith (2006), pp.2-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was an exception rather than the norm, as the vast [[Islamic economics in the world#Labour force|majority of labor]] in the medieval [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] consisted of free, [[Wage labour|paid labour]].&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery from Roman times to the early transatlantic trade|author=William D. Phillips|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=1985|isbn=0-7190-1825-0|page=76|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a variety of reasons, internal growth of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in Muslim society. This resulted in massive importation, which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non-Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran provides for [[manumission|emancipation]] of a slave as a means of religious atonement for sins.&lt;ref name="Holy Quran Exegesis by ibn Kathir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2426&amp;Itemid=79|title=Quran Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Command to grant Slaves a Contract of Emancipation|first=Administrator|last=N|website=www.qtafsir.com|access-date=2014-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402031805/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2426&amp;Itemid=79|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=This is a dubious questionable interpretation of this verse|date=June 2017}}

The Arab slave trade was most active in West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Africa. In the early 20th century (post [[World War I]]), slavery was gradually outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; For example, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]] only abolished slavery in 1962 under pressure from Britain; [[Oman]] followed suit in 1970, and [[Mauritania]] in 1905, 1981, and again in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Klein (2002), Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition, Page xxii, {{ISBN|0810841029}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, slavery claiming the sanction of Islam is documented presently in the predominantly Islamic countries of [[Chad]], [[Mauritania]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]], and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal, page 206. See later in article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segal, page 222. See later in article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early converts to Islam were the poor and former slaves. One notable example is [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]].&lt;ref&gt;The Qur'an with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English By Ali Ünal [https://books.google.com/books?id=DyuqdDIjaswC&amp;pg=PA1323 page 1323]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], Slaves and Slavery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilal b.

Slavery was widely practiced in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], as well as in the rest of the ancient and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] world. The minority were white slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of [[Bedouin]] captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native [[Arab]] slaves had also existed, a prime example being [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; The slave population increased by the custom of [[child abandonment]] (see also [[infanticide]]), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Lewis (1992) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; There is no conclusive evidence of the existence of enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families; the late and rare accounts of such occurrences show them to be abnormal, Brunschvig states&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; (According to Brockopp, debt slavery was persistent.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Two classes of slave existed: a purchased slave, and a slave born in the master's home. Over the latter the master had complete rights of ownership, though these slaves were unlikely to be sold or disposed of by the master. Female slaves were at times forced into [[prostitution]] for the benefit of their masters, in accordance with Near Eastern customs.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendelsohn (1949) pp. 54—58
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;John L Esposito (1998) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical accounts of the early years of Islam report that "slaves of non-Muslim masters ... suffered brutal punishments. [[Sumayyah bint Khayyat]] is famous as the first martyr of Islam, having been killed with a spear by Abū Jahl when she refused to give up her faith. [[Abu Bakr]] freed [[Bilal ibn Ribah|Bilal]] when his master, Umayya ibn Khalaf, placed a heavy rock on his chest in an attempt to force his conversion."&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;

==Slavery in the Quran==
{{Quran}}
[[File:Bilal.jpg|thumb|[[Bilal ibn Ribah]] (''pictured'', atop the [[Kaaba]]) an Ethiopian former slave, was appointed by Muhammad as the first official [[muezzin]]. He had been emancipated when [[Abu Bakr]] paid his ransom upon Muhammad's instruction. The image depicts an episode in January 630, when he became the first Muslim to proclaim [[adhan]] in [[Mecca]].]]

{{quote|The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them, and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the slaves and the debtors, and for the cause of Allah, and (for) the wayfarer; a duty imposed by Allah.

The mainstream view is that the Quran accepts the institution of slavery. It may be noted that the word 'abd' (slave) is rarely used, being more commonly replaced by some periphrasis such as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum]]'' ("that which your right hands own"). However the meaning and translation of this term has been disputed. W.G. Clarence-Smith has highlighted the [[Ideas of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez#Islam and Individual Liberty|point of view of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez on this issue]], who argued that the term is used in the past-tense in the Quran, thus signalling only those individuals who were already enslaved at the dawn of Islam. This slight change in tense is significant, as it allowed G.A. Parwez to argue that slavery was never compatible with the commandments of the Quran and is in fact outlawed by Quranic Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery%20quran&amp;f=false|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream view; however, is that the Qur'an recognizes the basic inequality between master and slave and the rights of the former over the latter. The historian Brunschvig states that from a spiritual perspective, "the slave has the same value as the free man, and the same eternity is in store for his soul; in this earthly life, failing emancipation, there remains the fact of his inferior status, to which he must piously resign himself."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|16|71}}, {{Quran-usc|30|28}})&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lewis, the Quran urges kindness to the slave&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|36}}, {{Quran-usc|9|60}}, {{Quran-usc|24|58}})&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends their liberation by purchase or manumission. The freeing of slaves is recommended both for the expiation of sins&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|92}}, {{Quran-usc|5|92}}, {{Quran-usc|58|3}})&lt;/ref&gt; and as an act of simple benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|177}}, {{Quran-usc|24|33}}, {{Quran-usc|90|13}})&lt;/ref&gt; It exhorts masters to allow slaves to earn or purchase their own freedom ([[Mukataba|manumission contracts]])."&lt;ref name="L1"&gt;Lewis 1990, page 6. All Qur'anic citations are his.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves are mentioned in at least twenty-nine verses of the Qur'an, most of these are Medinan and refer to the [[legal status]] of slaves. The legal material on slavery in the Qur'an is largely restricted to manumission and [[Human sexual behavior|sexual relations]].&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; According to Sikainga, the Qur'anic references to slavery as mainly contain "broad and general propositions of an ethical nature rather than specific legal formulations."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga (2005), p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran accepts the distinction between slave and free as part of the natural order and uses this distinction as an example of God's grace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|16|71}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding this discrimination between human beings as in accordance with the divinely established order of things.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EoI&lt;/ref&gt; "The Qur'an, however, does not consider slaves to be mere chattel; their humanity is directly addressed in references to their beliefs,&lt;ref name=q2221425&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|221}}, {{Quran-usc|4|25}})&lt;/ref&gt; their desire for manumission and their feelings about being forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|24|33}})&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, the Qur'an refers to master and slave with the same word, ''rajul''. Later interpreters presume slaves to be spiritual equals of free Muslims. For example, verse 4:25&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|4|25}}&lt;/ref&gt; urges believers to marry 'believing maids that your right hands own' and then states: "The one of you is as the other," which the Jalaalayn interpret as "You and they are equal in faith, so do not refrain from marrying them." The human aspect of slaves is further reinforced by reference to them as members of the private household, sometimes along with wives or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|23|6}}{{Quran-usc|24|58}}{{Quran-usc|33|50}}{{Quran-usc|70|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; The Prophet ordered slave-owners to address their slaves by such euphemistic terms as "my boy" and "my girl" stemmed from the belief that God, not their masters, was responsible for the slave's status.&lt;ref&gt;Marmon in Marmon (1999), page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many common features between the institution of slavery in the Quran and that of neighboring cultures. However, the Quranic institution had some unique new features.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; [[Bernard Lewis]] states that the Qur'anic legislation brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching effects: presumption of freedom, and the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined  circumstances.&lt;ref name="L1"/&gt; According to Brockopp, the idea of using alms for the manumission of slaves appears to be unique to the Quran, assuming the traditional interpretation of verses {{Quran-usc|2|177}} and {{Quran-usc|9|60}}. Similarly, the practice of freeing slaves in atonement for certain sins appears to be introduced by the Quran (but compare Exod 21:26-7).&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; The forced prostitution of female slaves, a Near Eastern custom of great antiquity, is condemned in the Quran.&lt;ref name="Esposito" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|24|33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray Gordon notes that this ban is "of no small significance."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1989, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Brockopp writes: "Other cultures limit a master's right to harm a slave but few exhort masters to treat their slaves kindly, and the placement of slaves in the same category as other weak members of society who deserve protection is unknown outside the Qur'an. The unique contribution of the Qur'an, then, is to be found in its emphasis on the place of slaves in society and society's responsibility toward the slave, perhaps the most progressive legislation on slavery in its time."&lt;ref name="Brockopp"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maurice Middleberg, "[[Surat al-Balad|Sura 90 in the Quran]] states that the righteous path involves 'the freeing of slaves.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/opinions/faiths-unite-end-modern-slavery/index.html|title='All faiths can unite to end modern slavery|last=Middleberg|first=Maurice|date=2016-04-22|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904052731/https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/opinions/faiths-unite-end-modern-slavery/index.html|archive-date=2018-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muhammad's traditions===
The most notable of Muhammad's slaves were: [[Safiyya bint Huyayy]], whom he freed and married; [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], given to Muhammad by [[Muqawqis|a Sassanid official]], whom he freed and who may have become his wife;&lt;ref&gt;from "Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir" (Book of the Major Classes) by Ibn Sa'd's&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sirin (Islamic history)|Sirin]], Maria's sister, whom he freed and married to the poet [[Hassan ibn Thabit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastprophet.info/en/content/view/111/14/1/17/ Aydin, p.17 (citing Ibn Abdilberr, İstîâb, IV, p. 1868; Nawavî, Tahzib al Asma, I, p. 162; Ibn al Asîr, Usd al Ghâbe, VI, p. 160)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220312/http://www.lastprophet.info/en/content/view/111/14/1/17/ |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], whom Muhammad freed and [[Islamic adoptional jurisprudence|adopted as a son]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (1996), p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic jurisprudence==

===Traditional Islamic jurisprudence===

====Principles====
In [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], slavery was an exceptional condition,{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} with the general rule being a presumption of freedom (''al-'asl huwa 'l-hurriya'' — "''The basic principle is liberty''") for a person if his or her origins were unknown.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Lawful enslavement was restricted to two instances: capture in war (on the condition that the prisoner is not a Muslim), or birth in slavery. Islamic law did not recognize the classes of slave from [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] including those sold or given into slavery by themselves and others, and those indebted into slavery.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; Though a free Muslim could not be enslaved, [[Religious conversion|conversion to Islam]] by a non-Muslim slave did not require that he or she then should be liberated. Slave status was not affected by conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
In the instance of illness it would be required for the slave to be looked after. [[Manumission]] is considered a meritorious act. Based on the Quranic verse (24:33), Islamic law permits a slave to ransom himself upon consent of his master through a contract known as ''[[mukataba]]''.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]], a professor of Law specializing in Islamic jurisprudence, states that both the Qur'an and Hadith are repeatedly exhorting Muslims to treat the slaves well and that Muhammad showed this both in action and in words.&lt;ref name="Hibri"&gt;Azizah Y. al-Hibri, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Levy concurs, adding that "cruelty to them was forbidden."&lt;ref name="L77"&gt;Levy (1957) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hibri quotes the famous last speech of Muhammad and other hadiths emphasizing that all believers, whether free or enslaved, are siblings.&lt;ref name="Hibri"/&gt; Lewis explains, "the humanitarian tendency of the Qur'an and the early caliphs in the Islamic empire, was to some extent counteracted by other influences,"&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; notably the practice of various conquered people and countries Muslims encountered, especially in provinces previously under [[Roman law]]. In spite of this, Lewis also states, "Islamic practice still represented a vast improvement on that inherited from antiquity, from Rome, and from Byzantium."&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Murray Gordon writes: "It was not surprising that Muhammad, who accepted the existing socio-political order, looked upon slavery as part of the natural order of things. His approach to what was already an age-old institution was reformist and not revolutionary. The Prophet had not in mind to bring about the abolition of slavery. Rather, his purpose was to improve the conditions of slaves by correcting abuses and appealing to the conscience of his followers to treat them humanely."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1987, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of slaves as members of the family was common, according to Levy. If a slave was born and brought up in the master's household he was never sold, except in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="L77"/&gt;

====Sexual intercourse====
{{See also|Ma malakat aymanukum and sex}}
In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), ''[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]'' is the term for slaves or captives of war. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Muminun]] 6 and [[Al-Maarij]] 30 both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess", saying " أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.  Sayyid [[Abul Ala Maududi]] explains that "two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one's possession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070311085024/http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|deadurl=yes|title=Surah - AL - MUMINOON|date=11 March 2007|archivedate=11 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concubinage====
{{Slavery}}
{{see also|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}
Slave women were required mainly as concubines and menials. A Muslim slaveholder was entitled by law to the sexual enjoyment of his slave women. While free women might own male slaves, they had no such right.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The property of a slave was owned by his or her master unless a contract of freedom of the slave had been entered into, which allowed the slave to earn money to purchase his or her freedom and similarly to pay bride wealth. The marriage of slaves required the consent of the owner. Under the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools of jurisprudence male slaves could marry two wives, but the Maliki permitted them to marry four wives like the free men. According to the Islamic law, a male slave could marry a free woman but this was discouraged in practice.&lt;ref name="Sikainga"/&gt; Islam permits sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside marriage. This is referred to in the Qur'an as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum]]'' or "what your right hands possess".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2 pp. 112-113 footnote 44; Also see commentary on verses {{Quran-usc-range|23|1|6}}: Vol. 3, notes 7-1, p. 241; 2000, Islamic Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] 4:24&lt;/ref&gt; There are some restrictions on the master; he may not co-habit with a female slave belonging to his wife, neither can he have relations with a female slave if she is co-owned, or already married.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

In ancient Arabian custom, the child of a freeman by his slave was also a slave unless he was recognized and liberated by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the recognition by a master of his offspring by a slave woman was optional in Islamic society, and in the early period was often withheld. By the [[High Middle Ages]] it became normal and was unremarkable in a society where the sovereigns themselves were almost invariably the children of slave concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother receives the title of "umm walad" (''lit''. mother of a child)&lt;ref name="umm walad"&gt;''[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2424] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801050417/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2424 |date=2017-08-01 }}'' Umm al-Walad, "Mother of the son. Refers to a slave woman impregnated by her owner…", Oxford Islamic Studies Online&lt;/ref&gt;, which is an improvement in her status as she can no longer be sold. Among Sunnis, she is automatically freed upon her master's death, however for Shi'a, she is only freed if her child is still alive; her value is then deducted from this child's share of the inheritance.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; Lovejoy writes that as an ''umm walad'', they attained "an intermediate position between slave and free" pending their freedom, although they would sometimes be nominally freed as soon as they gave birth.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

There is no limit on the number of concubines a master may possess. However, the general marital laws are to be observed, such as not having sexual relations with the sister of a female slave.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt; In Islam, "men are enjoined to marry free women in the first instance, but if they cannot afford the bridewealth for free women, they are told to marry slave women rather than engage in wrongful acts."&lt;ref&gt;Nashat (1999) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga(1996), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; A slave master could have sex with his female slave only while she was not married. This attempt to require sexual exclusivity for female slaves was rare in antiquity, when female slaves generally had no claim to an exclusive sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Kecia  |last=Ali  | authorlink = Kecia Ali | year=2010 | title=Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam |publisher=Harvard University Press|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C229nbjq8TMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sikainga, "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for members of their owners' household, their neighbors, and their guests."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga (1996) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shiite jurisprudence it is unlawful for a master of a female slave to grant a third party the use of her for sexual relations.  The Shiite scholar Shaykh al-Tusi stated:ولا يجوز إعارتها للاستمتاع بها لأن البضع لا يستباح بالإعارة
"It is not permissible to loan (the slave girl) for enjoyment purpose, because sexual intercourse cannot be legitimate through loaning"&lt;ref&gt;
Shaykh al-Tusi stated in Al-Mabsut, Volume 3 page 57&lt;/ref&gt; and the Shiite scholars al-Muhaqiq al-Kurki, Allamah al-Hilli and Ali Asghar Merwarid made the following ruling: ولا تجوز استعارة الجواري للاستمتاع
"It is not permissible to loan the slave girl for the purpose of sexual intercourse"&lt;ref&gt;al-Muhaqiq al-Kurki in ''Jame'a al-Maqasid'', Volume 6 page 62, Allamah al-Hilli in ''Al-Tadkira'', Volume 2 page 210 and Ali Asghar Merwarid in ''Al-Yanabi al-Fiqhya'', Volume 17 page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[legal doctrine]] of ''kafa'a''(lit."efficiency"), the purpose of which was to ensure that a man should be at least the social equal of the woman he marries, a freedman is not as good as the son of a freedman, and he in turn not as good as the grandson of a freedman. This principle is pursued up to three generations, after which all Muslims are deemed equally free.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 85&amp;ndash;86&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis asserts that since kafa'a "does not forbid unequal marriages", it is in no sense a "Muslim equivalent of [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nuremberg Laws]] of [[Nazi Germany]] or the apartheid laws of [[South Africa]]. His purpose, he states, is not to try to set up a moral competition - to compare castration and apartheid as offenses against humanity."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph, Review of ''Race and Color in Islam'' by [[Bernard Lewis]], ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'', Vol. 5, No. 3. (Jun., 1974), pp. 368-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal status====
Within [[Islamic jurisprudence]], slaves were excluded from religious office and from any office involving jurisdiction over others.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Freed slaves are able to occupy any office within the [[Caliphate|Islamic government]], and instances of this in history include the [[Mamluk]] who ruled Egypt for almost 260 years and the [[eunuch]]s who have held military and administrative positions of note.&lt;ref name="schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; With the permission of their owners they are able to marry.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002) p.148&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]], a contemporary scholar on [[Muslim world|Islamic civilization]], asserts that because the status of slaves under Islam could only be obtained through either being a [[prisoner of war]] (this was soon restricted only to infidels captured in a [[jihad|holy war]])&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; or born from slave parents, slavery would be theoretically abolished with the expansion of Islam.&lt;ref name="schimmel" /&gt; [[Fazlur Rahman]] agrees, stating that the Qur'anic acceptance of the institution of slavery on the legal plane was the only practical option available at the time of Muhammad since "slavery was ingrained in the structure of society, and its overnight wholesale liquidation would have created problems which it would have been absolutely impossible to solve, and only a dreamer could have issued such a visionary statement."&lt;ref&gt;Fazlur Rahman, Islam, University of Chicago Press, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's reforms stipulating the conditions of enslavement seriously limited the supply of new slaves.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Murray Gordon does note: "Muhammad took pains in urging the faithful to free their slaves as a way of expiating their sins. Some [[List of Muslim scholars|Muslim scholars]] have taken this mean that his true motive was to bring about a gradual elimination of slavery. An alternative argument is that by lending the [[moral authority]] of Islam to slavery, Muhammad assured its legitimacy. Thus, in lightening the fetter, he riveted it ever more firmly in place."&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Slavery in the Arab World]." New Amsterdam Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of Islam, a plentiful supply of new slaves were brought due to rapid conquest and expansion. But as the frontiers were gradually stabilized, this supply dwindled to a mere trickle. The prisoners of later wars between Muslims and Christians were commonly ransomed or exchanged.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

According to Lewis, this reduction resulted in Arabs who wanted slaves having to look elsewhere to avoid the restrictions in the Qur'an, meaning an increase of importing of slaves from non-Muslim lands,&lt;ref name="L9010"&gt;Lewis (1990) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; primarily from Africa. These slaves suffered a high death toll.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="L9010"/&gt; [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]] states that Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in [[Arabian Peninsula]] and to a lesser degree for the whole area of the whole [[Umayyad|Umayyad Caliphate]] where slavery had existed since the most ancient times. He however notes that with the passage of time and the extension of Islam, Islam by recognizing and codifying slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Manning (1990) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory free-born Muslims could not be enslaved, and the only way that a non-Muslim could be enslaved was being captured in the course of holy war.&lt;ref name="Sikainga"&gt;Sikainga (1996) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; (In early Islam, neither a Muslim nor a Christian or Jew could be enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;John Esposito (1998) p.40&lt;/ref&gt;) Slavery was also perceived as a means of converting non-Muslims to Islam: A task of the masters was religious instruction. Conversion and assimilation into the society of the master didn't automatically lead to emancipation, though there was normally some guarantee of better treatment and was deemed a prerequisite for emancipation.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul Lovejoy (2000) p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Sunni]] authorities approved the [[manumission]] of all the "[[People of the Book]]". According to some jurists -especially among the [[Shi'a]]- only Muslim slaves should be liberated.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis(1990) 106&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, traditional propagators of [[Islam in Africa]] often revealed a cautious attitude towards proselytizing because of its effect in reducing the potential reservoir of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, "Slavery in the [[Arab world|Arab World]]." [[New Amsterdam]] Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rights and restrictions=====
"Morally as well as physically the slave is regarded in law as an inferior being," Levy writes.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, a slave possesses a composite quality of being both a person and a possession.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; The slave is entitled to receive sustenance from the master, which includes shelter, food, clothing, and medical attention. It is a requirement for this sustenance to be of the same standard generally found in the locality and it is also recommended for the slave to have the same standard of food and clothing as the master. If the master refuses to provide the required sustenance, the slave may complain to a judge, who may then penalize the master through sale of her or his goods as necessary for the slave's keep. If the master does not have sufficient wealth to facilitate this, she or he must either sell, hire out, or manumit the slave as ordered. Slaves also have the right to a period of rest during the hottest parts of the day during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Khalil b. Ishaq, quoted in Levy (1957) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from slaves is rarely viable in a court of law. As slaves are regarded as inferior in Islamic law, death at the hands of a free man does not require that the latter be killed in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Except according to Hanafis, who make a free man liable to retaliation in cases of murder&lt;/ref&gt; The killer must pay the slave's master compensation equivalent to the slave's value, as opposed to blood-money. At the same time, slaves themselves possess a lessened responsibility for their actions, and receive half the penalty required upon a free man. For example: where a free man would be subject to a hundred lashes due to pre-marital relations, a slave would be subject to only fifty. Slaves are allowed to marry only with the owner's consent. Jurists differ over how many wives a slave may possess, with the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools allowing them two, and the Maliki school allowing four. Slaves are not permitted to possess or inherit property, or conduct independent business, and may conduct financial dealings only as a representative of the master. Offices of authority are generally not permitted for slaves, though a slave may act as the leader (''[[Imam]]'') in the congregational [[salat|prayers]], and he may also act as a subordinate officer in the governmental department of revenue.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957) pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; Masters may sell, bequeath, give away, pledge, hire out or compel them to earn money.&lt;ref name="L77" /&gt;

By the view of some [[madh'hab]] (but not others), a master may compel his/her slave(s) to marriage and determine the identity of their marriage partner(s)&lt;ref&gt;Khalil bin Ishaq, II, 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachau, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mahr]] that is given for marriage to a female slave is taken by her owner, whereas all other women possess it absolutely for themselves&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manumission====
The Qur'an and Hadith, the primary Islamic texts, make it a praiseworthy act for masters to [[manumission|set their slaves free]]. There are numerous ways in which a slave may become free. One way is through expiation for certain sins committed by the master, such as involuntary [[manslaughter]] or [[perjury]]. Other ways include emancipation through becoming an ''umm walad''&lt;ref name="umm walad" /&gt;, who is freed upon her master's death along with her children, or an independent act of piety by the master, as recommended by the Quran. It is also commendable to manumit a slave who demands his freedom and is considered worthy of it; however, [[Richard Francis Burton]] states in a footnote to the "Tale of the Second Eunuch", commenting on the proposed emancipation of a slave without employable skills, that "Here the slave refuses to be set free and starve. For a master so to do without ample reasons is held disgraceful. I well remember the weeping and wailing throughout Sind when an order from Sir Charles Napier set free the negroes whom British philanthropy thus doomed to endure if not to die of hunger."&lt;ref name="RFBurton"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is the ''[[mukataba]]'' contract: Levy states that "the slave may redeem himself if his master agrees and contracts to let him go on payment of a stipulated sum of money, which may be paid in two or more instalments, or on the giving of stipulated services or other consideration. If the consideration is a sum of money, the master must grant the slave the right to earn and to own property."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L8081"&gt;Levy pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

If the master makes a declaration of the slave's freedom, whether in jest or earnest, in the presence of the slave or another, then such a declaration becomes legally binding. Similarly, the master may promise manumission (verbally or in writing) that the slave is to be freed upon the former's death. Lastly, a slave is also freed automatically if she or he comes into the possession of a master who is directly related to her or him.&lt;ref name="L8081"/&gt;

Gordon opines that the Quran in particular and Islamic jurisprudence in general have not placed a premium on manumission but held it out as one way for atonement of sin. He states that "Manumission was only one of several virtuous observances that the pious could avail themselves of and was by no means the most important,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Gordon 1987, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that other options include reaffirming faith in God and giving food to the poor. He concludes that "there was no contradiction between being a devout Muslim and a slave-owing one as well."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1987, pages 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations==
=== Abolitionism ===
The abolition movement starting in the 19th century in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/antislavery_01.shtml|title=British Anti-slavery|last=Oldfield|first=John|date=2011-02-07|website=British History in depth|publisher=BBC History|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925213603/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/antislavery_01.shtml|archive-date=2016-09-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in other Western countries influenced the slavery in Muslim lands both in doctrine and in practice.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; One of the first religious decrees comes from the two highest dignitaries of the Hanafi and Maliki rites in the Ottoman Empire. These religious authorities declared that slavery is lawful in principle but it is regrettable in its consequences. They expressed two religious considerations in their support for abolition of slavery: "the initial enslaving of the people concerned comes under suspicion of illegality by reason of the present-day expansion of Islam in their countries; masters no longer comply with the rules of good treatment which regulate their rights and shelter them from wrong-doing."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

According to Brunschvig, although the total abolition of slavery might seem a reprehensible innovation and contrary to the Qur'an and the practice of early Muslims, the realities of the modern world caused a "discernible evolution in the thought of many educated Muslims before the end of the 19th century."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; These Muslims argued that Islam on the whole has "bestowed an exceptionally favourable lot on the victims of slavery" and that the  institution of slavery is linked to the particular economic and social stage in which Islam originated. According to the influential thesis of [[Syed Ameer Ali|Ameer Ali]], Islam only tolerated slavery through temporary necessity and that its complete abolition was not possible at the time of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

According to  Brockopp, some modern interpreters have accused the medieval interpreters of having subverted the Qur'an's demand for manumission contracts (see [[Mukataba]]). They have used the dramatic change in the institution of slavery in the 7th and 8th centuries to argue that the Qur'an would not have condoned the slaving practices common in Islamic history. Others{{who|date=June 2017}} have argued that the original intent of the Qur'an, when understood properly, was to abolish slavery altogether.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

The idea that Islam only tolerated slavery due to necessity has to some extent found its way into the circle of the [[Ulema]].&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; It has been unable to gain support among the [[Wahhabi]]s.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

===Islamist opinions===
[[File:Sayyid Qutb.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sayyid Qutb]]]]

Earlier in the 20th century, prior to the "reopening" of slavery by [[Salafi]] scholars like Shaykh al-Fawzan, Islamist authors declared slavery outdated without actually clearly affirming and promoting its abolition. This has caused at least one scholar (William Clarence-Smith&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staffinfo.cfm?contactid=36] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417083811/http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staffinfo.cfm?contactid=36 |date=April 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to bemoan the "dogged refusal of [[Abul A'la Maududi|Mawlana Mawdudi]] to give up on slavery"&lt;ref name=CS-maududi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=W.

[[Sayyid Qutb]], the scholar of the Islamist [[Muslim Brotherhood]] said in his exegesis (''[[Tafsir]]'') of the Quran:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And concerning slavery, that was when slavery was a world-wide structure and which was conducted amongst Muslims and their enemies in the form of enslaving of prisoners of war. And it was necessary for Islam to adopt a similar line of practise until the world devised a new code of practise during war other than enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;in [[Fi Zilal al-Qur'an]], Surah Tawbah (3/1669) also in Tafsir of Surah Baqarah (/230), tafsir of Surah Mu'minoon (4/2455), tafsir of Surah Muhammad (6/3285)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Qutb's brother [[Muhammad Qutb]] contrasted sexual relations between Muslim slave-owners and their female slaves with (in his view), the widespread and depraved practice of casual consensual sex in contemporary Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Islam made it lawful for a master to have a number of slave-women captured in wars and enjoined that he alone may have sexual relations with them ... Europe abhors this law but at the same gladly allows that most odious form of animalism according to which a man may have illicit relations with any girl coming across him on his way to gratify his animal passions.&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, Muhammad, ''Islam, the Misunderstood Religion'', Markazi Maktabi Islami, Delhi-6, 1992 p.50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Abul A'la Maududi]] of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] has said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Islam has clearly and categorically forbidden the primitive practice of capturing a free man, to make him a slave or to sell him into slavery. On this point the clear and unequivocal words of [[Muhammad]] are as follows:&lt;blockquote style="font-size:inherit; quotes:none"&gt;"There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]]. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man, then sells him and eats this money" (al-Bukhari and Ibn Majjah).&lt;/blockquote&gt; The words of this Tradition of the Prophet are also general, they have not been qualified or made applicable to a particular nation, race, country or followers of a particular religion.&amp;nbsp;... After this the only form of slavery which was left in Islamic society was the prisoners of war, who were captured on the battlefield. These prisoners of war were retained by the Muslim Government until their government agreed to receive them back in exchange for Muslim soldiers captured by them&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;From "Human Rights in Islam" by 'Allamah Abu Al-'A'la Mawdudi. Chapter 3, subsection 5 [http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/slav3.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203193405/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/slav3.htm |date=2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Taqiuddin Al Nabhani.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]].]]
[[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], a shariah judge and founder of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] movement, gives the following explanation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Islam came, for the situations where people were taken into slavery (e.g. debt), Islam imposed Shari’ah solutions to those situations other than slavery. ... It (Islam) made the existing slave and owner form a business contract, based upon the freedom, not upon slavery ...  As for the situation of war, ...  it clarified the rule of the captive in that either they are favoured by releasing without any exchange, or they are ransomed for money or exchanged for Muslims or non-Muslim citizens of the [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;''al-Shakhsiyah al-Islamiyyah'' (The Islamic Personality) by [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], Volume 3, Slavery Section&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The website of the organization stresses that because sharia historically was responding to a contract, not the institution of slavery, a future Khilafah could not re-introduce slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khilafah.com/index.php/the-khilafah/foreign-policy/2764-the-islamic-view-on-slaves-and-slavery "The Islamic view on Slaves and Slavery"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111114656/http://www.khilafah.com/index.php/the-khilafah/foreign-policy/2764-the-islamic-view-on-slaves-and-slavery |date=2010-11-11 }}, khilafah.com 13 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, according to some scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl and William Clarence-Smith&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a "reopening"&lt;ref&gt;Abou el Fadl, ''Great Theft'', HarperSanFrancisco, c2005. p.255&lt;/ref&gt; of the issue of slavery by some conservative [[Salafi]] Islamic scholars after its "closing" earlier in the 20th century when [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] banned slavery and "most Muslim scholars" found the practice "inconsistent with Qur'anic morality."&lt;ref&gt;Abou el Fadl, ''Great Theft'', HarperSanFrancisco, c2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/Research/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Conf3_WCSmith.pdf|title=Department of Economic History|first=London School of Economics and Political|last=Science|publisher=|access-date=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603012804/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/Research/GEHN/GEHNPDF/Conf3_WCSmith.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial high-level Saudi jurist, Shaykh [[Saleh Al-Fawzan]], said in a lecture, "Slavery is a part of Islam.

'''István Orosz''' (born 24 October 1951 in [[Kecskemét]]) is a Hungarian painter, printmaker, [[graphic designer]] and animated film director. He is known for his mathematically inspired works, [[impossible objects]], [[optical illusions]], double-meaning images and [[anamorphosis|anamorphoses]]. The geometric art of István Orosz, with forced perspectives and optical illusions, has been compared to works by [[M. C. Escher]].&lt;ref&gt;"Releases - Perception &amp; Deception: The Works of István Orosz" (overview), [[Moravian College]], [[Bethlehem, PA]], December 1998, webpage: [http://www.moravian.edu/news/releases/1998/002.htm MoravianEdu-1998-2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901144422/http://www.moravian.edu/news/releases/1998/002.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Studied at the Hungarian University of Arts and Design (now [[Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design]]) in [[Budapest]] as pupil of István Balogh and [[Ernő Rubik]]. After graduating in 1975 he began to deal with theatre as stage designer and animated film as animator and film director. He is known as [[Painting|painter]], [[printmaker]], [[poster]] [[designer]], and [[illustrator]] as well. He likes to use visual [[paradox]], double meaning images and illusionistic approaches while following traditional printing techniques such as woodcutting and [[etching]]. He also tries to renew the technique of [[anamorphosis]]. He is a regular participant in the major international biennials of posters and graphic art and his works has been shown in individual and group exhibitions in [[Hungary]] and abroad. Film director at the [[PannóniaFilm]] Studio in [[Budapest]], Habil. professor at [[University of West Hungary]] in [[Sopron]], co-founder of [[Hungarian Poster Association]], member of [[Alliance Graphique International]] (AGI) and Hungarian Art Academie. He often uses [[ΟΥΤΙΣ]], or [[Utisz]], (pronounced: outis) (No one) as artist's pseudonym.

==Quotes==
*''"Utisz - It was the Homeric hero Odysseus, who fought the [[Cyclops]], had used this name, and had put out the monster's eye. I imagine that poster is nothing else but an Odysseus' gesture: some kind of attack upon the eye".''
*''"If you want to create a poster try to explain your idea in a sentence. Then try to reduce it, leave out phrases, attributes until you just have the bare essentials. When you do not need any letter at all you are ready with the poster".''
*''"... When I have drawn these impossible objects, I did hope everybody would understand my intention, the intention of a Hungarian designer at the end of the 20th century who does not tell the truth just in order to be caught in the act."'
*''"There are things I can imagine and I can draw. There are things I can imagine but I cannot draw. But, could I draw something that I cannot imagine? That interests me greatly."''

==Introduction by Guy D'Obonner==
During the last two decades - when most of the works shown here were made – the activities of the [[poster]] [[designer]], the [[printmaker]], the [[illustrator]], and the [[film director]] have completed each other. Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster usually he did it with the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, he did it with the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If we call him only a poster designer based on his functional prints, we narrow down his field of activity, we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" as a way of thinking, or if we call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz. ''([[Guy d'Obonner]]: Transfiguration of Poster - detail)''&lt;ref&gt;"Posters - István Orosz". Edited by Vladislav Rostoka, [[Rabbit &amp; Solution Studio]], [[Bratislava]], 2002, webpage: [http://mek.oszk.hu/01600/01686/html/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poster art==
István Orosz was known as [[poster]] [[designer]] in the first part of his career. He made mainly cultural posters for theatres,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Medea.jpg Theater poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070018/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Medea.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  movies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/westside2.jpg Film poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070519/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/westside2.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  galleries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/chicago.jpg Exhibition poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927071804/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/chicago.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  museums&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/shakespeare.jpg Museum poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070341/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/shakespeare.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing houses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/dekameron1%20d.jpg Book poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070053/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/dekameron1%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the [[revolutions of 1989]] in [[Eastern Europe]] he drew some [[political posters]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/koncert.jpg Political poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070404/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/koncert.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; too. His "Tovarishi Adieu" (also used with text "Tovarishi Koniec" – that means [[Comrade]]s it is over) appeared in many countries and it was known as symbolic image of changes in the area.

==His anamorphoses==
Artists who design [[anamorphosis]] (anamorphosis is Greek for "re-transformation") play with perspective to create a distorted image that appears normal only when viewed from the correct angle or with the aid of curved mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Technique of [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/lab%20d.jpg anamorphic distortion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070456/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/lab%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was often used by [[Renaissance]]-era artists. Orosz tries to renew the technique of anamorphosis and his aim is to develop it as well when he gives a meaning to the distorted image, too. It is not an amorph picture any more, but a meaningful depiction that is independent from the result that appears in the mirror&lt;ref&gt;Anamorphosis with double meanings: a landscape in the horizontal sheet of paper and portrait of [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg Jules Verne in the mirror cylinder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070312/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or viewed from a special point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Anamorphosis with double meanings: [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Shakespeare%20anamorf%20d.jpg viewed in the traditional way] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070422/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Shakespeare%20anamorf%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }} a theatre in the age of William Shakespeare.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...and the same picture [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Shakespeare%20anamorf%20a%20d.jpg viewed from a narrow angle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070003/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Shakespeare%20anamorf%20a%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }} : the portrait of Shakespeare&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach of anamorphoses is suitable for expressing more sophisticated messages, and it fits to show more amusing fun.&lt;ref&gt;Anamorphic illustration for the narrative poem by Edgar Allan Poe: [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Poe%20d.jpg "The Raven"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070214/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Poe%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Poe%20hengerrel%20d.jpg The poet in the mirror] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070159/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Poe%20hengerrel%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }} - the same illustration with a chrome-plated brass cylinder&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lansdowne portrait''' is an [[cultural icon|icon]]ic life-size portrait of [[George Washington]] painted by [[Gilbert Stuart]] in 1796. It depicts a 64-year-old Washington in his last year as [[President of the United States]]. Stuart painted the Lansdowne portrait, three copies of it, and five portraits that were closely related to it.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|175}} The most famous copy is the one in the [[East Room]] of the [[White House]].

To preclude its possible sale at auction, the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. purchased the original painting in 2001, for (the amount is rumored to be,)
$2,000,000
==History==
The Lansdowne portrait likely (and fancifully) depicts President Washington's December 7, 1795 annual address to the [[4th United States Congress|Fourth U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|172}} The highly-unpopular [[Jay Treaty]], settling claims between the United States and Great Britain left over from the Revolutionary War, had been presented for approval to the U.S. Senate earlier in the year. The Senate held a special session to debate the treaty in June, at which opposition to it had been fierce. Exactly two-thirds of the 30 senators (the minimum required under the U.S. Constitution) approved the treaty in mid-August, and Washington, who strongly supported the treaty, signed it in late August.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|172}} The President's annual address was on the first day of the next session of Congress. Washington acknowledged the struggle over the treaty and called for unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29437 George Washington - Seventh Annual Address to Congress], from The American Presidency Project.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait's paper, pen and inkwell may allude to his signing of the treaty.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|172}} There was lingering resentment in the House of Representatives, which expressed its displeasure by declining to appropriate funding for the treaty's implementation until April 1796.&lt;ref name="Miles lecture"&gt;Ellen G. Miles, ""Gilbert Stuart's 'Lansdowne' Portrait of George Washington: From Private Diplomatic Gift to State Portrait," lecture given at the National Portrait Gallery, September 25, 2014.[https://vimeo.com/133491164]&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the Lansdowne portrait was celebrated as Washington's endorsement of the Jay Treaty:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The portrait presented by the President {{sic}} to the Marquis of Lansdowne is one of the finest pictures we have seen since the death of Reynolds. The dress he wears is plain black velvet; he has his sword on, upon the hilt of which one hand rests while the other is extended, as the figure is standing and addressing the Hall of Assembly. The point of time is that when he recommended inviolable union between America and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oracle and Public Advertiser'' (London), May 15, 1797.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The December 7, 1795 address was the last that President Washington delivered to Congress ''in person''. The following year he published his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] in the newspapers, rather than delivering it to Congress.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|172}}

===Stuart===
[[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Lansdowne]] &amp;ndash; who as [[British Prime Minister]] had secured a peaceful end to the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]]&lt;ref name=www.number10.gov.uk&gt;{{cite web|last=www.number10.gov.uk|first=U.K.Government|title=Past Prime Ministers|publisher=U.K.Government|accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; commissioned Stuart to paint a portrait of George Washington. Stuart lived in England and Ireland for eighteen years, and Lansdowne may have placed the order for a portrait prior to the artist's return to the United States in early 1793.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} Stuart lived and worked in New York City for a year and a half before moving to Philadelphia in November 1794.&lt;ref name="Zygmont"&gt;
Bryan Zygmont, [https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-americas/british-colonies/early-republic/a/gilbert-stuarts-lansdowne-portrait "Gilbert Stuart's Lansdowne Portrait,"] from Khan Academy.&lt;/ref&gt; He informed his uncle in Philadelphia of his upcoming arrival: "The object of my journey is only to secure a picture of the President, &amp; finish yours."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart to Joseph Anthony, 2 November 1794, Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston. Quoted in Miles, pp. 129-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philadelphia]] served as the temporary national capital from 1790 to 1800 &amp;ndash; while Washington, D.C. was under construction. Stuart was introduced to the President in December 1794, at one of Mrs. Washington's [[President's House (Philadelphia)|Friday evening "drawingrooms."]]&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|133}} But it was not until the following fall that Washington granted him a sitting. Meanwhile, Stuart gathered orders for portraits&amp;mdash;among his papers is a document titled: "A list of gentlemen who are to have copies of the portrait of the President of the United States." and dated: "Philadelphia. April 20th, 1795."&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|87–88}} Lord Lansdowne's name was third on the list of thirty-two subscribers.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|87}}{{efn|In a September 25, 2014 lecture, Ellen G. Miles, Curator Emerita of the National Portrait Gallery, noted that others on Stuart's list of subscribers received copies of Washington head-and-bust portraits, but Lord Lansdowne received an original full-length portrait. She theorized that Lansdowne had ordered a standard portrait, but it was upgraded at Senator Bingham's suggestion (and expense) to an original and full-length portrait, a much more impressive gift.&lt;ref name="Miles lecture"/&gt;}}

According to [[Rembrandt Peale]], President Washington granted a joint sitting to Stuart and him "in the Autumn of 1795."&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|88}} Stuart was not wholly satisfied with the resulting "Vaughan-style" portrait, but still painted between twelve and sixteen copies of it.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|135}} He later claimed to have destroyed his original.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|88}} While visiting London a decade earlier, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[William Bingham]] of [[Pennsylvania]] and his wife, Anne Willing Bingham, had sat for a family portrait by Stuart (abandoned).&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|198}} The artist may have approached Mrs. Bingham for assistance in getting the President to grant him another sitting:&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|91}}

According to Rembrandt Peale, this was the only sitting that Washington granted for the Lansdowne portrait.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"&gt;Ellen Gross Miles, "George Washington (The Lansdowne Portrait)," in ''Gilbert Stuart'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2004), pp. 166-90.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}} It took place in Stuart's studio (and lodgings) in William Moore Smith's house, at 5th &amp; Chestnut Streets.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|168}} With severely limited time, Stuart was forced to concentrate on the President's head and face.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|168}} There are multiple claims as to who posed for the body of the figure, including his landlord, Smith.{{efn|In [[George Washington Parke Custis|"Wash" Custis]]'s description of Washington's annual address to Congress (either 1794 or 1795, by Thomas Jefferson's presence), he wrote: "Washington was dressed precisely as Stuart has painted him in Lord Lansdowne's full-length portrait&amp;mdash;" and then proceeded to give a detailed description. On the portrait: "The defect in the full-length is in the limbs. For the figure, a man named Smith, with whom Stuart boarded, stood&amp;mdash;a smaller man than Washington; and the hands were painted from a wax cast of Stuart's own hand, which was much smaller than Washington's." On the mouth: "Washington, at the time Stuart painted his portrait, had a set of sea-horse ivory teeth. These, just made, were too large and clumsy, and gave that peculiar appearance of the mouth seen in Stuart's picture."&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Parke Custis, ''Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington'' (New York: Derby &amp; Jackson, 1860), pp. 491, 520-23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The portrait was begun by Stuart in his Philadelphia studio and completed in his [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]] studio, the second floor of a stable some 8 miles north of the city.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|130–31}} The artist moved to Germantown in Summer 1796 to avoid distractions.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|165–66}} The Binghams had enjoyed Lord Lansdowne's hospitality in London, and persuaded Stuart to allow them to pay for the portrait.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|166, 168}} Stuart completed the Lansdowne portrait by the fall of 1796, and Senator Bingham paid his fee of $1,000.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|170}} Bingham had an ornate frame made for it, and arranged for it to shipped to England in late November. Lord Lansdowne had received the portrait by March 5, 1797, when he mentioned it in a letter.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|92}} Lansdowne's letter of thanks to Mrs. Bingham survives, but is undated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A very fine portrait of the greatest man living in a magnificent frame found its way into my hall, with no one thing left for me to do regarding it, except to thank the amiable donor of it. It is universally approv'd and admir'd, and I see with satisfaction, that there is no one who does not turn away from every thing else, to pay their homage to General Washington. Among many circumstances which contribute to enhance the value of it, I shall always consider the quarter from whence it comes as most flattering, &amp; I look forward with the greatest pleasure to the time of shewing you and Mr. Bingham where I have plac'd it.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|170}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart's first copy of the portrait was for the Binghams (now at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]), and would have been completed before the original left his studio.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt; The President and First Lady visited Germantown on January 7, 1797: "Road [rode] to German Town with Mrs. Washington to see Mr. Stuarts paintings."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds., ''The Diaries of George Washington, Volume 6'' (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1976&amp;ndash;79), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bingham copy was still in the studio on July 27, 1797, when Robert Gilmor Jr. viewed it.&lt;ref name="Gilmor"&gt;Robert Gilmor Jr., ''Memorandums Made in a Tour to the Eastern States in the Year 1797'' (Boston: Trustees of the Boston Public Library, 1892), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The William Kerin Constable copy (now at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]) was completed that same month.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|178}} The Gardiner Baker copy (now at the White House) is presumed to have been the copy commissioned by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] in September 1796, likely as a diplomatic gift to France;{{efn|Ellen G. Miles has a theory as to why Charles Cotesworth Pinckney commissioned and paid for, but never retrieved his copy of the Lansdowne portrait from Gilbert Stuart's studio.&lt;br&gt;[[James Monroe]] was Minister to France in 1795, when the Jay Treaty was signed. France was then at war with Great Britain, and despite his best efforts, Monroe could not convince the French government that this was a benign treaty that would not affect Franco-American relations. President Washington recalled Monroe, and nominated Pinckney as his successor. Pinckney was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in September 1796, and arrived in Paris in November.&lt;br&gt;The [[French Directory]] refused to accept Pinckney's credentials, and negotiations between the countries broke down when French officials demanded a substantial bribe, in what became known as the [[XYZ Affair]].&lt;br&gt;Miles's theory is that Pinckney's copy of the Lansdowne portrait was intended as a diplomatic gift from the U.S. to France. Pinckney's deliberate humiliation and the suspension of diplomatic relations between the countries (for nearly 5 years) caused those plans (and the portrait) to be abandoned. Supporting evidence for this theory is that Pinckney later sought reimbursement from Secretary of State Timothy Pickering for the $500 that he paid to Stuart for the portrait.&lt;ref name="Miles lecture"/&gt;}} and resold by Stuart to Baker by December 1797.&lt;ref name="Stretch"&gt;Bonnie Barrett Stretch, "The White House Washington, If Stuart Didn't Paint It, Who Did?"

==Provenance==
&lt;blockquote&gt;After the death of Lord Lansdowne, his pictures were sold by auction. The ''Washington'' was purchased by Samuel Williams, an English {{sic}} merchant, for $2,000. Williams subsequently became insolvent, and his creditors disposed of the ''Washington'' by a lottery. Forty tickets were sold, at fifty guineas each. The picture fell to Mr. J. Delaware Lewis, a nephew of Mr. William D. Lewis, of Philadelphia. But few Americans had ever seen the picture, and Mr. William D. Lewis, who was Chairman of the Committee on Art, obtained the loan of it from his nephew for the [[1876 Centennial Exposition|Centennial Exhibition]]. It was sent out with the loan collection from England, unpacked at [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], and hung up in the British section before its arrival was known to the Fine Arts Committee. An effort was subsequently made to have it transferred to the American section, but it was unsuccessful. At the close of the Exhibition, it was returned to its owner in England.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;George Champlin Mason, ''The Life and Works of Gilbert Stuart'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1894).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description and Analysis==
[[File:Lansdowne portrait table leg.png|140px|thumb|left|The table leg may have been inspired by a wooden [[ceremonial mace]] used by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] (the U.S. House symbol was itself inspired by the Roman ''[[fasces]]''). The House mace was a bundle of tied reeds topped with a [[bald eagle]], an American symbol.]]
[[File:Gilbert Stuart - George Washington (detail of book labels) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Detail of the book bindings in the White House's copy of the Lansdowne portrait. "UNITED STATES" is spelled as "UNITED SATES" to distinguish the copy.]]
The painting is full of symbolism, drawn from American and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbols of the [[Roman Republic]]. Stuart painted Washington from life, showing him standing up, dressed in a black [[velvet]] suit with an outstretched hand held up in an [[Eloquence|oratorical]] manner. Behind Washington is a row of two [[Doric column]]s, with another row to the left. Wrapped around and between the columns are red tasseled drapes.

Washington's suit is plain and simple, and the [[sword]] he holds on his left side is a dress sword and not a battle sword (symbolizing a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]], rather than a [[monarchy]] or [[military dictatorship]]). In the sky, storm clouds appear on the left while a [[rainbow]] appears on the right, signifying the [[American Revolutionary War]] giving way to the peace and prosperity of the new [[United States]] after the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. The medallion at the top of the chair shows the red, white, and blue colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].

On and under the tablecloth-draped table to the left are two [[book]]s: ''Federalist''&amp;mdash;probably a reference to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]''&amp;mdash;and ''Journal of Congress''&amp;mdash;the ''[[Congressional Record]]''. Another five books are under the table: the three to the right are ''General Orders'', ''American Revolution'', and ''Constitutional Bylaws''&amp;mdash;symbolizing Washington's leadership as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] and [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]].

The [[pen]] and [[paper]] on the table signify the [[rule of law]]. The table's leg is shaped like a [[fasces]], an ancient Roman symbol of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[authority]] (''[[imperium]]''). On the far left of the table is a [[silver]] [[inkwell]], emblazed with [[Coat of Arms of George Washington|George Washington's coat of arms]] (see [[Syng inkstand]]). A white [[quill]] rests upon silver [[dog]]s, ancient symbols of [[loyalty]]. Behind these on the table is a large black [[hat]].

Washington's unusually clenched [[facial expression]] comes from his famous [[Dentures|false teeth]]. [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]'s [[marble]] [[sculpture]] of Washington shows a more natural expression. Stuart wrote: "When I painted him [Washington], he had just had a set of false teeth inserted, which accounts for the constrained expression so noticeable about the mouth and lower part of the face ... Houdon's [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] does not suffer from this defect."

==Alternate versions==
===Constable-Hamilton portrait===
Stuart painted a 1797 seated portrait of Washington, based on the Lansdowne. William Kerin Constable, who commissioned the Lansdowne copy now at the Brooklyn Museum, also commissioned the seated version.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|98}} Constable presented it to [[Alexander Hamilton]] in 1797.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|98}} The portrait remained in the Hamilton family until 1896, when it was bequeathed to the [[Lenox Library (New York City)|Lenox Library]].&lt;ref name="CBMAA"/&gt; The Lenox Library later merged with the [[New York Public Library]]. The portrait was auctioned at Sotheby's NY, 30 November 2005, lot 3, and sold for $8,136,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2005/american-paintings-drawings-sculpture-including-property-from-the-new-york-public-library-astor-lenox-and-tilden-foundations-n08134/lot.3.html George Washington (Constable-Hamilton Portrait)], from Sotheby's NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constable-Hamilton Portrait is now in the collection of the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]], in [[Bentonville, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="CBMAA"&gt;[http://collection.crystalbridges.org/objects/193/george-washington-the-constablehamilton-portrait?ctx=cf2d7cdf-4879-41e8-9884-d94fb9947503&amp;idx=2 George Washington - The Constable-Hamilton Portrait], from Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Munro-Lenox portrait===
Stuart made several changes for the Munro-Lenox portrait ({{circa}}1800):&lt;ref&gt;[https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=D52X1907708G8.5587&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!47905~!2&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Lenox&amp;index=.GW&amp;uindex=&amp;oper=&amp;term=Stuart,+Gilbert&amp;index=.AW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1 George Washington - The Munro-Lenox Portrait], from SIRIS.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington's head is slightly turned, and his hand is on the table, rather than gesturing into the air. The President looks directly at the viewer, rather than off to the side, which makes it a more compelling image than the Lansdowne.&lt;ref name="Miles"/&gt; The head appears to be based on Stuart's Athenaeum portrait (the image on the one-dollar bill).&lt;ref name="Miles"/&gt; The wall behind the President is lowered, allowing for a more dramatic scene of the sun breaking through the storm clouds. After 135 years of ownership by the [[New York Public Library]], the Munro-Lenox portrait was deassessioned and offered for auction in 2005.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.5.html/2005/american-paintings-drawings-sculpture-including-property-from-the-new-york-public-library-astor-lenox-and-tilden-foundations-n08134 George Washington - The Munro-Lenox Portrait], from Sotheby's New York.&lt;/ref&gt; It failed to sell at auction, and was sold in a private sale for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/05/arts/design/05voge.html "A Pair of New Owners for an Old President,"] ''The New York Times'', January 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart painted three full-size copies of the Munro-Lenox Portrait, one for the Connecticut State House in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]; and two for Rhode Island&amp;mdash;one for the State House in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and the other for [[Old Colony House]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]].&lt;ref name="Miles"&gt;Ellen Gross Miles, "George Washington (The Munro-Lenox Portrait)," in ''Gilbert Stuart'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2004), pp. 186-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bateau-Lavoir, circa 1910.jpg|thumb|350px|Le Bateau-Lavoir, c.1910]]
'''Le Bateau-Lavoir''' ("The Boat Wash-house") is the nickname for a building in the [[Montmartre]] district of the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]] that is famous in art history as the residence and meeting place for a group of outstanding early 20th-century artists, men of letters, theater people, and art dealers. It is located at No. 13 Rue Ravignan at Place Emile Goudeau, just below the [[Place du Tertre]]. 

A fire destroyed most of the building in May 1970 and only the façade remained, but it was completely rebuilt in 1978.

==History==
[[Image:Place Émile-Goudeau, Paris 20 May 2014.jpg|thumb|260px|Place Émile Goudeau in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]]]
Formerly a ballroom and piano factory, Bateau Lavoir was [[Squatting|squatted]] and divided into twenty small workshops in 1889. Distributed along a corridor, small rooms were linked without heating and with a single point of water. &lt;ref name=ParisDigest&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/montmartre.htm |title=Montmartre |author= |year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The name "Le Bateau-Lavoir" was coined by French poet [[Max Jacob]]. The building was dark and dirty, almost seeming to be scrap pile rather than a dwelling. On stormy days, it swayed and creaked, reminding people of washing-boats on the [[Seine River]], hence the name.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Darran |date=2013 |title=Serge Gainsbourg's Histoire de Melody Nelson |url= |location= |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |page= |isbn=9781623562878 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building stands on a small cobblestone square that was known as Place Ravignan. In 1911, it was rechristened Place Émile Goudeau for [[Émile Goudeau]] (1849–1906), a popular novelist, poet, and journalist who founded [[Les Hydropathes]], a renowned and famous literary club. The square now has a [[Wallace fountain]] and is planted with [[horse chestnut]] trees.

[[Maxime Maufra]] (1863–1918) was the first noted artist to take up residence in Bateau-Lavoir, around 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/modern_painting/bateau_lavoir.htm|title=Bateau-Lavoir|last=|first=|date=|website=www.serdar-hizli-art.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kees van Dongen]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] took up residence between 1900 and 1904. After 1904 more artists and writers moved in, including [[Otto van Rees (artist)|Otto van Rees]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Pierre Mac Orlan]], [[Juan Gris]], [[André Salmon]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Max Jacob]] and [[Pierre Reverdy]].

It became an unofficial club that included artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Marie Laurencin]], Modigliani, [[Jean-Paul Laurens]], [[Maurice Utrillo]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[María Blanchard]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Louis Marcoussis]]; writers [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Gustave Coquiot]], Cremnitz (Maurice Chevrier), [[Paul Fort]], André Warnod, [[Raymond Radiguet]], and [[Gertrude Stein]]; actors [[Charles Dullin]], [[Harry Baur]], and [[Gaston Modot]]; and art dealers [[Ambroise Vollard]], {{Ill|Clovis Sagot|fr}}, [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], and [[Berthe Weill]].

While residing at the Bateau-Lavoir Picasso painted works such as ''[[Garçon à la pipe]]'' (''Boy with a Pipe'') in 1905, and one of his most noted works, ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in 1907, considered by art historians as a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] painting (the precursor of a movement that became known as [[Cubism]]).

Following the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, creative artists living at the Bateau-Lavoir and in the neighborhood began moving elsewhere, mainly to [[Montparnasse]].

One night, [[Amedeo Modigliani]] destroyed a number of his friends' paintings while in an alcoholic rage in the Bateau-Lavoir, according to memoirs of his daughter, [[Jeanne Modigliani|Jeanne]].

'''License-free software''' is [[computer software]] that is not explicitly in the [[public domain]], but the software owner has not made explicit the terms of the [[software license|license]] which makes the software fully [[copyright]] protected according to the [[Berne convention]].

== Examples ==

Examples of license-free software formerly included programs written by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], such as [[qmail]], [[djbdns]], [[daemontools]], and [[ucspi-tcp]]. Bernstein held the copyright and distributed these works without license until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040622043020/http://qmail.org/not-open-source.html "qmail is not open source"] - an article published by Russell Nelson, OSI board member in 2004&lt;/ref&gt; From December 28, 2007 onwards, he started placing his software in the [[public domain]] with an explicit [[waiver]] statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |year=2007
 |url=http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html
 |title=Frequently asked questions from distributors
 |accessdate=2008-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |year=2007
 |url=http://cr.yp.to/qmail/dist.html
 |title=Information for distributors
 |accessdate=2008-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, small [[Scripting language|script]]s are frequently released without specifying a license.  For example, the website Userscripts.org hosts more than 52,000 [[Greasemonkey]] user scripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://userscripts.org/scripts 
 |title=Scripts &amp;mdash; Userscripts.org 
 |accessdate=2010-06-29 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506055146/http://userscripts.org/scripts 
 |archivedate=May 6, 2014 
}} &lt;/ref&gt; the majority of which have no specified license.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Similarly, github reported in 2015 that 85% of the projects it hosts are unlicensed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-github-kids-still-dont-care-about-open-source/ the-github-kids-still-dont-care-about-open-source] on techrepublic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights for users ==

On his [http://cr.yp.to/softwarelaw.html Software users' rights] web page, Bernstein explains his belief that under the terms of copyright law itself software users are always allowed to modify software for their own personal use, regardless of [[Software license agreement|license agreements]].  He says '"If you think you need a license from the copyright holder, you've been bamboozled by Microsoft. As long as you're not distributing the software, you have nothing to worry about."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cr.yp.to/softwarelaw.html|title=Software user's rights |work=yp.to}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also says that software users are allowed to back up, to compile, and to run the software that they possess.

He further says that ''"since it's not [[copyright infringement]] for you to apply a [[patch (computing)|patch]], it's also not copyright infringement for someone to give you a patch,"'' noting the case of ''[[Galoob v. Nintendo]]'' as precedent.  Thus modified versions of license-free software can legally be distributed in [[source code]] form in whatever way that the original can, by distributing a [[patch (computing)|patch]] alongside it.

== Reception and discussion ==

Advocates of license-free software, such as Bernstein, argue that [[software license]]s are harmful because they restrict the freedom to use software, and copyright law provides enough freedom without the need for licenses. Though having some restrictions, these licenses allow certain actions that are disallowed by copyright laws in some jurisdictions. If a license tries to restrict an action allowed by a copyright system, by Bernstein's argument those restrictions can be ignored. In fact, Bernstein's "non-license" of verbatim retransmission of source code is very similar in nature.

Similar positions on licenses are voiced by [[Free culture movement|Free culture]] activist [[Nina Paley]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ninapaley.com/2010/11/06/driving-without-a-license/ Driving Without a License?] on ninapaley.com ''"I can’t work up enthusiasm for any license today."'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[Luis Villa]] argued similarly negative about the license usage of "open source", when the small number projects licensed on [[GitHub]] were noticed, identifying a "[[Post Open Source]] movement against the (license) [[permission culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lu.is/blog/2013/01/27/taking-post-open-source-seriously-as-a-statement-about-copyright-law/ taking-post-open-source-seriously-as-a-statement-about-copyright-law/] on lu.is (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Liverpool]] has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from [[City of Westminster|Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Britain: Liverpool |publisher=HistoricBritain.com |url=http://www.historicbritain.com/results.aspx?showmessage=true&amp;location=liverpool&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples include works by [[George Frampton]], [[Goscombe John]], [[Thomas Thornycroft]], [[Charles Bell Birch]], [[Richard Westmacott]], [[Francis Chantrey]], [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]], [[Thomas Brock]] and [[F.W.

While statues and sculpture are dotted throughout the inner city, there are four primary groupings: inside and around [[St George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]]; in [[St John's Gardens]];&lt;ref&gt;dubbed "Liverpool's alfresco [[Valhalla]]", every statue inside is listed, together with the walls and gatepiers&lt;/ref&gt; around the [[Pier Head]]; and around the Palm House at [[Sefton Park]]. Smaller groups are found in Old Hall Street/Exchange Flags and in and around [[The Oratory]].

The ''[[Victoria Monument (Liverpool)|Queen Victoria Monument]]'' at Derby Square, an ensemble of 26 bronze figures by [[C. J. Allen (sculptor)|C. J. Allen]], is described in the Liverpool ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guide]]'' as one of the most ambitious British monuments to the Queen.&lt;ref name=Pevsner&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharples |first1=Joseph |last2=Pollard |first2=Richard |title=Liverpool |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQLDM9oekgC&amp;pg=PA149 |accessdate=February 4, 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0300102581 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Machines of the Isle of Nantes''' (Les Machines de l'île) is an artistic, touristic and cultural project based in [[Nantes]], [[France]]. In the old covered buildings of the former shipyards in Nantes that were at one time used for ship construction (''les nefs''), and later used as business sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.iledenantes.com/fr/projets/63-les-nefs.html |title=Réhabilitation des Nefs du site des Chantiers navals. |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Machines of the Isle are created by two artists, [[François Delarozière]] (of ''[[La Machine (production company)|La Machine]]'' production company) and Pierre Orefice (of ''Manaus'' association).

The projects aim to promote the city's image and intend to build an identity for it as a creative metropolis of dream and of fantasy. The site was opened to the public on 1 July 2007.

==Exhibits==

The Great Elephant (2007) is a mechanical elephant, {{convert|12|m}} and {{convert|8|m}} meters wide, made from 45 tons of wood and steel. It can take up to 49 passengers for a 45-minute walk.  It is an inexact replica of [[The Sultan's Elephant]] from [[Royal de Luxe]], which toured the world from 2005 to 2007; the main difference being that this elephant is designed to carry spectators.

The Marine Worlds Carousel (2012) is a huge carousel, rising nearly 25m high and measuring 20m in diameter. It will feature 35 moving underwater creatures on three levels: the ocean floor, the depths, and sea and boats. Visitors will be able to move about amidst a ballet of aquatic animals and sea carriages, as well as climb aboard and guide the movements of the Machines.

[[Image:Les Machines - branche prototype arbre aux oiseaux.JPG|thumb|upright|The branch prototype of the Heron Tree]]

The Heron Tree (2014) is a steel structure 45 meters in diameter and 28 meters in height, topped with two herons.  The project plans to allow visitors to climb either onto the back or onto the wings of the birds for a circular flight over the hanging gardens of the tree.

The Machine Gallery is an exhibition place to illustrate the background story of the machines.  Some visitors are invited to control marine animals or the European Flight Test Center. The entire process of the construction is on display by sketches, models and films.  In July 2008, three new machines were scheduled to be added into the gallery.

The Workshop is the site of fabrication for people to observe the ongoing building process. Today, the construction of the Marine Worlds occupies one part of the workshop.

[[Image:Kaigetsudo Ando Yasunori - Bijin.jpg|upright|right|thumb|A ''[[bijinga]]'' hanging scroll painting by [[Kaigetsudō Ando]].]]
'''''Nikuhitsu-ga''''' (肉筆画) is a form of [[Japanese painting]] in the ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' art style. The [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]] of this genre have become so famous in the West as to become almost synonymous with the term "ukiyo-e", but most ''ukiyo-e'' artists were painters as well as printmakers, with much the same style and subjects. Some turned to painting at the end of a career in prints, while some, like [[Miyagawa Chōshun]] and a number of the artists of the [[Kaigetsudō school]], never made prints and only worked in paintings.

Though advances in printing technology advanced over the course of the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), allowing for the production of more and more elaborate and colorful prints, the medium of painting always allowed a greater degree of freedom to the artist, and involved a much larger product in any case; the paintings of many ''ukiyo-e'' artists survive today and are known for their bright colors, attention to detail, and bold brush strokes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2989">The '''Oslo Conservatory of Music''' ({{lang-no|Musikkonservatoriet i Oslo}}) was a music school in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

The school was established by [[Ludvig Mathias Lindeman]] and his son [[Peter Brynie Lindeman]] in 1883 in Christiania (as Oslo was then called) and was named the Organist School ({{lang-no|Organistskolen}}).&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. 1961. ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', vol. 9. Kassel: Bärenreiter, p. 1583.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 it had 174 students and was renamed the Music and Organist School. Peter Brynie Lindeman took over leadership of the school after his father's death in 1887. The school was renamed again in 1892 to the Christiania Music Conservatory, and it was the only institution of its kind in Norway until 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nmh.no/om_musikkhogskolen/musikkhogskolens_historie Norges musikkhøgskole: Musikkhøgskolens historie.]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter's son [[Trygve Lindeman]] (1896–1979), who studied music in Stockholm, became a teacher at the school in 1921 and became its head in 1930. Trygve Lindeman retired in the 1960s and management was transferred to the Lindeman Foundation ({{lang-no|Lindemans Legat}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://nbl.snl.no/Trygve_Lindeman ''Norsk biografisk leksikon'': Trygve Lindeman.]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1969 to 1973, the conservatory was operated in a partnership between the foundation and the government. The school offered a mix of professional training of musicians, and amateur education for children and adults. The conservatory closed in 1973, when the [[Norwegian Academy of Music]] was established.

The Conservatory of Music Archives were administered by the Lindeman Foundation until 2013, when they were transferred to the [[National Archives of Norway]]. The archives consist of teaching records with student and teacher schedules, evening performances by students, the music conservatory society, and a series of leaving assessments of students. It also contains some accounting records, including student payments and salary records. The materials cover the period from the school's establishment in 1883 until it started being shut down in 1969/70.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1426">'''Prophetic dance''' is a [[ritual dance]] in which the purpose is to obtain a communication from or to [[God]] (gods)  [[spirit]]s in order to receive a favorable response (rain and good harvests, for example). Is also present in modern [[Christian culture]], in which the term is fixed.

==Christian faith==

"Prophetic Dance" and or movements in the church can be classified in two distinct forms.
The first type most commonly used in conjunction with pageantry, presentation and performance primarily. Flags, banners, and processionals which are just a few ways to be used to minister to God. This type of ministry can have profoundly prophetic overtones but is still geared primarily for the benefit of God.
The second avenue in which prophetic dance or movement can be used is whereby the vehicle/person being used becomes the minister to and for the benefit of the people. Believers feel that dancing or any movement inspired by God can and will become His voice at that moment. They further subscribe to the belief that an experienced person not meaning in dance vocabulary but relationally with God can use this medium to heal, deliver and set people free from all types of sickness and disease. The Prophetic arts is described as God using our gifts and talents to reveal His heart.

A '''receiving vault''' or '''receiving tomb''',{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}} sometimes also known as a '''public vault''', is a structure designed to temporarily store dead bodies in winter months when the ground is too frozen to dig a permanent [[grave]] in a [[cemetery]]. Technological advancements in excavation, embalming, and refrigeration have rendered the receiving vault obsolete.

==About the receiving vault==

===Development and use===
The receiving vault came into use in parts of the world such as northern Europe, northern North America, and far southern South America, where frozen ground made it difficult or impossible to dig graves during the winter months. In such areas, the receiving vault was used to temporarily store bodies until warmer weather permitted digging.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}} Receiving vaults were also used as a temporary burial site while an elaborate [[mausoleum]] or under ground [[crypt]] was being constructed to house the remains. Occasionally they were used to temporarily bury the remains of an individual until a decision was made regarding a permanent place of burial, or until the family had the funds to arrange for a permanent place of burial.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=110}}

In times of epidemics, in which large numbers of people could die within days of one another, receiving vaults were often used to hold remains until such time as individual or mass graves could be dug.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=110}} Disease-bearing corpses were also often stored in the receiving vault until such time as authorities believed it was safe to handle them.{{sfn|Cook|2013|page=111}} Some cemeteries, however, barred the placement of diseased remains in the receiving vault for fear that the vault would become contaminated.{{sfn|Milano|2011|page=66}}{{sfn|Young|2003|page=96}}

Receiving vaults largely ceased to be built once powered digging equipment, such as the [[steam shovel]] and [[backhoe]], made it possible to dig graves in winter months.{{sfn|Young|2003|page=32}}

===Types of receiving vaults===
The receiving vault was most commonly seen from the 1800s into the early 1900s.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}} The earliest receiving vaults were simple underground chambers dug out of hills.  Where the ground was level, the receiving vault was dug into the earth, and a mound heaped over it to mimic a hill.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}}  Receiving vaults stored coffins or bodies in loculi, or shelves, set into the walls of the vault. The interiors were simple, and often plain, with heavy lockable doors to prevent entry by [[Grave robbery|grave robbers]] or [[Body snatching|body snatchers]].{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=108}}

Receiving vaults built from the mid-1800s onward could be either above-ground or below-ground, and ranged from the simple structure with [[Loculus (architecture)|loculi]] (wall niches) for coffins to beautifully decorated, large, and ornate structures. Some cemeteries co-located a [[chapel]] (either next to or above) with the receiving vault to make it easier to hold a funeral in conjunction with the vault's use. The cost of constructing and operating the receiving vault was usually borne by the cemetery. Receiving vaults were usually located toward the center or the rear of a cemetery.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caparn|first=Harold A.|title=Modern Meditations Among the Tombs|newspaper=Landscape Architecture Magazine|date=July 1911|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7lCAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22receiving%20vault%22%20cemetery&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=%22receiving%20vault%22%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small cemeteries usually used a small, subterranean receiving vault, while larger burying grounds with more income built larger underground or above-ground structures.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=108}}

Known for his contributions to philosophical [[aesthetics]] and the emerging field of somaesthetics, currently he is the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities and Professor of Philosophy at [[Florida Atlantic University]].

==Biography and career==

Richard Shusterman was born on December 3, 1949, to a Jewish family living in [[Philadelphia]], USA. At the age 16 he left his home and went to [[Israel]], where he continued his education, studying English and philosophy at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. There he received a B.A. degree in English and Philosophy, and later an M.A. degree in philosophy (both degrees awarded magna cum laude). 
After teaching at different Israeli academic institutions, and receiving tenure at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev with an episode as a visiting fellow at [[St John's College, Oxford|St. John's College]], [[Oxford University]] during academic year 1984/85, Shusterman became an Associate Professor of Philosophy at [[Temple University]], [[Philadelphia]], USA in 1986. He was granted tenure in 1988 and promoted to full professor in 1991. He then served as chair of the philosophy department between the years of 1998–2004.
In 2004 Richard Shusterman left Temple University to become the [http://www.fau.edu/humanitieschair/ Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities] at [[Florida Atlantic University]], [[Boca Raton]], where he also holds the rank of Professor in the departments of Philosophy and English.
Richard Shusterman has been married twice. From his first marriage in Israel, he has two sons and a daughter. He has one daughter from his second marriage, which ended in 2013.

During his years at the University of Jerusalem, Shusterman focused on [[analytic philosophy]]. The interest carried over with his doctoral dissertation at Oxford University; ''The Object of Literary Criticism'' which he wrote at St. John's College under the supervision of [[J. O. Urmson]] and defended in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Shusterman|date=|year=1979|title=The object of literary criticism|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:35aaee34-ecdb-45fd-8922-745efdf3403f|journal=|language=en|publisher=Oxford Research Archive|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published under the original title in 1984.
1988 saw the publication of Shusterman's second book, [[T. S. Eliot]] and the Philosophy of Criticism, and with it came a turn in his philosophical focus as well. Influenced by the work that produced the book and personal experiences, Shusterman's attention moved from analytic philosophy to [[pragmatism]]. He also began work to develop his own theory of pragmatist aesthetics; based on [[John Dewey]]’s [[aesthetics]] but augmented by the argumentative methods and tools of analytic philosophy.
His third book published, Pragmatist Aesthetics in 1992, brought a big breakthrough in Shusterman’s academic career. The book’s original approach to the problems of definition of art, organic wholes, interpretation, popular art, and the ethics of taste brought him international fame as the book was translated into 14 languages and several editions were published. Shusterman’s position was further strengthened by three subsequent publications: Practicing Philosophy in 1997, Performing Live in 2000, and Surface and Depth in 2002; in which he continued the pragmatist tradition, raising significant interest, provoking numerous critiques and stimulating debates not only among professional philosophers, but in the areas of literary and cultural studies as well.
In Practicing Philosophy, Shusterman introduces his concept of ‘somaesthetics’, which he elaborates in greater detail in Performing Live. Somaesthetics is the focus of Shusterman's two subsequent books, Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics (2008) and Thinking through the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics (2012). The first of these books, translated into seven languages, helped establish somaesthetics as an international, interdisciplinary project involving scholars from fields beyond philosophy, while the second book consolidated this movement toward the interdisciplinary approach by applying somaesthetics to various arts, and cultural practices.

In 2007, as a part of his project of developing somaesthetics, Shusterman established the [http://www.fau.edu/bodymindculture/ Center for Body, Mind, and Culture] at FAU.  He is a member of many editorial boards and has been allocated important grants and fellowships for his research; from the National Endowment of the Humanities, the [[Fulbright Commission]], and the [[Humboldt Foundation]].

One of the important factors influencing Shusterman's philosophy has been his international career. For instance, his work in France with [[Pierre Bourdieu]], the [[Sorbonne]], and the [[College International de Philosophie]] has allowed his pragmatism to engage and deploy the contemporary French philosophical tradition. His Fulbright Professorship in [[Berlin]] enabled his pragmatism to intersect more closely with contemporary German philosophy. Similarly, his years as a visiting research professor in [[Hiroshima]], Japan and in [[Beijing]] and [[Shandong]] in China facilitated his study of [[Asian philosophy]] and [[Zen]] practice.

Shusterman philosophy stretches beyond the confines of professional academic life. In 1995, he was a delegate member of the [[UNESCO]] project Philosophy and Democracy in the World, and for several years he directed the UNESCO project MUSIC: Music, Urbanism, Social Integration and Culture. In 2012 he prepared a project commissioned by UNESCO that aims to use the internet to stimulate international youth to immerse in dialogue about peace and violence, through the medium of art.  Recalling the classical Greek concept of education, the project is named PAIDEIA, an acronym that stands for Peace through Art and Internet Dialog for Education and Intercultural Association.  On a more local level, during the years 1998-2004, he organized and hosted a public discussion forum, titled “Dialogues on the Square”, at Philadelphia's main [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] bookstore, at Rittenhouse Square.  In 2002, he received his professional certification as a [[Feldenkrais]] practitioner, and he has worked since as a somatic educator and therapist.

==Philosophical work==

===Shusterman's place in the contemporary pragmatism===
Contemporary pragmatism can be divided into two sub-fields; the neo-classical and the [[Neopragmatism|neo-analytical]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., T. Rockmore, “On Classical and Neo-Analytic Forms of Pragmatism”, ''Metaphilosophy'' vol. 36, no. 3, April, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has been well described by Richard Rorty, as an amalgam of the elements of classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, which is sometimes supplemented, especially in Rorty's case, by the ideas of continental thinkers like Martin Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., R. Rorty, “Truth without Correspondence to Reality”, in  ''Philosophy and Social Hope'' (London: Penguin 1999), p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The former, represented, among others, by Susan Haack, is more conservative in its development of the classical tradition and adopts a critical stance toward Rorty's interpretation thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. S. Haack, “Pragmatism, Old and New”, ''Contemporary Pragmatism'', vol. 1, no. 1, June, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming this description is correct, Shusterman's pragmatism lies somewhere in the middle between the above-mentioned positions. Although his analytic background and acceptance of some of Rorty's ideas (he even subsumes his and Rorty's thought under a common category of “reconstructivist genealogical-poetic pragmatism”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and Culture: Margolis and Rorty”, in ''Surface and Depth. Dialectics of Criticism and Culture'', (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) seemingly make him a neo-analytic pragmatist, the stress he puts on the importance of the notion of experience, which Rorty would like to substitute with the notion of language, chimes perfectly with the neo-classical stance.

Besides classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, Shusterman's interests touch varied traditions and disciplines: continental sociology ([[Pierre Bourdieu]]&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., R. Shusterman, “Cultural Analysis and the Limits of Philosophy: The Case of Bourdieu” in ''Surface and Depth''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and philosophy ([[Michel Foucault]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Care of the Self: The Case of Foucault”, ''Monist'', 83, 2000; R. Shusterman “Entertainment: A Question for Aesthetics”, ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 43, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;), Western body therapy ([[Moshe Feldenkrais]], [[F. Matthias Alexander]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “The Somatic Turn” in ''Performing Live'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as East-Asian thought ([[Confucius]]).&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and East-Asian Thought”, ''Metaphilosophy'', 35, 2004; R. Shusterman, “Pragmatist Aesthetics and East-Asian Philosophy”, ''Naked Punch'' (online edition), May, 2006; http://www.nakedpunch.com/shustermanchina.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

This diversity of interests and inspirations finds its reflection in the scope of Shusterman's philosophical work which embraces not only aesthetics, but also metaphysics, ethics, philosophy of language, political theory as well as metaphilosophy; in which he advocates the idea of philosophy as the art of living.

===Experience===

Experience serves as a basic category in Shusterman's pragmatism, both in terms of methodology (the pragmatist should always work from experience &lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, ''Performing Live'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as ontology or epistemology (experience “is a transactional nexus of interacting energies connecting the embodied self and its environing world”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Intellectualism and the Field of Aesthetics”, ''Revue Internationale de Philosophie'',  220, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) but contrary to John Dewey, Shusterman does not engage in constructing a general metaphysical conception. He has, however, made significant comments on Dewey's insights &lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism Between Aesthetic Experience and Aesthetic Education”, ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 22, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and defends Dewey's idea of immediate, nondiscursive experience against the criticism put forward by Richard Rorty.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, "Somatic Experience. Foundation or Reconstruction?", in ''Practicing Philosophy: Pragmatism and the Philosophical Life'' (New York: Routledge,1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Rorty shares Dewey's commitment to debunk epistemological [[foundationalism]], he (Rorty) believes that the notion of language is better suited to achieve this goal, than the notion of immediate, non-discursive experience preferred by Dewey. Rorty further says that Dewey's theory itself collapses into a version of foundationalism, where immediate, non-discursive experience serves as evidence for particular knowledge claims.

To this, Shusterman replies that:
(a) The anti-foundationalist thrust of the notion of language is not as clear as Rorty sees it (in fact language has been frequently used as a foundationalist category)
(b) Dewey never really intended his theory of experience to be a kind of epistemological foundationalism, but rather wanted to celebrate the richness and value of immediate experience, including “the immediate dimension of somatic experience” and to emphasize the positive role such experience can play in improving the quality of human life. (The inspiration of body theorist-therapist F. M. Alexander is important here). Although he argues that Dewey's theory was ultimately spoiled by a kind of foundationalism (not the one Rorty accuses Dewey of but rather one asserting that the specific quality of immediate experience is the glue that makes coherent thought possible),
Shusterman believes that the philosophical value of experience can and should be reaffirmed in an anti-foundationalist form.

In Shusterman's and, also, Dewey's opinion, the eastern meditation practices repair perception for understanding our dependence on the society's moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, [[Wilfrid Sellars]]’s critique of the myth of the given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the fact that we can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation has been one of the reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.

===Definitions of art===

Shusterman also addresses the philosophical problems of defining art; by presenting both, meta-theoretical insights as well as definitions of his own.

On the meta-theoretical level he criticizes [[essentialist]], classificatory definitions of art (preferred by the traditional analytic philosophy), which he calls “wrapper definitions” since they aim “at the perfect coverage” of the [[Extension (semantics)|logical extension]] of the notion of art.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, Surface and Depth, p. 179-181&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman finds these definitions problematic, given art's contested value and nature as well as its unpredictable development in the future. He further argues that there is a goal for art definitions, which is more important than the conceptual coverage that is directional/transformational in “illuminating the special point and value of art or [...] improving art’s appreciation”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism Between Aesthetic Experience and Aesthetic Education”, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

He says that these ideas may converge, but since they may as well not, it is unacceptable to exclude any definitions only on the basis that they do not satisfy the standards of taxonomical validity, like e.g. evaluative definitions which nevertheless can be useful in their own way. Besides discussing the issue of wrapper definitions in general, Shusterman has also criticized particular definitions of that kind invented by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] and [[Arthur Danto]].&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 38-44. Cf. R. Shusterman, “Art in a Box: Danto” (chapter 10 of ''Surface and Depth'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman advocates a definition of art; as experience that is influenced by Dewey's definition with significant changes. While he accepts the majority of the elements central to the Dewey's conception of this experience (e.g., that it cannot be reduced to the private mental world of the subject being rather an interaction between the subject and the object), there are some he finds questionable (e.g. Dewey's insistence on the unity and coherence of aesthetic experience which Shusterman would like to supplement with aesthetics of rupture and fragmentation).
He says that Dewey was wrong to treat his definition of art as experience as a traditionalist wrapper definition, thus making it vulnerable to the valid charges, that it is both too narrow and too wide (there are some artworks which do not engender aesthetic experiences and, conversely, in some cases aesthetic experience accompanies phenomena which simply cannot be redefined as art, like natural beauty, e.g.). He further says that what Dewey should have done instead was to assign to it the directional and transformational role mentioned above. Conceived this way, Shusterman argues, the definition of art as experience has an undeniable value because even though it cannot embrace the whole extension of the concept of art it “underlines a crucial background condition, direction, and valued goal of art” (i.e. aesthetic experience) and also helps to widen “the realm of art by challenging the rigid division between art and action that is supported by definitions that define art as mimesis, poiesis, or the narrow practice defined by the institutional art world".&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and Criticism: A Response to three critics of ''Pragmatist Aesthetics''”, ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', 16, 2002, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman also advocates a definition of art as dramatization, which supplements the definition he has inherited from Dewey not only by illuminating art's nature from a slightly different angle, but also by serving a different, yet equally important purpose – the reconciliation of two prominent and, at the same time, conflicted aesthetic accounts of art: [[historicism]] and [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]. Since the notion of dramatization involves, and harmonizes two important moments: of putting something into a formalized frame (e.g. “the frame of a theatrical performance”&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Art as Dramatization,” in ''Surface and Depth''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and of intense experiential content that is framed, it presents itself as a potential synthesizing formula for historicism and naturalism which, Shusterman argues, can be reduced to emphasizing the formal institutional frame of art (historicism) or experiential intensity that characterizes art as such (naturalism).

Both of Shusterman's definitions have become the subject of many commentaries and criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Thomas Leddy and Paul C. Taylor defend Dewey’s original theory of art as experience against Shusterman’s criticism, while Ranjan Ghosh points out that the definition of art as dramatization is significantly consonant with the Indian concept of Rasa (see the secondary literature listed above). Cf J. J. Stuhr, "Practice, Semiotics, and the Limits of Philosophy", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', vol. 19, no. 1, 2005, p. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

Of the many debates that galvanize contemporary humanities, one of the most important one is devoted to the problem of interpretation. Shusterman has participated in it by co-editing a fundamental anthology “The Interpretive Turn”, as well as making his opinions known.
Shusterman's account of interpretation is constructed in opposition to both analytic aesthetics and [[deconstruction]], which are often said to constitute the two opposite poles of contemporary interpretive theory. As he claims, both of them share “a picture of understanding as the recapturing or reproducing of a particular [...] [“separate and autonomous”] meaning-object”, yet they differ as to whether such act is possible. Deconstructionists, assuming their protean vision of language as “systematic play of differences”, claim it is not, and hence deem every reading a “misreading”, while analytic aestheticians think otherwise, usually construing the objective work-meaning as “metaphysically fixed in the artwork” and identifying it with the intention of the artist or “semantic features of the work itself”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Surface and Depth'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid both these extremes Shusterman proposes a conception of textual meaning inspired by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]](and his notion of [[language-game|language games]]) in which meaning is thought of as a correlate of understanding, the latter term being conceived as “an ability to handle or respond to [something] in certain accepted ways”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; which, although shared and legitimized by the community, can be quite different and constitute many diverse “interpretation games”.
Interpretation, thus, is not an act (be it successful or inherently condemned to failure) of discovering the meaning of text, but rather of constructing it, or, as Shusterman would like to put it, of “making sense’” of text. One of the corollaries of this account is that correctness of interpretation is always relative to the “rules” (typically implicit) of a given interpretation game. Since there are many different incommensurable games existing at the same time and since some of them have undergone some significant changes over history (and some may even have disappeared from use), we can speak of a plurality of correct interpretations of the same text both in synchronic and diachronic dimensions. Another consequence of this theory is Shusterman's logical pluralism which claims not only that there can be different (even contradictory), yet equally true interpretations (that would be only a cognitive pluralism), but also that there are legitimate forms of approaching texts which do not even aim at interpretational truth or plausibility, but rather aim at other useful goals (e.g., providing pleasure or making an old text more relevant to contemporary readers).&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, “Logics of Interpretation: The Persistence of Pluralism”, in ''Surface and Depth'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Shusterman's contributions to the theory of interpretation is his critique of a widely held view he calls ‘hermeneutic universalism’, and attributes to [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Alexander Nehamas]] and [[Stanley Fish]], among others. Agreeing with basic anti-foundationalist thrust of the hermeneutic universalists’ position, Shusterman simultaneously rejects their thesis that “to perceive, read, understand, or behave at all intelligently [...] must always be to interpret” and seeks to refute it with many original arguments. He also insists that the notion of interpretation needs a contrasting category to guarantee its own meaningfulness. If everything is interpretation then the concept loses its point. Shusterman argues that immediate, non-interpretive understanding can serve that role of contrast. Inspired by Wittgenstein and Heidegger's theory of [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic circle]], Shusterman proposes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“the immediacy of uninterrupted understandings of language (as when I immediately understand simple and pertinent utterances of a language I know well) and the mediacy of interpretations (as when I encounter an utterance or text that I do not understand in terms of word-meaning or contextual relevance and then have to figure out what is meant)”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, "Pragmatism and Criticism", p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Among Shusterman's achievements in the theory of interpretation, there are also the accounts of literary criticism he created in his earlier, analytic period, as well as his pragmatist arguments against interpretational intentionalism and his genealogical critique of deconstructionist ([[Harold Bloom]]’s, [[Jonathan Culler]]’s), analytic ([[Joseph Margolis]]’) and neo-pragmatist (Richard Rorty's, Stanley Fish's, [[Walter Benn Michaels]] and [[Steven Knapp]]’s) literary theories which, as he claims, are all governed at their core by an ideology of professionalism.

===Popular art===

According to Shusterman, one of the most pressing sociocultural problems of today is the aesthetic legitimization of popular art. He feels that though popular art may now seem to be socially justified, its artistic value is still questioned which leads to the following problems:
*popular art is “deprived of artistic care and control” which could protect it against the negative influence of the market, and, as a result, it often becomes “brutally crude in sensibility”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
*satisfactions provided by this kind of art cannot be complete since they are diminished by a sense of humiliation which is induced in its audience by official art institutions’ explicit disapproval of popular art forms.
*this situation in turn “intensifies painful divisions in society and even in ourselves”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Popular Art and Education”, ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 13, 1995, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
A sincere advocate of popular aesthetics, Shusterman is careful to distinguish his stance from one-sided apologia and would rather characterize it as ‘melorism’ which “recognizes popular art’s flaws and abuses but also its merits [while also holding] that popular art should be improved because it can and often does achieve real aesthetic merits and serve worthy social ends”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Popular Art and Education”, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;
Putting his meliorism into practice, Shusterman seeks to win aesthetic legitimation for popular art in two ways:
*On a general theoretical level:
**he promotes the definition of art as experience, assuming that it could “effect the artistic legitimation” of popular art (e.g., “[[rock music]]”) “which affords such frequent and intensely gratifying aesthetic experience to so many people from so many nations, cultures, and classes”;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
**provides counter arguments to the most influential criticisms of popular art (e.g., [[Theodor W. Adorno]]’s and [[Allan Bloom]]’s&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 7 of ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;)
**analyzes (both on conceptual-etymological as well as genealogical level) the phenomenon of entertainment to highlight the crucial positive role it plays in human existence.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, "Entertainment: A Question for Aesthetics", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 43, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shusterman also engages in the aesthetic criticism of particular genres of popular arts and of its concrete works, arguing for artistic value of [[country music]] and [[hip hop music|rap]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Affect and Authenticity In Country Musicals” in ''Performing Live'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000); “The Fine Art of Rap” in ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000); “Art in Action, Art Infraction. Goodman, Rap, Pragmatism (New Reality Mix)” in ''Practicing Philosophy: Pragmatism and the Philosophical Life''; "Pragmatism, Art, and Violence: The Case of Rap”, in T. Yamamoto (ed.), ''Philosophical Designs for a Socio-Cultural Transformation'' (Tokyo and Boulder: E.H.E.S.C. and Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; What is worth stressing is that Shusterman was probably the first art philosopher ever to write about rap,&lt;ref&gt;His „Fine Art of Rap” was first published in 1991: ''New Literary History'', 22, 1991, p. 613-632.&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the fact that the accuracy of his treatment of this music genre is sometimes questioned,&lt;ref&gt;See T. Brennan, “Off the Gangsta Tip: A Rap Appreciation, or Forgetting about Los Angeles”, ''Critical Inquiry'', 20, 1994; G. C. Maher, “Brechtian Hip-Hop. Didactics and Self-Production in Post-Gangsta Political Mixtapes”, ''Journal of Black Studies'', vol. 36, no. 1, September, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; his groundbreaking role in this area cannot be denied and has been appreciated worldwide.

===Somaesthetics===
{{main article|Somaesthetics}}

'Somaesthetics’ is a term coined by Shusterman to denote a new philosophical discipline he has invented as a remedy for the following problems:

*According to Shusterman our culture's growing preoccupation with the body has not yet found an appropriate response in the realm of philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus is unwilling or unable to counteract the negative aspects of the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich our experience of the varieties of bodily charms”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Revival of Aesthetics”, ''[[Filozofski Vestnik]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*Despite the relative abundance of humanist disciplines devoted to the body they lack
**a conceptual framework that could integrate their efforts (and also allow for their better cooperation with natural sciences and various somatic methods);
**“a clear pragmatic orientation, something that the individual can directly translate into a discipline of improved somatic practice”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Body/Media Issue” in ''Performing Live'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philosophical aesthetics has paid very little attention to the body as a result of “the willful neglect of the body in [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten’s]] founding text of modern aesthetics, an omission reinforced by subsequent intellectualist and idealist theories (from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] through [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and on to contemporary theories that emphasize disinterested contemplation)”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Revival of Aesthetics”&lt;/ref&gt;

The above-mentioned conditions have determined the nature of somaesthetics as a grounded-in-philosophical-aesthetics yet interdisciplinary project of theory and practice which can be defined as:

{{Quotation|“the critical, meliorative study of the experience and the use of one’s body as a locus sensory-aesthetic appreciation (aisthesis) and creative self-fashioning [...], devoted [also] to the knowledge, discourses and disciplines that structure such somatic care or can improve it.”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Care of the Self: The Case of Foucault”, ''Monist'', 83, 2000, p. 532-533.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To clarify the terminological issues, one needs to mention that Shusterman has intentionally put the term ‘soma’ (instead of the more familiar ‘body’) in the name of his disciplinary proposal to emphasize one important feature of his conception of corporeality. For Shusterman, who is a true disciple of Dewey in this regard, bodily and mental (as well as cultural and biological) dimensions of  human beings are essentially inseparable, and to signify this unity (this “sentient perceiving «body-mind»”) he prefers to use the term ‘soma’ which, unlike ‘body’, does not automatically connote passive flesh contrasted to dynamic soul or mind.

Although Shusterman's project may at first glance seem utterly innovatory and even iconoclastic, its various elements, as Shusterman himself admits, can be traced to many respected traditions: ancient Greek philosophy and the later Western philosophies (Michel de Montaigne, John Dewey, Michel Foucault), but also East-Asian wisdom such as Confucianism.
Somaesthetics divides into three fundamental branches:

*''analytical somaesthetics'' which is a “descriptive and theoretical enterprise devoted to explaining the nature of our bodily perceptions and practices and their function in our knowledge and construction of the world. Besides the traditional topics in philosophy of mind, ontology, and epistemology that relate to the mind-body issue and the role of somatic factors in consciousness and action, analytic somaesthetics also includes the sort of genealogical, sociological, and cultural analyses advanced by Beauvoir, Foucault [and] Pierre Bourdieu”;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and The Second Sex: A Pragmatist Reading of a Feminist Classic”, ''Hypatia'' 18, 2003, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''pragmatic somaesthetics'' which (in “contrast to analytic somaesthetics, whose logic is essentially descriptive”) “has a distinctly normative, often prescriptive, character because it involves proposing specific methods of somatic improvement or engaging in their comparison, explanation, and critique”;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''practical somaesthetics'' which “involves actually engaging in programs of disciplined, reflective, corporeal practice aimed at somatic self-improvement”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman himself works in all three somaesthetic subdisciplines:

*within the analytic field he theorizes the body's status as the basic medium of human existence and the fundamental role it plays in the realm of cognition, ethics, politics and aesthetics;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Body/Media Issue”&lt;/ref&gt;
*in pragmatic somaesthetics
**he analyzes different somatic disciplines (e.g., Feldenkrais method, [[Alexander Technique]], [[Bioenergetics]]);&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “The Somatic Turn: Care of the Body in Contemporary Culture”, chapter 8 of ''Performing Live''.&lt;/ref&gt;
**criticizes different thinkers, such as [[Edmund Burke]], [[William James]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and Michel Foucault, for either neglecting or misconceiving the value of various forms of somatic care;&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Burke’s Sublime”, ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 45, 2005;“William James, Somatic Introspection, and Care of the Self”, ''Philosophical Forum'', 36, 2005; "The Silent, Limping Body of Philosophy”, in T. Carman and M. Hansen (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Merleau-Ponty'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
**scrutinizes the issue of Asian erotic arts;&lt;ref&gt;“Asian Ars Erotica and the Question of Sexual Aesthetics”,''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', vol. 65, no. 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
**discusses the value of somaesthetics for education in the humanities;&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman,“Somaesthetics and Education: Exploring the Terrain”, in Liora Bressler (ed.), ''Knowing Bodies, Moving Minds: Towards Embodied Teaching and Learning'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2004); “Thinking Through the Body: Educating for the Humanities”, ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'', vol. 40, no. 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*As a certified practitioner of the Feldenkrais Method and a somatic therapist, he gives workshops on somaesthetics that include practical exercises and demonstrations, and he also has experience in treating different cases of somatic disabilities.

While undeniably a new phenomenon, somaesthetics, which by now forms the center of Shusterman's philosophical inquiries, has already influenced many scholars working in fields as diverse as philosophy, [[art education]], [[dance theory]], health and fitness studies.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the secondary literature listed above&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Samut khoi''''' ({{lang-th|สมุดข่อย}}, {{IPA-th|sā.mùt kʰɔ̀j|pron}}; {{lang-lo|ສະໝຸດຂ່ອຍ}}; "''khoi'' books") or '''''samut thai''''' ({{lang-th|สมุดไทย|links=no}}, {{IPA-th|sā.mùt tʰāj|}}) are a type of folding-book [[manuscript]] which were historically widely used in many buddhist cultures, including [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Thailand]], as well as in [[Myanmar]], where they are known as ''[[parabaik]]''. The techniques used in their production came probably from the ancient kingdom of Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka). They are usually made with the paper of the [[Streblus asper|Siamese rough bush]] or ''khoi'' tree, and are not [[Bookbinding|bound]] like Western books but are folded in an accordion style. ''Samut khoi'' are made either with black paper (in Thailand known as ''samut thai dam''), or with white paper (''samut thai khao''). The use of ''samut khoi'' in Thailand dates to the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Paper|publisher=Nakorn Phanom National Library (Thailand)|url=http://www.finearts.go.th/nakhonphanomlibrary/parameters/km/item/ตำนานกระดาษ}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually used for secular texts including royal chronicles, legal documents and works of literature, while [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s were more commonly used for religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=สมุดข่อย และคัมภีร์ใบลาน กรุสมบัติจากบรรพชน|trans-title=''Samut khoi'' and palm-leaf manuscipts: treasure troves from our ancestors|url=http://www.ayutthayastudies.aru.ac.th/content/view/627/32/ |publisher=Ayutthaya Studies Institute, Ayutthaya Rajabhat University|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book: A Global History|chapter=Southeast Asia (2): The Mainland |first=Jana |last=Igunma |editor-first1=Michael F.|editor-last1=Suarez|editor-first2=H.

== Khmer paper books ==
Paper books has a long history in the [[Khmer Empire]], predating the Ayutthaya Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The paper used for the Khmer books, known as ''kraing'', was made from the bark of the [[mulberry]] tree. In what we now know as Cambodia, the ''kraing'' literature was stored in pagodas across the country. During the [[Cambodian civil war]] and the subsequent [[Democratic Kampuchea|Khmer Rouge regime]] of the 1960s and 1970s, as much as 80% of the pagodas in Cambodia were destroyed, including their libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/palm-leaves-preserving-history |title=Palm leaves preserving history |author=Sen David and Thik Kaliyann |newspaper=The Phnom Penh Post |volume=6|date=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambodia, only a tiny fraction of the original ''kraing'' of the Khmer Empire has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Khmer Medical Text "''The Treatment of the Four Diseases''" Manuscript |author=Prof. K.

The [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] church of '''Santiago de Peñalba''' is located in the '' [[Valle del Silencio]] '' (Valley of Silence) in the  region of [[El Bierzo]], [[León (province)|province of León]], [[Castile and León|Community of Castile and León]], [[Spain]].

The ''Valle del Silencio'' is known as "La Tebaida Berciana" (the Bercian [[Thebaid]]) due to the abundance of sanctuaries and monasteries, dating to the 8th century.

==History==
Abbot Salomón promoted the construction of the church in the first half of the 10th century, a time of prosperity in the [[Kingdom of León]]. It was completed in the reign of [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]], who expanded the limits of his kingdom beyond the [[Duero River]]. Ramiro II made multiple donations to the church and the monastery.

One of those donations, made to the Bishopric of [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]], was the so-called ''Cruz de Peñalba'' ([[Cross of Peñalba]]), a symbol of El Bierzo's [[comarca]]. This cross is an example of [[Visigothic]] gold work, influenced by Mozarabic models.

==Architecture==
The church is characterized by opposed apses, an unusual feature shared with the tenth-century church of [[San Cebrián de Mazote]] (also constructed during the apogee of the [[Kingdom of León]]).

The church's decoration is a mixture of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] elements, including lunar and astral symbols; [[Byzantine]] influences seen in its Greek-cross plant; [[Arab]] elements, especially a small umbrella roof dome which covers the principal altar; and [[Mozarabic]] influence, seen in its famous horseshoe arches.

'''Sea Odyssey: Giant Spectacular''' was a three-day outdoor [[performance art]] event featuring giant [[marionette]]s, that took place in [[Liverpool]], England, from 20 to 22 April  2012.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17777090 |title=Giant puppets in Liverpool for Sea Odyssey Titanic event |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed and operated by French street theatre company [[Royal de Luxe]], and featured three giants, the 9-metre (30-foot) tall Little Giant Girl, the 15-metre (50-foot) tall Giant Uncle, and the girl's dog, Xolo.&lt;ref name=Wake&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2012/04/20/sea-odyssey-little-giant-girl-wakes-up-to-start-three-day-liverpool-spectacular-100252-30801720 |title=Sea Odyssey: Little Giant Girl wakes up to start three-day Liverpool spectacular|publisher=[[Liverpool Daily Post]]|date=20 April 2012|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that, over the course of the three days, 600,000 people watched the event&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17798401 |title=Liverpool giants: Sea Odyssey Titanic event ends |publisher=BBC |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Liverpool City Council recorded a footfall in the main shopping district of 900,000.&lt;ref name=councilstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=214917|title=City on crest of a wave after Sea Odyssey|publisher=Liverpool City Council|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent report into the impact of Sea Odyssey concluded it was the most successful event in Liverpool’s history. The report showed that 800,000 people took part in the event, which resulted in an economic impact of £32 million.&lt;ref name=councilstat2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=215928|title=Sea Odyssey success|publisher=Liverpool City Council|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==

The event, staged to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], was inspired by a letter written by a 10-year-old girl, May McMurray, in 1912 to her father William, a bedroom steward on the Titanic who did not survive the sinking. The letter did not arrive until after the Titanic sailed, and was returned to the sender and is now on display at Liverpool's Maritime Museum.&lt;ref name=Inspired&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17729987 |title=Liverpool Sea Odyssey event inspired by Titanic letter |publisher=BBC |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=May&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-culture/liverpool-arts/2012/04/19/sea-odyssey-the-story-of-the-little-girl-who-inspired-liverpool-s-biggest-ever-street-theatre-event-99623-30779993/ |title=SEA ODYSSEY: The story of the little girl who inspired Liverpool’s biggest ever street theatre event |publisher=Liverpool Daily Post |date=19 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RDL_News&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-de-luxe.com/en/news/ |title=Liverpool, "L’Odyssée de la mer" (in French)|publisher=Royal de Luxe, Nantes| date= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the event, estimated at £1.5m, was partly met by European legacy funding from Liverpool's 2008 Capital of Culture year. Early forecasts suggested it resulted in a £12&amp;nbsp;million boost to the city's economy.&lt;ref name=Heart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17812818 |title=Liverpool Sea Odyssey giant event's £12m economy boost |publisher=BBC |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?id=214917 |title=City on crest of a wave after Sea Odyssey |publisher=Liverpool City Council |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With initial expectations of around 250,000 people attending,&lt;ref name=BBC-Bringing&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17762154 |title=Bringing Liverpool's Sea Odyssey giants to life |publisher=BBC |date=20 April 2012|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately after the event it was estimated that 600,000 people watched the event over the three days.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3/&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt;

The show was led by Royal de Luxe's artistic director, Jean-Luc Courcoult, who celebrated its conclusion by jumping into the [[River Mersey]].&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Courcoult&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-de-luxe.com/en/jean-luc-courcoult/ |title=Le metteur en scène, Jean-Luc Courcoult |publisher=Royal de Luxe, Nantes| date= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

The story, written by Jean-Luc Courcoult, envisages the girl's uncle, a diver, searching the wreck of the Titanic, and having found his brother's letter, coming ashore to bring it and the news of the ship's fate to his niece.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giantspectacular.com/content/story |title=Liverpool Story |publisher=giantspectacular.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512125448/http://www.giantspectacular.com/content/story |archivedate=12 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising from the water at Liverpool's [[Salthouse Dock]], the giant uncle wanders around the city in search of the girl, who simultaneously awakes in the city's [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]] and, accompanied by her dog Xolo, sets out to look for her uncle.&lt;ref name=Wake/&gt;

The two miss each other several times, finally meeting up at the [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]] at the end of the second day of the event. The following day, the pair set out together for a final walk around the city centre, and then board a boat at [[Canning Dock]] and leave Liverpool via the River Mersey.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heart&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17806029 |title=Sea Odyssey giants capture Liverpool's heart |publisher=BBC |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between them, by the end of the three days, the giants covered a distance of 23 miles (37&amp;nbsp;km), taking in the areas around the football grounds of [[Liverpool F.C.]] and [[Everton F.C.]], the city centre, [[Pier Head]], [[Chinatown, Liverpool|Chinatown]], and the [[Albert Dock]] and King's Dock complexes.&lt;ref name=Inspired/&gt;

==Giants==

The giants taking part in the event comprised the Little Giant Girl, measuring 9 metres (30 feet), the Giant Uncle, measuring 15 metres (50 feet), and the girl's dog, Xolo. The girl and the uncle are constructed from [[Populus|poplar]] wood, [[Tilia|lime]] wood and steel, and have eyes made from street lights and hair made from horse hair. The dog, Xolo, is made from [[papier-mâché]] and steel. All three are controlled using ropes, pulleys and motors.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC-Bringing/&gt;

During the three days, the puppets, cranes, and other equipment required a team of 110 operators, who call themselves ''[[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputians]]'' after the characters from the 1726 [[Jonathan Swift]] novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''. A total of 20 cranes were required to move them around the city.&lt;ref name=BBC-Day1/&gt; The uncle requires 31 people to control, with the girl operated by a team of 24 puppeteers, and the dog a team of 21.&lt;ref name=BBC-Bringing/&gt;

During the tour the giants were accompanied by a group of live musicians, and used a number of props, including the girl's boat, on which she sailed for part of her journey, her scooter, deck chair, bed, and radio.&lt;ref name=Story/&gt;

The game follows the story of Garcia Hotspur, a Mexican demon hunter who goes to the City of the Damned to battle its evils in order to save his true love. The game is the result of collaboration between [[Goichi Suda]] and [[Shinji Mikami]], and combined the styles of the two designers, namely the "[[punk rock]]" edge of the former and the "[[Psychological thriller|psychological]] [[Action game|action]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]" of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5638447/first-shadows-of-the-damned-screens-and-concept-art/ |title=First Shadows Of The Damned Screens And Concept Art |author=Brian Ashcraft |date=September 15, 2010 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Demon hunter Garcia Hotspur comes home to find his girlfriend, Paula, being abducted by the Lord of Demons, Fleming, who brags that he will take Paula with him to kill her again and again. Garcia is powerless to stop Fleming, but instead follows him back to the underworld along with his demon sidekick, Johnson, who also acts as his gun, torch and motorcycle. In the demon world, Johnson helps guide Garcia through the twisted nature of the demon realm, defeating numerous enemies that try to feed on Garcia's flesh, and keeping him away from the darkness that destroys the human flesh. As they travel, they witness numerous deaths of Paula by Fleming and other demons, all to toy with Garcia's senses. Another human demon hunter, who simply goes by the name "Colonel", temporarily aids Garcia, but then leaves to get revenge on the death of his loved one, only to be brutally killed later. Garcia also encounters an ally in Christopher, a half-human, half-demon that sells Garcia valuable goods to boost his demon-fighting powers.

Later in the game, Garcia and Johnson learn of the Unbreakable Huntress, the first female demon slayer to ever challenge Fleming. The Unbreakable Huntress challenged Fleming, but was brutally dismembered by the demon king. Impressed with her refusal to surrender even when reduced to a quad amputee, Fleming made the Huntress into his queen, only to repeatedly kill her over and over again, healing any wounds that resulted from the torture. In rebellion, the Unbreakable Huntress continued to escape from the City of the Damned, only to be dragged back and killed by Fleming. Paula is hinted to have been the Unbreakable Huntress prior to the start of the game.

Eventually, Garcia reaches Fleming's "Castle of Hassle", and battles his way through to its top, where Fleming awaits him, Paula encased within his cloak.  Fleming enters into battle with Garcia, but Garcia gains the upper hand, and destroys him. He rushes to Paula's side, but she hits him, angered that he watched her die over and over and made no attempt to stop it or comfort her. Furious, she transforms into a demon herself, and attacks Garcia, but Garcia eventually weakens her enough. Paula reverts to her human form, and as she lies wounded and the darkness surrounds them, Garcia comforts her and apologizes.

In the epilogue, Garcia and Paula have returned to his home and are planning for a trip, when Garcia receives a call from Fleming, warning him that more demons are coming for him. Garcia takes this in stride, commenting that as long as he is dating the Lord of Demon's mistress, demons will continue to follow them, and he vows to kill every last one.

==Gameplay==
''Shadows of the Damned'' is an [[action game]]. The player controls Garcia, moving him through the environments. Garcia's sidekick, Johnson, is ever-present, acting normally as a torch for light or quick melee attacks, but can become a weapon when needed. Johnson can take three forms: a pistol, a shotgun, and automatic rifle, all which are upgraded into more powerful forms either by finding blue gems left after boss fights that add extra abilities, or through slotting of red gems, found in the environment or purchasable from Christopher, to improve damage, reload speed, or ammo capacity. Garcia's health bar can also be extended using red gems. Health is restored by imbibing alcohol that can be found in the game's levels, or purchasable from Christopher or vending machines using white gems, the form of currency in the demon world.

Johnson also can fire a special "light bullet", which can be used to both stun enemies and is a primary mechanic of the game's "darkness" puzzles. If Garcia enters an area covered by darkness, he will momentary be safe but soon the darkness will drain his health until he leaves or dissipates it. This most often can be done by firing a light bullet at a goat's head in the area, but often finding this goat requires completing other puzzles, such as opening a series of locked doors. Other ways of dispelling the darkness included killing demons that are spewing it, or using fireworks to temporarily remove it. In some puzzles, the solution can only be completed while Garcia is within the darkness. Demons that spawn from the darkness often will be shrouded by it even when the darkness is dispelled, preventing Garcia from damaging them until struck with a light bullet.  There are numerous [[boss (video game)|boss fights]] that combine several aspects of the gameplay, including darkness, to be defeated. Certain levels are based on mini-games, such as the use of a [[sidescroller]] in some chapters.

==Development==
The game's history can be traced back to 2005, when [[Goichi Suda]] and [[Shinji Mikami]] (creator of the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series) became good friends while working together on ''[[Killer7]]''. Suda wanted to make a survival horror game exclusively for the [[PlayStation 3]]. With his first horror title ''[[Michigan: Report From Hell]]'' receiving decent sales in Japan by 2006, Suda immediately began working on ''Kurayami'' (Japanese for 'Darkness') in his spare time. It was at one time thought to be called "Closer". However, EA later confirmed that name had been abandoned for another title.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} By the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) in 2006, a publisher for ''Kurayami'' had not yet been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/140354/interviews/suda-51-contact-established/ |title=Suda 51: Contact established |author=Andy Robinson |date=May 22, 2006 |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714131735/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/140354/interviews/suda-51-contact-established/ |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Suda presented the game's concept to [[EA Games]], who agreed to license the [[Unreal Engine 3]] and to publish the game to a worldwide audience. Shinji Mikami was then invited to executive-produce the project. Suda wanted to announce the game at E3 2009, but was not allowed to do so, due to a media silence agreement between Grasshopper Manufacture and EA Games. That December, [[Akira Yamaoka]] (sound designer for the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series) left [[Konami]] after finishing his work on ''[[Silent Hill: Shattered Memories]]'' and joined Grasshopper Manufacture because he enjoyed the latter's game ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]''. Yamaoka began work as the sound designer for the game. The game went about five different versions until Electronics Arts approved it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/trading-blows-with-suda51-and-grasshopper-manufactures-team-of-grindhouse-action-heroes/ |title=Trading blows with Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture’s team of grindhouse action heroes |author=Daniel Robson |date=July 1, 2014|work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707004956/http://www.edge-online.com/features/trading-blows-with-suda51-and-grasshopper-manufactures-team-of-grindhouse-action-heroes |archivedate=July 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly titled ''Shadows of the Damned'' was finally unveiled at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] in 2010 as an action game.

''Shadows of the Damned'' took 3 years to make and the game design had gone through significant changes (five design drafts in total). Originally, Garcia was going to start out shirtless and without a gun. From there, he would gradually acquire weapons along the way and purchase clothes at stores within the game. However, Grasshopper was pressured by EA to have Garcia start with a gun because, ''"westerners are about guns."'' In addition, Paula was originally designed as a little girl living in Garcia's gun and would hop around like a rabbit or flutter like a butterfly when her ability is needed; and this would lead to a prominent love story. Again, EA had these features removed because they did not understand the concept. EA informed Grasshopper that, ''"there's this thing called an elevator pitch in America, and if you can't tell your story in the length of an elevator ride, Hollywood won't use it."'' This forced Suda to completely scrap all of his initial ideas and had Johnson the talking Skull replaced Paula, and make the game a fairy tale like [[Arsène Lupin III|Lupin III]]'s ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' or [[Princess Peach]] and [[Mario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art of Grasshopper Manufacture |author=Goichi Suda |year=2015 |publisher=PIE International Inc |location=Japan |page=216 |accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 17, 2012, Mikami expressed his dissatisfaction with the game stating that both he and Suda were disappointed with the end product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psxextreme.com/ps3-news/11553.html |title=Mikami: Shadows Of The Damned Broke Suda51's Heart |author=Ben Dutka |date=July 17, 2012 |publisher=PSX Extreme |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"[Shadows of The Damned] became a completely different game. That was a bit disappointing. I think Suda was unable to create the scenario he'd originally had in his head, and he rewrote the scenario several times. I think his heart was broken. He's such a unique creator, so it seems to me that he was not quite comfortable with making this game."|Shinji Mikami}}

''Shadows of the Damned'' received "generally favorable reviews" according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc_shadow_ps3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_shadow_360"/&gt; In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/japan-review-check-dark-souls |title=Japan Review Check: Dark Souls |author=Kevin Gifford |date=September 14, 2011 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=September 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADE0bDw3?url=http://www.1up.com/news/japan-review-check-dark-souls |archivedate=August 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Destructoid]]'' said of the Xbox 360 version: "This crackbrained horror romp takes camp to a new extreme and wants you, the player, to have nothing but fun the entire time."&lt;ref name="destructoid_shadows"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] praised the game's sound design, challenging and terrifying bosses, varied gameplay, and clever use of darkness, but criticized the lack of a new game+ function as well as the stiff animation. GameZone said, "To a much simpler degree, ''Shadows of the Damned'' is an amazing experience that anyone with a sense of humor and an affinity for rich games should get their hands on ASAP."&lt;ref name="gamezone_shadows"/&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the Xbox 360 version an A−, saying that "Suda 51's warped, pop-culture-obsessed vision and Mikami's sure-fire action make a heck of a match."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/shadows-of-the-damned-58106 |title=Shadows Of The Damned (X360) |author=Gus Mastrapa |date=June 27, 2011 |publisher=''[[The A.V.

But if you like the sort of gameplay that ''Resident Evil'' offers, it will bring you a lot of enjoyment, more or less from start to finish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jun/27/shadows-of-the-damned-review |title=Shadows of the Damned - review (X360) |author=Steve Boxer |date=June 27, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the Xbox 360 version a score of seven out of ten, saying that its "erratic, slapdash nature leaves you slightly dazed. But despite some alarming dips in quality, despite the game never quite reaching the level of brilliance you hope for, you will be glad you played it."&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; ''The Digital Fix'' similarly gave the same console version seven out of ten, saying, "The game is certainly the closest to a mainstream title that Suda 51 has been involved in. Strangely, the most memorable aspects of the game actually are quite distant from the actual gameplay; the characters, the storybooks and the music are more memorable than any of the action set-pieces. Having said that, the game is worth at least one playthrough, especially if you enjoyed any of Suda 51’s previous titles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gaming.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/51/shadows-of-the-damned.html |title=Shadows of the Damned (X360) |author=Ryan Poxon |date=August 9, 2011 |publisher=''The Digital Fix'' |accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the same console version three stars out of five and said it was "not as scary as the likes of ''Silent Hill'' or ''Resident Evil'', not as funny as ''No More Heroes'' and not as original as ''Killer7'', leaving it stuck in video game limbo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/review/a326032/shadows-of-the-damned-xbox-360/ |title='Shadows Of The Damned' (Xbox 360) |author=Liam Martin |date=June 21, 2011 |publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]'' |accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' gave it a similar score of three stars out of five, saying that the game's "slick visuals and offbeat sensibility is worth checking out, despite its ordinary gameplay. Besides, ordinary doesn't mean bad. Beheading demons with a shotgun that fires skulls has a certain amount of appeal, after all. It's pretty brainless, but it's a weekend's worth of stuff to shoot, and sometimes that's all you really need."&lt;ref name="escapist"/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' gave the same console version a score of five out of ten, saying, "With a little more restraint and focus on the core experience, ''Shadows Of The Damned'' could have been the action thrill ride Garcia Hotspur thinks it is.

'''Slow Design''' is a branch of the [[Slow movement (culture)|Slow Movement]], which began with the concept of [[Slow Food]], a term coined in contrast to ''fast food''. As with every branch of the Slow Movement, the overarching goal of Slow Design is to promote well being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. Slow Design seeks a holistic approach to designing that takes into consideration a wide range of material and social factors as well as the short and long term impacts of the design.

==Origin and meaning==
Slow Design refers to the goals and approach of the designer, rather than the object of the design.  In this way a Slow Design approach can be used within any [[design]] field.  The term was probably first coined by Alastair Fuad-Luke in his 2002 paper "'Slow Design' - a paradigm for living sustainably?", in which Slow Design is seen as the next step in the development of [[sustainable design]], balancing individual, socio-cultural, and environmental needs.&lt;ref name="FuadLuke2002"/&gt;

While Fuad-Luke focused on the design of physical products, the concept can be applied to the design of non-material things such as experiences, processes, services, and organizations. In fact, Slow Design may be seen as a path toward the [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] required for long-term sustainability as it takes into account the non-material nature of human well being and [[happiness]].

Beth Meredith and Eric Storm attempt to summarize the concept, stating: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slow Design is a democratic and holistic design approach for creating appropriately tailored solutions for the long-term well being of people and the planet. To this end, Slow Design seeks out positive synergies between the elements in a system, celebrates diversity and regionalism, and cultivates meaningful relationships that add richness to life.&lt;ref name="MeredithStorm2010"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The editor and journalist [[Spencer Bailey]] has described Slow Design as “design that’s timeless and made to last, and done thoughtfully, with intent, and with care for our planet.”&lt;ref name="Spencer Bailey, editor, New York"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spencer Bailey, editor, New York”|url=http://www.slow-words.com/spencer-bailey-editor-new-york/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and future practice ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Common qualities of Slow Design include:
* Holistic – taking into account as many relevant short and long term factors as possible.
* Sustainable – considering the [[Cradle to cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] impacts and reducing harm as much as possible including the [[precautionary principle]].
* Elegant – finding the simplest and most concise solutions that provide the desired results.
* Tailored – creating specific solutions that fit a particular situation.
* Democratic – keeping the process and results accessible to those using and impacted by the design and to non-professionals.
* Adaptable – developing solutions that will continue to work over time or that can be modified as needed. 
* Durable – making sure solutions can be maintained over time while minimizing the need for repairs and replacement.
* Non-toxic – eliminating substances and processes that pollute or are toxic.
* Efficient – minimizing waste of time, labor, energy, and physical resources.
* Distinctive – promoting cultural, social, and environmental uniqueness and diversity.

Slow design is still a relatively new concept of design thinking, and its implications are yet to be fully developed and defined. It could evolve in the following ways:
* Longer design processes with more time for research, contemplation, real life impact tests, and fine tuning. 
* Design for manufacturing with local or regional materials and technologies or design that supports local industries, workshops, and craftspeople. 
* Design that takes into account local or regional culture both as a source of inspiration and as an important consideration for the design outcome. 
* Design that studies the concept of natural time cycles and incorporates them into design and manufacturing processes. 
* Design that looks at longer cycles of human behavior and sustainability.
* Design that takes into account deeper well being and the findings of [[positive psychology]].

professionals of these sectors.
[[File:LOGO_TEN_COMPLET.jpg|frame]]

==Background==

The platform of Tenstar Community Movement was created in 2000 by [[Abbas Gharib]] with other professionals and artists both in Europe and Middle East to support the creative people and to defend their sectors, working through the possible comparative dialogues with the world of Western advanced, cultures and disciplines within targeted initiatives in arts and creativity. Its name at the origins, was  "Ten - International Developments", with the actions in the [[Post-contemporary]] domai for the ten creative areas to support young designers and artists.

In 2008, this Platform was transferred to Italy to become a Registered Italian [[Voluntary association|association]] and to implement better its actions, in the European environments best suited to create a  container for its concepts and a network for its objectives believing that the Educational sectors, including public and private services are forming large parts of creative areas.&lt;ref&gt;Kultur &amp; Kommunikation for Nordic Innovation Centre (2007), ''Creative Industries Education in the Nordic Countries''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mœglin, Pierre (2010), ''Les Industries éducatives'', Paris, Puf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Vision==

This Movement believes that its commitment for the social regeneration, by working within the interactions of its creative sectors is also a valid contribution for passing from an old energy-based, to a new knowledge based society. In these tasks, its vision through the creative concepts, leads to the overcoming of the current models in the field of artistic expression to the new creative formats, projected toward the future. &lt;br&gt; 
The mission wants to see rebuilt, the legacy of artistic and cultural heritage of the city artifacts, which are meaningful as the best spatial places, capable of accommodating art and culture experiences, creation of employments with  value added sustainable production, for an advanced structural economy of culture and creativity for a [[post-industrial society]], i.e. a knowledge society.

==New organizers with new tasks==

New organizers of "Tenstar Community" in Italy are Sandra Villa, an architect and designer, Samì Gharib, a sociologist and expert in communication and Leila Gharib who is a Musician and art performer.&lt;br&gt;
The commitments of "TEN" coincide with the current economic and social needs of innovation, so that the ten creative areas and the ten goals of the Association remain being active in the educational, cultural and creative sectors, that are engines for the growth and development,&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard, ''The Rise of the Creative Class And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life'', Basic Books, 2002, new edition 2012, {{ISBN|0465029930}}.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the "creative citizens' rights" for a knowledge society, a World Without Poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Social Business and the Future of Capitalism.

'''''The Bathers''''' (French: ''Les Baigneuses'') is an oil painting on canvas made between 1918 and 1919 by the French painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. After being given to the State by his three sons in 1923, it is currently kept at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.

There are two groups of naked women: two models lying in the foreground plus three bathers in the background, on the right. One of the models of this painting is [[Catherine Hessling|Andrée Hessling]], who became the first wife of Renoir's son, [[Jean Renoir|Jean]]. The natural setting displayed in the painting was the large garden of the house owned by the painter in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pierre-Auguste Renoir — ''Les Baigneuses'' |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/peinture.html |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |language=French |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the painting, Renoir removed any reference to the contemporary world and showed "a timeless nature". The theme of the bather is predominant in the final season of Renoir's paintings: the women portrayed by the painter are free and uninhibited. These bathers are "melted in the nature and the forms merge with the trees, flowers and the shares of red water".&lt;ref name="Flammarion"&gt;{{cite book |title=Renoir — Les classiques de l'art |publisher=Flammarion |year=2005 |place=Paris |language=French |isbn=2-08-011445-X |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting received criticism because of "the enormousness of the legs and arms, the weakness of flesh, and the pinkish color of the models".&lt;ref name="Flammarion"/&gt;

'''''The Forgiven''''' is a 2017 British drama film directed by [[Roland Joffé]] and based on the play ''The Archbishop and the Antichrist'' by Michael Ashton, that tells a story involving Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]]'s search for answers during the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] and his meetings with the fictional character Piet Blomfeld.

==Plot==
After the end of [[apartheid]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] is running the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] and visits Cape Town's [[Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison]] to meet with Piet Blomfeld, an ex-[[South African Defence Force]] officer and [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] member, to assess his candidacy for amnesty. Blomfeld is a potential witness to murders committed during the time of Apartheid, particularly the murder of the teenage daughter of Mrs. Morobe, who begs the Archbishop to find answers about her missing daughter. Blomfeld shows no regret and no willingness to speak, instead using his time during the meetings to berate the Archbishop with insults. An attempt on his life by another prisoner causes Blomfeld to begin considering confessing, but some of the other individuals involved in the murder are working at Pollsmoor and do not wish for the information to be revealed.

A few decades before the book's publication, very little was known outside [[Asia]] about the Buddha and [[Buddhism]], the religion which he founded, and which had existed for about twenty-five centuries. Arnold's book was one of the first successful attempts to popularize Buddhism for a Western readership.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, L.: ''All is Change: The Two-Thousand-Year Journey of Buddhism to the West'', Little, Brown and Company, 2006. See pages 141 to 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, P.: ''An Introduction to Buddhism'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. See page 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been highly acclaimed from the time it was first published and has been the subject of several reviews. It has been translated into several languages, including Hindi.

==Adaptations==
A film adaptation of the poem directed by [[Franz Osten]] and [[Himansu Rai]] was made in 1928, titled ''[[Prem Sanyas]]'' (''[[Prem Sanyas|The Light of Asia]]'' in English).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0016240|Prem Sanyas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dudley Buck]] used the book as the basis for an [[oratorio]], ''[[The Light of Asia (oratorio)|The Light of Asia]]'', first performed in 1887.&lt;ref name = "Orr"&gt;Orr, N. Lee (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=nxUbPDdLJpQC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Buck+Light+of+Asia+washington&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PG2OUby-OK3P0AWB9oDABQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Buck%20Light%20of%20Asia%20washington&amp;f=false ''Dudley Buck''], p. 98. University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|1945 movie version]] of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), as the protagonist turns to a life of depravity, a friend tries to turn him back to a good life by lending him a copy of ''The Light of Asia''.

==Chapters==
The first six chapters deal with the early part of Buddha's life – his birth as Siddhartha, prince of Kapilavastu,Nepal; his gaining first-hand knowledge of the sufferings of mankind; his resorting to meditation; and his ultimate transformation as the "Enlightened One" after long years of meditation. The subsequent chapters speak of the Buddha's travels and the important elements of the message he spread are discussed &amp;mdash; for instance, that suffering is a built-in aspect of existence; that craving for sensuality and identity is the root of suffering, and that suffering can be ended. It calls for right understanding; right thought; right speech; right action; right livelihood; right effort; right mindfulness; and right concentration. Throughout his peregrinations, mostly in eastern India, Gautama Buddha was joined by thousands of disciples and admirers from all walks of life.

'''''The Scoop''''' and '''''Behind the Screen''''' are both collaborative detective serials written by members of the [[Detection Club]] which were broadcast weekly by their authors on the [[BBC National Programme]] in 1930 and 1931 with the scripts then being published in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' within a week after broadcast. The two serials were first published in book form in the UK by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] in [[1983 in literature|1983]] and in the US by [[Harper &amp; Row]] in [[1984 in literature|1984]]. The UK edition retailed at [[£]]6.95.

Julian Symons, then President of the club (1983), explains in his introduction:  "...The present volume... was written to provide funds so that club premises might be acquired.  Other books with the same purpose, also the product of several hands, were ''[[The Floating Admiral]]'' (1931), ... ''Ask a Policeman'' (1933), ... and ... ''Verdict of Thirteen''. ..."

==Behind the Screen==
The episodes, contributors, transmission and magazine publication details of this serial are as follows (all episodes were transmitted from 9.25pm to 9.40pm):

'''Trick roping''' is an entertainment or competitive art involving the spinning of a [[lasso]] also known as a lariat or a "rope."  It is particularly associated with [[Wild West Shows|wild west shows]] or western arts in the United States.

The lasso is a well-known tool of American [[cowboy]]s, who developed rope spinning and throwing skills in using lassos to catch animals. Cowboys developed various tricks to show off their prowess with the lasso and demonstrations of these tricks evolved into entertainment and competitive disciplines.

There is a well-established repertoire of tricks that can be divided into three fundamental categories: "flat loop", "vertical loop" and "butterfly". In addition there are thrown loop tricks and tricks that involve the use of two ropes. Among the vertical loop tricks is the "Texas Skip", which involves the performer spinning the lasso in a wide loop in a vertical plane and jumping through the loop from one side to the other on each rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Well-known trick ropers include:

*[[Texas Jack Omohundro]], the first performer to introduce roping acts to the American stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Logan|first1=Herschel C.|title=Buckskin and Satin: The Life of Texas Jack and His Wife|date=1954||page=73|publisher=Stackpole|location=Harrisburg|url=https://archive.org/details/buckskinandstain007287mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Montie Montana]], who had a 60-year career as a trick roper, also appeared in several [[John Wayne]] movies.

*Actor and humorist [[Will Rogers]], known for his roles as a cowboy, was an expert at trick roping. Rogers' rope tricks were showcased in the 1922 silent film "The Ropin' Fool."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Ropin' Fool|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124857/|date = 1922-10-29|accessdate = 2016-02-23|first = Clarence G.|last = Badger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Vince Bruce, born April 4, 1955, died September 24, 2011: Internationally acclaimed as one of the best western acts in the world, Bruce made his Broadway debut in 1991, in the Tony Award-winning musical ''The Will Rogers Follies — A Life in Revue''. Appearing as the trick-roping star and portraying Rogers in this tribute to the cowboy and vaudeville star, Bruce remained with the show for two and a half years at New York’s Palace Theatre. For his act, he performed a spin with two ropes, a feat first devised 60 years earlier by Will Rogers himself. On July 21, 1991, at the Empire State Building, Vince set a new world record — 4,011 — for “Texas Skips”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vince Bruce - Obituaries|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8818953/Vince-Bruce.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|agency=The Telegraph|date=10 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Florence LaDue|Flores LaDue]] (1883-1951): the only cowgirl to claim three world championships for trick and fancy roping, Flores remained undefeated in the event. Flores and her husband, Guy Weadick, also a Trick Roper, organized and produced the first Calgary Stampede. Flores Ladue is reputed to have been the first trick roper to perform the trick known as the Texas Skip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flores Ladue|url=http://www.cowgirl.net/portfolios/flores-ladue/|website=National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yellow Arrow sticker in New York City.jpg|thumb|A Yellow Arrow sticker in New York CIty]]
'''''Yellow Arrow''''' was a public art project created by Christopher Allen, [[Brian House]], and [[Jesse Shapins]] that was active from 2004-2006. The project is an important example of [[locative media]] and mobile phone art and draws concepts from [[psychogeography]].

''Yellow Arrow'' stickers were obtained from the project website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/01/AR2005070102280.html |title=Targeting the 'Art' Around Every Corner |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2005-07-02|accessdate=2011-04-10 |first=Tommy |last=Nguyen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed anywhere in the public realm.  When encountering a sticker on the street, one could send the unique code printed on it as a [[short message service|text message]] to the project phone number.  Moments later a message would be received that was left by the person who placed the sticker.

The ''Yellow Arrow'' symbol means "there’s more here: a hidden detail, a funny story, a memory, and a crazy experience." Each arrow linked digital content to a specific location using the mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/technology/techspecial2/25geo.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22yellow%20arrow%22&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Ethan | last=Todras-Whitehill | title=Making Connections, Here and Now | date=2006-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an underground phenomenon, the project developed an international community, and 7535 ''Yellow Arrow'' stickers were placed in 467 cities and 35 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=House|first=Brian|title=Yellow Arrow|url=http://brianhouse.net/works/yellow_arrow/|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since first appearing at the [[Psy-Geo-Conflux]] in New York in May 2004, ''Yellow Arrow'' has been featured in The New York Times, Wired,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=Text in the City|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/play.html?pg=3|accessdate=14 September 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsweek, The Washington Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nguyen|first=Tommy|title=Targeting the 'Art' Around Every Corner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/01/AR2005070102280.html|accessdate=14 September 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2005-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Globe, CNN and NBC, the London Times, Politiken,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/fakta_kultur/ECE115054/yellow-arrow---et-globalt-kunstprojekt/|title=Yellow Arrow - et globalt kunstprojekt

In ''Toward the Sentient City'', Mark Shepard writes, "In place of the ubiquitous bronze plaque providing "official narratives" affixed to the side of "significant" urban structures or spaces, ''Yellow Arrow'' provides for the unofficial annotation of everyday urban places by ordinary citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepard|first=Mark|title=Sentient City|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51586-3|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yellow Arrow'' was included in the exhibition ''Design and the Elastic Mind'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA.org {{!}} Design and The Elastic Mind|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the project was discontinued and its content was archived on [[Flickr]].
