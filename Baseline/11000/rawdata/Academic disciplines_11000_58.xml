The '''Amerind Foundation''' is a [[museum]] and research facility dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of [[Amerindian|Native American]] cultures and their histories. Its facilities are located near the village of [[Dragoon, Arizona|Dragoon]] in [[Cochise County, Arizona]], about 65 miles east of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Texas Canyon]].

[[William Shirley Fulton]] (1880–1964), an archaeologist, established the Amerind Foundation in 1937.

The Amerind Foundation's building was designed by Tucson architect [[Merritt Starkweather]] and contains one of the finest collections of [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[ethnology|ethnological]] artifacts in the country as well as a sizable research library. 

According to the Foundation's literature, "Amerind" is a contraction of the words "[[Native American name controversy|American]]" and "Indian".

==Museum exhibits==
The museum's permanent exhibits include archaeological artifacts from the Amerind property by founder [[William Shirley Fulton]] and later by director [[Charles C. Di Peso]], as well as items found at Di Peso at [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]] and other excavations.  The objects include weapons, tools, baskets, sandals, cordage of human hair, and cloth.

There are ethnographic items from different indigenous peoples ranging from Alaska to South America. Items on display include jewelry, baskets, weapons, cradle boards, religious artifacts, figurative items, ceramics and pottery, and art.

===Art Gallery===
The Fulton-Hayden Memorial Art Gallery features paintings by 20th century [[Anglo]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] artists.

'''Caenogenesis''' (also variously spelled '''cainogenesis''', '''cenogenesis''', '''kainogenesis''', '''kenogenesis''') is the introduction during [[embryon]]ic development of characters or structure not present in the earlier [[evolution]]ary history of the strain or [[species]], as opposed to [[palingenesis]]. Notable examples include the addition of the [[placenta]] in [[mammal]]s.

Caenogenesis constitutes a violation to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[biogenetic law]] and was explained by Haeckel as adaptation to the peculiar conditions of the [[organism]]'s individual development. Other authorities, such as [[Wilhelm His, Sr.]], on the contrary saw embryonic differences as precursors to adult differences.

[[Image:rice chaffs.jpg|thumb|[[Rice]] chaff]]

'''Chaff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|f}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cambridge Pronouncing Dictionary|author=Daniel Jones|editor1=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartman |editor3=Jane Setter |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the dry, scaly protective casings of the seeds of [[cereal grain]], or similar fine, dry, scaly plant material such as scaly parts of [[flower]]s, or finely chopped [[straw]]. Chaff is indigestible by humans, but [[livestock]] can eat it and in [[agriculture]] it is used as livestock [[fodder]], or is a waste material [[plough]]ed into the [[soil]] or burnt.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|chaff|glume}}
"Chaff" comes from [[Middle English]] ''chaf'', from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceaf'', related to [[Old High German]] ''cheva'', "husk".

==Grain chaff==
[[Image:Usdaeinkorn1 Triticum monococcum.jpg|thumbnail|Spikelets of a hulled wheat, [[Einkorn wheat|einkorn]]]]In [[Poaceae|grass]]es (including [[cereal]]s such as [[rice]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, and [[wheat]]), the ripe seed is surrounded by thin, dry, scaly [[bracts]] (called [[glume]]s, [[Lemma (botany)|lemma]]s and [[palea (botany)|palea]]s), forming a dry [[husk]] (or hull) around the grain. Once it is removed it is often referred to as chaff.
 
In wild  cereals and in the primitive domesticated [[einkorn]],&lt;ref name=Potts&gt;Potts, D. T. (1996) ''Mesopotamia Civilization: The Material Foundations'' [[Cornell University Press]]. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-8014-3339-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[emmer]]&lt;ref&gt;Nevo, Eviatar &amp; A. B. Korol &amp; A. Beiles &amp; T. Fahima. (2002) ''Evolution of Wild Emmer and Wheat Improvement: Population Genetics, Genetic Resources, and Genome...''. Springer. p. 8. {{ISBN|3-540-41750-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spelt]]&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, J. G. &amp; P. A. Judd. (2003) ''The Oxford Book of Health Foods''. [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 35. {{ISBN|0-19-850459-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; wheats, the husks enclose each seed tightly.  Before the grain can be used, the husks must be removed.

The process of loosening the chaff from the grain so as to remove it is called ''[[threshing]]'' &amp;ndash; traditionally done by milling or pounding. Separating remaining loose chaff from the grain is called ''[[winnowing]]'' &amp;ndash; traditionally done by repeatedly tossing the grain up into a light wind which gradually blows the lighter chaff away. This method typically utilizes a broad, plate-shaped basket or similar receptacle to hold and collect the winnowed grain as it falls back down.

Domesticated grains such as [[durum wheat]] and [[common wheat]] have been bred to have chaff that is easily removed. These varieties are known as ''free-threshing'' or ''naked''.

Chaff should not be confused with [[bran]], which is finer scaly material that is part of the grain itself.

==Straw chaff==
Chaff is also made by chopping [[straw]] (or sometimes coarse [[hay]]) into very short lengths, using a machine called a [[chaff cutter]].  Like grain chaff this is used as animal feed, and is a way of turning coarse fodder into a form more palatable to livestock.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/collection/search/display.aspx?irn=56 "The Chaff cutter"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquefarmtools.info/ Cutting chaff by hand]: detail of painting by [[David Teniers the Younger]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorians.asp-host.co.uk/themes/agriculture/chaffcutterobj.htm A Victorian chaff cutter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321063813/http://www.victorians.asp-host.co.uk/themes/agriculture/chaffcutterobj.htm |date=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botany==
In [[botany]], chaff refers to the thin [[List of plant morphology terms#Basic flower parts|receptacular]] [[bracts]] of many species in the sunflower family [[Asteraceae]] and related families. They are modified scale-like [[leaves]] surrounding single [[floret]]s in the flower-head.&lt;ref name="Jones2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Jones|title=Plant Life of Kentucky: An Illustrated Guide to the Vascular Flora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bsngx7s0OI4C&amp;pg=PA751|date=25 March 2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7194-6|pages=751–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphor==
Chaff as a waste product from grain processing leads to a [[metaphor]]ical use of the term, to refer to something seen as worthless.  This is commonly used in the expression "to separate the wheat from the chaff" from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 3:12 which says: Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&lt;ref name="Manser2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin H. Manser|title=I Never Knew That Was in the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hPJjxbDpxgC&amp;pg=PT1224|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=978-1-4185-6690-6|pages=1224–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare also the "[[Parable of the Tares]]", which refers to a mixture of wheat and [[Lolium temulentum|tares]] (a kind of weed). Another example is in Psalm 1:4 of the [[Bible]], which says: The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. (KJV)

==Use==
Hungarian engineer László Schremmer has recently discovered that by the use of chaff-based filters it is possible to reduce the [[arsenic]] content of  water to 3 microgram/litre. This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mno.hu/gazdasag/szenzacios-magyar-talalmany-1068315 Newspaper article] (in Hungarian) published by [[Magyar Nemzet]] on April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''order''' in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=6-1LAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=%22An%20order%20in%20architecture%20is%20a%20certain%20assemblage%20of%20parts%20subject%20to%20uniform%20established%20proportions,%20regulated%20by%20the%20office%20that%20each%20part%20has%20to%20perform%22&amp;f=false|title=An Encyclopædia of Architecture: Historical, Theoretical, and Practical|last=Gwilt|first=Joseph|date=1842|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coming down to the present from [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman]] civilization, the '''architectural orders''' are the styles of [[classical architecture]], each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of [[column]] employed. The three orders of architecture—the [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]—originated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], which they made simpler than Doric, and the [[Composite order|Composite]], which was more ornamental than the Corinthian.  The architectural order of a classical building is akin to the [[Musical mode|mode]] or [[Key (music)|key]] of [[classical music]], the [[grammar]] or [[rhetoric]] of a written composition.  It is established by certain ''modules'' like the [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 7-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the orders were essentially structural in [[Ancient Greek architecture]], which made little use of the arch until its late period, in [[Roman architecture]] where the arch was often dominant, the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in [[portico]]s and similar uses.  Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into [[pilaster]]s.  This treatment continued after the conscious and "correct" use of the orders, initially following exclusively Roman models, returned in the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Greek Revival architecture]], inspired by increasing knowledge of Greek originals, returned to more authentic models, including ones from relatively early periods.

== Elements ==
[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

Each style has distinctive [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s at the top of columns and horizontal [[entablature]]s which it supports, while the rest of the building does not in itself vary between the orders.  The column shaft and base also varies with the order, and is sometimes articulated with vertical hollow grooves known as [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]].  The shaft is wider at the bottom than at the top, because its [[entasis]], beginning a third of the way up, imperceptibly makes the column slightly more slender at the top, although some Doric columns, especially early Greek ones, are visibly "flared", with straight profiles that narrow going up the shaft.

The capital rests on the shaft. It has a load-bearing function, which concentrates the weight of the entablature on the supportive column, but it primarily serves an aesthetic purpose.  The necking is the continuation of the shaft, but is visually separated by one or many grooves. The [[Molding (decorative)|echinus]] lies atop the necking.  It is a circular block that bulges outwards towards the top to support the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]], which is a square or shaped block that in turn supports the entablature.  The entablature consists of three horizontal layers, all of which are visually separated from each other using moldings or bands.  In Roman and post-Renaissance work, the entablature may be carried from column to column in the form of an [[arch]] that springs from the column that bears its weight, retaining its divisions and sculptural enrichment, if any.  There are names for all the many parts of the orders.

== Measurement ==
[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|left|Greek orders with full height]] 
The height of columns are calculated in terms of a ratio between the diameter of the shaft at its base and the height of the column. A Doric column can be described as seven diameters high, an Ionic column as eight diameters high and a Corinthian column nine diameters high, although the actual ratios used vary considerably in both ancient and revived examples, but keeping to the trend of increasing slimness between the orders. Sometimes this is phrased as "lower diameters high", to establish which part of the shaft has been measured.

== Greek orders ==
There are three distinct orders in Ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. These three were adopted by the Romans, who modified their capitals. The Roman adoption of the Greek orders took place in the 1st century BC. The three Ancient Greek orders have since been consistently used in neo-classical European architecture.

Sometimes the Doric order is considered the earliest order, but there is no evidence to support this.  Rather, the Doric and Ionic orders seem to have appeared at around the same time, the Ionic in eastern Greece and the Doric in the west and mainland.

Both the Doric and the Ionic order appear to have originated in wood. The [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]] in Olympia is the oldest well-preserved temple of Doric architecture. It was built just after 600 BC. The Doric order later spread across Greece and into [[Sicily]] where it was the chief order for [[monumental architecture]] for 800 years.  Early Greeks were no doubt aware of the use of stone columns with bases and capitals in [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]], and that of other Near Eastern cultures, although there they were mostly used in interiors, rather than as a dominant feature of all or part of exteriors, in the Greek style.  
[[File:DoricParthenon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Doric order of the [[Parthenon]]]]

=== Doric order===
{{Main|Doric order}}
The Doric order originated on the mainland and western [[Greece]]. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, organized, heavy columns with plain, round [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 16 flutes. The capital consists of a necking or Annulet which is a simple ring. The echinus is convex, or circular cushion like stone, and the abacus is square slab of stone.

Above the capital is a square [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] connecting the capital to the entablature.  The Entablature is divided into three horizontal registers, the lower part of which is either smooth or divided by horizontal lines.  The upper half is distinctive for the Doric order. The frieze of the Doric entablature is divided into [[triglyph]]s and [[metope (architecture)|metopes]]. A triglyph is a unit consisting of three vertical bands which are separated by grooves. Metopes are the plain or carved reliefs between two triglyphs.

The Greek forms of the Doric order come without an individual base. They instead are placed directly on the [[stylobate]]. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result, they appear lighter than the Greek orders.

[[File:IonicCapitalPriene.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ionic order]]

=== Ionic order ===
{{Main|Ionic order}}
The Ionic order came from eastern Greece, where its origins are entwined with the similar but little known [[Aeolic order]]. It is distinguished by slender, fluted [[column|pillar]]s with a large base and two opposed ''volutes'' (also called ''scrolls'') in the echinus of the capital. The echinus itself is decorated with an [[egg-and-dart]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]. The Ionic shaft comes with four more flutes than the Doric counterpart (totalling 24). The Ionic base has two convex moldings called ''tori'' which are separated by a scotia.

The Ionic order is also marked by an [[entasis]], a curved tapering in the column shaft. A column of the ionic order is nine times its lower diameter. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped bands (''fasciae''). The frieze comes without the Doric ''triglyph'' and ''metope''. The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures instead.

[[File:CorinthianOrderPantheon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Corinthian order]]

=== Corinthian order ===
{{Main|Corinthian order}}
The Corinthian order is the most ornate of the Greek orders, characterized by a slender fluted column having an ornate capital decorated with two rows of acanthus leaves and four scrolls. It is commonly regarded as the most elegant of the three orders.  The shaft of the Corinthian order has 24 flutes. The column is commonly ten diameters high.

The Roman writer [[Vitruvius]] [[Callimachus (sculptor)#Architecture|credited]] the invention of the Corinthian order to [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], a Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] of the 5th century BC. The oldest known building built according to this order is the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in Athens, constructed from 335 to 334 BC. The Corinthian order was raised to rank by the writings of Vitruvius in the 1st century BC.

== Roman orders ==
The Romans adapted all the Greek orders and also developed two orders of their own, basically modifications of Greek orders. However, it was not until the Renaissance that these were named and formalized as the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] and [[Composite order|Composite]], respectively the plainest and most ornate of the orders.  The Romans also invented the [[superposed order]]. A superposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for the top story.

The [[Colossal order]] was invented by [[Renaissance architecture|architects in the Renaissance]]. The Colossal order is characterized by columns that extend the height of two or more stories.
[[File:PalladioTuscan.jpg|thumb|150px|The Tuscan order in [[Andrea Palladio]], ''Quattro Libri di Architettura,'' 1570]]

=== Tuscan order ===
{{Main|Tuscan order}}
The Tuscan order has a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a simplified adaptation of the Doric order by the Greeks. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consists of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it is similar to the Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.

[[File:Komposita1.png|right|thumb|150px|Composite order]]

=== Composite order ===
{{Main|Composite order}}
The Composite order is a mixed order, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian order. Until the [[Renaissance]] it was not ranked as a separate order. Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order. The column of the Composite order is typically ten diameters high.

== Historical development of the orders ==
[[File:StGervais Fassade.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]] in Paris presents columns of the three orders : Doric at the ground floor, Ionic at the second floor, Corinthian at the third floor]]
[[File:Bodleian Library 2 (5650412310).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Tower of The Five Orders at the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]], completed in 1619, includes Tuscan through Composite orders.]]
The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] period saw renewed interest in the literary sources of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The treatise ''[[De architectura]]'' by Roman theoretician, architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]], is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Rediscovered in the 15th century, Vitruvius was instantly hailed as the authority on architecture. However, in his text the word ''order'' is not to be found. To describe the four species of columns (he only mentions: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian) he uses, in fact, various words such as: ''genus'' (gender), ''mos'' (habit, fashion, manner), ''opera'' (work).

The term ''order'', as well as the idea of redefining the ''canon'' started circulating in Rome, at the beginning of the 16th century, probably during the studies of Vitruvius' text conducted and shared by Peruzzi, Raphael and Sangallo.&lt;ref&gt;H. Burns and H. Gunthers, ''24éme Colloque International d'Etude Humanistes'', Tours 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
Ever since, the definition of the ''canon'' has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules for the use of the Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Small, [http://sites.scran.ac.uk/ada/documents/general/orders/classical_orders.htm "The five orders of classical architecture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vignola defining the concept of "order" ==
{{Main|The Five Orders of Architecture}}
 
Following the examples of Vitruvius and the five books of the ''Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], published from 1537 onwards, [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] produced an architecture rule book that was not only more practical than the previous two treatises, but also was systematically and consistently adopting, for the first time,  the term '''order''' to define each of the five different species of columns inherited from Antiquity. A first publication of the various plates, as separate sheets, appeared in Rome in 1562, with the title: ''Regola delli Cinque Ordini di Architettura'' (''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture ''&lt;ref&gt;The most recent English translation is the one, with an introduction and commentary by Branko Mitrovic, N.Y. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;). As David Watkin has pointed out, Vignola's book "was to have an astonishing publishing history of over 500 editions in 400 years in ten languages, Italian, Dutch, English, Flemish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, during which it became perhaps the most influential book of all times".&lt;ref&gt;David Watkin, Introduction to the ''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture'', translated by John Leeke, reprint of the 1699 edition, N.Y., 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
The book consisted simply of an introduction followed by 32 annotated plates, highlighting the proportional system with all the minute details of the Five Architectural Orders. According to Christof Thoenes, the main expert of Renaissance architectural treatises,  "in accordance with Vitruvius’s example, Vignola chose a “module” equal to a half-diameter which is the base of the system. All the other measurements are expressed in fractions or in multiples of this module. The result is an arithmetical model, and with its help each order, harmoniously proportioned, can easily be adapted to any given height, of a façade or an interior. From this point of view, Vignola's Regola is a remarkable intellectual achievement".[http://architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr/traite/Notice/ENSBA_LES64.asp?param=en]

In America, ''The American Builder's Companion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Benjamin| first = Asher| title = The American Builder's Companion: Or, a System of Architecture Particularly Adapted to the Present Style of Building| year = 1827| publisher = Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-22236-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; written in the early 19th century by the architect [[Asher Benjamin]], influenced many builders in the eastern states, particularly those who developed what became known as the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. The last American re-interpretation of Vignola's ''Regola'', was edited in 1904 by William Robert Ware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ware| first = William R.| title = The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC| year = 1994| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-28310-4| pages = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break from the classical mode came first with the [[Gothic revival]], then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The [[Bauhaus]] promoted pure functionalism, stripped of superfluous ornament, and that has become one of the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]] introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a few practitioners e.g. [[Quinlan Terry]] and Stuart Martin still work in a traditional classical idiom.

== Nonce orders ==
Several orders, usually based upon the composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again. They are termed "''nonce orders''" by analogy to ''[[nonce word]]s''; several examples follow below. 
These nonce orders all express the “speaking architecture” (''[[architecture parlante]]'') that was taught in the Paris courses, most explicitly by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], in which sculptural details of classical architecture could be enlisted to speak symbolically, the better to express the purpose of the structure and enrich its visual meaning with specific appropriateness. This idea was taken up strongly in the training of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], ca 1875–1915. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

;British Order
[[Robert Adam]]'s brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]] was in Rome in 1762, drawing antiquities under the direction of [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau|Clérisseau]]; he invented a '''British Order''' and published an engraving of it. Its capital the heraldic lion and unicorn take the place of the Composite's volutes, a Byzantine or Romanesque conception, but expressed in terms of neoclassical realism. Adam's ink-and-wash rendering with red highlighting is at the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library|Avery Library]], [[Columbia University]].

;Ammonite order and Agricultural order
In 1789 [[George Dance the Elder|George Dance]] invented an '''[[Ammonite Order]]''', a variant of Ionic substituting volutes in the form of [[fossil]] [[ammonite]]s for [[John Boydell]]'s [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]] in [[Pall Mall, London]].&lt;ref name="oxford22"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Curl |first1=James Stevens |last2=Wilson |first2=Susan |title=Oxford Dictionary of Architecture |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967499-2 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptation of the Corinthian order by [[William Donthorne]] that used turnip leaves and [[mangelwurzel]] is termed the '''Agricultural order'''.&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p.&amp;nbsp;238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corn-capital-litchfield.jpg|thumb|upright|Corn capital at the [[Litchfield Villa]] [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)]] ([[Alexander Jackson Davis|A.J. Davis]], architect)]]
;American orders
In the United States [[Benjamin Latrobe]], the architect of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in Washington&amp;nbsp;DC, designed a series of botanically '''American orders'''. Most famous is the order substituting corncobs and their husks, which was executed by [[Giuseppe Franzoni]] and employed in the small domed Vestibule of the Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court survived the fire of 24&amp;nbsp;August 1814, nearly intact. With peace restored, Latrobe designed an American order that substituted for the acanthus tobacco leaves, of which he sent a sketch to [[Thomas Jefferson]] in a letter, 5&amp;nbsp;November 1816. He was encouraged to send a model of it, which remains at [[Monticello]]. In the 1830s [[Alexander Jackson Davis]] admired it enough to make a drawing of it. In 1809 Latrobe invented a second American order, employing [[magnolia]] flowers constrained within the profile of classical mouldings, as his drawing demonstrates. It was intended for "the Upper Columns in the Gallery of the Entrance of the Chamber of the Senate" ({{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/us.capitol/s4.html |title=United States Capitol exhibit}}).

'''Clothing technology''' involves the manufacturing, materials, and [[design]] innovations that have been developed and used. The [[timeline of clothing and textiles technology]] includes major changes in the manufacture and distribution of [[clothing]].

From [[clothing in the ancient world]] into modernity the use of technology has dramatically influenced clothing and [[fashion]] in the [[modern history|modern]] age. [[Industrialization]] brought changes in the manufacture of goods. In many nations, homemade goods [[craft]]ed by hand have largely been replaced by [[factory]] produced goods on [[assembly line]]s purchased in a [[consumer culture]]. Innovations include man-made materials such as [[polyester]], [[nylon]], and [[gramophone record|vinyl]] as well as features like [[zipper]]s and [[velcro]]. The advent of advanced electronics has resulted in [[wearable technology]] being developed and popularized since the 1980s. 

[[Design]] is an important part of the industry beyond utilitarian concerns and the [[fashion]] and [[Glamour (presentation)|glamour]] industries have developed in relation to clothing [[marketing]] and [[retail]]. [[Environmentalism|Environmental]] and [[human rights]] issues have also become considerations for clothing and spurred the promotion and use of some natural materials such as [[bamboo textiles|bamboo]] that are considered environmentally friendly. 

==Production==
The advent of industrialization included [[factory|factories]], specialized and technologically advanced equipment, and [[production line]]s for the [[mass production]] of [[textiles]]. [[Globalization]] and advances in trade increased sourcing of metrials and competition for wares across borders. The [[swadeshi movement]] in [[India]] was an effort to counteract the economic control and influence that British factories exerted over the one-time colony. Concerns have also been raised over the use of so-called [[sweat shops]]. 

[[Clothing line]]s based on famous [[clothing designer|designer]]s have been featured and advertised in magazines and other media. [[brand management|Branding]] and [marketing] are features of the [[advertising age]]. Some designers have also become television and media personalities. In recent years fashion and design has also been the subject of television shows.

==Sports==
The [[design]] and constructions of [[Sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] has changed dramatically over time. &lt;!-- should this be a separate article? --&gt; [[Swimwear]] used in competitions been developed including [[foam]]s, synthetic and stretchable [[athletic tape|tape]]s, and lightweight materials with performance characteristics specially designed for various athletics pursuits have been developed.

==Education==
[[Computer-aided design]] is used in the production of clothing. Corporate and business training to address accounting, trade, and finance issues has also become a significant part of the trade. Courses and programs at Universities specialize in these fields. the [[Beijing Institute of Clothing Technology]] and [[Fachhochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin]] are examples institutions focused on the business. National governments have also become involved in the business with [[trade rules]] and negotiations as well as investments such as Europe's [[Future Textiles and Clothing]] program.

'''Colored music notation''' is a technique used to facilitate enhanced learning in young music students by adding visual color to written musical notation.  It is based upon the concept that color can affect the observer in various ways, and combines this with standard learning of basic notation.

==Basis==
Viewing [[color]] has been widely shown to change an individual's [[Emotion|emotional state]] and stimulate [[neurons]].  The [[Lüscher color test]] observes from experiments that when individuals are required to contemplate pure red for varying lengths of time, [the experiments] have shown that this color decidedly has a stimulating effect on the [[nervous system]]; [[blood pressure]] increases, and [[respiration rate]] and [[heart rate]] both increase.  Pure blue, on the other hand, has the reverse effect; observers experience a decline in blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.&lt;ref name="poast"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poast |first=Michael |date=June 2000 |title=Color Music: Visual Color Notation for Musical Expression  |journal=Leonardo |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=215–21 |jstor=1577047 |doi=10.1162/002409400552531}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given these findings, it has been suggested{{by whom|date=November 2014}} that the influence of colored musical notation would be similar.

==Music education==
In [[music education]], color is typically used in method books to highlight new material.  Stimuli received through several senses excite more neurons in several localized areas of the cortex, thereby reinforcing the learning process and improving retention.&lt;ref name="rogers-91"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=George L. |title=Effect of Color-Coded Notation on Music Achievement of Elementary Instrumental Students |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education  |volume=39 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=64–73 |jstor=3344609 |doi=10.2307/3344609}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information has been proven by other researchers; Chute (1978) reported that "elementary students who viewed a colored version of an instructional film scored significantly higher on both immediate and delayed tests than did students who viewed a monochrome version".&lt;ref name="rogers-96"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=George L. |title=Effect of Colored Rhythmic Notation on Music-Reading Skills of Elementary Students |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education |volume=44 |issue=1 |year=1996 |pages=15–25 |jstor=3345410 |doi=10.2307/3345410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color studies==

===Effect on achievement===

A researcher in this field, George L. Rogers is the Director of [[Music Education]] at [[Westfield State College]].  He is also the author of 25 articles in publications that include the Music Educators Journal, The Instrumentalist, and the Journal of Research in Music Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Faculty Listing |publisher=[[Westfield State College]] |url=http://www.wsc.ma.edu/music/faculty/default.asp?who= |accessdate=2006-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006124206/http://www.wsc.ma.edu/music/faculty/default.asp?who= |archivedate=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, George L. Rogers did a study that researched the effect of color-coded notation on music achievement of elementary instrumental students.  Rogers states that the color-coded notation used in this study was not meant to replace the present notational system; rather, it was intended as a pedagogical aid for beginners.&lt;ref name="rogers-91"/&gt;

The subjects used for this study were 92 fifth- and sixth-grade beginner [[wind instrument]] players who attended two different schools.  The experimental group used color-coded method books and supplementary materials in which each different pitch was highlighted with a different color using felt-tip markers.  The control group used identical materials, but with the notation uncolored.  The students were then tested in three different parts: 
# Students performed a 26-note melody from memory (The materials were presented either in color or uncolored notation).
# Students [[Sight reading|sight-read]] two 12-note melodies (One melody was presented in color-coded notation, the other uncolored. The students were then asked which notation was easier to play).
# Students named the letter names of the notes in two 7-note melodies.&lt;ref name="rogers-91"/&gt;

The results of this study are as follows:  Subjects in the experimental and [[Scientific control|control groups]] performed much the same on the task of playing music from memory.   For the task of sight-reading, the experimental group scored higher than did the control group.  However, the control group (without color-coded notation) scored higher when sight-reading uncolored notation.  In fact, the students who learned using color-coded notation scored significantly lower when sight-reading plain notation.

A possible theory regarding these results is that the students in the experimental group memorized the colors instead of the notation.  The third task of note naming seemed to be less of a challenge for the control group who learned to read notation than the experimental group who learned which color is which fingering on their instrument.  In regards to which type of notation was easier to read, in the experimental group all but three found the color-coded notation easier to play, in the control group 18 out of the 46 chose color-coded notation also easier to read.  This is a deviation from standard findings, as most students prefer the method they were first introduced to.&lt;ref name="rogers-91"/&gt;

===Effect on music-reading skills===

In 1996, Rogers did another study researching the effect of colored [[rhythm|rhythmic notation]] on the music-reading skills of elementary students.   Rogers states that the purpose of studying the effect of colored rhythmic notation was to determine if instruction involving the addition of color to standard rhythmic notation would affect the performance of elementary music students on the task of clapping and vocalizing rhythmic exercises on sight.  The subjects of this study were 134 first- and second-grade general music students. The two particular schools involved in the experiment were chosen because most students attending were dealing with notation intensively for the first time.&lt;ref name="rogers-96"/&gt;

The experimental subjects participated in vocalizing and clapping rhythms notated with colored chalk on the chalkboard as a regular part of general music classes.  Control subjects read, vocalized and clapped identical rhythms noted in white chalk.  In the experimental group, contrasting colors were used to notate the different rhythmic values.  The colors used were arbitrary and changed from week to week (so no one color was identified with a particular note or rest).

The students used the [[Cheve]] rhythm syllables, consisting of ''ta''’s for quarter notes and ''ti-ti''’s for [[Note value|eighth notes]]. The students were tested by sight-reading two exercises from a chalkboard and clapping and vocalizing the rhythmic notation.  One test was in colored rhythmic notation and the other was uncolored.  The students performed the two exercises involving similar rhythms, with colored notation being applied randomly to either the first or second task.&lt;ref name="rogers-96"/&gt;
			
The results of this study are as follows:  Students in both experimental and control groups scored well, with a combined mean for all subjects of 10.66 out of 12 points.  Students who experienced colored rhythmic notation during the treatment period scored somewhat higher as a group on both tasks.&lt;ref name="rogers-96"/&gt;

===Special needs students===
Students who need academic assistance are often students who have [[Learning disability|learning disorders]].  Kent Gerlach clarifies some of the symptoms of learning disorders, and establishes that certain difficulties arise, particularly with the following:

*Poor [[visual memory]] – forgetting what has been seen or read.
*Poor visual discrimination, especially when distinguishing between squares and rectangles, circles and ovals, the letters m, r, h, n, r, p, b, d, g, and q, and the numbers 6 and 9, 21 and 12.
*Poor figure ground – difficulty selecting one thing from a group, such as a particular letter in a word or word in a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerlach |first=Kent |title=Individuals with Special Needs |publisher=Pacific Training Associates |location=[[Seattle, WA]] |oclc=57378072}}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers found that during the 1991 study on the effects of color-coded notation on music achievement of elementary instrumental students that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The high level of dependence on color-coding among learning disabled and [[Developmental disability|mentally handicapped]] students may reflect a situation similar to that reported by Chute in which students of different ability levels were affected differently by the presence or absence of color in instructional materials. Not only did the learning-disabled and mentally handicapped students in the experimental group score much higher on the tasks that involved color-coded notation than on the uncolored notation, but it also appeared that the color-coded notation enabled them to score as high as or higher than the other students"&lt;ref name="rogers-91"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He suggests that the scores of students identified as receiving extra academic assistance were examined separately and were found to be lower than the overall student sample, but were otherwise similar to the means for all students.&lt;ref name="rogers-96"/&gt;

==Findings==
As a result of these experiments, colored notation does seem to help early music students to learn notation and rhythms more than students with uncolored notation. In Rogers' 1991 study of color-coded notation, it is clear that students relied more heavily on the colors that were assigned to the notation, rather than on learning the notation.  However, as the students were able to easily tell the different notes apart, perhaps by using different colors that are not assigned to a note, the experimental students would have been able to read not only the colored notation better but also the uncolored notation.  Rogers did change the second study, in 1996, making the colors arbitrary.  While the obvious disadvantage of memorization from the 1991 study exists, the overall findings of the study were that colored musical notation is an inexpensive and effective tool when used with young music students.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10319">In [[computer science]], the '''complexity function''' of a string, a finite or infinite sequence of letters from some alphabet, is the function that counts the number of distinct factors (substrings of consecutive symbols) from that string.  More generally, the complexity function of a language, a set of finite words over an alphabet, counts the number of distinct words of given length.

==Complexity function of a word==
Let ''u'' be a (possibly infinite) sequence of symbols from an alphabet.  Define the function
''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') of a positive integer ''n'' to be the number of different factors (consecutive substrings) of length ''n'' from the string&amp;nbsp;''u''.&lt;ref name=L7&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=L46/&gt;&lt;ref name=PF3&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS82&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS298&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.298&lt;/ref&gt;

For a string ''u'' of length at least ''n'' over an alphabet of size ''k'' we clearly have 
:&lt;math&gt; 1 \le p_u(n) \le k^n \ , &lt;/math&gt;
the bounds being achieved by the constant word and a [[disjunctive word]],&lt;ref name=Bug91&gt;Bugeaud (2012) p.91&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the [[Champernowne word]] respectively.&lt;ref name=CN165&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.165&lt;/ref&gt;  For infinite words ''u'', we have ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') bounded if ''u'' is ultimately periodic (a finite, possibly empty, sequence followed by a finite cycle).  Conversely, if ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') ≤ ''n'' for some ''n'', then ''u'' is ultimately periodic.&lt;ref name=PF3/&gt;&lt;ref name=AS302&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.302&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aperiodic sequence''' is one which is not ultimately periodic.  An aperiodic sequence has strictly increasing complexity function (this is the '''Morse–Hedlund theorem'''),&lt;ref name=BR166/&gt;&lt;ref name=CN166&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.166&lt;/ref&gt; so ''p''(''n'') is at least ''n''+1.&lt;ref name=L22&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A set ''S'' of finite binary words is ''balanced'' if for each ''n'' the subset ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of words of length ''n'' has the property that the [[Hamming weight]] of the words in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; takes at most two distinct values.  A '''balanced sequence''' is one for which the set of factors is balanced.&lt;ref name=AS313&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.313&lt;/ref&gt;  A balanced sequence has complexity function at most ''n''+1.&lt;ref name=L48&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sturmian word]] over a binary alphabet is one with complexity function ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=PF6&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  A sequence is Sturmian if and only if it is balanced and aperiodic.&lt;ref name=L46&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS318&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  An example is the [[Fibonacci word]].&lt;ref name=PF6/&gt;&lt;ref name=deluca1995&gt;{{cite journal |  journal=Information Processing Letters | year=1995 | pages=307–312 | doi=10.1016/0020-0190(95)00067-M | title=A division property of the Fibonacci word | first=Aldo | last=de Luca |  volume=54 |  issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, a Sturmian word over an alphabet of size ''k'' is one with complexity ''n''+''k''−1.  An Arnoux-Rauzy word over a ternary alphabet has complexity 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1:&lt;ref name=PF6/&gt; an example is the [[Tribonacci word]].&lt;ref name=PF368&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.368&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[recurrent word]]s, those in which each factor appears infinitely often, the complexity function almost characterises the set of factors: if ''s'' is a recurrent word with the same complexity function as ''t'' are then ''s'' has the same set of factors as ''t'' or δ''t'' where δ denotes the letter doubling morphism ''a'' → ''aa''.&lt;ref name=BLRS84&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complexity function of a language==
Let ''L'' be a language over an alphabet and define the function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') of a positive integer ''n'' to be the number of different words of length ''n'' in ''L''&lt;ref name=BR166&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.166&lt;/ref&gt;  The complexity function of a word is thus the complexity function of the language consisting of the factors of that word.

The complexity function of a language is less constrained than that of a word.  For example, it may be bounded but not eventually constant: the complexity function of the [[regular language]] &lt;math&gt;a(bb)^*a&lt;/math&gt; takes values 3 and 4 on odd and even ''n''≥2 respectively.  There is an analogue of the Morse–Hedlund theorem: if the complexity of ''L'' satisfies ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')  ≤ ''n'' for some ''n'', then ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is bounded and there is a finite language ''F'' such that&lt;ref name=BR166/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L \subseteq \{ x y^k z : x,y,z \in F,\ k \in \mathbb{N} \} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

A '''polynomial''' or '''[[sparse language]]''' is one for which the complexity function ''p''(''n'') is bounded by a fixed power of ''n''.  A [[regular language]] which is not polynomial is ''exponential'': there are infinitely many ''n'' for which ''p''(''n'') is greater than ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some fixed ''k'' &gt; 1.&lt;ref name=BR136&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
The ''[[topological entropy]]'' of an infinite sequence ''u'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{top}}(u) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log p_u(n)}{n \log k} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The limit exists as the logarithm of the complexity function is [[Subadditivity|subadditive]].&lt;ref name=PF4&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS303&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.303&lt;/ref&gt;  Every real number between 0 and 1 occurs as the topological entropy of some sequence is applicable,&lt;ref name=CN169&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.169&lt;/ref&gt; which may be taken to be [[Uniformly recurrent word|uniformly recurrent]]&lt;ref name=BR391&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.391&lt;/ref&gt; or even uniquely ergodic.&lt;ref name=BR169&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''x'' a real number and ''b'' an integer ≥ 2 then the complexity function of ''x'' in base ''b'' is the complexity function ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') of the sequence of digits of ''x'' written in base ''b''.
If ''x'' is an [[irrational number]] then ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') ≥ ''n''+1; if ''x'' is [[rational number|rational]] then ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') ≤ ''C'' for some constant ''C'' depending on ''x'' and ''b''.&lt;ref name=Bug91&gt;Bugeaud (2012) p.91&lt;/ref&gt;  It is conjectured that for algebraic irrational ''x'' the complexity is ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (which would follow if all such numbers were [[Normal number|normal]]) but all that is known in this case is that ''p'' grows faster than any linear function of ''n''.&lt;ref name=BR414&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.414&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''abelian complexity function''' ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') similarly counts the number of occurrences of distinct factors of given length ''n'', where now we identify factors that differ only by a permutation of the positions.  Clearly ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') ≤ ''p''(''n'').  The abelian complexity of a Sturmian sequence satisfies ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') = 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=On the Asymptotic Abelian Complexity of Morphic Words | title=Developments in Language Theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4212">'''Cryptospores''' are [[fossil]]ised primitive plant [[spore]]s that first appear in the [[fossil]] record during the middle of the [[Ordovician]] period.

==Evidence that cryptospores derive from land plants==

===Occurrence===
Cryptospores are generally found in non-marine [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and decrease in abundance with distance offshore. This suggests that any cryptospores found in the [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] environment were transported there by the wind from the land, rather than originating from the marine environment.

===Wall Ultrastructure===
The walls of cryptospores consist of many lamellae (thin sheets). [[Marchantiophyta|Liverwort]]s, thought to be the most primitive land plants, also have this spore wall [[Comparative anatomy|morphology]].

===Chemical composition ===
(Some) cryptospores are composed of sporopollenin and have the same chemical makeup as co-occurring trilete spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steemans|first=P.|author2=Lepot, K. |author3=Marshall, C.P. |author4= Le Hérissé, A. and Javaux, E.J. |title=FTIR characterisation of the chemical composition of Silurian miospores (cryptospores and trilete spores) from Gotland, Sweden|journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology|date=2010|volume=162|issue=4|pages=577–590|doi=10.1016/j.revpalbo.2010.07.006|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034666710001557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other information==
Recently, fossils of plant [[Sporangium|sporangia]] have been found in [[Oman]] with cryptospores showing concentric lamellae in their walls, similar to [[liverworts]]. The earliest known cryptospores are from Middle [[Ordovician]] ([[Dapingian]]) strata of [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubinstein|first=C.V.|author2=Gerrienne, P. |author3=de la Puente, G.S. |author4=Astini, R.A. |author5=Steemans, P. |title=Early Middle Ordovician evidence for land plants in Argentina (eastern Gondwana)|journal=New Phytologist|date=2010|volume=188|issue=2|pages=365–369|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03433.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03433.x/full|pmid=20731783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spores from the Lindegård [[Mudstone]] (late [[Katian]]–early [[Hirnantian]]) represent the earliest record of early [[land plant]] [[spores]] from [[Sweden]] and possibly also from [[Baltica]] and implies that [[land plants]] had migrated to the [[palaeocontinent]] [[Baltica]] by at least the Late [[Ordovician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Badawy|first=A.S.|author2=Mehlqvist, K. |author3=Vajda, V. |author4= Ahlberg, P. and Calner, M. |title=Late Ordovician (Katian) spores in Sweden: oldest land plant remains from Baltica|journal=GFF|date=2014|volume=136|issue=1|pages=16–21|doi=10.1080/11035897.2014.899266|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11035897.2014.899266#.U2RHetIW2So}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery reinforces the earlier suggestion that the migration of land plants from northern [[Gondwana]] to [[Baltica]] in the Late [[Ordovician]] was facilitated by the northward migration of [[Avalonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steemans|first=P.|author2=Wellman, C.H. and Gerrienne, P. |title=Paleogeographic and paleoclimatic considerations based on Ordovician to Lochkovian vegetation|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|date=2010|volume=339|pages=49–58|doi=10.1144/SP339.5|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/339/1/49.abstract|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is evidenced by the co-occurrence of reworked, Early–Middle [[Ordovician]] [[acritarchs]], possibly suggesting an Avalonian provenance in a [[foreland basin]] system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14180">The Drought Research Initiative(DRI) was established to better understand the physical characteristics of and processes influencing Canadian Prairie droughts, and to contribute to their better prediction, through a focus on the recent severe drought that began in 1999 and largely ended in 2005. It is an interdisciplinary effort that involves 15 funded investigators from 6 Canadian universities and more than 20 collaborators from other universities and federal laboratories as well as partners from three provincial governments ([[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]]). DRI is achieving its objective by focusing on five complementary research themes, including quantification, understanding, prediction, comparisons with other droughts, and  implications for society. Details beyond the scope of this entry can be found in Stewart et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Stewart, R., J. Pomeroy and R. Lawford, 2008: A Drought Research Initiative for the Canadian Prairies, CMOS Bulletin, Vol. 36, No. 3, 97-102.&lt;/ref&gt; or on the [http://www.drinetwork.ca/ DRI website]

==Background==
[[Drought]] is an anomaly within the atmospheric, surface and sub-surface cycling of water and energy, usually initiated through large to regional scale atmospheric processes, and enhanced and maintained through regional to local [[earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]], [[Surface-water hydrology|surface hydrology]], [[land surface]] and [[groundwater]] feedbacks that operate throughout the annual cycle. Droughts are a distinctive feature of the [[Drought in Canada|Canadian Prairies]] where the large scale [[atmospheric circulation]]s are influenced by [[Block (meteorology)|blocking]] from intense [[orography]] to the west and long distances from all warm ocean-derived atmospheric water sources. &lt;br /&gt;
DRI addresses a multi-year drought that began in 1999 with cessation of its atmospheric component in 2004/2005 and many of its hydrological components in 2005.   It was the worst drought for at least a hundred years in parts of the [[Canadian Prairies]]. According to Phillips (2002),&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Phillips, D.W., 2002: The top ten Canadian weather stories for 2001. CMOS Bulletin, 30, 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; for the western and central Canadian Prairies during 2001 and 2002, “… it was the worst of times. Even in the dust bowl of the 1930s, no single year between Medicine Hat, Kindersley and Saskatoon was drier than in 2001”.   The drought affected agriculture, recreation, tourism, health, hydro-electricity, and forestry in the Prairies. [[Gross Domestic Product]] fell some $5.8 billion and employment losses exceeded 41,000 jobs for 2001 and 2002.  This drought also contributed to a negative or zero net farm income for several provinces for the first time in 25 years ([[Statistics Canada]], 2003&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;Statistics Canada, 2003: Net Farm Income. Catalogue No. 21-010-XIE, Volume 2. Ottawa, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;) with agricultural production over Canada dropping an estimated $3.6 billion in 2001/2002.  Previously reliable water supplies such as streams, wetlands, dugouts, reservoirs, and groundwater were placed under stress and often failed. More details are available in Wheaton (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, E, Wittrock V, Kulshreshtha S, Koshida G, Grant C,

Despite the enormous economic, environmental, and societal impacts of droughts, DRI is undertaking the first integrated drought research program of its kind in Canada with the hope being that the occurrence and nature of drought can be better anticipated on short and long term scales.  From a longer-term perspective, this 5-year Network represents an essential step in better predicting droughts over Canada, their detailed structure and their impacts with increasing confidence and better assessing whether there will be a ‘drying of the continental interior’ in the future

==Research Themes==
DRI is achieving its objective by focusing on five complementary research themes, including quantification, understanding, and better prediction of a particular drought with funding primarily from the [[Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences|Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (CFCAS)]].  Comparisons with other droughts, and implications for society have been funded with additional direct and in-kind support coming from [[Environment Canada]], [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]], [[Natural Resources Canada]], [[Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration|Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA)]], [[Saskatchewan Watershed Authority]], [[Saskatchewan Research Council]], [[Manitoba Water Stewardship]] and [[Manitoba Hydro]].

===1: Characterizing Drought===
To characterize the drought of 1999-2005 DRI has been quantifying its atmospheric, hydrologic, and land-surface physical features at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.  This analysis will be realized by addressing three focused questions:
*What variables are required to quantify the characteristics of this recent drought?
*What data sources and model outputs are available for quantification of these parameters?
*How do we characterize and “close the budgets” of water and energy over the Prairies?

The analysis has involved the development of a four-dimensional assessment of the atmosphere during the drought over various temporal scales using a knowledge of [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[geopotential height]], [[wind]], [[clouds]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] amount, and current [[weather]]. At the surface, the spatial and temporal characteristics of vegetative state (in terms of [[water stress]]) for major vegetation types ([[crop]]s and [[boreal shield|boreal zones]]), [[soil moisture]], [[drainage basin|stream network]], [[river flows]], lake levels, [[wetlands]], [[depression storage capacity|depression storage]], [[groundwater]] and [[subsurface flow|sub-surface flows]] be assessed to determine when and where drought is occurring. Although this is a difficult task due to data gaps, and the complexity of the shallow undulations in the prairies [[topography]], an analysis of [[in-situ]] data, [[earth observation satellite|satellite]] data and model output now provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the drought.

===2: Drought Processes===
DRI is also focusing on the understanding of the processes and feedbacks governing the formation, evolution, cessation and structure of the drought.  This theme addresses the following questions:
*What processes were responsible for the onset of the recent drought?
*What processes and feedbacks contributed to the drought’s evolution, persistence, and spatial structure?
*What processes and feedbacks controlled the termination of this drought?
There are many ways in which drought, basically a sustained precipitation deficit, can be initiated and prolonged.  Some processes that reduce precipitation include, large scale circulation anomalies, lack of moisture advected into a region, reduction of local moisture supplies, production of [[virga]] as opposed to precipitation, and possibly even the role of [[aerosols]] in the dusty environment acting to reduce precipitation.  Over the five years of this drought, these processes and numerous other factors were operating at various times and locations to preclude substantial precipitation from being produced over large regions of the Prairies.  &lt;br /&gt;
While prairie drought processes have characteristic spatial and temporal scales, land surface hydrological/biophysical processes generally operate at small spatial scales (and with larger inherent spatial variability) while atmospheric process have a hierarchy of scales ranging from planetary to local turbulence.  DRI is addressing the cascade of energy and movement of moisture through atmospheric processes and the horizontal scale link between land surface and groundwater processes during drought events.

===3: Drought Prediction===
Drought prediction research in DRI is directed at assessing and reducing uncertainties in the prediction of drought and its structure. In particular, prediction research has focused on the evaluation and improvement of prediction models.  The modelling tools used are [[global climate model|global]] and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs), and [[hydrological model]]s.  The hydrological models are driven by output from the [[atmospheric models]], data from ongoing research sites and reanalysis products.  DRI modeling studies address the following questions:
*How well was the current drought predicted based on current techniques?
*To what extent could this prediction be improved through better initialization?
*To what extent could this prediction be improved through dynamical [[downscaling]] and better [[physics]]?
*What are the appropriate scales and processes for prediction of Prairie droughts?
Use is being made of archived historical model outputs and new simulations to address many of these issues. DRI focuses on many facets of a particular extreme and consequently many more variables beyond the traditional temperature and precipitation need to be examined. For example, experiments carried out within DRI are helping to assess the role of [[soil moisture]] and [[snow cover]] on seasonal prediction.

===4:  Drought Comparisons===
Theme 4 provides comparisons of the recent drought and previous droughts over this region and those in other regions, in the context of [[climate variability]] and [[climate change|change]].  For many users there is a need to understand a current or recent drought event in the context of historical droughts.  These comparisons are guided by the following research questions:
*How do the physical features, processes, and feedbacks of the recent Canadian Prairie drought compare with a) previous droughts over the [[Drought in Canada|Canadian Prairies]], b) [[Drought in Canada|Canada-wide droughts]], c) [[Drought in the United States|US Great Plains droughts]], and d) [[drought|droughts across the world]]?
*How does the prediction of the recent drought compare with predictions of other droughts?
*How does the recent drought compare with past [[climate variability]] and projected [[climate change]]?
Comparisons between the 1999-2004/05 drought have focused on the internal structure of drought, as well as its presence over a particular region.  Many droughts, including the 1999-2005 event have a complex internal structure for their precipitation patterns which often changed dramatically during the drought.  More details on these comparisons are available in Bonsal (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Bonsal, B., 2008: Droughts in Canada: an overview. CMOS Bulletin, Vol. 36, No. 3, 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===5: Drought Impacts===
Theme 5 applies our progress in drought characterization and prediction to critical issues of importance to society during times of drought.  These efforts are linked to the following questions:
*What organizations are affected by drought?
*What exactly is the nature of their impact and how can this be alleviated?
*Given the progress being made by the Network, how can it address drought impacts on affected organizations?
In order to advance this theme, DRI has carried out an extensive consultative process with the users; has launched a set of simulation exercises to test how users may adapt new DRI products to make better decisions through an exercise known as DEWS (Drought Early Warning System test), and formed a Partners Advisory Committee composed of experts from user agencies and groups to give advice on their needs for DRI research and information.  More details are available in Lawford et al. (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Lawford, R., H. Hill, E. Wheaton, I. Hanuta, A. Warkentin, B. Girling and R. Stewart, 2008: A review of some requirements for drought information on the Canadian Prairies. CMOS Bulletin, Vol. 36, No. 3, 97-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Structure and Linkages==
DRI is led by two Principal Investigators, Drs. Ronald Stewart and John Pomeroy.  A Board of Directors, chaired by Jim Bruce oversees the program strategy and a Science Committee takes the day-to-day decisions about the implementation of the project. In addition, the operational details are implemented by a Secretariat consisting of a Network Manager, a Financial Manager and two Data Managers.  A Partners Advisory Committee, chaired by Harvey Hill, also meets and reports on the user needs to the Board of Directors. The program have also established strong linkages and collaborations with research initiatives and departments and on provincial, federal and international levels. The detailed program structure and linkages can be found in Stewart et al., (2008).&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

==The DRI Legacy==
DRI has brought together an unprecedented amount of information on [[Drought in Canada|Canadian drought]]. On its [http://www.drinetwork.ca web site], one can find many links to various datasets that describe elements of drought in the atmosphere, at the surface or below the surface.  Compiling a Prairie-wide database of provincial groundwater and water levels is part of this effort. The data are being brought together in an integrated information system.  Synthesis articles, special issue of [http://www.cmos.ca/pubs.html#Atmosphere-Ocean Atmosphere-Ocean] and a public information document about the 1999-2005 drought are in preparation.  In addition, new techniques of archiving and making available datasets are being explored as one other legacy of DRI.  Undoubtedly, the greatest legacy of DRI will be the young people who have been trained at the PhD, Masters and early scientist level who carried out much of this research and are now pursuing lifetime careers in disciplines related to DRI.

'''Eliot Deutsch''' (born January 8, 1931) is a philosopher, teacher, and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n 79060562}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made important contributions to the understanding and appreciation of [[Eastern philosophies]] in the West through his many works on comparative [[philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]].  Currently he is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the [[University of Hawaii]].

==Biography==

After Deutsch received his doctorate from [[Columbia University]] he was an Associate Professor of Philosophy from 1960 to 1967 and was a Chair in the Department of Philosophy at the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]].  In the summer of 1966 Deutsch was a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1967 Deutsch joined the [[University of Hawaii]] as Professor of Philosophy. He was the editor (from 1967 to 1987) of the international journal ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'', Director of the Sixth Eastern Philosophers conference, as well as the past president of the Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy.&lt;ref name="Author Page"&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/Public/Authors/Detail.asp?AuthorID=83 Author Page]&lt;/ref&gt; Fall of 1985 Deutsch was at [[Harvard University]] as a visiting professor there.  In 1987 until 1989 he was the Director as the Sixth East-West Philosophers' Conference.  From 1991 through 1996 he held position as a Graduate Chair in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Hawaii]].  Deutsch was a Visiting Fellow at Clare Hall the [[University of Cambridge]] in England from July to December 1998 and was elected a Life Member in 1999.  From 1967 through 2006 Professor Deutsch has been a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Hawaii]] as well as spending some of those years as Chair.&lt;ref name="Author Page"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20925">{{short description|A shift in the function of a trait during evolution}}
'''Exaptation''' ([[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Elisabeth Vrba]]'s proposed replacement for what he considered the [[teleology in biology|teleologically]]-loaded term "'''pre-adaptation'''"{{sfn|Gould|Vrba|1982}}) and the related term [[Co-option (biology)|co-option]] describe a shift in the function of a trait during [[evolution]]. For example, a trait can evolve because it served one particular function, but subsequently it may come to serve another. Exaptations are common in both anatomy and behaviour. Bird feathers are a classic example: initially they may have evolved for temperature regulation, but later were adapted for flight. Interest in exaptation relates to both the process and products of evolution: the process that creates [[complex traits]] and the products (functions, anatomical structures, biochemicals, etc.) that may be imperfectly developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.2307/2405873 | author=Bock, W.J. | title=Preadaptation and multiple evolutionary pathways | journal=Evolution | year=1959 | volume=13 | issue=2 | pages=194–211 | jstor=2405873 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayden |first1=Eric J. |last2=Ferrada |first2=Evandro |last3=Wagner |first3=Andreas |title=Cryptic genetic variation promotes rapid evolutionary adaptation in an RNA enzyme |journal=Nature |date=2 June 2011 |volume=474 |issue=7349 |pages=92–95 |doi=10.1038/nature10083 |pmid=21637259 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and definitions==
[[File:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles Darwin]]
The idea that the function of a trait might shift during its evolutionary history originated with [[Charles Darwin]] ({{harvnb|Darwin|1859}}). For many years the phenomenon was labeled "preadaptation", but since this term suggests [[teleology in biology]], appearing to conflict with [[natural selection]], it has been replaced by the term exaptation.

The idea had been explored by several scholars{{efn|See Jacob (1977)&lt;ref name=Jacob1977&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid= 860134 |year= 1977 |last1=Jacob |first1=F. |title=Evolution and tinkering |volume=196 |issue=4295 |pages=1161–6 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.860134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mayr (1982)&lt;ref name=Mayr1982&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Growth_of_Biological_Thought.html?id=pHThtE2R0UQC |last= Mayr |first=Ernst |year=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0-674-36445-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; for references.}} when in 1982 [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Elisabeth Vrba]] introduced the term "exaptation". However, this definition had two categories with different implications for the role of adaptation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) A character, previously shaped by natural selection for a particular function (an adaptation), is coopted for a new use—cooptation.
(2) A character whose origin cannot be ascribed to the direct action of natural selection (a nonaptation), is coopted for a current use—cooptation. (Gould and Vrba 1982, Table 1)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The definitions are silent as to whether exaptations had been shaped by natural selection after cooption, although Gould and Vrba cite examples (e.g., feathers) of traits shaped after cooption. Note that the selection pressure upon a trait is likely to change if it is (especially, primarily or solely) used for a new purpose, potentially initiating a different evolutionary trajectory.

To avoid these ambiguities, [[David Buss|Buss]] et al. (1998) suggested the term "co-opted adaptation", which is limited to traits that evolved after cooption. However, the commonly used terms of "exaptation" and "cooption" are ambiguous in this regard.

==Preadaptation ==

In some circumstances, the "pre-" in preadaptation can be interpreted as applying, for non-teleological reasons, prior to the adaptation itself, creating a meaning for the term that is distinct from exaptation.&lt;ref name="Eshel98"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Eshel, I. Matessi, C. | title=Canalization, genetic assimilation and preadaptation: A quantitative genetic model | journal=Genetics | year=1998 | volume=4 | pages=2119–2133 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masel06"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Masel| first=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Masel | title=Cryptic Genetic Variation Is Enriched for Potential Adaptations| journal=Genetics| volume=172| issue=3| pages=1985–1991| date=March 2006| url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?&amp;artid=1456269| doi=10.1534/genetics.105.051649| id=| accessdate =| pmid=16387877| pmc=1456269| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, future environments (say, hotter or drier ones), may resemble those already encountered by a population at one of its current spatial or temporal margins.&lt;ref name="Eshel98" /&gt; This is not actual foresight, but rather the luck of having adapted to a climate which later becomes more prominent. Cryptic [[genetic variation]] may have the most strongly deleterious [[mutation]]s purged from it, leaving an increased chance of useful adaptations,&lt;ref name="Masel06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rajon, E. |author2=Masel, J. |author2link=Joanna Masel | title=Evolution of molecular error rates and the consequences for evolvability| journal=PNAS| year=2011 |volume=108| issue=3| pages=1082–1087 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1012918108 | pmid=21199946| pmc=3024668| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this represents [[Natural selection|selection]] acting on current [[genome]]s with consequences for the future, rather than foresight.

Function may not always come before form: developed structures could change or alter the primary functions they were intended for due to some structural or historical cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/2011Vol89/e-pub/21757789.pdf Exaptation in Human Evolution: How to Test Adaptive vs Exaptive Evolutionary Hypotheses]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Red feather pigments.jpg|thumb|Bird feathers of various colors]]

Exaptations include the co-option of [[feathers]], which initially evolved for heat regulation, for display, and later for use in bird flight. Another example is the lungs of many basal fish, which evolved into the lungs of terrestrial vertebrates but also underwent exaptation to become the [[gas bladder]], a buoyancy control organ, in derived fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colleen Farmer |year=1997 |title=Did Lungs and the Intracardiac Shunt Evolve to Oxygenate the Heart in Vertebrates? |journal=Paleobiology |volume=23 |pages=358–372 |jstor=2401109|issue=3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third is the [[Evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles|repurposing of two of the three bones in the reptilian jaw]] to become the malleus and incus of the mammalian ear, leaving the mammalian jaw with just one hinge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaws to ears in the ancestors of mammals|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_05|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A behavioural example pertains to subdominant [[Gray wolf|wolves]] licking the mouths of lead wolves as a sign of submissiveness. (Similarly, dogs, which are wolves who through a long process were domesticated, lick the faces of their human owners.) This trait can be explained as an exaptation of wolf pups licking the faces of adults to encourage them to regurgitate food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolf.org/wolves/learn/basic/biology/communication.asp |title=accessed May 16, 2008 |publisher=Wolf.org |accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metabolism can be considered an important part of exaptation. As one of the oldest biological systems and being central to life on the Earth, studies have shown that metabolism may be able to use exaptation in order to be fit, given some new set of conditions or environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zora.uzh.ch/88311/5/Barve_Nature_2013.pdf A Latent Capacity for Evolutionary Innovation through Exaptation in Metabolic Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that up to 44 carbon sources are viable for metabolism to successfully take place and that any one adaptation in these specific metabolic systems is due to multiple exaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barve |first=Aditya |last2=Wagner |first2=Andreas |date=2013 |title=A latent capacity for evolutionary innovation through exaptation in metabolic systems |journal=Nature |volume=500 |issue=7461 |pages=203-206 |doi=10.1038/nature12301 |pmid=23851393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking this perspective, exaptations are important in the origination of adaptations in general. A recent example comes from [[Richard Lenski]]'s [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment]], in which aerobic growth on [[Citric acid|citrate]] arose in one of twelve populations after 31,000 generations of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blount |first=Zachary D. |last2=Borland |first2=Christina Z. |last3=Lenski |first3=Richard E. |date=2008 |title=Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of Escherichia coli |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=23 |pages=7899–7906 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0803151105 |issn=1091-6490 |pmc=2430337 |pmid=18524956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic analysis by [[Zachary Blount|Blount]] and colleagues showed that this novel trait was due to a gene duplication that caused oxic expression of a citrate transporter gene that is normally only expressed under anoxic conditions, thus exapting it for aerobic use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blount |first=Zachary D. |last2=Barrick |first2=Jeffrey E. |last3=Davidson |first3=Carla J. |last4=Lenski |first4=Richard E. |title=Genomic analysis of a key innovation in an experimental Escherichia coli population|journal=Nature |volume=489 |issue=7417 |pages=513–518 |doi=10.1038/nature11514 |pmc=3461117|pmid=22992527|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metabolic systems have the potential to innovate without adaptive origins.

Gould and [[Jürgen Brosius|Brosius]] took the concept of exaptation to the genetic level. It is possible to look at a [[retroposon]], originally thought to be simply junk DNA, and deduce that it may have gotten a new function to be termed as an exaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brosius |first1=Jürgen |title=Retroposons--seeds of evolution |journal=Science |date=1991 |volume=251 |issue=4995 |pages=753 |pmid=1990437 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/251/4995/753.long |doi=10.1126/science.1990437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brosius |first1=Jürgen |last2=Gould |first2=Stephen Jay |title=On "genomenclature": a comprehensive (and respectful) taxonomy for pseudogenes and other "junk DNA" |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |date=1992 |volume=89 |issue=22 |pages=10706–10 |pmid=1279691 |pmc=50410 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.22.10706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Okada |first1=Norihiro |title=Emergence of mammals by emergency: exaptation |journal=Genes to Cells |date=14 July 2010 |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=801–812 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2443.2010.01429.x |pmid=20633052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given an emergency situation in the past, a species may have used junk DNA for a useful purpose in order to evolve and be able to survive. This may have occurred with mammalian ancestors when confronted with a large [[mass extinction]] about 250 million years ago and [[Great Oxygenation Event| substantial increase in the level of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere]]. More than 100 [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] have been found to be conserved only among mammalian genomes and are thought to have essential roles in the generation of features such as the placenta, diaphragm, mammary glands, neocortex, and auditory ossicles. It is believed that as a result of exaptation, or making previously "useless" DNA into DNA that could be used in order to increase survival chance, mammals were able to generate new brain structures as well as behavior to better survive the mass extinction and adapt to new environments. Similarly, viruses and their components have been repeatedly exapted for host functions. The functions of exapted viruses typically involve either defense from other viruses or cellular competitors or transfer of nucleic acids between cells, or storage functions. [[Koonin]] and Krupovic suggested that virus exaptation can reach different depths, from recruitment of a fully functional virus to exploitation of defective, partially degraded viruses, to utilization of individual virus proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=EV |last2=Krupovic |first2=M |title=The depths of virus exaptation |journal=Current Opinion in Virology |date=2018 |volume=31 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1016/j.coviro.2018.07.011 |pmid=30071360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptation and exaptation cycle ==

It was speculated by Gould and Vrba&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~khayes/Journal_Club/fall2006/Gould_&amp;_Vrb_1982_Paleobio.pdf Exaptation - A Missing Term in the Science of Form]&lt;/ref&gt; in one of the first papers written about exaptation, that when an exaptation arises, it may not be perfectly suited for its new role and may therefore develop new adaptations to promote its use in a better manner. In other words, the beginning of developing a particular trait starts out with a primary adaptation toward a fit or specific role, followed by a primary exaptation (a new role is derived using the existing feature but may not be perfect for it), which in turn leads to the development of a secondary adaptation (the feature is improved by natural selection for better performance), promoting further development of an exaptation, and so forth.

Once again, feathers are an important example, in that they may have first been adapted for thermoregulation and with time became useful for catching insects, and therefore served as a new feature for another benefit. For instance, large contour feathers with specific arrangements arose as an adaptation for catching insects more successfully, which eventually led to flight, since the larger feathers served better for that purpose.

==Implications==

=== Evolution of complex traits===
One of the challenges to Darwin's theory of evolution was explaining how complex structures could evolve gradually,&lt;ref&gt;The development of complex structures (i.e., evolution of novelties) occur either by intensification of an existing function or by a switch in functions.&lt;/ref&gt; given that their incipient forms may have been inadequate to serve any function. As [[George Jackson Mivart]] (a critic of Darwin) pointed out, 5 percent of a bird wing would not be functional. The incipient form of complex traits would not have survived long enough to evolve to a useful form.

As Darwin elaborated in the last edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species|The Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; many complex traits evolved from earlier traits that had served different functions. By trapping air, primitive wings would have enabled birds to efficiently regulate their temperature, in part, by lifting up their feathers when too warm. Individual animals with more of this functionality would more successfully survive and reproduce, resulting in the proliferation and intensification of the trait.

Eventually, feathers became sufficiently large to enable some individuals to glide. These individuals would in turn more successfully survive and reproduce, resulting in the spread of this trait because it served a second and still more beneficial function: that of locomotion. Hence, the evolution of bird wings can be explained by a shifting in function from the regulation of temperature to flight.

===Jury-rigged design===
Darwin explained how the traits of living organisms are well-designed for their environment, but he also recognized that many traits are imperfectly designed. They appear to have been made from available material, that is, [[jury-rigged]].{{efn|Jacob (1977)&lt;ref name=Jacob1977/&gt; sees much of evolution as "tinkering," that is, working with available traits. "Tinkering" includes (but is not limited to) shifts in function.}} Understanding exaptations may suggest hypotheses regarding subtleties in the adaptation. For instance, that feathers evolved initially for thermal regulation may help to explain some of their features unrelated to flight (Buss et al., 1998). However, this is readily explained by the fact that they serve a dual purpose.

Some of the chemical pathways for physical pain and pain from social exclusion overlap.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald and Leary, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The physical pain system may have been co-opted to motivate social animals to respond to threats to their inclusion in the group.

===Evolution of technology===
Exaptation has received increasing attention in innovation and management studies inspired by evolutionary dynamics, where it has been proposed as a mechanism that drives the serendipitous expansion of technologies and products in new domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/icc/article-abstract/25/1/115/2449848|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/exaptation2018/home-page|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fascinating Aïda''' is a British comedy singing group and [[satire|satirical]] [[cabaret]] act founded in March 1983. The line-up consists of founder member [[Dillie Keane]]; [[Adèle Anderson]], who joined in 1984, and [[Liza Pulman]], who first joined in 2004. The group received a [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Perrier Award]] nomination at the 1984 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]], and went on to be nominated three times for the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment|Olivier Award for Best Entertainment]] (1995, 2000 and 2004), and twice for the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue]] (2005 and 2010). Keane and Anderson were also nominated for the 2010 [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]].

==History==
[[File:Barefaced Chic Photo.JPG|thumb|left|(from left to right) [[Adèle Anderson]], [[Dillie Keane]] and Marilyn Cutts performing in ''Barefaced Chic!'' at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]].]]
Fascinating Aïda was founded in March 1983 by [[Dillie Keane]],&lt;ref name="BTG-DK"/&gt; along with Marilyn Cutts and Lizzie Richardson. The members have varied frequently, but the central two have been [[Adèle Anderson]] — who joined the group in 1984 — and Keane. The trio started performing in a [[West End of London|West End]] [[wine bar]], but they soon caught the attention of the media and performed on television for the first time in July 1983.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Over the years, they gained a growing fanbase and national popularity, earning three [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] nominations for ''[[Laurence Olivier Award for  Best Entertainment|Best Entertainment]]'', in 1995, 2000 and 2004. They were voted ''Most Popular Act 1985'' by [[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]] magazine and also earned a [[if.comedy award|Perrier Comedy Award]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedyawards.co.uk/comedyshow.asp |title=Best comedy show |work=Foster's Edinburgh Comedy Awards |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group broke up in 1989&lt;ref name="GBA-FA"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently reformed in 1994, and performed for a further ten years, releasing a number of albums, before breaking up again in 2004. Their 20th anniversary show, ''One Last Flutter'', ran from 13 November to 6 December 2003 at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London, when original member Marilyn Cutts joined the group for one last time.&lt;ref name="CN371175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COM-FA"&gt;

[[Liza Pulman]] joined in early 2004. That year, they performed their show ''Absolutely Fabulous'' twice in New York. First in June for the Brits Off-Broadway Festival, then from September to November at the Acorn Theatre, Manhattan. The show earned them a 2005 [[Drama Desk Award]] nomination for [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue|Outstanding revue]].&lt;ref name="BTG-DK"&gt;

The group wrote songs for radio and television programmes such as [[Stop The Week|Stop the Week]], After Hours, [[People Like Us (mockumentary)|People Like Us]] and [[TV-am]].&lt;ref name="CN371175"/&gt;
Some of their most famous songs include ''Shattered Illusions'', ''Herpes Tango'', ''Lieder'' and ''Taboo''.  They were the subject of several [[BBC]] documentaries. All the current members are also established actresses, mainly in musical theatre. Dillie Keane is also a writer, having written a column in ''[[The Stage]]'' magazine for ten years, and written two books, ''The Joy of Sequins'' in 1995 and ''Fascinating Who?'' in 1985. Keane says she now spends her time "juggling acting, cabaret and writing". The group have an official mascot—a pure bred [[Irish setter]] called "Dillie", born in 1999.

After the death in 2007 of the group's pianist and musical director, [[Russell Churney]],&lt;ref name="NYT040601"/&gt; plans for a new show were shelved. It was announced in early March 2008 that they would get together again for a short spell of concerts and possibly a brief tour to celebrate their 25th anniversary, and the show would include new songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228012309/http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/faframe.htm |date=28 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nathan@bluekitedesigns.com for Jermyn Street Theatre |url=http://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/ |title=Jermyn Street Theatre, the official online home of London's leading Off-West-End venue |publisher=Jermynstreettheatre.co.uk |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colekitchenn.com/ |title=COLE KITCHENN LTD – Producers – General Management – Personal Management |publisher=Colekitchenn.com |accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 they performed at the [[Jermyn Street Theatre]], followed by three nationwide tours.

With the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity]] in the [[Renaissance]], the poetry of [[Ovid]] became a major influence on the imagination of poets and artists, and remained a fundamental influence on the diffusion and perception of '''[[Greek mythology]]''' through subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name="BrBurn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek mythology|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;br /&gt;* L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; From the early years of the Renaissance, artists portrayed subjects from Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Among the best-known subjects of Italian artists are [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', the [[Leda and the Swan|Ledas]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]''.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Through the medium of [[Latin]] and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Dante]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In northern Europe, Greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature.  Both Latin and Greek classical texts were translated, so that stories of mythology became available. In England, [[Chaucer]], the [[Elizabethan]]s and [[John Milton]] were among those influenced by Greek myths; nearly all the major English poets from [[Shakespeare]] to [[Robert Bridges]] turned for inspiration to Greek mythology. [[Jean Racine]] in [[France]] and [[Goethe]] in [[Germany]] revived Greek drama.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Racine reworked the ancient myths &amp;mdash; including those of [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaidra]], [[Andromache]], Oedipus and [[Iphigeneia]] &amp;mdash; to new purpose.&lt;ref name="Burn75"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The rape of Europa, Goya.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Francisco Goya, [[Europa (mythology)|''The rape of Europa'']] ''(El rapto de Europa),'' 1772]]
In the 18th century, the philosophical revolution of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] spread throughout Europe.  It was accompanied by a certain reaction against Greek myth; there was a tendency to insist on the scientific and philosophical achievements of Greece and Rome. The myths, however, continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the [[libretti]] for [[Handel]]'s operas ''[[Admeto]]'' and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'', [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Idomeneo]]'', and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]''.&lt;ref name="Burn75" /&gt; By the end of the century, [[Romanticism]] initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including  Greek mythology. In Britain, it was a great period for new translations of Greek tragedies and [[Homer]]'s works, and these in turn inspired contemporary poets, such as [[Keats]], [[Byron]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].&lt;ref name="Burn75-76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[poet laureate]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], was such that even his portraits of the quintessentially English court of [[King Arthur]] are suffused with echoes of the Homeric epics. The visual arts kept pace, stimulated by the purchase of the [[Parthenon marbles]] in 1816; many of the "Greek" paintings of [[Lord Leighton]] and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] were seriously accepted as part of the transmission of the Hellenic ideal.&lt;ref name="Burn76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 76&lt;/ref&gt;

American authors of the 19th century, such as [[Thomas Bulfinch]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], believed that myths should provide pleasure, and held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature.&lt;ref name="Klatt"&gt;Klatt-Brazouski, ''Ancient Greek and Roman Mythology'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bulfinch, "The so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among living men. They belong now not to the department of theology, but to those of literature and taste."&lt;ref name="Bulfinchintroduction"&gt;T. Bulfinch (1855). [https://books.google.com/books?id=r8oVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11 ''The Age of Fable: Or, Stories of Gods and Heroes''], p.11. Sanborn, Carter, and Bazin.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by such major dramatists as [[Jean Anouilh]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Jean Giraudoux]] in France, [[Eugene O'Neill]] in America, and [[T. S. Eliot]] in England, and by great novelists such as the Irish [[James Joyce]] and the French [[André Gide]]. [[Richard Strauss]], [[Jacques Offenbach]] and many others have set Greek mythological themes to music.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

'''''Icarus''''' is a [[scientific journal]] dedicated to the field of [[planetary science]].  Its longtime owner and publisher was [[Academic Press]], which was then purchased by [[Elsevier]]. It is published under the auspices of the [[American Astronomical Society]]'s [[Division for Planetary Sciences]] (DPS). The journal contains articles discussing the results of new research on [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and other scientific aspects of the [[Solar System]] or [[Extrasolar planet|extrasolar systems]].

The journal was founded in 1962, and became affiliated with the DPS in 1974. [[Carl Sagan]] served as editor of the journal from 1968 to 1979.  He was succeeded by [[Joseph A. Burns]] (1980–1997), [[Phil Nicholson|Philip D. Nicholson]] (1998–2018), and Rosaly Lopes.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21926">In the height region between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km altitude on Earth, the ionospheric plasma is electrically conducting. Atmospheric tidal winds due to differential  solar heating or due to gravitational lunar forcing move the ionospheric plasma against the [[geomagnetic field]] lines thus generating electric fields and currents just like a [[dynamo]] coil moving against magnetic field lines. That region is therefore called '''ionospheric dynamo region'''.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels&gt;Chapman , S.J. and J. Bartels, „Geomagnetism“ , Clarendon Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; 
The magnetic manifestation of these electric currents on the ground  can be observed during magnetospheric quiet conditions. They are called Sq-variations (S=solar; q=quiet) and L-variations  (L=lunar) of the geomagnetic field.
Additional electric currents are generated by the varying  [[magnetospheric electric convection field]]. These are the DP1-currents (the auroral electrojets) and the  polar DP2-currents.
&lt;ref name=Akasofu&gt;Akasofu, S.I., "Physics of Magnetospheric Substorms", Reidel, Dordrecht, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a polar-ring current has been derived from the observations which depends on the polarity of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;Heppner, J.P., in Dyer, E.R. (ed), "Critical Problems of Magnetospheric Physics", Nat. Acad. Sci.,Washington, D.C., p. 107. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; These geomagnetic variations belong to the so-called external part of the [[geomagnetic field]]. Their amplitudes reach at most about 1% of the main internal [[geomagnetic field]] '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Atmospheric Electric Conductivity==
Radioactive material from the ground and galactic cosmic rays ionize a small fraction  of the atmospheric gas within the lower and middle atmosphere  and make the gas electrically conducting. Electrons quickly  attach to neutral particles forming negative ions. The positive ions are mostly singly charged. The electric conductivity depends on the mobility of the ions . That mobility  is proportional to the reciprocal air density. Thus, the electric conductivity increases almost  exponentially with altitude.  The ions move with the neutral gas making the conductivity [[isotropic]].&lt;ref&gt;Viggiano, A.A., and F. Arnold, in Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. 1, p. 1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

At heights between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km however -the dynamo region-, solar X- and extreme [[ultraviolet radiation]] (XUV) is almost completely absorbed  generating the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers.  Here, the electrons are already bound to the [[geomagnetic field]] gyrating several times about these lines before they collide with the neutrals, while the positive ions still essentially move with the neutral gas. Thus, the electric conductivity becomes [[anisotropic]]. The conductivity parallel to an electric field  '''E'''  is called  [[Pedersen]] conductivity.  The conductivity orthogonal to '''E''' and the geomagnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  is the [[Hall]] conductivity. Ohmic losses and thus [[Joule]] heating occur when Pedersen currents flow. The component parallel to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  still increases with altitude. Near the geomagnetic dip equator, a west-east directed electric field generates vertical Hall currents which cannot close. Therefore,  a vertical polarization field builds up generating a horizontal Hall current which adds to the Pedersen current. Such enhancement is described by the [[Cowling]] conductivity. Pedersen and Hall conductivities reach maximum values near 120 to 140&amp;nbsp;km  altitudes with numbers of about 1 mS/m during sunlit conditions. During the night, these numbers may decrease by a factor of ten or more. The values of  these conductivities depend on local time, latitude, season and solar 11- year cycle. The height integrated conductivities become of the order of 50 S, or  a total resistance of the dynamo region of about 1/50 = 0.02 Ohm during daytime conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Fejer, A.A., Rev. Geophys., 2, 275, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

In the auroral regions which lie between about 15° and 20° geomagnetic co-latitude and the corresponding latitudes in the southern hemisphere, precipitating high energy particles from the [[magnetosphere]] ionize the neutral gas, in particular at heights around 110 to 120&amp;nbsp;km, and increase the electric conductivity substantially. During magnetospheric disturbed conditions, this conductivity enhancement becomes much larger, and the auroral regions move equatorward.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt;

At heights above about 200&amp;nbsp;km, collisions between neutrals and plasma become rare so that both ions and electrons can only gyrate about the geomagnetic lines of force, or drift orthogonal to '''E''' and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. The parallel conductivity is so large that the geomagnetic lines of force become electric potential lines, and only electric fields orthogonal to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; can exist (see [[magnetosphere]]).

==Atmospheric Tides==
'''Atmospheric tides''' are global-scale waves excited by regular solar differential heating (thermal tides)or by the gravitational [[tidal force]] of the moon (gravitational tides). The atmosphere behaves like a huge waveguide closed at the bottom (the Earth's surface) and open to space at the top. In such a waveguide an infinite number of atmospheric wave modes can be excited. Because the waveguide is imperfect, however, only  modes of lowest degree with large horizontal and vertical scales can develop sufficiently well so that they can be filtered out from the meteorological noise. They are solutions of the [[Laplace]] equation &lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, M.S., "The eigenfunctions of Laplace's tidal equations over a sphere", Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.", London, A262, p. 511, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and are called Hough functions. These can be approximated by a sum of [[spherical harmonics]].

Two kinds of wave modes exit: class 1 waves (sometimes called gravity waves), and class 2 waves (rotational waves). Class 2 waves owe their existence to the [[Coriolis effect]] and can only exist for periods larger than 12 hours. Tidal waves can be either internal (travelling waves ) with positive eigenvalues (or equivalent depth)  which have finite vertical wavelengths and can transport wave energy upward, or external (evanescent waves) with negative eigenvalues and infinitely large vertical wavelengths meaning that their phases remain constant with altitude. These external wave modes cannot transport wave energy, and their  amplitudes decrease exponentially with height outside their source regions. Each mode is characterized by four numbers: the zonal wave number n, positive for class 1 waves and negative for class 2 waves (their meridional structures becoming increasingly complex with increasing number n), a meridional wave number m, the eigenvalue, and the period, in our case one solar or [[lunar day]], respectively. The modes are labeled as (m, n). Even numbers of n correspond to waves symmetric with respect to the equator, and odd numbers corresponding to antisymmetric waves.

At thermospheric heighs, [[dissipation]] of atmospheric waves becomes significant so that at above about 150&amp;nbsp;km altitude, all wave modes gradually become external waves, and the [[Hough function]]s degenerate to [[spherical harmonics]]s; e.g., mode (1, -2) develops to the spherical harmonic P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), mode (2, 2) becomes P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), with θ the co-latitude, etc.&lt;ref name=VollandAT&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migrating Solar  Tides===
The fundamental solar diurnal tidal mode which optimally matches the solar heat input configuration and thus is most strongly excited is the (1,&amp;nbsp;-2) - mode. It depends on local time and travels westward with the Sun. It is an external mode of class 2. Its maximum pressure amplitude on the ground is about 60 hPa.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen &gt;Chapman, S., and R.S. Lindzen, "Atmospheric Tides", Kluwer Dordrecht, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[thermosphere]], however, it becomes the predominant mode reaching temperature amplitudes at the [[exosphere]] of at least 140 K  and horizontal winds of the order of  100&amp;nbsp;m/s and more increasing with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, H. and J.W. King, J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 29,1045, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The largest solar semidiurnal wave is mode (2,&amp;nbsp;2) with maximum pressure amplitudes near the ground of 120&amp;nbsp; hPa. It is an internal class 1 wave. Its amplitude increases with altitude. Although its solar excitation is half of that of mode (1,&amp;nbsp;-2), its amplitude on the ground is larger by a factor of two. This indicates the effect of  suppression of external waves, in this case by a factor of four
.&lt;ref name=VollandAT/&gt;

===Semidiurnal Lunar Tides===
The dominant migrating lunar tide is the (2, 2) mode depending on lunar [[Time zone|local time]]. Its maximum pressure amplitude near the ground is 6 Pa, which is far below the meteorological noise. Therefore, it is not simple to detect such small signal.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen /&gt; Because it is an internal waves, its amplitude increases with altitude reaching values at 100&amp;nbsp;km height two orders of magnitude larger than on the ground.

==Electric Currents==

===Sq-Current===

====Morphology====
More than 100 geomagnetic observatories around the world measure regularly the variations of the [[earth's magnetic field]]. The daily variations during selected days of quiet geomagnetic activity are used to determine a monthly mean. From the horizontal component ΔH of such data, one can derive a corresponding overhead equivalent electric sheet current system at dynamo layer heights of strength

J = 2 ΔH/μ = 1.6 ΔH

with J (in milliAmpere/meter) the electric overhead sheet current, ΔH (in nanoTesla) the observed horizontal component of the geomagnetic variation, and μ the electric permeability of free space.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels /&gt; One can determine the direction of the magnetic field with regard to the current by the simple rule of thumb: if the thumb of the right hand points into the direction of the current, the curved fingers give the direction of the associated magnetic field.

One has to take into account that this relationship is not unique. In general, electric currents within [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] are three-dimensional, and an infinite number of current configurations fits to the geomagnetic variations observed on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima, N., Radio Sci., 6, 269, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic measurement in space are necessary to obtain a realistic picture.

[[File:Sqcurrent.jpg|thumb|400px|Figure 1. Streamlines of equivalent ionospheric Sq current during equinox (1957 - 1969) at 12 UT separated into primary (a) and secondary (b) part. Between two streamlines flow 20 kA &lt;ref&gt;Malin, S.R.C., Phil Trans. R. Soc., London, Ser. A 274, 551,1973&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;]].
Figure 1a shows current streamlines of an equivalent Sq current as seen from the sun at noon. This current configuration is fixed to the sun, while the earth rotates beneath it. A total current of about 140 kA flows within one daytime vortex. The rotating Sq current and the electrically conducting earth interior behave like  a huge  transformer with the dynamo region as the primary winding and the earth as the secondary winding. Since the Sq current varies with the basic period of one day, electric currents are induced within the earth's interior. The magnetic field of this secondary current is superimposed on the magnetic field of the primary Sq current. Methods to separate  both components go back to [[Gauss]]. The amplitude of the secondary current is about 1/3 of that of the  primary current and slightly shifted in  phase. Figure 1b shows that secondary component. The ratio between sheet current and magnetic component given above has now simply the value one.

The Sq current depends on season. The summer [[vortex]] is intensified compared with the winter vortex and reaches into the winter hemisphere. A longitudinal dependence of the Sq current exists which is related to  the inclined dipole component of the internal magnetic field, but probably also to nonmigrating tidal waves from below.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., at all., J. Geophys. Res., Space Physics, 113, 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 11-year [[solar cycle]], the amplitude of Sq increases by a factor of more than two from sunspot minimum to sunspot maximum. Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric [[E-layer]] diminishes much more strongly than that of the [[F-layer]]. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Matsushita, S., and W.H. Campell, W.H. (eds.), "Physics of Geomagnetic Phenomena", Vol. I and II, Academic Press, New York,1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The main driver of the Sq current is the external (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height,&lt;ref&gt;Kato, S., J. Geophys. Res., 71, 3211, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., J. Geophys.Res. 87, 5222, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by  180°. This appears to be the result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity  
.&lt;ref name=VollandAE&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; 
The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity.  
 
Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150&amp;nbsp;km from the equator
.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; Such enhancement of the Sq current  by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. 
During a [[solar flare]], bursts of [[solar radiation]] from the environment of an active  sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase  occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.DF., and S.V. Venkatesmaran, J. Geophys. Res., 81, 139,1971&lt;/ref&gt; During  a [[solar eclipse]], the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C.U., J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 25,529,1963&lt;/ref&gt; It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity.
 
In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi 
anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanc, M., and A.D. Richmond, J. Geophys. Res., 85, 1669, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaka, K,.Z., et all., Ann. Geophys., 27, 3523, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This current system is called Ddyn.

====Theory====
[[File:Sqblockdiagram.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2. Blockdiagram illustrating coupling between the horizontal wind '''U''' and pressure p via the Ampere force '''j'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Here '''j''' is the electric current density, '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; the geomagnetic field, h the equivalent depth, σ the electric conductivity, and '''E''' the electric polarization field. In a self-consistent treatment of the coupled system, gate B must be closed. In conventional dynamo theories, gate B is open.]]
In order to determine quantitatively the dynamo action of the neutral wind '''U''', one starts with the horizontal momentum equation of the wind together with  an equation for the divergence of the wind. The momentum equation balances the inertial force, the Coriolis force, and the horizontal gradient of pressure p.&amp;nbsp;In addition, the Ampere force '''J'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; couples the electric  current density '''j''' to the wind and pressure system. The equivalent depth h (the eigenvalue of the tidal mode) determines the divergence of the wind. The electric current must obey [[Ohm]]'s law. An electric polarization field  '''E''' is generated by charge separation to enforce the condition of no sources and sinks of the current. Feedback between wind and electric current occurs via the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''. Usually, the  electric conductivity tensor '''σ''' is considered as a given data set, and a height integrated conductivity tensor '''Σ'''  and a height integrated sheet current  '''J''' are applied.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.D., Geomagn. and Geoelectr. 31, 287,1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In conventional models, the Ampere force is neglected. This means that gate B in Figure 2 is open. This is called a kinematic dynamo. Models with closed gate B are called  hydromagnetic dynamos. The influence of the mutual coupling between wind and current can immediately be seen if one considers an infinitely large electric conductivity σ. In the kinematic model, the electric current would become infinitely large, while the wind amplitude remains constant. In the hydromagnetic model, the current reaches an upper limit, similar to a technical dynamo during short circuit, while the wind amplitude breaks down to a fraction of its original value. Charge separation acts like a self-impedance preventing the current to become infinitely large.&lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;

===L-Current===
Lunar (L) currents are weaker by a factor of about 20 than the Sq currents. The dominant wind component to drive these currents is the (2, 2) tidal mode. The L current is similar in shape as the Sq current, with the difference that four vortices instead of two exit. In each vortex a total current of about 4 kA flows. The seasonal variation of L is similar to that of Sq. During sunlit hours, L is strongly enhanced, while it approaches zero during the night. Thus, the L current exhibits, in addition, a  modulation depending on the lunar phase.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; The geomagnetic effect of the L-current can best been seen near the dip equator where the [[Cowling]] conductivity strongly enhances that current.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt;

===DP1-Current===
Interaction between [[solar wind]] plasma and the polar [[geomagnetic field]] produces a global-scale [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] directed from dawn to dusk  with a potential difference of  about 15 kV during quiet magnetospheric conditions, increasing substantially during disturbed conditions. Charge separation takes place at the [[magnetopause]]. This area is connected with the ionospheric dynamo region via the first open geomagnetic field lines with one footpoint within the auroral regions. Thus, electric discharging currents can flow via field-aligned currents as two small bands within the auroral zone dynamo layer, on the daytime as well as on the nighttime hemisphere. These currents are called DP1 current or auroral electrojets. Their magnitudes  are of the order of Mega Amperes.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt; Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating of these currents is comparable with that due to the solar XUV heat input within middle and lower latitudes during quiet conditions and much larger during disturbed conditions. Therefore, it dominates ionospheric and thermospheric dynamics and causes [[ionospheric]] and thermospheric storms &lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G.W., in  Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. II, p.195, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G. W., Surv. Geophys. 32, 101, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===DP2-Current===
The [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] drives a two cell current within the polar cup  with their vortices situated on the morning and on the evening side. It is called DP2 current. That current exists already during quiet conditions  (S&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;) and becomes enhances during disturbed conditions. It is mainly composed of electric  Hall currents.&lt;ref name= ChapmanBartels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishida, A., and S. Kokubun, Rev. Geophys. Space Sci., 9, 417,1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar-Ring Current===
If the azimuthal  component of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]]  (IMF) is directed toward dusk, the magnetospheric plasma is slowed down in the northern polar cap and accelerated in the southern polar cap. If the azimuthal component of the IMF is directed toward dawn, the situation is reversed. This devitation from co-rotation disappears at lower latitudes. The magnetic effect on the ground within the polar regions corresponds to an ionospheric Hall current at about 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; polar distance encircling the magnetic poles in a clockwise direction as seen by an observer standing on the ground during interplanetatry sectors with fields pointing away from the sun, and in a counterclockwise direction during toward-sector polarity &lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Svalgaard, L., J. Geophys. Res., 78, 2064, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israelite highland settlement''' refers to ancient [[Israelite]] settlement in the highlands north of [[Jerusalem]] discovered in [[archaeological field survey]]s conducted in [[Israel]] since the 1970s.

These surveys found a large increase in the settled population dating to 1200 BCE. It is not known whether the Israelites arrived in the wake of conquests or the new villages were established by former nomads or displaced persons. A similar increase was not found in the surrounding lowland areas. According to archaeological evidence, these areas may have been inhabited by [[Canaan]]ites or [[Sea People]].

A 2005 book by Robert D. Miller  applies statistical modeling to the sizes and locations of the villages, grouping them by economic and political features.  He found highland groupings centered on [[Dothan (ancient city)|Dothan]], Tirzah, [[Shechem]], and [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]]. [[Tribe of Benjamin#Territory|The tribal territory of Benjamin]] was not organized around any main town.

This evidence does not prove there was a conquest as described in the [[Book of Joshua]], but if the biblical reference to "daughter villages" means all villages closest to a specific town, the [[List of surviving and destroyed Canaanite cities|list of Canaanite towns not taken]] in the [[Book of Judges]] ({{Bibleref2|Judges 1:27-35}}), which begins: "Nor did Manesseh drive out [[Bet Shean]] and her daughter-villages ...", the correspondence to the survey results is remarkably accurate. Towns not captured in the central zone were Taanach, Ibleam, [[Megiddo (place)|Meggido]], [[Tel Dor|Dor]], [[Gezer]], [[Aijalon]], [[Salbit|Shaalbim]], and Jerusalem.

The '''Latin American Public Opinion Project''' (LAPOP) is a research institute specializing in the development, implementation, and analysis of [[public opinion]] [[survey methodology|surveys]]. Founded by [[Mitchell A. Seligson]] over two decades ago, its principal focus is on governance and democracy in [[Latin America]]. The AmericasBarometer is the best-known survey produced by LAPOP.  It is the only survey of democratic public opinion and behavior that covers the Americas ([[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]], [[South America|South]], and the [[Caribbean]]). It  measures democratic values and behaviors in the Americas using national probability samples of voting-age adults. [[Elizabeth Zechmeister]] is the director of LAPOP. Noam Lupu is associate director of LAPOP.

== History ==

LAPOP has its origins in studies of [[democracy|democratic values]] in Costa Rica. This pioneering public opinion research took place in the 1970s, a time in which much of the rest of Latin America was under the control of [[authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]], prohibiting studies of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/magazines/arts-and-science/2010-11/survey-says/ |title=Vanderbilt University's Arts and Sciences Magazine, Fall 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As [[democratization]] expanded in Latin America, LAPOP grew in scope and size. Today LAPOP regularly carries out public opinion surveys in nearly every country in Latin America, Canada, the United States, and much of Caribbean.

== Structure ==

LAPOP is housed at [[Vanderbilt University]] in Nashville, Tennessee. Vanderbilt is a research university that has been a leader in the study of Latin America and the Caribbean for over 60 years. At this host institution, a team of faculty, staff, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students designs and analyzes the public opinion surveys generated by the project. The group also edits and publishes the regular Insights Series reports, each one of which examines a one facet of public opinion. LAPOP’s network extends far beyond the Vanderbilt campus, to include partner institutions throughout the Americas.

LAPOP functions as a consortium, working in partnership with numerous academic and non-governmental institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. It collaborates with these institutions, sharing ideas for survey content and working together to disseminate the results of the public opinion surveys to the citizens of participating countries. This dissemination of results takes the form of systematic country reports, comparative studies, panel presentations, and media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/pdfs/At-a-glance-v2.pdf |title=The AmericasBarometer at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The AmericasBarometer ==

In 2004, LAPOP established the AmericasBarometer as multi-country, regularly-conducted surveys of democratic values and behaviors in the Americas, organized by a consortium of academic and think-tank partners in the hemisphere. The first round included voting-age respondents from 11 countries. The second round of surveys took place in 2006 and included 22 countries from the hemisphere. The third round, 2008, included 24 countries in the Americas. The 2010 and 2012 round included 26 countries across North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The 2014/15 round consisted of over 50,000 interviews in 28 countries. The most recent round, 2016/17, comprises 29 national surveys and more than 43,000 interviews.

== Methods and Practices ==

Cutting-edge methods and transparent practices ensure that data collected by LAPOP are of the highest quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/CAM_Survey_Evaluation_Report_Final_11.29.04.pdf |title=Independent Evaluation of LAPOP Surveys}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These methods and practices include the following:

=== Pre-Survey ===
* Solicitation of input from a vast network of academics, practitioners, and policymakers
* Use of Vanderbilt University’s experimental research lab to test new items
* Extensive in-country pre-testing of survey items
* Translation of surveys into more than 15 [[Latin America#Language|languages]] spoken in the Americas
* Expert design of national [[Survey sampling#Probability sampling|probability samples]]
* Approval from Vanderbilt University’s [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Board]] for the protection of human subjects

=== Implementation ===
* Rigorous training of all interviewers using guidelines published in extensive training manuals
* Partnerships with reputable survey organizations in the regions
* Widespread use of electronic handheld devices ([[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] and smartphones) and software designed by LAPOP to allow multilingual interviews and extensive validity checks
* Participants are voting-age adults interviewed face to face in their households, except in Canada and the United States where the interviews are web-based

=== Post-survey ===
* Use of cutting-edge statistical programs and methods
* Presentation of results in clear, user-friendly graphs
* Public dissemination of results in surveyed design and methods on the LAPOP website
* Immediate uploading of data into LAPOP’s free interactive data analysis program

LAPOP’s resources and expertise allow it to conduct special projects requested by scholars, government institutions, and agencies concerned with democratic development. These have recently included novel experiments embedded within national surveys to assess issues of ethnicity and violence. In addition, these include an extensive new focus on randomized block experiments as a means of program evaluation.

== Use of LAPOP Data ==

The data are used by academic researchers; the [[USAID|United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) in its efforts to promote democracy and good governance in Latin America and the Caribbean; the [[World Bank]] in its Governance Indicators series; the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] in its numerous research projects; the [[United Nations Development Programme]] and the [[Organization of American States]] in their democracy programs; and most significantly, by the governments of several Latin American countries as a source of independent information with which to assess public opinion and shape policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/studies-articles-books.php |title=Studies, Articles, and Books Using LAPOP Data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esty, March 4, 2007, Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030202044.html When Being Green Puts You in the Black], Retrieved April 11, 2015, "...Toyota reported record profits last year because it put these issues at the center of its design strategy, which includes hybrid engines, "lightweighting" of its vehicles through the use of carbon fiber and other advanced materials, .."&lt;/ref&gt; The auto industry has used the term for many years, as the effort to keep making cars lighter is ongoing.&lt;ref name=twsUSAToday/&gt; 

Another common material used for lightweighting is aluminum. Incorporating aluminum has grown continuously to not only meet [[Corporate average fuel economy|CAFE]] standards, but to also improve automotive performance. A vehicle with lower weight has better acceleration, braking and handling. In addition, lighter vehicles can tow and haul larger loads because the engine is not carrying unnecessary weight. Even though aluminum is light, it does not sacrifice strength: aluminum body structure is equal in strength to steel and can absorb twice as much crash-induced energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marin|first1=Andy|title=Vacuum Impregnation Enables Lightweight Material Use|url=https://lightweightingworld.com/vacuum-impregnation-enables-lightweight-material-use/|website=Light Weighting World|publisher=Light Weighting World magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2149">'''Male eggs''' are the result of a process in which the eggs of a female would be emptied of their genetic contents (a technique similar to that used in the [[cloning]] process), and those contents would be replaced with male DNA. Such eggs could then be fertilized by sperm.  The procedure was conceived by [[Calum MacKellar]], a Scottish bioethicist. With this technique, two males could be the biological parents of a child. However, such a procedure would additionally require an [[artificial womb]] or a female [[gestational carrier]].&lt;ref name="EBR"&gt;[http://www.bioethics.org.uk/2_fathrs.htm EUROPEAN BIOETHICAL RESEARCH: "CHILDREN WITH TWO GENETIC FATHERS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727053609/http://www.bioethics.org.uk/2_fathrs.htm |date=2007-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4753986/Genetic-offspring-for-gays-a-possibility.html Telegraph.co.uk: "Genetic offspring for gays 'a possibility'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn19 New Scientist: "Baby talk"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/genetics_reproduction/timeline.html CBC news: "Timeline: Assisted reproduction and birth control"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/940790.stm BBC News: "Male-only conception 'highly speculative'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGS"&gt;[http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3904 Center for Genetics and Society: "Are male eggs and female sperm on the horizon?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Polar bears]] on the sea ice of the [[Arctic Ocean]], near the [[north pole]].]]
Conservation biologists have designed a variety of objective means to  measure [[biodiversity]] [[empirical]]ly. Each measure of biodiversity relates to a particular use of the data. For practical [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s, measurements should include {{clarify|text=a quantification of values that are commonly shared among locally affected organisms, including humans|date=July 2014}}. For others, a more economically defensible definition should allow the ensuring of continued possibilities for both adaptation and future use by humans, assuring  environmental [[sustainability]].

As a consequence, biologists argue that this measure is likely to be associated with the variety of genes. Since it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove beneficial, the best choice{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} for [[conservation ethic|conservation]] is to assure the persistence of as many genes as possible. For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it prohibits [[ecological succession]].

== Taxonomic Diversity ==
Biodiversity is usually plotted as taxonomic richness of a geographic area, with some reference to a temporal scale. [[Robert Whittaker|Whittaker]]&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, R.H., ''Evolution and measurement of species diversity'', Taxon, 21, 213–251 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; described three common metrics used to measure species-level biodiversity, encompassing attention to [[species richness]] or [[species evenness]]:
* [[Species richness]] - the simplest of the indices available.
* [[Simpson index]]
* [[Shannon-Wiener index]]

Recently, another new index has been invented called the [[Mean Species Abundance Index]] (MSA); this index calculates the trend in population size of a cross section of the
species. It does this in line with the CBD 2010 indicator for species [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080510063151/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/GLOBIO/PDF/Flyer_%20IB_Project_LR.pdf MSA Index (page 4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Measures of Diversity ==
Alternatively, other types of diversity may be plotted against a temporal timescale:
* [[species diversity]]
* [[ecological diversity]]
* [[morphological diversity]]
* [[genetic diversity]]

These different types of diversity may not be independent. There is, for example, a close link between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors tried to organize the measurements of biodiversity in the following way:&lt;ref&gt;Cianciaruso, M.V., Silva, I.A. &amp; Batalha, M.A. Diversidades filogenética e funcional: novas abordagens para a Ecologia de comunidades. Biota Neotrop. 9(3): [http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v9n3/pt/abstract?article+bn01309032009].&lt;/ref&gt;
* traditional diversity measures
** species density, take into account the number of species in an area
** [[species richness]], take into account the number of species per individuals (usually [species]/[individuals x area])
** [[Diversity index|diversity indices]], take into account the number of species (the [[species richness|richness]]) and their relative contribution (the [[species evenness|evenness]]); e.g.:
*** [[Simpson index]]
*** [[Shannon-Wiener index]]
* [[phylogenetic diversity]] measures, include information on phylogenetic relationships among species
** phylogenetic diversity (PD) index; Faith (1992)
** topology based measures
*** taxonomic distinctiveness; Vane-Wright et al. (1991)
*** taxonomic diversity; Warwick &amp; Clarke (1995)
*** taxonomic distinctness; Clarke &amp; Warwick (1998)
* [[Functional diversity (ecology)|functional diversity]] measures, include information on functional traits among species 
** categoric measures
*** functional group richness (FGR); e.g., Tilman et al. (1997)
** continuous measures
*** with only one functional trait; e.g., Mason et al. (2003)
*** multivariate measures, with many functional traits
**** functional attribute diversity (FAD); Walker et al. (1999) 
**** convex hull volume; Cornwell et al. (2006)
**** functional diversity (FD); Petchey &amp; Gaston (2002)

== Scale ==
Diversity may be measured at different scales. These are three indices used by ecologists: 
* [[Alpha diversity]] refers to diversity within a particular area, community or ecosystem, and is measured by counting the number of taxa within the ecosystem (usually species)&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Beta diversity]] is species diversity between ecosystems; this involves comparing the number of taxa that are [[Endemic (ecology)|unique to each of the ecosystems]].
* [[Gamma diversity]] is a measurement of the overall diversity for different ecosystems within a region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4306">[[File:Messesee panorama.jpg|thumbnail|right|Messesee in Messestadt Riem]]
'''Messestadt Riem''' (literally: Convention City Riem) is an urban district in the east of [[Munich]]. It is part of the [[Trudering-Riem|municipality 15 Trudering-Riem]], and located entirely on the grounds of the 1992 abandoned [[Munich-Riem airport]] and includes today, along with a residential area, the [[Neue Messe München]] trade fair center and the [[Riem Arcaden]] [[shopping mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.toytowngermany.com/wiki/Messestadt | title=Messestadt | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Toytown Germany | language= | accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Messestadt Riem is, after [[Freiham]], the second youngest district of Munich. After the flight operation was moved in 1992 to the new [[Munich Airport]], the old airport building in Riem could be emptied and the construction of the new exhibition center started from the mid-1990s, with the corresponding [[rapid transit]] connections in the following years. In 1998, the fair could finally move out of their exhibition halls on the [[Theresienhöhe]] to the spacious new building in the fair city. Many other companies also moved and established themselves on the former airport site.
Immediately west of the west entrance, the ''Messesee'' (Fair lake) was created, 390 m long (north-south) and 46 to 94 m wide (east-west), with a water area of 2.6 [[hectare]].

In the southern part of the former airport a development area with rental apartments and condominiums was created. With the Riem Arcaden, shopping for daily items is easily accomplished, and because of the numerous pedestrian zones, many kindergartens and three primary schools the fair site is a suitable location for young families to live. The first projects for car-free living in Munich have been established here since 1998.
The first multi-family passive house and the first multifamily zero-energy house in Munich were created here.

== Riemer Park ==
South of the residential area is the Riemer Park. In 2005, the [[Bundesgartenschau]] was held here after Munich won the corresponding competition in 2000. For this purpose Riemer Park, a large landscaped park, was built in 2002. After the Bundesgartenschau Riemer Park, the third largest park in the city of Munich, was opened to the public as a recreation area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mrlodge.com/muenchen-info/suburb-information/messestadt-riem/ | title=Messestadt Riem | author= | date= | website=mrlodge.com | publisher= | language= | accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With enormous effort, a lake was created in its center, known under the name Buga Lake (officially Riemer lake). The lake is east to west 800 m long, 150 m wide, 10 ha in size, up to 18 m deep and contains 100,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water. It is an upscale ground water reserve, which can also be used for bathing. Because the water table is too low in the area and also varies greatly seasonally, a concrete trough was applied and the three pumps, each pumping a constant 40 liters of water per second into the lake, stopping the water from accumulating and causing flooding in the basements of surrounding residential buildings, among other things a drain pipe was laid under the sea. On the east bank there is a beach, while on the west bank, where a pedestrian bridge leads over the lake, a sedimentation zone was created with aquatic plants. Located near the west bank is two more, shallow sedimentation basins with water plants that are only 1100 and 800 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size.

== Churches ==
In 2005, in the West of Messestadt Riem, an ecumenical church center where the Protestant St. Sophia and the Catholic St. Florian churches were dedicated and opened. 

== Transportation ==
Messestadt Riem is connected to two rapid transport stations of [[Munich U-Bahn]], as well as, the bus lines 139, 186, 189, 190 and N74. The [[Bundesautobahn 94|Autobahn 94]] passes to the north of the fair city. Discussions are ongoing about a railway connection to Messestadt Riem as part of the [[Erding Ring Closure]] to the airport.

{{Distinguish|Multimodal interaction|Modality (human-computer interaction)}}
In [[user interface]] design, a '''mode''' is a distinct setting within a [[computer program]] or any physical machine [[Interface (computing)|interface]], in which the same [[user input]] will produce perceived results different to those that it would in other settings. The best-known '''modal''' interface components are probably the [[Caps lock]] and [[Insert key|Insert]] keys on the standard [[computer keyboard]], both of which put the user's typing into a different mode after being pressed, then return it to the regular mode after being re-pressed.

An interface that uses no modes is known as a '''modeless''' interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/term_321.txl Usability Glossary: modeless] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022205105/http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/term_321.txl |date=2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeless interfaces avoid '''mode errors'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/mode-error/ Usability Glossary: mode error]&lt;/ref&gt; by making it impossible for the user to commit them.

== Definition ==
A precise definition is given by [[Jef Raskin]] in his book ''[[The Humane Interface]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An human-machine interface is modal with respect to a given gesture
when (1) the current [[State (computer science)|state]] of the interface is not the user's [[Wiktionary:locus|locus]]&lt;!-- (sic). Do not change this to "focus"; "locus" is the word used by the source, it means "place". --&gt; of
attention and (2) the interface will execute one among several
different responses to the gesture, depending on the system's current
state." (Page 42).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Raskin's sense and according to his definition, an interface is not modal as long as the user is fully aware of its current state. Raskin refers to this as "locus of attention" (from the [[Latin]] word ''locus'' meaning "place" or "location"). Typically a user is aware of a system state if the state change was purposefully initiated by the user, or if the system gives some strong signals to notify the user of the state change in the place where interaction occurs. If the user's locus of attention changes to a different area, the state of the interface may then represent a mode since the user is no longer aware of it.

==Examples==
{{Expand section|the detailed description of typical uses of modes|date=December 2010}}
Several examples of well-known software have been described as ''modal'' and/or using interface modes:
* [[Text editor]]s – typically are in insert mode by default but can be toggled in and out of [[overtype]] mode by pressing the [[Insert key|Insert]] key.
* [[vi]] – has one mode for inserting text, and a separate mode for entering commands.  There is also an "[[Ex (editor)|ex]]" mode for issuing more complex commands (e.g. search and replace). Under normal circumstances, the editor automatically returns to the previous mode after a command has been issued; however, it is possible to permanently move into this mode using ''Shift-Q''.
* [[Emacs]] – has the concept of "prefix keys", which trigger a modal state by pressing the control key plus a letter key. Emacs then waits for additional keypresses that complete a [[keybinding]]. This differs from ''vi'' in that the mode always ends as soon as the command is called (when the sequence of key presses that activates it is completed). Emacs also has many "major and minor" modes that change the available commands, and may be automatically invoked based on file type to more easily edit files of that type. Emacs modes are not restricted to editing text files; modes exist for [[file browser|file browsing]], [[web browsing]], [[IRC]] and [[email]] and their interaction patterns are equivalent to [[application software]] within the Emacs environment. Modes are written in [[Emacs Lisp]], and all modes may not be included with all versions.
* [[Cisco IOS]] – certain commands are executed in a "command mode".
* Tools chosen from a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] in [[Photo manipulation|photo-editing]] and drawing applications are examples of a modal interface. Some advanced image editors have a feature where the same tools can be accessed nonmodally by a keypress, and remain active as long as the key is held down. Releasing the key returns the interface to the modal tool activated by the palette.
* Video games can use [[game mode]]s as a mechanic to enhance [[gameplay]].
* [[Modal window]]s block all [[workflow]] in the top-level program until the modal window is closed.&lt;ref name="java"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/modality.html|title=How to Use Modality in Dialogs|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mode errors ==
{{See also|User error}}

Modes are often frowned upon in interface design because they are likely to produce '''mode errors''' when the user forgets what state the interface is in, performs an action that is appropriate to a different mode, and gets an unexpected and undesired response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/mode-error/ Glossary: mode error]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/modal Usability Glossary: modal]&lt;/ref&gt; A mode error can be quite startling and disorienting as the user copes with the sudden violation of his or her [[user expectations]].

Problems occur if a change in the system state happens unnoticed (initiated by the system, or by another person, such as the user who was previously using the machine), or if after some time the user forgets about the state change. Another typical problem is a sudden change of state that interrupts a user's activity, such as [[focus stealing]]. In such a situation it can easily happen that the user does some operations with the old state in mind, while the brain has not yet fully processed the signals indicating the state change.

A very frustrating type of modality is created by a mode where the user does not find a way out, in other words, where they cannot find how to restore the previous system state.

===Examples of mode errors===
* The most common source of mode errors may be the [[caps lock|Caps Lock]] key. Other common modes available in [[PC keyboard]]s are [[Insert key|Insert]] and the other [[lock key]]s, [[Num lock]] and [[Scroll lock]]. [[Dead key]]s for diacritics also create a short-term mode, at least if they don't provide visual feedback that the next typed character will be modified.
* PC users whose language is not based on the [[Latin alphabet]] commonly have to interact using two different [[keyboard layout]]s: a local one and [[QWERTY]]. This gives rise to mode errors linked to the current keyboard layout: quite often, the synchronization of "current layout" mode between the human and the interface is lost, and text is typed in a layout which is not the intended one, producing meaningless text and confusion. Keyboard keys in UI elements like "(y/n)" can have opposite effect if a program is translated.
* A frequent example is the sudden appearance of a [[modal window|modal]] [[Alert dialog box|error dialog]] in an application while the user is typing, known as [[focus stealing]]; the user expects the typed text to be introduced into a text field, but the unexpected dialog may discard all the input, or may interpret some keystrokes (like "Y" for "yes" and "N" for "no") in a way that the user did not intend.
* The [[Unix]] [[text editor]] [[vi]] can be notoriously difficult for beginners precisely because it uses modes, and because earlier versions configured mode indication to be turned off by default.
* In many computer video games, the keyboard is used both for controlling the game and typing messages. A user may forget they are in "typing mode" as they attempt to react to something sudden in the game and find the controls unresponsive (and instead their text bar full of the command keys pressed).

=== In transportation accidents ===
* According to the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]], one of the factors contributing to [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] crash was ''"the complexities of the autothrottle and autopilot flight director systems … which increased the likelihood of mode error".''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2014/asiana214/abstract.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.martindoms.com/2011/01/24/poor-ui-design-can-kill/ Poor UI design can kill]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mode confusion was part of the events that led to the loss of [[Air France Flight 447]] in 2009, and the loss of life of 228 people. The pilots reacted to a loss of altitude by pulling on the stick, which would have been an appropriate reaction with the autopilot fully enabled, which would then have  put the aircraft in a climbing configuration. However, the airplane's systems had entered a mode of lesser automation ("direct law" in Airbus terms) due to a blocked airspeed sensor, allowing the pilots to put the plane in a nose-high stall configuration, from which they did not recover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/uss-mccain-collision-ultimately-caused-by-ui-confusion/] BEA final report on the loss of Air France 447&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 17, 2015, the offshore supply vessel "Red7 Alliance" collided with a lock gate of the Kiel Canal in Germany, damaging it severely. An investigation concluded that the levers controlling the ship's [[Azimuth thruster]]s were not used in a way appropriate to the mode they were set to,  resulting in the ship accelerating instead of coming to a stop in the lock.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bsu-bund.de/SharedDocs/pdf/DE/Unfallberichte/2016/Untersuchungsbericht_16_15.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=5] M/V Red7 Alliance investigation report (German)&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 21, 2017, the US Navy destroyer [[USS John S. McCain]] collided with a commercial tanker in the Strait of Malacca, resulting in the loss of life of ten crew members. An investigation conducted by the US military concluded that immediately prior to the collision, helm and propulsion controls had been redistributed between bridge stations, and the bridge crew was not fully aware of that redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/uss-mccain-collision-ultimately-caused-by-ui-confusion/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment ==
Modes are intended to grab the user's full attention and to cause them to acknowledge the content present in them, in particular when critical confirmation from the user is required.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quince.infragistics.com/Patterns/Modal%20Panel.aspx#Context|title=Modal Panel - Context|author=[http://infragistics.com Infragistics.com]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506101851/http://quince.infragistics.com/Patterns/Modal%20Panel.aspx#Context|archivedate=2013-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later use is criticised as ineffective for its intended use (protection against errors in destructive actions) due to [[habituation]].  Actually making the action reversible (providing an "undo" option) is recommended instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aza Raskin]], A List Apart: [http://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning Never Use a Warning When you Mean Undo]&lt;/ref&gt; Though modes can be successful in particular usages to restrict dangerous or undesired operations, especially when the mode is actively maintained by a user as a ''[[Mode (computer interface)#Quasimodes|quasimode]]''.

Modes are sometimes used to represent information pertinent to the task that doesn’t fit well into the main visual flow.&lt;ref name="context"/&gt; Modes can also work as well-understood conventions, such as painting tools.&lt;ref name="glossary"/&gt;

Modal proponents{{Who|date=September 2010}} may argue that many common activities are modal and users adapt to them.  An example of modal interaction is that of driving motor vehicles.  A driver may be surprised when pressing the acceleration pedal does not accelerate the vehicle in the forward direction, most likely because the vehicle has been placed in an operating mode like park, neutral, or reverse.  Modal interfaces require training and experience to avoid mode errors like these.

Interface expert [[Jef Raskin]] came out strongly against modes, writing, "Modes are a significant source of errors, confusion, unnecessary restrictions, and complexity in interfaces." Later he notes, " 'It is no accident that swearing is denoted by #&amp;%!#$&amp;,' writes my colleague, Dr. James Winter; it is 'what a typewriter used to do when you typed numbers when the Caps Lock was engaged'." Raskin dedicated his book [[The Humane Interface]] to describe the principles of a modeless interface for computers. Those principles were implemented in the [[Canon Cat]] and [[Archy]] systems.

Some interface designers have recently taken steps to make [[modal window]]s more obvious and user friendly by darkening the background behind the window or allowing any mouse click outside of the modal window to force the window to close – a design called a [[Lightbox (JavaScript)|Lightbox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/application-design.html|title=10 Best Application UIs|author=Jakob Nielsen, Alertbox}}&lt;/ref&gt; – thus alleviating the risk of modal errors. [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] states as an advantage of modal dialogs that it improves user awareness. "When something does need fixing, it's better to make sure that the user knows about it." For this goal, the Lightbox design provides strong visual contrast of the dialog over the rest of the visuals. However, while such a method may reduce the risk of inadvertent wrong interactions, it does not solve the problem that the modal window blocks use of the application's normal features and so prevents the user from taking any action to fix the difficulty, or even from scrolling the screen to bring into view information which they need to correctly choose from the options the modal window presents, and it does nothing to alleviate the user's frustration at having blundered into a dead end from which they cannot escape without some more or less destructive consequence.

[[Larry Tesler]], of [[Xerox PARC]] and [[Apple Computer]], disliked modes sufficiently to get a personalized license plate for his car that reads: "NO MODES". He has used this plate from the early 1980s to the present, on various cars. Along with others, he has also been using the phrase "Don't Mode Me In" for years as a rally cry to eliminate or reduce modes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/lisalist@mail.maclaunch.com/msg00409.html Origins of the Apple Human Interface] by Larry Tesler, Chris Espinosa&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Wyman, the designer of a [[multi-touch]] table for a [[Denver Art Museum]] art exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2009/06/technology-for-experiences-sake-guest.html Technology for Experience's Sake: Guest Post by Bruce Wyman]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that interfaces for several simultaneous users must be modeless, in order to avoid bringing any single user into focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ixda.org/discuss.php?post=43435#43442 Bruce Wyman's post] at the ixda.org mailing list&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design recommendations==

===Avoid when possible===
[[Image:Arret.jpg|thumb|Small signs make explicit the mappings from signal to roads]]
Alternatives to modes such as the [[undo]] command and the [[Recycle bin (computing)|recycle bin]] are recommended when possible.&lt;ref name="Implementation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quince.infragistics.com/Patterns/Modal%20Panel.aspx#Implementation|title=Modal Panel - Implementation|author=[http://infragistics.com Infragistics.com]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506101851/http://quince.infragistics.com/Patterns/Modal%20Panel.aspx#Implementation|archivedate=2013-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HCI researcher [[Donald Norman]] argues that the best way to avoid mode errors, in addition to clear indications of state, is helping the users to construct an accurate [[mental model]] of the system which will allow them to predict the mode accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358092|title=Design rules based on analyses of human error}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is demonstrated, for example, by some [[stop sign]]s at road intersections. A driver may be [[Operant conditioning|conditioned]] by a [[four-way stop]] [[sign]] near his or her home to assume that similar intersections will also be four way stops. If it happens to be only two way, the driver could proceed through if he or she sees no other cars. Especially if there is an obstructed view, a car could come though and hit the first car broadside. An improved design alleviates the problem by including a small diagram showing which of the directions have a stop sign and which don't, thus improving the [[situational awareness]] of drivers.

===Proper placement===
{{See also|Modal_window#Recommendations|l1=Design recommendations for modal windows}}
Modal controls are best placed where the focus is in the task flow.&lt;ref name="Implementation"/&gt;  For example, a modal window can be placed next to the [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control element]] that triggers its activation. Modal controls can be disruptive, so efforts should be made to reduce their capacity to block user work. After completing the task for which the mode was activated, or after a cancel action such as the [[Escape key]], returning to the previous state when a mode is dismissed will reduce the negative impact.

===Quasimodes===
In the book ''[[The Humane Interface]]'', Jef Raskin championed what he termed ''quasimodes'', which are modes that are kept in place only through some constant action on the part of the user; such modes are also called ''spring-loaded modes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/spring-loaded-mode/ Usability Glossary: spring-loaded mode]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''quasimode'' is a composite of the Latin prefix ''[[wiktionary:quasi-|quasi-]]'' (which means ''almost'', ''to some degree'') and the English word "[[wiktionary:Mode|mode]]".

[[Modifier key]]s on the keyboard, such as the [[Shift key]], the [[Alt key]] and the [[Control key]], are all examples of a quasimodal interface.

The application enters into that mode as long as the user is performing a conscious action, like pressing a key and keeping it pressed while invoking a command. If the sustaining action is stopped without executing a command, the application returns to a neutral status.

The purported benefit of this technique is that the user doesn't have to remember the current state of the application when invoking a command: the same action will always produce the same perceived result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.useit.com/alertbox/springload.html Spring-Loaded Modes], Jakob Nielsen.&lt;/ref&gt; An interface that uses quasimodes only and has no full modes is still modeless according to Raskin's definition.

The [[StickyKeys]] feature turns a quasimode into a mode by serializing keystrokes of modifier keys with normal keys, so that they don't have to be pressed simultaneously. In this case the increased possibility of a mode error is largely compensated for by the improved [[accessibility]] for users with physical disabilities.

'''''Mycotaxon''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] that covers the [[nomenclature]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[fungi]], including [[lichens]]. The journal was founded by Grégoire L. Hennebert and [[Richard P. Korf]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="Korf 2005"/&gt; They were frustrated that papers submitted to journals such as ''[[Mycologia]]'' took a year or longer from submission to publication. Korf and Hennebert introduced a number of innovations to make their journal more efficient and accessible than its contemporaries. ''Mycotaxon'' reduced the wait time between submission and publication by requiring authors to submit camera-ready copy. [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] was the industry standard at the time; ''Mycotaxon'' used photo-offset [[lithography]] to expedite publication.&lt;ref name="Cornell"/&gt; A quarterly journal, ''Mycotaxon'' aimed to publish papers within four months of submission.&lt;ref name="Korf 1974"/&gt; ''Mycotaxon'' took an unusual non-blind approach to refereeing: authors were required to enlist a reviewer outside of their institution to peer-review their manuscript prior to its submission.&lt;ref name="Cornell"/&gt; Initially ''Mycotaxon'' did not demand page charges from authors, rather relying on subscription fees to finance publication. Papers of all lengths were accepted.&lt;ref name="Korf 1974"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3522">'''The National Electrical Safety Code (NESC)''' or '''ANSI Standard C2''' is a United States standard of the safe installation, operation, and maintenance of electric power and communication utility systems including power substations, power and communication overhead lines, and power and communication underground lines. It is published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). "National Electrical Safety Code" and "NESC" are registered trademarks of the IEEE. The NESC should not be confused with the [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA). The NEC is used for residential, commercial, and industrial building wiring.

==General==

===Access to the NESC===
The NESC is written as a voluntary standard. It is typically adopted as law by individual states or other governmental authorities. To determine the legal status of the NESC, the state public service commission, public utility commission, or other governmental authority should be contacted. The majority of the states in the United States adopt the NESC in some form or fashion. The state of California is an exception. The state of California writes their own utility codes titled General Order 95 (GO95) for overhead lines and General Order 128 (GO128) for underground lines. The current edition of the NESC (2017) is available as a spiral bound book containing approximately 345 pages. The NESC codebook can be purchased online from the publisher, from [http://www.IEEE.org IEEE], or at various third party websites.

===Format of the NESC===
The NESC is written by various sub committees. The organizations represented, subcommittees, and committee members are listed in the front of the code book. The NESC contains the procedure and time schedule for revising the NESC, which are described in the back of the code book. The NESC has an interpretation committee that issues formal interpretations. The process for obtaining a formal interpretation is outlined in the front of the code book. The NESC is currently published on a 5-year cycle. Urgent safety matters that require a change in between code editions are handled through a Tentative Interim Amendment (TIA) process. Original work on the NESC began in 1913.

The NESC is structured into parts, sections, and rules. There are general sections at the beginning of the book covering the introduction, definitions, references, and grounding. Following the general section are four main parts including: substations rules (Part 1), overhead line rules (Part 2), underground line rules (Part 3), and work rules (Part 4).

==NESC Handbooks==

The '''New Alchemy Institute''' was a research center that did pioneering investigation into [[organic agriculture]], [[aquaculture]], and [[bioshelter]] design between 1969 and 1991. It was founded by [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Nancy Jack Todd, and William McLarney. Its purpose was to research human support systems of food, water, and shelter and to completely rethink how these systems were designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Alastair|title=Remembering Jay Baldwin, experimental geodesic dome champion - Archpaper.com|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/04/remembering-jay-baldwin/|accessdate=18 May 2018|work=archpaper.com|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of the Institute==

The New Alchemy Institute was founded on a {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}}, former dairy farm in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Hatchville]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Cape Cod]]. Their stated aim was to do research on behalf of the planet: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Among our major tasks is the creation of ecologically derived human support systems - [[renewable energy]], agriculture [[aquaculture]], housing and landscapes. The strategies we research emphasize a minimal reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s and operate on a scale accessible to individuals, families and small groups. It is our belief that ecological and social transformations must take place at the lowest functional levels of society if humankind is to direct its course towards a greener, saner world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our programs are geared to produce not riches, but rich and stable lives, independent of world fashion and the vagaries of international economics. The New Alchemists work at the lowest functional level of society on the premise that society, like the planet itself, can be no healthier than the components of which it is constructed. The urgency of our efforts is based on our belief that the industrial societies which now dominate the world are in the process of destroying it." (Fall 1970, Bulletin of the New Alchemists. [http://www.thegreencenter.net/newalchemy.html])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Areas of research==

===Bioshelters===

A [[bioshelter]] is a solar greenhouse that is managed as a self-contained [[ecosystem]].  The groupings of plants, animals, soil and insects are selected so that closed loops of life cycles, materials, water, and energy are created, and require minimal inputs from outside the system.  They emulate natural rhythms of growth and cycling of nutrients.

New Alchemy built several bioshelters:

* "The Ark" located at the property in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Hatchville, Massachusetts]], United States
* "The Ark" located at [[Little Pond, Prince Edward Island|Spry Point, Prince Edward Island]], Canada
* others

===Organic agriculture===
New Alchemy investigated the practices of organic agriculture for both field crops, and greenhouse growing. They researched intensive gardening, biological pest control, cover cropping, irrigation using fish pond water, perennial food crops, and tree crops.

===Aquaculture===
New Alchemy experimented with growing edible fish  in ponds in the bioshelters. The solar aquaculture ponds were  above-ground, translucent tanks. The fertile pond water was used for irrigating the crops in the greenhouses. This proved to be a successful way to raise edible fish, floating hydroponic crops, and irrigated greenhouse food crops.

==Ideological basis==
The scientists working at New Alchemy were determined to rethink how human support systems were designed. They looked to nature as the ultimate designer, using careful observation of natural cycles and processes as the template for creating truly sustainable systems.

==Publications==
The research conducted at New Alchemy was documented in a series of journals and technical bulletins.  A complete list is available at: [http://www.thegreencenter.net New Alchemy Institute]

'''Programme level''' refers to the [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] level that an [[sound|audio]] source is transmitted or recorded at, and is important in audio if listeners of [[Compact Disc]]s (CDs), [[radio]] and [[television]] are to get the best experience, without excessive [[noise]] in quiet periods or distortion of loud sounds. Programme level is often measured using a [[peak programme meter]] or a [[VU meter]].

The level of an audio signal is among the most basic of measurements, and yet widespread misunderstanding and disagreement about programme levels has become arguably the greatest single obstacle to high quality [[sound reproduction]].

== How it works ==
Live sound covers an enormous range of levels, but this is not something that can be demonstrated with a conventional [[sound level meter]]. Sound level meters respond quite slowly, even on a "fast" setting: they use a [[root mean square]] (RMS) rectifier which by definition must take a slow running average of the square of the input voltage. Music is complex, and constantly varying, with brief peaks originating from many sources including the initial impact of sticks on [[cymbal]]s and [[drum]]s. A loud [[Band (music)|band]] might measure 100&amp;nbsp;[[dB SPL]] on a sound level meter, yet have peaks reaching 130&amp;nbsp;dB SPL or higher.

A recording system must handle these peaks; they can be measured using a peak responding meter with an integration time of 0.5&amp;nbsp;ms or less (not a standard IEC type PPM which has a longer integration time).

The [[sound level meter]] is useless for properly assessing noise levels, since the commonly used [[A-weighting]] is based on equal-loudness contours for pure tones, and is not valid for the random noise.

The subjective [[loudness]] of noise is best measured using a noise-meter to the [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] standard. The chart below shows, on this basis, the real range of live music, and then the level capabilities of various stages in the audio chain, from [[microphone]] to [[loudspeaker]].

== Analysing programme levels ==
[[File:Lindos10.svg|thumb]]
This chart is based on the assumption that what goes in should come out—true high-fidelity—and so an [[Alignment level|Alignment Level]] (AL) corresponding to 100&amp;nbsp;dB SPL has been assumed throughout. Any lower level would imply severe clipping at the first stage; the master recording. Top quality [[microphone]]s do not present a problem; most will handle 130&amp;nbsp;dB SPL without severe [[distortion]], and a few manage more than 140&amp;nbsp;dB SPL.

The [[master recording]] process, using current 24-bit techniques, offers around 99&amp;nbsp;dB of "true" dynamic range (based on the ''ITU-R&amp;nbsp;468 noise weighting'' standard); identical to the dynamic range of a good studio microphone, though very few recordings will use just one microphone, and so the noise on most recordings is likely to be the sum of several microphones after mixing, and probably at least 6&amp;nbsp;dB worse than shown.

The '''Qatar Computing Research Institute''' (QCRI) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], is a nonprofit multidisciplinary computing research institute founded by the [[Qatar Foundation]] (QF) for Education, Science and Community Development in 2010. It is primarily funded by the Qatar Foundation, a private, non-profit organization that is supporting Qatar on its journey from carbon economy to [[knowledge economy]]. 

==Background==
QCRI is one of the three national research institutes under Qatar Foundation and specializes in applied computing research. Its research fall into two main categories: core computing and multidisciplinary computing. Within core computing, QCRI specializes in internet computing (with an emphasis on cloud computing and social networking), data analysis, and advanced computer hardware design. Within multidisciplinary computing, QCRI is focused on Arabic language technologies, high performance computing, and bioinformatics.

QCRI has offices in the [[Hamad Bin Khalifa University|HBKU]] Research Complex, in [[Doha]]'s [[Education City]].  QCRI has a staff of 90+ employees.

==Origins==
QCRI grew out of a series of meetings held by the Qatari Arab Joint Committee (QAJC) analyzing the needs of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;"Qatar Computing Research Institute looks to 'shake computer science'". Business Intelligence Middle East. 18 August 2010. http://www.bi-me.com/main.php?c=3&amp;cg=3&amp;t=1&amp;id=47875 Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The group found that Qatar Foundation funded basic computing research at academic institutions worldwide through [[Qatar National Research Fund]] (QNRF) and that it incubated the development of new commercial computing products through Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP), but it lacked a research organization focused on computing grand challenges that address national priorities for growth and development.

QCRI was established in 2010 with a mandate to tackle large-scale computing challenges relevant to the needs of Qatari stakeholders.

[[Image:SEA Logo lowres.png|150px|right]]
'''Sea Education Association''' (SEA) is a private, nonprofit educational organization. Founded in 1971 by [[Corwith Cramer]], Jr. SEA operates two sailing ships traveling throughout both the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans. 

SEA is based on Cape Cod in the oceanographic research community of Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

== History ==

Founded in 1971, the Sea Education Association spent its first years operated from headquarters in [[Boston]] and [[Chicago]], however in 1975, Corwith Cramer had the organization and its sole vessel, the R/V Westward, transferred to its modern-day location in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]].

Over the years, the program would expand greatly, with more ocean semester programs being offered at a time and the expanding of the SEA fleet. Most of these changes can be accredited to Cramer's successor, Rafe Parker, who replaced him in 1982. Some of the program's most significant changes include, the addition of the SSV ''Corwith Cramer'' brigantine in 1987, and the replacement of the R/V ''Westward'' with the SSV ''Robert C. Seamans'' in 2001.

John Bullard took over as President in 2002 and retired in June 2012. During John's term, SEA developed the Stanford@SEA Program and formed additional partnerships with domestic and foreign universities.

Peg Brandon, SEA Semester alumna and former SEA Faculty Captain, took over as SEA's President in 2014.

A '''sex toy''' is an object or device that is primarily used to facilitate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual pleasure]], such as a [[dildo]] or [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]].  Many popular sex toys are designed to resemble human genitals and may be vibrating or non-vibrating.  The term ''sex toy'' can also include [[BDSM]] apparatus and [[sex furniture]] such as [[fisting sling|slings]]; however, it is not applied to items such as [[birth control]], [[pornography]], or [[condom]]s. Alternative expressions include '''adult toy''' and the dated euphemism '''marital aid''', although "marital aid" has a broader sense and is applied to drugs and herbs marketed to supposedly enhance or prolong sex. Sex toys are most commonly sold at a [[sex shop]], but they may also be sold in a pharmacy/chemist store, a pornographic DVD store, or [[head shop]]. Today's sex toys are available in almost all countries for male and females.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Types==

=== Erotic electrostimulation ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
Another form of sex toy for both men and women are those for [[erotic electrostimulation]].

Erotic electrostimulation refers to the act of using electricity for sexual stimulation. Electrostimulation dates back as early as the mid 1700s. By the mid 1970s, medical transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines were widely available. The machines work by stimulating nerve endings with electricity, sending signals of stimulation to the brain. Electrostimulation works off this same principle, when the brain received a signal of stimulation from the genitals, pleasure hormones are released.

===Erotic furniture===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
[[Erotic furniture]] is furniture specially shaped for comfort, penetration levels, and stimulation.

===General penetrative toys===
[[Image:Ben Wa balls.jpg|thumb|upright|A type of Ben Wa balls]]
{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=

| footer = ''Top-'' A woman [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]] a man [[doggy-style]] with a pink [[strap-on dildo]]. ''Bottom-'' Illustration of [[anal bead]] use
}}
* [[Ben Wa balls]] are hollow metal balls inserted vaginally which can be worn inside the vagina for extended periods of time. The internal rolling is claimed to enhance orgasms.
* Love Balls are solid metal balls inserted vaginally prior to sex. The weight and agitation by penis or dildo enhance sensation. They were popularised by the novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' and its film adaptation.
* A [[dildo]] is a non-vibrating device which is used for sexual stimulation of the vagina or anus. Dildos are generally made of silicone rubber, but can be made of other materials such as body safe metals such as titanium, stainless steel, aluminium, or glass. They are often made to resemble a penis, although some are C-shaped or S-shaped for G-spot or P-spot stimulation.
** A [[double penetration dildo]] is a long, usually flexible dildo with both ends designed for penetration. It allows for mutual penetration between two persons (or for double penetration of  a single female, both anally and vaginally).
** A [[strap-on dildo]] is a dildo worn in a harness, used to penetrate another person.
* A horseshoe is a non-vibrating sex toy which is shaped similar to a [[horseshoe]], which is put into the vagina and anus at the same time. It is made with softer plastics.
* [[Kegel exercise]]r, also known as vaginal barbells, eggs, or jugglers, are designed to improve muscle tone in the [[pelvic floor]], and can be used for sexual pleasure as well as enhancing vaginal response.
* A [[sex-machine]] is a motor-driven device that combines penetration with rotational or reciprocal movement, or both.&lt;ref name="leung"&gt;Leung, Isaac (2009). "The Cultural Production of Sex Machines and the Contemporary Technosexual Practices". In Grenzfurthner, J. et al., eds. ''Do androids sleep with electric sheep? Critical perspectives on sexuality and pornography in science and social fiction.''  [[RE/SEARCH]], {{ISBN|978-1-889307-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anal toys====
[[Image:Zwei unterschiedliche Butt-Plugs.jpg|upright|thumb|Two butt plugs]]
* [[Anal beads]]
* [[Butt plug]]s are often shorter dildos intended for anal insertion.  They tend to have a flared base to prevent the device from becoming sucked into the rectum.
* [[Prostate massage]]rs are devices designed to stimulate a man's [[prostate]] for health and pleasure.

====Glass sex toys====
[[File:Glass Dildo.JPG|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Glass [[Dildo]]]]
Glass sex toys are commonly made from clear medical grade [[borosilicate glass]] ("hard glass"). This particular type of safety toughened glass is non-toxic and will withstand extreme temperatures, as well as physical shock without compromising its structural integrity.

The choice of this high-grade material provides safety in use and the option to heat or chill the toys. Borosilicate glass is also non-porous and can be sterilized to help prevent infection with reuse. The highest quality glass toys can even be put in the dishwasher making them easier to keep clean. As well as their practical qualities, a main selling point of glass sex toys is their visual appeal.

Some glass sex toys vibrate.  There are two main ways this can be achieved. Either the toy may have a hole into which a small bullet vibrator can be inserted, or the core of the glass design can be modified to form a standard vibrator. The latter option usually has a plastic cap covering the battery compartment, which will also house any control buttons or switches.

====Vibrators====
{{main|Vibrator (sex toy)}}
Vibrators are vibrating devices intended to stimulate the body. Vibrators come in a range of shapes and sizes, for internal or external use.  Some vibrators intended for internal use are [[Phallus|phallic]] in shape.  Small vibrators may have a stretchy loop attachment for use as a finger toy or [[cock ring]]. Penetrative vibrators usually measure twelve to eighteen cm (five to seven inches) in length and two to five cm (one to two inches) wide often to mimic the size of the average [[human penis]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

* [[Anal vibrator]]s are designed to be inserted into the rectum, which may stimulate the [[prostate]] in men.  The safest ones have a flared base which remains outside the body, that prevents the toy from becoming irretrievable.
*  Bullet vibrators are small, bullet-shaped vibrators that can be used for direct stimulation or inserted into other sex toys to increase stimulation.  Some are sold with stretchy loops for attachment as a finger toy or [[cock ring]].
* Luxury vibrators have an increased focus on design and the use of expensive materials that appeal to a more upscale fashion market.
* [[G-spot vibrator]]s are curved at one end to facilitate stimulation of the female [[G-spot]].
* The [[rabbit vibrator]], of which there are several variations, is a popular female sex toy popularized by the television series ''[[Sex and the City]]''.&lt;ref name="Sex and The City Episode Guide"&gt;{{cite web| title =  Sex and The City Episode Guide| publisher = HBO.com| url = http://www.hbo.com/city/episode/season1/episode09.shtml| accessdate =2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises an insertable shaft which often has additional functionality, such as rotation and internal beads or a thrusting action. Attached to the shaft is a vibrating clitoral stimulator. For most rabbit vibrators this comes in the form of "bunny ears" which sit each side of the [[clitoris]].
* Vibrator wands, such as the [[Hitachi Magic Wand]], are large vibrators that generally plug into an electrical outlet (versus operating on battery power) and are often marketed as back massagers.&lt;ref name="christophertrout"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trout |first1=Christopher |title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/ |accessdate=30 August 2014 |work=[[Engadget]] |date=28 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/ |archivedate=27 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are able to produce far more powerful vibration than most battery-powered vibrators.&lt;ref name="christophertrout" /&gt;  Various attachments made of silicone or a rubber material allow the toy to be used penetratively, or give the toy more interesting texture.&lt;ref name="christophertrout" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News &amp; Commentary|work=Valley Advocate|location=Easthampton, Massachusetts|publisher=Accessed via [[NewsBank]]|date=4 November 2010|quote=The Hitachi Magic Wand, with a reputation for releasing even the most stubborn orgasm, brings a powerful buzz to all the right places (instead of uncomfortably rattling the handle). Separately sold removable silicone tops add extra texture or penetration options}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sybian]]s are dual-area vibrators in the form of a clitoral stimulator and vaginal stimulator, designed to stimulate the two erogenous zones simultaneously and independently.

===Nipple toys===
* A [[nipple clamp]] is a clamp used to stimulate the nipples by applying varying degrees of pressure.
* Suction devices are generally either rubber or glass.

===Penile toys===
[[Image:Sex Toy.png|thumb|100px|A penis sleeve]]
* [[Artificial vagina]]s, also known as "pocket pussies" or "male masturbators", are tubes made of soft material to simulate [[sexual intercourse]]. The material and often textured inner canal are designed to stimulate the [[Human penis|penis]] and induce [[orgasm]]. The male masturbators come in many shapes and styles; they can be shaped like [[vulva]]s, anuses, mouths, or as non-descriptive holes. Some male masturbators are [[disposable]] and some can be washed and used repeatedly. Some are equipped with [[sex-machine]] options that work similar to [[milking machines]].&lt;ref name="browne"&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Ray Broadus|year=1982|title=Objects of special devotion: fetishism in popular culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NO5DkzptBeoC|page=49|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A cock harness is a more elaborate harness designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with [[BDSM]] activities such as [[cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|cock and ball torture]]. An [[Arab strap (sexual device)|Arab strap]] is one such form of harness, purported to be a device used for maintaining an erection.
* [[Cock ring]]s prolong male erection by holding blood inside the penis. A man may wear a cock-ring to combat erectile difficulties, or for the sensation of tightness and engorgement that wearing one provides. Some models include a protruding [[Clitoris|clitoral]] stimulator, designed to stimulate the clitoris during sex. Others vibrate, either vibrating the ring itself, or in a popular 'Dolphin' variant by using two removable bullet vibrators to provide stimulation to both the testicles and clitoris. Some cock rings also have [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrators]] attached which can be worn to stimulate a partner during [[sexual intercourse]], especially in the [[scrotum]] or [[perineum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremerestraints.com/nova-silicone-cock-ring-and-prostate-vibe.html|title="Nova Silicone Cock Ring and Prostate Vibe"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other cock rings have arms that rub and apply pressure to the [[perineum]] of the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Albert G|year=1994|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5439007|title=United States Patent 5,439,007 "Suspensory"|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A triple crown is a special cock ring that has additional rings for restraining the testicles. In orgasm, the testicles usually retract toward the body before [[ejaculation]]. A triple crown changes and intensifies the sensation of orgasm by forcing the testicles to stay away from the body.
* A docking sleeve is a cylindrical device similar to a penis sleeve, but is open at both ends, so that two men can [[List of sex positions#Genital-genital sex|dock]], a form of [[Mutual masturbation#Mutual masturbation as a form of non-penetrative sex|mutual masturbation]].
* A penis extension is a partially hollow device like a very short dildo, with the hollow end placed on the end of the penis, intended to increase the effective length of the penis, again for the benefit of the person being penetrated. These are generally worn with condoms to prevent them from falling off during use.
* A penis sleeve is a cylindrical device that is placed on the shaft of the penis, with the aim of increasing stimulation for the person being penetrated. They often have soft bumps intended to provide further stimulation.

==Health, safety, and privacy concerns==

No safety regulations exist in the sex toy industry. The sex toys are sold as novelty items so they do not need to adhere to certain regulations such as reporting the chemicals and materials used in a product. Due to this status, manufacturers are not responsible if their toys are used for any other purpose than being a novelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|publisher=www.kinseyconfidential.org|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations such as [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|title=REACH - ECHA|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724051550/http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|archivedate=24 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; do exist, and some sex toys may be compliant to this though, despite that there is no obligation for manufacturers on attaining compliance.  A 2006 study conducted by the [[Greenpeace]] Netherlands office found high level of [[phthalate]]s in seven out of eight plastic sex toys tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/bad-vibrations-we-expose-an-eu-sex-scandal Bad vibrations? We expose an EU sex scandal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514001824/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/bad-vibrations-we-expose-an-eu-sex-scandal |date=2008-05-14 }} Posted by bex (8 September 2006)Greenpeace UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex toys are classified as novelties in the United States because the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has extensive testing and financial requirements in order for sex toys to be classified as medical devices. Therefore, sex toy manufacturers more often choose less complex production by labelling them a novelty, where their listed ingredients do not have to be accurate in chemical composition or percentage of ingredients.  Due to the novelty classification, sex toys may contain toxins such as phthalates, which have been banned in children's toys by the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|CPSC]].&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation - Kinsey Confidential|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phthalates|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Phthalates-Information/|publisher=www.cpsc.gov|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phthalates are chemical plasticizers that are added as softeners, to create the malleable and soft effect that many look for in sex toys.&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"/&gt;

Studies on rodents have revealed that when exposed to very large doses, phthalates can cause damage to the liver, lungs, kidneys, testes and can cause hormonal disruption. The latest research indicates that exposure to these substances can upset the body's ability to regulate hormone production, damage reproduction, can cause liver and kidney defects, and can cause cancer. The most common and external side-effects are rashes, itchiness and irritation to the locations of use.

Before using a sex toy, owners should take precautions.  One should check for tears, rough seams or cracks  that could harm the inside of the vagina or anus.  Condoms should also be used on porous sex toys and sex toys that are being shared between two or more partners. They should also use appropriate lubricants; silicone lube will break down silicone toys, and oil-based lubes will break down latex condoms.&lt;ref name=brownedu&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Toys|url=http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/sexuality/sex_toys.php/|publisher=[[Brown University]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleaning sex toys is also very important for sexual health and sex toy safety.  Cleaning them will avoid the potential of bacterial infection, transmission of STIs (if shared), or pregnancy (if sperm is present on the toy).  Porous sex toys (ridged, flexible, soft and squishy) are difficult to clean and can hide bacteria that multiply and harm the human body. Non-porous toys are easier to clean, being less harmful.&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"/&gt;  When cleaning sex toys, always use warm water and unscented anti-bacterial soap.&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;

Non-porous toys&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;
* Glass toys: some can be put in the dishwasher, but it is recommended not to expose them to extreme temperatures and to wash them with soap and water.
* Stainless Steel toys: boil or soak stainless steel toys in 1-10 bleach-water solution for ten minutes, put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, or use soap and water (if there are electrical components to the toy).
* Hard plastic toys: do not boil the toy, and wash with soap and water.
* Silicone toys: put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, boil for 5–10 minutes, or wash with water and soap.

Porous toys&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;
* Rubber toys: they cannot be properly cleaned because bacteria is absorbed into the material, so it is recommended to always use a condom.
* Cyberskin and Vinyl toys: clean with warm water, air dry, and sprinkle it with a small amount of cornstarch (to keep them dry and not sticky).
* Nylon toys: put it in the top rack of the dish-washer or wash with soap and water.

Anal toys ([[butt plug]]s, small dildos, etc.)
*When using sex toys in the anus, sex toys can easily get lost as rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon; to prevent this serious problem, it is recommended that individuals use sex toys with a flared base or a string.&lt;ref name=scientificamerican&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Vibrations: U.S. Consumer Web Site Aims to Enhance Sex Toy Safety|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/good-vibrations-us-consumer-web-site-aims-to-enhance-sex-toy-safety/|publisher=www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the security software company [[Trend Micro]] demonstrated that some sex toys are vulnerable to [[cyberattack]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Your Sex Toys Could Be Vulnerable To Cyberattack|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-toy-cyberattack_us_56e82b02e4b065e2e3d74bb5|work=Huffington Post|date=15 March 2016|author=Caroline Copley|agency=Reuters|location=Hanover, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating the field of [[Tor hidden services|onion dildonics]].&lt;ref name="Onion Dildonics"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix |title=Smart dildos and vibrators keep getting hacked – but Tor could be the answer to safer connected sex|quote=Connected sex toys are gathering huge amounts of data about our most intimate moments.

==Legal issues==

===India===
Sex toys are illegal in India.&lt;ref name ="singh2007"&gt;Singh, Jyotsna (20 June 2007).

Section 18A of the [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]], inserted by the [[Immorality Amendment Act, 1969]], prohibited the manufacture or sale of any item "intended to be used to perform an unnatural sexual act". The term "unnatural sexual act" referred to any sex other than vaginal heterosexual sex, and this prohibition was ostensibly aimed at preventing the use of [[dildo]]s by [[lesbian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kevan |last1=Botha |first2=Edwin |last2=Cameron |authorlink2=Edwin Cameron |editor1-first=Donald J. |editor1-last=West |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Green |title=Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-Nation Comparison |chapter=South Africa |year=1997 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-45532-3 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer enforced, the section was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===United States===

Sex toys and lubricants have become increasingly available in major commercial outlets in the United States. On-shelf displays tend to be more discreet than the offerings on web sites. These items tend to be displayed in the "sexual health" sections of stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/110965|title=Sex Aids on Retail Shelves|date=13 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, many [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] and some [[Great Plains|Great Plains states]] banned the sale of sex toys completely, either directly or through laws regulating "obscene devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lingere Store Accused of Violating State Obscenity Laws | publisher = KBCD.com | url = http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=6554592&amp;pass=1&amp;nav=3w6y | accessdate = 2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[William H. Pryor, Jr.]], an assistant attorney general in [[Alabama]] commenting on a case involving sex toys and discussing to what end the devices are used, was quoted as saying there is no "fundamental right for a person to buy a device to produce [[orgasm]]". A federal appeals court upheld Alabama's law prohibiting the sale of sex toys on Valentine's Day, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, Phillip. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-01-2390404063_x.htm Court leaves Ala. sex toy ban intact], USA Today, Oct 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a federal appeals court overturned a [[Texas]] statute banning the sales of sex toys, deeming such a statute as violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment on the right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appeals court overturns Texas ban on sex toys | publisher = msnbc.msn.com | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23155562 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court cited ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', where the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2003 struck down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, as unconstitutionally aiming at "enforcing a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct".  Similar statutes have been struck down in [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]].

[[Marty Klein]], author of ''America's War on Sex'' and an advocate for the moral value of sex toys, has described the sex toy bans as a form of [[erotophobia]] and [[genophobia]] claiming the "extraordinary erosion of personal liberty, coupled with the massive disrespect of and fear of sexuality is no joke" and that the "Supreme Court [of the United States] has declared our orgasms a battlefield, and sex toys another casualty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Holthouse|first=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005085548/http://www.damemagazine.com/features/f261/AlabamavsDildos.php?Page=2|url=http://www.damemagazine.com/features/f261/AlabamavsDildos.php?Page=2|archive-date=5 October 2009|title=Alabama vs. Dildos: Attorney General Troy King stands hard against stimulators|magazine=Dame Magazine|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SignaresBal.jpg|thumb|300px|A Signares ball, with European men.]]
'''Signare''' was the name for the [[Mulatto]] French-African women of the island of [[Gorée]] in [[French Senegal]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. These women of color managed to gain some individual assets, status, and power in the hierarchies of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic Slave Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Signares of St. Louis and Gorée: Women Entrepreneurs in Eighteenth-Century Senegal|last = Brooks|first = George|publisher = |year = 1976|isbn = |location = |pages = 19–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and economic role==
Signares commonly had power in networks of trade and wealth within the limitations of slavery. The influence held by these women led to changes in gender roles in the family structure archetype. Some owned masses of land as well as slaves. European merchants and traders, especially the French and British, would settle on coastal societies inhabited by signares in order to benefit from the increased proximity to the sources of African commerce. The earliest of these merchants were the Portuguese. These merchants were given the name "''[[lançados]]''", because "they threw themselves" among Africans, and they would establish relationships with the most influential signares who would accept them in order to obtain commercial privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Hafkin, Nancy J., and Edna G. Bay. ''Women in Africa: Studies in Social and Economic Change''. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many signares were wed under “common local law” that was recognized by priests of the Catholic faith. These marriages were for economic and social reasons. Both signares and their husbands gained from these partnerships. Europeans passed their names down to the offspring and with it their lineage.

[[File:La Signare de Gorée avec ses esclaves-Musée de la Compagnie des Indes.jpg|thumb|A signare on [[Gorée]] along with her slaves.]]
When some of the signares became too powerful, leaders like the Portuguese Crown sought ways to remove the women from their wealth.  Different crimes that the Portuguese Crown sought to accuse the women of were crimes against the state or crimes against Christianity. An example of this appears with [[Bibiana Vaz|Bibiana Vuz de França]]. She was a prominent signare who over the years accumulated a lot of wealth and slaves. After realizing how powerful that she was, the Crown wanted to find a way dismantle her influence and power.  “Accused of rebellion, trading with foreigners, and tax evasion, she was imprisoned with her younger brother and another co-conspirator and taken to Cape Verde Islands”.&lt;ref&gt;Havik, Philip J.. Women and trade in the Guinea Bissau region: the role of African and Luso-African women in trade networks from the early 16th to the mid 19th century.2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was able to receive a royal pardon and free her younger brother after leading a coup against the Crown’s representatives.  Due to her power, the Crown sought to criminalize Bibiana Vuz de França. However, once they realized that she was too powerful and too influential, all charges against her were dropped and she was once more considered loyal to the crown. Bibiana Vuz de França’s confrontation with the Portuguese Crown represents the strength that the signares in this time period had, and also the Portuguese growing inability to control the people.

=== Social mobility ===

The social status of signares also allowed for greater social mobility in Gorée than in other parts of Africa. Though there is limited documentation on the origins of most of the signares, it seems likely that at this time the people of Gorée were divided into several social classes: the ''jambor ''or freeborn; the ''jam'' or people of slave descent; the ''tega ''and ''uga ''or blacksmiths and leatherworkers and ''griots ''or storytellers. 

Many signares were of the ''jam ''or ''griot'' class, and were often married by European men because they were considered especially beautiful. Once married to European men, women helped them handle many of their trading affairs and transactions, and gained economic and social stature in the community themselves. In this way women of lower social status could gain power in the community and become important traders through their marital status.

=== Marital practices ===
Marriages between African women and European men were governed by local law. Given the fact that many European men would not stay in Gorée permanently, marriages were often in a state of flux. If a European man left Gorée and intended to return, the African woman would wait for him. When the man got on the boat to go back to Europe, signares would scoop up the sand where his last footprints were and put it a handkerchief, which she'd hang on her bedpost it until he returned. Signares would often wait years for men to return without remarrying. 

If European men left without planning to return, or if a signare learned that her European husband was not going to return to Gorée, women would remarry. This was not considered shameful in any way, and signares would not lose any of their social status, and would often retain much of the trading power that they gained through their prior marital status. Remarried signares would often raise their children from their European husbands alongside their new African husbands, and these children would receive inheritance from their mothers, not their fathers.

'''Social problem-solving''', in its most basic form, is defined as [[problem solving]] as it occurs in the natural environment.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla, 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Zurilla|first=T.J.|title=Problem-Solving therapy: A social competence approach to clinical intervention|year=1986|publisher=Srpinger|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically it refers to the cognitive-behavioral process in which one works to find adaptive ways of coping with everyday situations that are considered problematic. This process in self-directed, conscious, effortful, cogent, and focused.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla 1998 1091–1107"&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Zurilla|first=T.J.|author2=Change, E.C. |author3=Nottingham, E.J. |author4=Faccini, L. |title=Social problem-solving deficits and hopelessness, depression, and suicidal risk in college students and psychiatric inpatients|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|year=1998|volume=54|issue=8|pages=1091–1107|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4679(199812)54:8&lt;1091::aid-jclp9&gt;3.0.co;2-j}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptive social problem-solving skills are known to be effective coping skills in an array of stressful situations. Social problem-solving consists of two major processes.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla, 1986"/&gt; One of these processes is known as problem orientation. Problem orientation is defined as the [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] one holds about problems in everyday life and ones assessment of their ability to solve said problems.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla, 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla &amp; Nezu, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Zurilla|first=T.J.|author2=Nezu, A.M. |title=Development and preliminary evaluation of the Social Problem-Solving Inventory|journal=Psychological Assessment: A Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=1990|volume=2|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem orientation may be positive and constructive to the problem solving process or negative and therefore dysfunctional in the process. Problem-solving proper is known as the second major process in social problem-solving. This process refers to the skills and techniques one uses to search for solutions and applying these skills to find the best solutions available. This model has been expanded by McFall&lt;ref name="McFall, 1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFall|first=R.M.|title=A review and reformulation of the concept of social sills|journal=Behavioral Assessment|year=1982|volume=4|pages=1–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liberman and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Liberman, et al, 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liberman|first=R.P.|author2=Mueser, K.T. |author3=Wallace, C.J. |author4=Jacobs, H.E. |author5=Eckman, T. |author6=Massel, H.K. |title=Training skills in the psychiatrically disabled: Learning coping and competence|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|year=1986|volume=12|pages=631–647|doi=10.1093/schbul/12.4.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these variations social problem-solving is considered to be a multi-step process including the adoption of a general orientation, defining the problem, brainstorming for solutions, decision making, and follow up stages.&lt;ref name="Bellack, et al, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bellack|first=A.S. |author2=Sayers, M. |author3=Mueser, K.T. |author4=Bennett, M.|title=Evaluation of social problem solving in schizophrenia|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1994|volume=103|issue=2|doi=10.1037/0021-843x.103.2.371|pages=371–378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Based on the above model, it is hypothesized that a positive problem orientation leads to rational problem-solving skills.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla, Nezu, &amp; Maydeu-Olivares, 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang, E.C., D'Zurilla, T.J., Sanna, I.J.|title=Social Problem-Solving: Theory, Research, and Training|year=2004|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rational problem-solving style is defined as a sensible, thoughtful, and methodical application of effective problem-solving skills.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla, Nezu, &amp; Maydeu-Olivares, 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maydeu-Olivares &amp; D'Zurilla, 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maydeu-Olivares|first=A|author2=D'Zurilla, T.J.|title=A factor-analytic study of the Social Problem Solving Inventory: An integration of theory and data|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|year=1996|volume=20|issue=2|pages=115–133|doi=10.1007/bf02228030}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, is most likely to result in positive outcomes and an exit from the problem solving process for this particular instance.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla, Nezu, &amp; Maydeu-Olivares, 2004"/&gt; When a negative outcome occurs, a person with rational problem solving skills is more likely to begin the cycle of problem-solving again. This time with the intent of finding a more appropriate solution or to redefine the problem. On the other hand, a negative problem solving orientation is likely to lead towards impulsive-careless or avoidant problem-solving styles. An impulsive-careless style is defined as narrowed, rash, thoughtless, speedy, and incomplete attempts at problem solving.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla, Nezu, &amp; Maydeu-Olivares, 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maydeu-Olivares &amp; D'Zurilla, 1996"/&gt; An avoidance style to problem-solving is characterized by inaction, [[procrastination]], and attempts to shift responsibility to others. Both of these styles are hypothesized to lead towards negative outcomes more often in the Social Problem-Solving Process.&lt;ref name="D'Zurilla, Nezu, &amp; Maydeu-Olivares, 2004"/&gt; When negative outcomes occur, a person with an impulsive-careless or avoidant skill set is more likely to give up.

== Benefits and deficits ==

* [[Demography|demographic]] characteristics of the family members: family size, [[Ageing|age]], [[ethnicity]], and [[gender]] of the members
* [[social class]] of the family, the economic level and [[social mobility|mobility]] of the family, the professions of its members, the [[education]] levels of the family members
* what spheres of [[personal life|life]] are important in and to the family unit
* the effect of [[social change]] on the family
* the interactions of the family with other social organizations.
* [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] of family forms in contemporary societies in relation to [[ideology]], [[gender differences]], and [[State (polity)|state]] policies such as those concerned with [[marriage]]
* interaction between family members within the family. How they rely on one another. How they work together/rely on the work of someone in the family.

Examples of specific issues looked at include:
* Changing roles of family members. Each member is restricted by the [[sex role]]s of the traditional family. These roles such as the father as the worker and the mother as the [[homemaker]] are declining. The mother is becoming the supplementary provider and she retains the responsibilities of child rearing. Therefore, the female role in the labor force is "compatible with the demands of the traditional family".&lt;ref name="Bittman"/&gt; Sociology studies the adaptation of the males role to caregiver as well as provider. The gender roles are increasingly interwoven.

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

There are three major research methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

One approach is [[Statistical survey|survey]] research of contemporary families. This holds the benefit of leaving statistical data and large and hopefully random samples from which a researcher can interpolate the general traits of a society. However, survey respondents tend to answer as would feel regular or ideal rather than as things might actually be. It also gives a very one-sided explanation view of a larger group, which does not sufficiently allow for contention. The information is often outdated, not representing the true statistics of the world. The information can also be deceiving and not represent the true points that the surveys and graphs are representing.

Another method is [[ethnographic]] research of families. Where surveys allow for broad but shallow analyses, observation allows sociologists to obtain rich information on a source of a much more limited size. It allows the research an "insider" perspective, and through this closer look, a better idea of the actual social framework of families. Where surveys are strong, however, ethnographic research is weak. By reducing the size of a sample size, it may be no longer evident as to how representative the family being researched on is, to families at large within a society, and then also does not allow much room in linking the specific traits of the families being observed to a society more generally.

Finally, a researcher can use documented studies of families from the past as a source of information. These sources may include very personal items (such as [[diary|diaries]]), legal records ([[census]] data, [[Will (law)|wills]], court records), and matters of public record (such as [[sermon]]s).

==Sociology of interracial intimacy==
The construction of race in Western society and, to a degree, globally, has led to a distinct view of [[interracial marriage|interracial]] intimacy. Although interracial relationships and marriages have become far more popular and socially acceptable in the United States and Western Europe since the Civil Rights era, these unions continue to be viewed with less than total acceptance by significant portions of the population. More historically, ''American Families'' by [[Stephanie Coontz]] treats the difficulties these couples went through during the time before ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', when interracial marriage bans were declared unconstitutional. These bans functioned to enforce the [[one-drop rule]] and reenforce [[Racial identity|identity]] and privilege. Internationally, the [[far right]] continues to promote ideas of [[racial hygiene|racial purity]] by working against the normalization of interracial couples and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A White Side of Black Britain: Interracial Intimacy and Racial Literacy|journal=Duke University Press|date=2010|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/663266?journalCode=ajs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern family life and religious discourse==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

Historically, religious discourses have played a significant role in constituting family members and constructing particular forms of behavior in families, and religion has been particularly important in discourses on female sexuality. An example of the role of religion in this respect was the'witchcraft craze' in Medieval Europe. According to Turner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=B.|year=1987|title=Medical Power and Social Knowledge|location=London|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was a device to regulate the behavior of women, and the attack on women as witches was principally 'a critique of their sexuality'. 'Women were closely associated with witchcraft, because it was argued that they were particularly susceptible to the sexual advances of the devil. ...Women were seen to be irrational, emotional and lacking in self-restraint; they were especially vulnerable to satanic temptation.'

Turner argues that attempts to regulate female sexuality through religious discourse have, in the case of Western Europe, to be understood in the context of concerns about managing private property and ensuring its continuity. Thus, for the land-owning aristocracy, the point of marriage was to produce a male heir to the property of the household. Since child mortality was common, women had to be more or less continuously pregnant during their marriage to guarantee a living male heir. Furthermore, this heir had to be legitimate, if disputes over inheritance were to be avoided. This legitimacy could only be ensured by the heads of households marrying virgins and ensuring the chastity of their wives for the duration of the marriage. Equally,daughters had to be sexually pure if they were to be eligible for marriage to other property-holding families. Such marriages were prompted solely by the need to produce children and had none of the elements of eroticism and sexual compatibility of contemporary marriages.

In pre-modern Europe, these interests were reflected in the character of marriages. They were private, arranged contracts that could be easily dissolved in the event of child production being compromised by the woman's infertility or infidelity. With the entry of the Church into marriage arrangements, different definitions of marriage emerged. Lifelong marriages were demanded,but with a concern to regulate sexuality, particularly the sexuality of women.

==Sociology of marriage==
In the year 2015, [[Judeo-Christian]] [[belief system]] marriage is modeled after [[Adam and Eve]]'s lifetime commitment between man and woman. The married couple produces children, constituting the [[nuclear family]]. Some sociologists now dispute the degree to which this idealized arrangement has and does reflect the true structure of families in American society. In her 1995 article ''The American Family and the Nostalgia Trap'', sociologist [[Stephanie Coontz]] first posited that the [[American family]] has always been defined first and foremost by its economic needs. For instance, in colonial times families often relied on slaves or indentured servants to support themselves economically. The modern "breadwinner-[[homemaker]] model", argues Coontz, then has little historical basis. Only in the 1950s did the myth of the happy, nuclear family as the correct family structuration arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coontz|first=Stephanie|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ499175&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ499175|title=The American Family and the Nostalgia Trap|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=76|number=7|year=1995|pages=K1-K20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The modern family is increasingly complex and has changed profoundly, with greater acceptance for unmarried cohabitation, divorce, single-parent families, same-sex partnerships and complex extended family relations. Grandparents are also doing their bit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Steve|title=Is the nuclear family a happier one?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zc68d2p#zx249j6|website=BBC iWonder|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To paraphrase the quote, family structure is changing drastically and there is a vast variety of different family structures.

Yet Coontz argues in ''Marriage, A History'' that during the 20th century, marriages have become [[Divorce in the United States|increasingly unstable]] in the United States as individuals have begun to seek unions for the ideals of love and affection rather than social or economic expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coontz|first=Stephanie|title=Marriage, A History|edition=1st|publisher=Viking Adult|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transition has blurred the division of labor within the breadwinner-homemaker model, such that maintenance of the household and childcare, called the "second shift", are now topics for debate between marital partners. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] argues in ''The Second Shift'' that despite changes in perceptions of the purpose of marriage and the economic foundations for marriage, women continue to do the bulk of care work to the detriment of the American family. Hochschild illustrates the ways in which an unequal division of the second shift undermines family welfare by reducing marital equality and spousal satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hochschild|first1=A.R.|last2=Machung|first2=A.|year=2003|title=The Second Shift|location=New York|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families and marriage have increasingly become areas where gender matters. However, it is important to note that gender differences in marriage have too often been perceived as merely an "individual struggle and depoliticized by reducing social inequalities to differences".&lt;ref name=Ferree2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferree|first=M.M.|year=2010|title=Filling the glass: Gender perspectives on families|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=72|number=3|pages=420–439|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00711.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|422}}

===The marriage market: determining who marries whom===
There are many theoretical models to describe how people determine who to marry. An important gender-focused approach is an [[intersectional]] approach that combines education level and gender. Men and women operate in a "marriage market" that is influenced by many competing factors. One of the most decisive factors is education level. Studies have shown that men and women tend to marry partners that have attained a level of education similar to their own. In the study by Bruze, Svarer, and Weiss, low education is defined as a high school education or less, medium education is defined as vocational education, and high education is defined as a college education (2015).&lt;ref name=Bruze2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruze|first1=G.|last2=Svarer|first2=M.|last3=Weiss|first3=Y.|year=2015|title=The dynamics of marriage and divorce|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|volume=33|number=1|pages=123–170|doi=10.1086/677393|url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/58928/1/715540009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marriages]] depend on the expectations of two people and are "formed and terminated" based on those expectations. Consequently, individuals "are selected into and out of the marriage market on the basis of their education".&lt;ref name=Bruze2015/&gt; The most distinct marital trend is that men with low education are slowly selected out of the marriage market, instead remaining single. The driving force behind this process is that a marriage in which both partners or only the husband have low education end with divorce at a substantially higher rate than marriages where both partners or the husband do not have low education. Young women with medium education levels tend to have the highest rates of marriage. Highly educated men tend to marry highly educated women. Moreover, men and women who have attained high levels of education delay marriage past the age when other individuals typically marry. This trend becomes stronger with age: the proportion of married with high educations who are married to women with similarly high educations reaches 64% when the men are 46 years old.&lt;ref name=Bruze2015/&gt;

Another important intersectional factor to consider in relation to gender and marriage is marriage markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/1/marriage-inequalityclassjobswagesfamily.html|title=OPINION: Inequality damages marriage|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage market means how economics affects who marries, whose bonds endure and what this means for future generations of workers and parents. Analyzing marriage markets as they pertain to marriage has several benefits. First, marriage market conditions are forces that influence marriage from outside they subjects affect, which means they impact the general trends of marriage decisions.&lt;ref name=Harknett2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harknett|first1=K.|last2=Kuperberg|first2=A.|year=2011|title=Education, labor markets and the retreat from marriage|journal=Social Forces|volume=90|number=1|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/sf/90.1.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} In other words, individual circumstances cause people to make decisions about their marriages that might be specific to their personal situation; marriage markets impact all peoples' decisions about marriage from a macro level, which means stead incomes and job make for sound marriage. In addition, Job stability benefits both employeers through greater productivity and families though more cohesion. Second, marriage market conditions may capture many economic influences.&lt;ref name=Harknett2011/&gt;{{rp|43}} Empirical findings indicate that financial stability is an important requisite for marriage. In weak marriage markets (when there is high unemployment) couples who would like to get married may delay doing so due to unemployment or financial troubles. Furthermore, even couples that are already married may face doubts about the future economic status of themselves or their partners, which can create marital instability. Conversely, strong labor markets (when unemployment is low) may improve the employment situation and financial situation of either partner, which may facilitate marriage and increase economic stability.&lt;ref name=Harknett2011/&gt;{{rp|44}} Thus, when marriage markets are strong and unemployment is low, marriage may be perceived as more attractive to individuals than when marriage markets and weak and unemployment is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/jobs/2012/02/03/the-marriage-gap-the-impact-of-economic-and-technological-change-on-marriage-rates/|title=The Marriage Gap: The Impact of Economic and Technological Change on Marriage Rates {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-01-18|newspaper=Brookings|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Intersection of class and gender===
[[Social class]] interacts with gender to impact the male-female dynamic in marriage, particularly with respect to "temporal flexibility at work and home".&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gertsel|first1=N.|last2=Clawson|first2=D.|year=2014|title=Class advantage and the gender divide: Flexibility on the job and at home|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=120|number=4|pages=395–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|397}} Research shows that class advantaged men and women use their class privilege and the flexibility it provides them in ways that support conventional [[gender roles]]. Conversely, men and women who do not have access to such flexibility and control of their time are pressured to weaken conventional gender expectations regarding marriage, family, and jobs. Gertsel and Clawson conducted a study in which they collected data from four groups of paid care workers, divided by class and gender (2014).&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt; The two class-advantaged groups were [[nurses]] and [[Physician|doctors]]. The nurses were almost exclusively women and the doctors were almost exclusively men. This group had a number of choices about work hours and their ability to utilize family-friendly workplace policies. The two class-disadvantaged groups were female [[nursing assistants]] (CNAs) and male [[emergency medical technicians]] (EMTs). The class-disadvantaged group had fewer choices regarding their work hours and faced greater constraints in flexibility and control of their time. Women in particular need flexible work hours in order to meet the inflexible demands that marriage and a family place upon them, as traditional gender expectations stipulate that the woman be the primary caregiver.&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt;{{rp|405}} The results of this study demonstrate that class, intersecting with gender, influences the ability of men and women to obtain and utilize flexibility with their time.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Furthermore, gender shapes the particular variety of flexibility demanded. In advantaged occupations, both men and women are able to acquire the flexibility they so desire. However, they choose to use the control that this affords them in different manners. Women cut back on paid work hours and take leaves to handle domestic labor and child-care. In other words, they make job sacrifices. On the other hand, men are less likely to utilize family-friendly policies to make work sacrifices; they spend less at home and more time working. In essence, both men and women of class-advantaged occupations use the flexibility that their status provides them to "enact neotraditional gender expectations".&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt;{{rp|424}}

Class-disadvantaged men and women do not have the same temporal flexibility that allows them to make decisions on how to allocate their time. They face stricter constraints on their work hours and policies, thus making it impossible for them to choose whether to spend more time at work or more time at home. For example, even if a class-disadvantaged woman wanted to spend less time at work and more time with her children or in the home, she might not be able due to the inability to get time off from work or take a leave of absence.&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt;

Thus, class-disadvantage makes it more difficult for both men and women to adhere to traditional gender expectations. The researchers showed that class advantage is used to "do gender" in traditional ways, while class disadvantage may lead to a violation of traditional gender expectations in a way that "undoes gender".&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt;{{rp|431}} 

===Gender and work-family balance in marriage===
Research indicates that three principal factors predict how well men and women perceive their work-life balance in marriage: job characteristics, family characteristics, and spillover between work and family.&lt;ref name=Keene2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keene|first1=J.R.|last2=Quadagno|first2=J.|year=2004|title=Predictors of perceived work-family balance: Gender difference or gender similarity|journal=Sociological Perspectives|volume=47|number=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1525/sop.2004.47.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Job characteristics determine workers' freedom to balance multiple demands and obligations in their marriage. As demonstrated by Gertsel and Clawson, higher-level occupations are generally more accommodating to family life than are lower level occupations (2014).&lt;ref name=Gertsel2014/&gt; Furthermore, the number of hours worked and the work spillover into family life are the most telling predictors of perceived imbalance in marriage. Keene and Quadagno found a greater likelihood of perceived imbalance when work duties caused men or women to miss a family event or make it difficult to maintain their home (2004).&lt;ref name=Keene2004/&gt;

Additional research by Keene and Quadagno suggests that the gender expectations that men should prioritize their work lives and women should prioritize their marriage and home life no longer exist.&lt;ref name="Keene2004" /&gt; However, there persists an unequal division of labor in the home between men and women. One theoretical approach to explain this concept is the "gender similarity" approach, which "predicts that the convergence in men's and women's work and family demands should lead to a convergence in attitudes toward work and family responsibilities and feelings of work-family balance".&lt;ref name="Keene2004" /&gt;{{rp|4}} In contrast, the "gender differences" approach stipulates that "normative differences between men and women remain, with the family still primarily defined as women's sphere and paid work as men's domain".&lt;ref name="Keene2004" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There is empirical evidence in support of both theories. Some research supports the convergence of men's and women's work experiences: both men and women make adjustments in their marriage and personal lives to meet their employer's expectations, while also making adjustments at work to maintain their marital and family obligations. However, the analysis from the abovementioned study supports the gender differences model. Gender differences exist in the division of household labor and chores, with men working more hours and women spending more time on domestic and child-care responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Keene2004" /&gt; 

==Divorce==

===Trends===

The [[divorce]] rate in western countries has generally increased over time. Divorce rates have however started to decrease over the last twenty years.  In the USA, divorce rate changed from l.2 per 1000 marriages in 1860 to 3.0, 4.0 and 7.7 in 1890, 1900, 1920 then to, 5.3, 4.7, 4.1 and 3.7 per 1000 marriages in 1979, 1990, 2000 and 2004 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Strow, C. W., &amp; Strow, B. K. (2006). A history of divorce and remarriage in the United States. Humanomics, 22(4), 239-257.&lt;/ref&gt; People are less inclined to stay in unhappy relationships to keep the family unit intact and the maintain consistency in their children's lives, the way previous generations did. 

Divorce rates in Canada and the United States fluctuated in a similar pattern, though the United States still has the highest divorce rate in the world (50% higher than Canada's).&lt;ref name="Macionis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macionis|first1=J.J.|last2=Gerber|first2=L.M.|year=2011|title=Sociology|edition=7th|location=Toronto|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are several possible causes for the increased rate of divorce:

# Individualism: In today's society, families spend more time apart than they do together. Some individuals in a family focus more on personal happiness and earning income to support their family that it consumes the time actual spent with their family.
# Feelings are no longer mutual: Many people end marriages because they are no longer satisfied by sexual needs or merely because they have lost feelings for one another. This often happens when one partner finds a more exciting relationship and chooses to move forward with that new relationship. In some cases, a partner may even commit adultery which also may result in a divorce as a partner discovers their partner being unfaithful to them.
# Women have become more independent: Now that women have equal rights and have proven over time that they have the potential and ability to support themselves, women find it much easier to leave unhappy marriages. They are also more work focused, thus giving them less time to cope with their relationship.
# Stress: Stress is a big factor in marriages. Working to support a family, while trying to stabilize finances is a big factor of stress. Also, with both partners working (in most cases), leaves less "family time" which makes raising children difficult. This often happens in the stage where couples are raising young children.
# Socially acceptable: In today's generation, divorce is now more socially acceptable. Now, instead of discouraging a divorce in an unsatisfying relationship, it is more widely accepted and sometimes even encouraged. Not only is it now more acceptable, but it is also easier to get a divorce legally than it was in previous years according to the Divorce Act of 1968.

===Parents: Falling out of love===

Many scholars have attempted to explain why humans enter relationships, stay in relationships and end relationships. Levinger's (1965, 1976) theory on divorce is based on a theoretical tradition consisting of three basic components: attractions, barriers and alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, Paul, R. and Hohmann-Marriot, Brandyl.  A Comparison of High and Low Distress Marriages That End in Divorce. Journal of Marriage and Family, Vol. 69, No. 3 (Aug., 2007), pp 621-638.&lt;/ref&gt; Attraction in this theory is proportional to the rewards one gets from the relationship minus the cost of the relationship. All the things that can be seen as gains from the relationship such as love, sex, companionship, emotional support and daily assistance are the rewards of the relationship. The costs would the negative aspects of the relationship such as [[domestic violence]], infidelity, quarrels and limitations on personal freedom. Generally people tend to stay in high rewards and low cost relationships. However, the reverse situation, that is, a costly marriage with few benefits does not automatically lead to divorce. Couples must overcome barriers such as religious beliefs, social stigma, and financial dependence or law restrictions before they successfully dissolve their marriage. 

Another theory to explain why relationships end is the "Mate ejection theory", by Brian Boutwell, J.C. Barnes and K.M Beaver.&lt;ref&gt;Boutwell, B. B., Barnes, J. C., &amp; Beaver, K. M. (2015). When love dies: Further elucidating the existence of a mate ejection module. Review of General Psychology, 19(1), 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mate ejection theory looks at the dissolution of marriage from an evolutionary point of view, where all species seek to successfully reproduce. According to this theory there are gender differences in the process of ejection. For example, a woman will be more upset when her husband emotionally cheats on her and a man will be more upset when his wife physically cheats on him. The reason for this stems from evolutionary roots, a man emotionally cheating on his wife equates to a loss or reduction in resources for the wife to raise the children whereas an act of physical [[infidelity]] by the wife threatens the husband's chance to pass on his genes to the next generation via reproduction. Both these circumstances call for mate ejection. "Ancestral conditions that favored the dissolution of a mateship constituted a recurrent adaptive problem over human evolutionary history and thus imposed selection pressures for the evolution of strategic solutions." Put differently, the capability of emancipating themselves from certain relationships could have conferred a fitness benefit for ancestral humans.&lt;ref&gt;(Buss, 1994) {{title missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of Divorce on Children===

Three [[longitudinal studies]] on divorce: The Marin County Project (the clinical study of 60 families that began in 1971), The Virginia County Study (a series of longitudinal studies on marriage, divorce and remarriage) and The Binuclear Family Studies of 98 families have helped expand the literature on divorce. The Binuclear study was based on the findings from the Marin County Project and Virginia County Study.&lt;ref&gt;Ahrons, C. R. (2007). Family ties after divorce: Long-term implications for children. Family Process, 46(1), 53-65.&lt;/ref&gt; This research has been used to understand the [[implications of divorce]] on children later on in life.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Judith Wallerstein]], an influential psychologist's research on the effect of divorce (based on the Marin County Project), on children suggests that, "children with divorced parents often reach adulthood as psychologically troubled individuals who find it difficult to maintain satisfying relationships with others". A lot of quantitative research done by other scholars agrees with Wallerstein's conclusion. It has been shown that the children with divorced parents have an increased risk of: experiencing psychological problems, having troubled marriages, divorcing and having poor relationships with parents especially the father. Wallerstein, however, has a disputed 'extreme version' of her theory where she claims that the difference between the children with divorced and continuously married parents is dramatic and pervasive.

One such opponent of Wallerstein's extreme theory is Mavis Hetherington who argues that the negative effects of divorce on children have been exaggerated and that most children grow up without long-term harm. Hetherington's data showed that 25% of children with divorced parents reach adulthood with a serious social, emotional or psychological problem, compared to 10% of children with continuously married parents. 75% of the children grow up to be well-functioning adults.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Twenty years after the 98 families from the binuclear study were interviewed; the offspring from these families were interviewed. Eighty-five percent of the offspring were interviewed and out of those, 23% had completed postgraduate training, 33% had completed college, 31% had completed post-secondary training, 10% had received their high school diplomas and the majority (85%) of the interviewed children were employed.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, P. R. (2003). Reconciling divergent perspectives: Judith Wallerstein, quantitative family research, and children of divorce. Family Relations, 52(4), 332-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of motherhood==

===Contemporary theories surrounding motherhood===
[[Mothering]] is the social practice of nurturing and caring for dependent children. It is a dynamic process of social interactions and relationships. Mothering is typically associated with women since it is typically women who mother their children. However, "not all women mother, and mothering as nurturing and caring work is not inevitable the exclusive domain of women".&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arendell|first1=Terry|title=Conceiving and Investigating Motherhood: The Decade's Scholarship|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=November 2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=1192–1207|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.01192.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Mothering as a female role is a [[social construction]] that is highly influenced by gender belief systems. The roles associated with motherhood are variable across time and culture.&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"/&gt;

====Universalist approach====
The universalist approach to motherhood is aimed at conceptualizing the work that mothers do. This approach identifies mothers through what they do, rather than how they feel. Mothers share a set of activities known as "maternal practice", that are universal, even though they vary as individuals and across cultures. These activities include nurturing, protecting, and training their children. An individual's mothering actions are shaped by their beliefs about family, individuality, the nature of childhood, and the nature of their child. These are also often shaped by their own childhood and past experiences with children. The dynamic interactions between the mother and child create deep and meaningful connections.&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"/&gt;

====Particularistic approach====
The particularistic approach to mothering suggests that the role of a mother, their activities, and understandings cannot be separated from the context in which they live. According to this theory, mothering takes place within "''specific historical contexts framed by interlocking structures of race, class, and gender'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Patricia Hill|editor1-last=Bassin|editor1-first=Donna|editor2-last=Honey|editor2-first=Margaret|editor3-last=Kaplan|editor3-first=Meryle Mahrer|editor1-link=Representations of Motherhood|title=Shifting the Center: Race, Class, and Feminist Theorizing About Motherhood|date=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300068638|pages=56–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a mother's strategies and meanings that she develops are influenced by different social locations, such as the intersections of regional and local political economy with class, ethnicity, culture, and sexual preference.&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"/&gt;

===Conventional notions of motherhood===
Motherhood ideology is influenced by the idealization of the family structure and perpetuates the image of a heterosexual couple with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorne|first1=Barrie|editor1-last=Thorne|editor1-first=Barrie|editor2-last=Yalom|editor2-first=Marilyn|title=Rethinking the Family: Some Feminist Questions|date=1993|publisher=Longman|location=New York|isbn=0582282659|pages=3–30|edition=2nd|chapter=Feminism and the family: Two decades of thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sociologists refer to this as the "[[bourgeois]] family", which arose out of typical 16th- and 17th-century European households and is often considered the "traditional Western" structure. In this family model the father acts as the economic support and sometimes disciplinarian of the family, while the [[mother]] or other female relative oversees most of the child-rearing.

In [[East Asia]]n and [[Western world|Western]] traditional families, fathers were the heads of the families, which meant that his duties included providing financial support and making critical decisions, some of which must have been obeyed without question by the rest of the family members.  "Some Asian American men are brought up under stringent gender role expectations such as a focus on group harmony and filial piety, carrying on their family name and conforming to the expectations of the parents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=William M.|url=https://umdrive.memphis.edu/slease/public/ResearchTeam/ResearchReadings/Liu.pdf|title=Exploring the Lives of Asian American Men: Racial Identity, Male Role Norms, Gender Role Conflicts, and Prejudicial Attitudes|journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity|volume=3|number=2|pages=107–118|year=2002|doi=10.1037/1524-9220.3.2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother's role in the family is celebrated on [[Mother's Day]]. [[Anna Reeves Jarvis]] was a woman who originally organized Mother's Work Day's protesting the lack of cleanliness and sanitation in the work place.&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Ruth|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2217890/|title=Soap to ploughshares: How to return Mother's Day to its original meaning|work=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=West Virginia State Archives|url=http://www.wvculture.org/hiSTory/jarvis.html|title=Ann Maria Reeves Jarvis|work=WVA&amp;H West Virginia Archives &amp; History|publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History|year=2009|accessdate=25 September 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921030946/http://www.wvculture.org/history/jarvis.html|archivedate=21 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarvis died in 1905 and her daughter created a National Mother's Day to honor her mother.&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt; Mothers frequently have a very important role in raising offspring and the title can be given to a non-biological mother that fills this role. This is common in [[stepfamily|stepmothers]].

===Deviancy discourses===
There are many cultural contradictions and diverse arrangements and practices that challenge the intensive mothering ideology. However, they are considered deviant discourses since they do not conform to the script of full-time motherhood in the context of marriage. These include single mothers, welfare mothers, minority mothers, immigrant mothers, and lesbian mothers. These types of motherhood categories are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name="Investigating Motherhood 2000"/&gt; Furthermore, women who cannot or choose not to be mothers deal with many internal and external pressures.&lt;ref name="The Motherhood Mandate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russo|first1=Nancy Felipe|date=1976|title=The Motherhood Mandate|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=32|issue=3|pages=143–153|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1976.tb02603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motherhood Statistics===
In the United States, 82.5 million women are mothers of all ages, while the national average age of first child births is 25.1 years.  In 2008, 10% of births were to [[teenage pregnancy|teenage girls]], and 14% were to women ages 35 and older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Gretchen|last2=D'vera|first2=John|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1586/changing-demographic-characteristics-american-mothers|title=The New Demography of American Motherhood|publisher=Pew Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a study found that the average woman spends 5 years working and building a career before having children, and mothers working non-salary jobs began having children at age 27, compared to mothers with salary positions, who became pregnant at age 31.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goudreau|first=Jenna|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/01/family-career-working-mother-forbes-woman-time-best-age-to-have-children_2.html|title=When Should You Become a Mom|work=Forbes|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124045821/http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/01/family-career-working-mother-forbes-woman-time-best-age-to-have-children_2.html|archivedate=24 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study shows that the difference in age of child birth is related to education, since the longer a woman has been in school, the older she will be when she enters the workforce.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; 

==Sociology of fatherhood==
[[File:Vater mit Toechtern 03.jpg|thumb|Father with his two daughters in relationship]]
According to anthropologist [[Maurice Godelier]], a critical novelty in human society, compared to humans' closest biological relatives ([[chimpanzees]] and [[bonobos]]), is the parental role assumed by the males, which were unaware of their "father" connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Maurice|last=Godelier|authorlink=Maurice Godelier|title=Métamorphoses de la parenté|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goody|first=Jack|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=The Labyrinth of Kinship |publisher=New Left Review |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, especially traditional western, a father is usually the husband in a [[Marriage|married couple]]. Many times fathers have a very important role in raising offspring and the title can be given to a non-biological father that fills this role. This is common in [[stepfamily|stepfathers]] (males married to biological mothers).
In [[East Asia]]n and [[Western world|Western]] traditional families, fathers are the heads of the families, which means that their duties include providing financial support and making critical decisions, some of which must be obeyed without question by the rest of the family members.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

As with cultural concepts of family, the specifics of a father's role vary according to cultural [[Folkways (sociology)|folkways]]. In what some sociologists term the "[[bourgeois]] family", which arose out of typical 16th- and 17th-century European households, the father's role has been somewhat limited. In this family model the father acts as the economic support and sometimes disciplinarian of the family, while the [[mother]] or other female relative oversees most of the child-rearing. This structure is enforced, for example, in societies which legislate "[[maternity leave]]" but do not have a corresponding "[[paternity leave]]".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

However, this limited role has increasingly been called into question. Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care, and the male breadwinner role, and policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers, as a tool of changing gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bjørnholt | first1 = M. | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | last2 = | first2 = | year =2014 | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | url = http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295–315 | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science of parenting===
Described as 'the science of male parenting', the study of 'father craft' emerged principally in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the United States (but also throughout [[Europe]]) in the 1920s. "Male adjuncts to [[Maternity]] and Infant Welfare Centers – reacted to the maternal dominance in infant welfare and parenting in interwar Britain by arguing that fathers should play a crucial role in the upbringing of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Tim|doi=10.1111/j.0953-5233.2006.00388.x|title=Fatherhood and the British Fathercraft Movement, 1919-39|journal=Gender &amp; History|date=6 March 2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Were such a study to be conducted into the science of female parenting, it would be called mother craft.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The words 'ma ma' and 'mom', usually regarded as [[terms of endearment]] directed towards a mother figure, are generally one of the first words a child speaks. While 'da da' or 'dad' often precede it, this does not reflect a stronger bond between the father and child than that of the mother and child, it is merely simpler to pronounce than 'mummy' or 'mum' which require greater control over the mouth muscles.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Children tend to remember 'daddy' more because, according to research, they are more exciting to the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golinkoff|first=Roberta|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=54595|title=Baby Talk: Communicating with your child|date=2 October 2003|publisher=MedicineNet|accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary theories===
A number of studies have been given to the American public to determine how men view and define [[fatherhood]]. Specifically, studies have focused on why men choose to become fathers and the relationship between fatherhood and contemporary [[masculinity]]. Not surprisingly, recent research on fatherhood is framed by [[Social identity theory|identity theory]] and has focused on the salience, centrality, and importance of the father identity in men's lives, especially as it may be linked to men's involvement with their children. According to identity theory, the more salient and central the identity, the more likely individuals are to engage in behaviors associated with it. [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]] refers to the readiness to act out an identity in a particular situation. [[Centrality]] refers to the importance of an identity in relation to other identities. The centrality of the father identity is usually held at a higher level (as opposed to brother, husband, etc.) due to the gendered expectation that men must be "good" fathers. Men who view their role as a father central and crucial to who they are as a person are more likely to engage with their children and strive to participate in [[responsible fatherhood]]. Men who fail to successfully become fathers or are unable to have children view the lack of fatherhood as a threat to their masculinity. As a result, the threat to masculinity serves as a driving force for men to possibly become fathers because they never want to be seen as infertile or effeminate.&lt;ref name=Stryker1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stryker|first1=S.|last2=Serpe|first2=R.T.|year=1994|title=Identity salience and psychological centrality: Equivalent, overlapping, or complementary concepts? |journal=Social Psychological Quarterly|volume=57|pages=16–35|doi=10.2307/2786972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men who do not choose fatherhood===
Studies on men who choose not to be fathers often focus on how the role of fatherhood is crucial to masculinity and a man's central identity. Many men blame economic difficulties, cultural differences, and life situations as potential factors that deter them from fatherhood.&lt;ref name=Stryker1994/&gt;

Economic difficulties, see [[economic problem]], serve as a primary explanation for men to avoid fatherhood. For men, it is difficult to separate occupational success from fatherhood because financially providing for one's family has been central to the identity of being a father in the United States. As a result, a complex relationship is formed between economic struggles and the importance of fatherhood. Men who are not employed or have low earnings often feel as if they have failed as both fathers and men. On the other hand, men who have a low socioeconomic status find fatherhood very appealing because it gives them a measure of accomplishment denied to them by the occupational world.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In terms of the cultural importance of fatherhood, white men and men of color have differing views on fatherhood that can affect how many of these men participate in fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=N.|year=2002|title=The package deal: Marriage, work, and fatherhood in men's lives|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Temple University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, some men blame life situations as the primary factor for their decision not to pursue fatherhood. Life situations are defined as an individual's relationship status (single or married) and their age. Studies have shown that men who are older and married tend to be more likely to pursue fatherhood. It has been proposed that men continue to view [[marriage]], work and fatherhood as a "package deal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tichenor|first1=Veronica|first2=Julia|last2=Mcquillan|first3=Arthur L.|last3=Greil|first4=Raleigh|last4=Contreras|first5=Karina M.|last5=Shreffler|title=The Importance of Fatherhood to U.S. Married and Cohabiting Men|journal=Fathering: A Journal of Theory, Research, and Practice About Men As Fathers|volume=9|number=3|year=2011|pages=232–251|doi=10.3149/fth.0903.232}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that lacking one of these components, like work or marriage, may result in the decision not to have children.

It has also been proposed that married men feel as if they are expected to pursue fatherhood as a part of their marriage though they personally may not want to have children. On the other hand, men who are single and younger do not feel the same desire because they are not "prepared" to emotionally and financially support a child.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Alternate family forms==

The number of [[married couples]] raising children has decreased over the years. In Canada, married and [[common law]] couples with children under the age of 25 represented 44% of all families in 2001.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; This statistic has lowered since 1991, when married and common law couples raising children under the age of 25 represented 49 percent of all Canadian families.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; There are various family forms which are becoming increasingly popular in society.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===One-parent families===
In Canada, one parent families have become popular since 1961 when only 8.4 percent of children were being raised by a single parent.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; In 2001, 15.6 percent of children were being raised by  a single parent.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;  The number of single parent families continue to rise, while it is four times more likely that the mother is the parent raising the child. The high percentage of mothers becoming the sole parent is sometimes due to the result of a divorce, unplanned pregnancy or the inability to find a befitting partner.
Children who are raised by a single parent are commonly at a disadvantage due to the characteristics of parenting. A mother and father both make significant contributions to the development of a child, therefore one parent's ability to raise a child on her or his own may be hindered.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Cohabitation===
A residence containing an unmarried couple is called [[cohabitation]]. This type of family style is becoming increasingly accepted in Canada and has increased from 8% in 1981 to 16.4% in 2001.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; In Sweden and Nordic communities, this family form is quite common, with or without the inclusion of children. However, in various Catholic regions such as Italy, this is uncommon due to the religious aspects (See [[Catholic marriage]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Gay and lesbian couples===
Gay and Lesbian couples are categorized as same sex relationships. In 1989, Denmark was the first nation to allow same sex couples to get married and to provide equal rights to all citizens.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; After this many nations began to allow same sex marriages to occur such as Canada and Spain (2005).&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt; A United States Supreme Court ruling mandated that same sex marriage is constituational and therefore allowed in all 50 states in the United States (2015).

===Child-rearing by same-sex couples===
Children of same-sex couples either come from past relationships or through other opportunities like adoption or artificial insemination.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} From the data collected in the 2000 U.S. Census, it was suggested that more than 250,000 children in the United States were being raised by lesbian and gay couples.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 2010 U.S. Census, it was reported that 20% of lesbian and gay couple or partnership households are raising children (115,064 out of 594,000 same-sex households). The trend of child-rearing amongst gay and lesbian couples or partnerships is on the rise. Also, the support from the general public for gay and lesbian couples or partnerships to raising children is at its all-time high since the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1994, the idea of homosexual partnerships parenting children evenly divided Americans for support. When Americans were asked, "Do you think homosexual couples should or should not have the legal right to adopt a child", 28% of Americans said they should, and 65% said they shouldn't.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In 2003, the idea of homosexual partnerships parenting children evenly divided Americans for support. When Americans were asked the same question about the right of homosexual partnerships to raise children through adoption, 49% of Americans said they should, and 48% said they shouldn't.  In 2014, Americans were asked a very similar question. The results were almost more polarizing than the results found in 1994. Twenty years later, 63% of Americans said lesbian and gay couples or partnerships, and 35% said they shouldn't.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There are no federal laws prohibiting the adoption of a child by a homosexual couple or partnership.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} But there are some states, one being Florida, that depend on the opinions of the county judge in charge of the case, and county judges base their decisions on "the best interest of the child", in regards to child adoption by same-sex couple.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The "best interest of the child" seems to be the driving force behind the push back and reasoning for the remaining lack of support for homosexual couples or partnerships adopting or raising children. The central argument in the debate for legal rights, policies and overall support is related to the idea of same-sex couples raising children is the well-being of children raised in those families. There are concerns like about the mental, emotional and even the social development of children who are raised in same sex couple or partnership households. There has been a plethora of research conducted that provides insight into a range of issues, including the personal development, gender development, peer relationships, and family relationships of children with same-sex parents.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Research suggests that sexual identities (including gender identity, gender-role behavior, and sexual orientation) develop in much the same ways among children of lesbian mothers as they do among children of heterosexual parents.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Evidence also suggests that children of lesbian and gay parents have normal social relationships with peers and adults.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} There have also been studies of other aspects of personal development (including personality, self-concept, and conduct) that similarly reveal few differences between children of lesbian mothers and children of heterosexual parents.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These differences are not significant but are noticeable. For example, there was a study that examined and compared particular behaviors and ideas/belief performed by sons and daughters of lesbian mothers. Studies found that 53% of the daughters of lesbian mothers aspired to pursue careers as physicians, attorneys, and engineers compared with only 21% of the daughters of heterosexual mothers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The sons of lesbian mothers also tended to be less aggressive and more nurturing than the sons of heterosexual mothers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  The general concern about homosexual couples or partnerships parenting children doesn't have any grounds for their argument, "children who grow up with one or two gay and/or lesbian parents fare as well in emotional, cognitive, social, and sexual functioning as do children whose parents are heterosexual. Children's optimal development seems to be influenced more by the nature of the relationships and interactions within the family unit than by the particular structural form it takes."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Chosen or fictive kin===
{{main|fictive kin}}
Others who are not related by blood or marriage are variously called fictive kin, chosen kin, or voluntary kin.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=pHcADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of childhood==
The values learned during childhood are important in the development and socialization of children. The family is considered to be the agency of [[primary socialisation]] and the first [[focal socialisation agency]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===History===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
In the last two or three decades, the sociology of childhood has gained increasing attention and triggered numerous empirical studies as well as intensive theoretical disputes, starting in the Scandinavian and the English-speaking countries. Up to this time, sociology had approached children and childhood mainly from a socialization perspective, and the emergence of the new childhood sociological paradigm ran parallel to the feminist critique of sociological traditions. Childhood sociologists attacked the "adultocentric" approach and the "separative view" of sociology towards children. Not surprisingly, then, the key works in the sociology of childhood are quite interdisciplinary, linking [[history]], [[cultural studies]], [[ethnomethodology]], and [[pedagogy]]. Key texts include James and Prout's ''Constructing and Reconstructing Childhood'' (1990/1997), James, Jenks and Prout ''Theorizing Childhood'' (1998)and Prout's ''The Future of Childhood'' (2005). On methodological issues in research with children see ''Research with Children'', edited by Christensen and James (2008).

===Recent trends===
The current Sociology of childhood is organized around three central discussions:

'''The child as a social actor''': This approach derives from youth sociology as well as ethnography. Focusing on everyday life and the ways children orient themselves in society, it engages with the cultural performances and the social worlds they construct and take part in. Theory and research methodology approach children as active participants and members of society right from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Mackay1975"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mackay |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Mackay (sociologist) |year=1975 |chapter=Conceptions of children and models of socialization |editor=R.

Therefore, the sociology of childhood distinguishes itself from the established concepts of [[socialisation]]&lt;ref name="Cromdal2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cromdal |first=Jakob |authorlink=Jakob Cromdal |year=2006 |chapter=Socialization |editor=K. Brown |title=Encyclopedia of language and linguistics |location=North-Holland |publisher=Elsevier |pages=462–66 |doi=10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/00353-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; research and [[developmental psychology]] of the last decades.

'''The generational order''': The second approach centers on socio-structural and socio-theoretical questions concerning [[social equality]] and [[social order]] in a society, which categorizes their members by age and segregates them in many respects (rights, deeds, economical participation, ascribed needs etc.). These issues can be summarized under the overall concept of the '''generational order'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Conceptualising-Child-Adult-Relations/Alanen-Mayall/p/book/9780415231596|title=Conceptualising Child-Adult Relations (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the categorization of societal members by age is far from being an innocent representation of natural distinctions, but rather a social construction of such a "natural truth". It is, therefore, a relevant component of [[social order]] and deeply connected to other dimensions of social inequality.
Social and economic changes and socio-political interventions thus become central topics in childhood sociology. The analysis of these issues has increased awareness of the generational inequality of societies.

'''The Hybridity of Childhood''': This discussion is more critical (though not dismissive) of the social constructionist approaches that have dominated the sociology of childhood since the 1990s. More open to materialist perspectives, it seeks an interdisciplinary path that recognizes the biological as well as the social and cultural shaping of childhood and holds open the possibility of an interdisciplinary Childhood Studies emergent from current multi-disciplinary efforts. This scholarship has two important influences. Firstly, a so-called 'new wave' of childhood studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=K. W.|date=2011-12-20|title=The new wave of childhood studies: Breaking the grip of bio-social dualism?|url=http://chd.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0907568211427612|journal=Childhood|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=439–452|doi=10.1177/0907568211427612}}&lt;/ref&gt; heavily influenced by Alan Prout's (2005) seminal book ''The Future of Childhood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Future-of-Childhood/Prout/p/book/9780415256759|title=The Future of Childhood (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Prout examines how childhoods are not merely constructed socially – via discourses, laws or institutions – but materially, through toys, food and medicines. Since then, sociologists such as Nick Lee have offered important analyses of the ways in which the 'entanglements' between children and non-human materialities and technologies have become ever-more important to the governance and regulation of children's lives, through what he terms the 'biopoliticisation' of childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=N.|last2=Motzkau|first2=J.|date=2011-01-13|title=Navigating the bio-politics of childhood|url=http://chd.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0907568210371526|journal=Childhood|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=7–19|doi=10.1177/0907568210371526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, nonrepresentational approaches to [[Children's geographies]] have offered a commensurate and (arguably) broader series of approaches that move beyond social constructivism. Scholars such as Peter Kraftl, John Horton and Affrica Taylor have been particularly influential in examining how childhoods are produced and experienced through complex intersections of emotion, affect, embodiment and materiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraftl|first=Peter|date=2013-11-01|title=Beyond 'voice', beyond 'agency', beyond 'politics'?

Nevertheless, during the mid-2010s, a so-called 'spatial turn' in childhood and education studies saw increasing cross-fertilisation between these fields and the take-up of children's geographers' work by sociologists and others. Therefore, the prospects for cross-disciplinary scholarship around hybridity, spatiality and a 'new wave' remain very promising – perhaps most evident in a recent volume by Julie Seymour, Abigail Hackett and Lisa Procter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781137464972|title=Children's Spatialities - Embodiment, Emotion and {{!}} Julie Seymour {{!}} Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and childhood===

There has been much research and discussion about the effects of society on the assumption of gender roles in childhood, and how societal norms perpetuate gender-differentiated interactions with children. [[Psychologist]]s and [[sociology|sociologists]] suggest that [[gender identity|self-gender identity]] is a result of social learning from peers, [[role model]]ing within the family unit, and genetic predisposition.&lt;ref name="Raley"&gt;Raley, S., &amp; Bianchi S. (2006). Sons, Daughters, And Family Processes: Does Gender Of Children Matter? Annual Review of Sociology, 32(1), 401-21&lt;/ref&gt; The sociological implications are as follows:

'''Peer interactions''':

There are significant gender differences in the relationship styles among children which particularly begin to emerge after early childhood and at the onset of middle childhood around age 6 and grow more prevalent with age. Boys tend to play in larger groups than girls, and friends of boys are more likely to become friends with each other which, in turn leads to more density in social networks among boys. Boys also have more well-defined dominance hierarchies than girls within their peer groups. In terms of [[dyad (sociology)|dyadic relationships]], girls are more likely to have longer-lasting relationships of this nature, but no literature suggests that girls engage in more dyadic relationships than boys. Girls are also more [[prosocial behavior|prosocial]] in conflict situations and are better at collaborative work and play than boys. They also spend more time in social conversations than boys and are more likely to [[self-disclosure|self-disclose]] among their peers than boys. On the other hand, boys are more likely than girls to engage in organized play such as sports and activities with well-defined rules. One theory suggests that because of this, boys have more opportunities to exhibit their strength and skill and compare theirs to that of their peers during these competitive activities. Girls' peer groups are characterized by strong interpersonal relations, empathy for others, and working towards connection-oriented goals, while boys focus more on asserting their own [[dominance hierarchy|dominance]] in the peer group and agenda-oriented goals.&lt;ref name="Rose"/&gt;

Significant social differences also exist between boys and girls when experiencing and dealing with social stress. Boys experience more social stress among their peers than girls in the form of verbal and physical abuse, but girls experience more social stress through strains in their friendships and social networks. To deal with social stress, girls do more support-seeking, express more emotions to their friends, and [[rumination (psychology)|ruminate]] more than boys. Boys use humor as a distraction from stress and seek less emotional support within their friendships and social networks.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;Rose, Amanda J.; Rudolph, Karen D. (2006). "A Review of Sex Differences in Peer Relationship Processes: Potential Trade-offs for the Emotional and Behavioral Development of Girls and Boys".Psychological Bulletin, 132(1), 98-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family interactions''':

Overall, the literature implies that the biological gender of children affects how parents interact with them. Differentials in interaction range from the amount of time spent with children to how much parents invest financially in their children's futures. On average, [[father]]s tend to exhibit more differential treatment than [[mother]]s, and fathers tend to be more invested in families with sons than families with daughters in terms of both time and money. However, the association of gender with father investment has been weakening over the years, and the differentials are not large. Parents tend to enroll their daughters in more cultural activities than their sons (e.g. art classes, dance classes, and musical instrument lessons), and tend to be more invested in school-related parent involvement programs for their sons than their daughters.&lt;ref name="Raley"/&gt;

Sons and daughters are not only treated differently by their parents based on gender, but also receive different benefits from their parents based on gender. Parents, both fathers and mothers, may be less invested in their daughters' higher education than their sons' and tend to save more money on average in anticipation for their sons' enrollment in educational institutions after high school graduation. However, this may not lead to more academic or work success for sons later in life. Parents are also more likely to underestimate daughters' abilities in math and science while overestimating that of sons. Daughters also, on average, also do more housework than sons, which reflects [[occupational sexism|gendered divisions in the workplace]] and household in society.&lt;ref name="Raley"/&gt;

[[sibling|Sibling relations]], unlike parental relations, show no consensus in the literature about being gender-differentiated in interactions and benefits. However, sex-minority siblings may have more difficulty receiving necessary sex-specific treatment from parents.&lt;ref name="Raley"/&gt;

===Current tasks===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Questions about socialization practices and institutions remain central in childhood research. But, they are being dealt with in a new, more sociological way. To analyze socialization processes means, therefore, to reconstruct the historically and culturally varying conceptions, processes and institutions of [[discipline|disciplining]] and [[civilization]] of the offspring. In addition, the strategies of [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] formation and the practices of [[Social status|status]] (re-)production are considered. The sociology of social inequality and the sociology of the family and private life are, therefore, important fields for childhood sociologists. Children's own action, their resistance, cooperation, and collective action among [[peer group|peers]] has to be taken into account. Meanwhile, widespread anthropological assumptions concerning a universal human nature, based on a view of individual and society as opposed to each other, should be omitted from the conceptual repertoire of sociological [[childhood research]]. They are the legacy of the older socialization approach and they legitimate some forms of childhood and education practices as indispensable and even as a "natural" requirement of society, while devaluing others. In this way they generally legitimate western [[middle class]] childhood and mask [[Social inequality|inequality]] and the interests of [[social order]].

      <comment>The definition using wavelength does not give the same index as using frequency.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">In [[astronomy]], the '''spectral index''' of a source is a measure of the dependence of radiative flux density (that is, radiative flux per unit of frequency) on [[frequency]]. Given frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and [[radiative flux]] density &lt;math&gt;S_\nu&lt;/math&gt;, the spectral index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given implicitly by
:&lt;math&gt;S_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that if flux does not follow a [[power law]] in frequency, the spectral index itself is a function of frequency. Rearranging the above, we see that the spectral index is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \! \left( \nu \right) = \frac{\partial \log S_\nu \! \left( \nu \right)}{\partial \log \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly the power law can only apply over a certain range of frequency because otherwise the integral over all frequencies would be infinite.

Spectral index is also sometimes defined in terms of [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the spectral index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given implicitly by
:&lt;math&gt;S_\lambda\propto\lambda^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
and at a given frequency, spectral index may be calculated by taking the derivative
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \! \left( \lambda \right) =\frac{\partial \log S_\lambda \! \left( \lambda \right)}{\partial \log \lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;
The spectral index using the &lt;math&gt;S_\nu&lt;/math&gt;, which we may call &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\nu,&lt;/math&gt; differs from the index &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; defined using &lt;math&gt;S_\lambda.&lt;/math&gt; The total flux between two frequencies or wavelengths is
:&lt;math&gt;S=C_1(\nu_2^{\alpha_\nu+1}-\nu_1^{\alpha_\nu+1})=C_2(\lambda_2^{\alpha_\lambda+1}-\lambda_1^{\alpha_\lambda+1})=c^{\alpha_\lambda+1}C_2(\nu_2^{-\alpha_\lambda-1}-\nu_1^{-\alpha_\lambda-1})&lt;/math&gt;
which implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_\lambda=-\alpha_\nu-2.&lt;/math&gt;
The opposite sign convention is sometimes employed,&lt;ref&gt;Burke, B.F., Graham-Smith, F. (2009). ''An Introduction to Radio Astronomy, 3rd Ed.'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-87808-1}}, page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the spectral index is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

The spectral index of a source can hint at its properties. For example, using the positive sign convention, a spectral index of 0 to 2 at radio frequencies indicates [[thermal emission]], while a steep negative spectral index typically indicates [[synchrotron emission]].

==Spectral Index of Thermal emission==
At radio frequencies (i.e. in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit), where the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] is a good approximation to the spectrum of [[thermal radiation]], intensity is given by
:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) \simeq \frac{2 \nu^2 k T}{c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the logarithm of each side and taking the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\log \, \nu&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \log B_\nu(T)}{\partial \log \nu} \simeq 2.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the positive sign convention, the spectral index of thermal radiation is thus &lt;math&gt;\alpha \simeq 2&lt;/math&gt; in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. The spectral index departs from this value at shorter wavelengths, for which the Rayleigh-Jeans law becomes an increasingly inaccurate approximation, tending towards zero as intensity reaches a peak at a frequency given by [[Wien's_displacement_law#Frequency-dependent_formulation|Wien's displacement law]]. Because of the simple temperature-dependence of radiative flux in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime, the ''radio spectral index'' is defined implicitly by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Spectral Index |publisher=[[Wolfram Research]] |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/RadioSpectralIndex.html  |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \propto \nu^{\alpha} T.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2447">'''Symphorophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] in which [[sexual arousal]] involves staging and watching a [[tragedy]], such as a [[fire]] or a [[traffic accident]].

The term was coined by [[John Money]] in his 1984 paper ''Paraphilias: Phenomenology and classification'', formed from the Greek root "συμφορά" ("symphora", ''event, misfortune''):&lt;ref name = Money1984&gt;{{cite journal | last = Money | first = J | year = 1984 | title = Paraphilias: Phenomenology and classification  | authorlink = John Money | pmid = 6234812 | journal = [[American Journal of Psychotherapy]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A special form of sacrificial paraphilia, for which a suitable name is symphorophilia (being erotically turned on by accidents or catastrophes), culminates in an arranged disaster, such as an automobile crash. Like a game of Russian roulette, it may end in death &amp;mdash; alone or with the partner. However, flirting with disaster, rather than suicide and murder is the trigger responsible for autoerotic arousal and excitement. Being the daredevil who will live to risk a love-death again is an essential part of this paraphilia.

As a photographic print is the positive made from its negative, so also the positive of self-crashing is arranging for a disaster to occur on the highway, and then watching the carnage from a preselected observation post. Disasters other than on the highway may be arranged &amp;mdash; catastrophic fires, for example. For those members of the general public who have a touch of sadomasochism in them, disaster as an unrehearsed event is often a large part of the appeal of entertainment stunts and sports, from the circus to stock-car racing.}}

'''''The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors, and Architects''''' or '''''Le vite de' pittori, scultori et architetti moderni''''' is a series of artist biographies written by [[Gian Pietro Bellori]] (1613–96), whom [[Julius von Schlosser]] called "the most important historiographer of art not only of Rome, but all Italy, even of Europe, in the seventeenth century".&lt;ref name=Schlosser&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Schlosser|first1=Julius Ritter|title=Die Kunstliteratur: Ein Handbuch zur Quellenkunde der neueren Kunstgeschichte.|date=1924|publisher=Kunstverlag Anton Schroll &amp; Co.|location=Vienna|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Die_Kunstliteratur.html?id=RaQwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the foundational texts of the history and criticism of European art.&lt;ref name=Cropper/&gt;

The first edition (1672) contained biographies of nine painters ([[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Carracci]], [[Barocci]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Rubens]], [[Van Dyck]], [[Domenichino]], [[Lanfranco]], and [[Poussin]]), two sculptors ([[François Duquesnoy]] and [[Alessandro Algardi]]), and one architect ([[Domenico Fontana]]). The book was dedicated to [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and published with French financial support.&lt;ref name=Zirpolo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zirpolo|first1=Lilian|title=The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition by Giovan Pietro Bellori; Alice Sedgwick Wohl Review by: Lilian H.

==Preface==
The preface to the ''Lives'' is an essay Bellori delivered to the [[Accademia di San Luca]], [[Rome]] in 1664. The essay, entitled ''The Idea of the Painter, the Sculptor and the Architect'' (''L'idea del pittore, dello scultore, e dell'architetto'') contributed to a classicist reading of the ''Lives'', as opposed the a book about near-contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Cropper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cropper|first1=Elizabeth|title=Giovan Pietro Bellori, the Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition by Alice Sedgwick Wohl|journal=The Burlington Magazine|date=December 2006|volume=148|issue=1245|page=854|jstor=20074653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four basic theatrical forms either defined, implied, or derived by or from Aristotle: Tragedy; Comedy; Melodrama; and Drama.  Any number of styles can be used to convey these forms.

A good working definition of, "Style", is ''how'' something is done.  Theatrical styles are influenced by their time and place, artistic and other social structures, as well as the individual style of the particular artist or artists.  As theater is a mongrel art form, a production may or may not have stylistic integrity with regard to script, acting, direction, design, music, and venue.

==Styles==

There are a variety of '''theatrical styles''' used in theater/drama. These include

'''[[Naturalism (theater)|Naturalism]]'''
Portraying life on stage with a close attention to detail, based on observation of real life.  Cause and effect are central to the script's structure, with the subjects focused on conflicts of "nature vs. nurture", the natural order of things, survival, notions of evolution.  The production style is one of everyday reality.  

'''[[Theatrical realism|Realism]]'''
Portraying characters on stage that are close to real life, with realistic settings and staging.  Realism is an effort to satisfy all the theatrical conventions necessary to the production, but to do so in a way that seems to be "normal" life.

'''[[Expressionism]]'''
Anti-realistic in seeing appearance as distorted and the truth lying within man. The outward appearance on stage can be distorted and unrealistic to portray an eternal truth or internal emotional conflict.

'''[[Theater of the Absurd|Absurdity]]'''
Presents a perspective that all human attempts at significance are illogical. Ultimate truth is chaos with little certainty. There is no necessity that need drive us.

'''[[Epic Theatre]]'''
As devised by Bertolt Brecht, epic theatre forces audience members to constantly return to rational observation, rather than emotional immersion. Sudden bursts of song, elements of absurdity and breaches of the fourth wall are all prime examples of how this rational observation is constantly revitalized; this idea is known as Verfremdungseffekt.

'''[[Melodrama]]'''
As devised by early Greek dramatists, these styles rely on stock characters and stereotypes  to portray stories in an exaggerated way, either tragic or comic. Links to '''commedia dell'arte'''.

'''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]'''
As developed by Antonin Artaud, a style that encourages the shock and horror of the audience, through the excessive use of light and sound, instead of active entertainment or emotional relaxation.

'''[[Physical theatre]]'''
A modernist approach to theatre which centralises a performer's movement as the key communicator of a play's storytelling. 

'''[[Poor theatre]]'''
Developed by Jerzy Growotski, this genre believes in the stripping back of set, props, costume, light and sound to allow focus to be placed solely upon the actors, their characterisation and the underlying human relationships.

'''[[Immersive theatre]]'''
Developed by Augusto Boal, these styles all place focus on the audience member's individuality: their personal decisions, opinions and emotions, and how that impacts those of the characters onstage. The audience firmly exists within the 'world of the play'. Links to '''Promenade''' and '''Forum''' theatre.

[[Image:TurbidityStandards.jpg|right|frame|Turbidity standards of 5, 50, and 500 NTU]]
'''Turbidity''' is the cloudiness or [[haze|haziness]] of a [[fluid]] caused by large numbers of individual [[Particle (ecology)|particles]] that are generally invisible to the [[naked eye]], similar to [[smoke]] in [[air]]. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of [[water quality]].

[[Fluids]] can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the [[Settling|settable solids]]), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are [[colloid]]al. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.

'''Turbidity''' (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production, haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5° from the incoming light direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php Haze technical definition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822002852/http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php |date=August 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of [[phytoplankton]]. Human activities that disturb land, such as [[construction]], [[mining]] and [[agriculture]], can lead to high [[sediment]] levels entering water bodies during rain storms due to [[storm water]] [[surface runoff|runoff]]. Areas prone to high bank erosion rates as well as [[urbanized]] areas also contribute large amounts of turbidity to nearby waters, through stormwater [[water pollution|pollution]] from [[Pavement (material)|paved]] surfaces such as roads, bridges and parking lots.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/urbanmm/index.html "National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Urban Areas."] Chapters 7 and 8. Document No. EPA 841-B-05-004. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some industries such as [[quarry]]ing, [[coal mine|mining]] and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles.

In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop [[gastrointestinal diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Mann, C.C. Tam, C.D. Higgins, &amp; L.C. Lodrigues. (2007). The association between drinking water turbidity and gastrointestinal illness: a systematic review. ''BMC Public Health''. 7(256): 1 - 7&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially problematic for immunocompromised people, because contaminants like [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]] can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with [[chlorine]] because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet (UV) sterilization]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civilengineerbuddy.com/turbidity-water-its-measurment-environmental-engineering/|title=Turbidity of water and its measurment &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; – disinfection not possible without removing suspended particles|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In water bodies such as [[lake]]s, rivers and [[reservoirs]], high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]]. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This phenomenon has been regularly observed throughout the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm "Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Chesapeake Bay Program. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx "Sediments."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073649/http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many [[mangrove]] areas, high turbidity is needed in order to support certain species, such as to protect juvenile fish from predators. For most mangroves along the eastern coast of [[Australia]], in particular [[Moreton Bay]], turbidity levels as high as 600 [[Nephelometer|Nephelometric]] Turbidity Units (NTU) are needed for proper [[ecosystem]] health.

==Measurement==
[[Image:Runoff torbidity.jpg|thumb|right|Turbid creek water caused by heavy rains.]]

The most widely used measurement unit for turbidity is the [[Formazine|Formazin]] Turbidity Unit (FTU). [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] refers to its units as FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Units). [[ISO 7027]] provides the method in water quality for the determination of turbidity. It is used to determine the [[concentration]] of suspended particles in a sample of water by measuring the incident light scattered at right angles from the sample. The scattered light is captured by a [[photodiode]], which produces an electronic signal that is converted to a turbidity. [[Open source hardware]] has been developed following the ISO 7027 method to measure turbidity reliably using an [[Arduino]] microcontroller and inexpensive [[LED]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bas Wijnen, G. C. Anzalone and Joshua M. Pearce, Open-source mobile water quality testing platform. Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4(3) pp. 532–537 (2014). doi:10.2166/washdev.2014.137 [https://www.academia.edu/8319858/Open-source_mobile_water_quality_testing_platform open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several practical ways of checking water quality, the most direct being some measure of [[attenuation]] (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or '''JTU''') is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the water. Of course water alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a column of water should be calibrated and reported in JTUs.

The propensity of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them is now considered a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a [[nephelometer]] with the detector set up to the side of the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are lots of small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units ('''NTU'''). To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) is somewhat unusual for each location or situation.

Turbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and the ocean can be measured using a [[Secchi disk]]. This black and white disk is lowered into the water until it can no longer be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The Secchi disk has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the [[euphotic zone]] with a 3-fold division of the ''Secchi depth'', however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom.

An additional device, which may help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2013}}Waterwatch Australia, Module 4 - physical and chemical parameters [https://web.archive.org/web/20060513024523/http://www.waterwatch.org.au/publications/module4/turbidity.html "Methods Turbidity"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myre, E, Shaw, R. The Turbidity Tube: Simple and Accurate Measurement of Turbidity in the Field. [http://watsanmissionassistant.wikispaces.com/file/view/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf/360203097/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf "The Turbidity Tube"]&lt;/ref&gt; The turbidity tube condenses water in a graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the Secchi disk.

Turbidity in air, which causes solar attenuation, is used as a measure of pollution. To model the attenuation of beam irradiance, several turbidity parameters have been introduced, including the Linke turbidity factor (T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;HelioClim (Center for Energy and Processes). Paris, France.

==Standards and test methods==
[[File:Turbidimeters.JPG|thumb|[[Turbidimeter]]s used at a water purification plant to measure turbidity (in NTU) of raw water and clear water after filtration.]]

===Drinking water standards===
Governments have set standards on the allowable turbidity in drinking water. In the United States, systems that use conventional or direct filtration methods turbidity cannot be higher than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at the plant outlet and all samples for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU for at least 95 percent of the samples in any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTU. Many drinking water utilities strive to achieve levels as low as 0.1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/index.html#3 "Drinking Water Contaminants."] 2009-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The European standards for turbidity state that it must be no more than 4 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/standards.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]], establishes that the turbidity of drinking water should not be more than 5 NTU, and should ideally be below 1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenntech.com/turbidity.htm#ixzz3R3yPreK7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambient water standards===
The U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has published water quality criteria for turbidity.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/criteria/goldbook.pdf "Quality Criteria for Water."] (Commonly known as the "Gold Book.") 1986. Document No. EPA-440/5-86-001.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are scientific assessments of the effects of turbidity, which are used by states to develop [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] for water bodies. (States may also publish their own criteria.) Some states have [[Promulgation|promulgated]] water quality standards for turbidity, including:
* [[Louisiana]]. 25, 50 or 150 NTU, or background plus 10 percent, depending on the water body.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Baton Rouge, LA.[http://epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/la/la_6_wqs.pdf "Surface Water Quality Standards."] ''Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC).'' Title 33, Part IX, Chapter 11. August 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Vermont]]. 10 NTU or 25 NTU, depending on water body classification.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Water Resources Board. Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf "Vermont Water Quality Standards."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231093748/http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf |date=2013-12-31 }} January 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. 5 NTU over background (when background is 50 NTU or less), or 10 percent increase when background is over 50 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA.[http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/wa/wa_10_chapter173-201a.pdf "Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the State of Washington."] ''Washington Administrative Code (WAC).'' Chapter 173-201A. November 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical methods===
Published analytical test methods for turbidity include:

==Treatment==
'''Turbidity''' is commonly treated using either a settling or filtration process. Depending on the application, chemical reagents will be dosed into the wastewater stream to increase the effectiveness of the settling or filtration process. [[Potable water]] treatment and municipal wastewater plants often remove turbidity with a combination of sand filtration, settling tanks, and clarifiers.

[[In-situ water treatment]] or direct dosing for the treatment of turbidity is common when the affected water bodies are dispersed (i.e. there are numerous water bodies spread out over a geographical area, such as small drinking water reservoirs), when the problem is not consistent (i.e. when there is turbidity in a water body only during and after the wet season) or when a low cost solution is required. In-situ treatment of turbidity involves the addition of a reagent, generally a [[flocculant]], evenly dispensed over the surface of the body of water. The flocs then settle at the bottom of the water body where they remain or are removed when the water body is drained. This method is commonly used at [[coal mine]]s and coal loading facilities where stormwater collection ponds have seasonal issues with turbidity. A number of companies offer portable treatment systems for in-situ water treatment or direct dosing of reagents.

===Reagents===
There are a number of [[chemical reagent]]s that are available for treating turbidity. Reagents available for treating turbidity include [[aluminium sulfate]] or [[alum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[ferric chloride]] (FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), poly-[[aluminium chloride]], long chain [[acrylamide]]-based [[polymer]]s and numerous proprietary reagents.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Systems, Clear Solutions newsletter - Focus on Turbidity [http://www.earthsystems.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ClearSolutions_No1_2003.pdf] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The water chemistry must be carefully considered when chemical dosing as some reagents, such as alum, will alter the [[pH]] of the water.

The dosing process must also be considered when using reagents as the [[Flocculation|flocs]] may be broken apart by excessive mixing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4770">A '''vacuum furnace''' is a type of [[furnace]] in which the product in the furnace is surrounded by a [[vacuum]] during processing. The absence of air or other gases prevents [[Redox|oxidation]], heat loss from the product through [[convection]], and removes a source of contamination. This enables the furnace to heat materials (typically metals and ceramics) to temperatures as high as {{Convert|3000|C|F|0|lk=on}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mrf-furnaces.com/vacuum-furnaces/|title=Vacuum Furnaces - Materials Research Furnaces, Inc.|newspaper=Materials Research Furnaces, Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; with select materials. Maximum furnace temperatures and vacuum levels depend on [[Melting points of the elements (data page)|melting points]] and [[Vapor pressures of the elements (data page)|vapor pressures]] of heated materials. Vacuum furnaces are used to carry out processes such as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], [[brazing]], [[sintering]] and [[heat treatment]] with high consistency and low contamination.

Characteristics of a vacuum furnace are:

* Uniform temperatures in the range. {{Convert|800-3000|C|lk=on|sigfig=2}}
* Commercially available vacuum pumping systems can reach vacuum levels as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; Torr. (1 Torr = 1.333 millibar)
* Temperature can be controlled within a heated zone, typically surrounded by heat shielding or insulation.
* Low contamination of the product by carbon, [[oxygen]] and other gases.
* Vacuum pumping systems remove low temperature by-products from the process materials during heating, resulting in a higher purity end product.
* Quick cooling ([[quenching]]) of product can be used to shorten process cycle times.
* The process can be computer controlled to ensure repeatability.

Heating metals to high temperatures in open to atmosphere normally causes rapid [[oxidation]], which is undesirable. A vacuum furnace removes the oxygen and prevents this from happening.

An [[inert gas]], such as [[Argon]], is often used to quickly cool the treated metals back to non-metallurgical levels (below {{Convert|400|F|disp=sqbr|sigfig=1}}) after the desired process in the furnace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imp.mtu.edu/metallic/vacuum_furnace.html|title=Vacuum Furnace at IMP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inert gas can be pressurized to two times atmosphere or more, then circulated through the hot zone area to pick up heat before passing through a [[heat exchanger]] to remove heat. This process continues until the desired temperature is reached.

==Common uses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Vacuum furnaces are used in a wide range of applications in both production industries and research laboratories.

At temperatures below 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, a vacuum furnace is commonly used for the heat treatment of [[steel]] alloys. Many general heat treating applications involve the hardening and tempering of a steel part to make it strong and tough through service. Hardening involves heating the steel to a predetermined temperature, then cooling it rapidly.

A further application for vacuum furnaces is Vacuum [[Carburizing]] also known as Low Pressure Carburizing or LPC. In this process, a gas (such as acetylene) is introduced as a partial pressure into the hot zone at temperatures typically between {{Convert|1600|and|1950|F}}. The gas disassociates into its constituent elements (in this case carbon and hydrogen). The carbon is then diffused into the surface area of the part. This function is typically repeated, varying the duration of gas input and diffusion time. Once the workload is properly "cased", the metal is quenched using oil or high pressure gas (HPGQ). For HPGQ, nitrogen or, for faster quench helium, is commonly used. This process is also known as [[case hardening]].

Another low temperature application of vacuum furnaces is debinding, a process for the removal of binders. Heat is applied under a vacuum in a sealed chamber, melting or vaporizing the binder from the [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]]. The binder is evacuated by the pumping system and collected or purged downstream. The material with a higher melting point is left behind in a purified state and can be further processed.

Vacuum furnaces capable of temperatures above 1200&amp;nbsp;°C are used in various industry sectors such as electronics, medical, crystal growth, energy and artificial gems. The processing of high temperature materials, both of metals and nonmetals, in a vacuum environment allows [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], [[brazing]], [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purification]], [[sintering]] and other processes to take place in a controlled manner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19751">'''Women in geology''' concerns the history and contributions of [[Woman|women]] to the field of [[geology]]. There has been a long history of women in the field, but they have tended to be under-represented. In the era before the eighteenth century, science and geological science had not been as formalized as they would become later. Hence early geologists tended to be informal observers and collectors, whether they were male or female. Notable examples of this period include [[Hildegard of Bingen]] who wrote works concerning stones and [[Barbara Uthmann]] who supervised her husband's mining operations after his death. Mrs. Uthmann was also a relative of [[Georg Agricola]]. In addition to these names varied aristocratic women had scientific collections of rocks or minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kölbl-Ebert|first1=M.|title=On the origin of women geologists by means of social selection: German and British comparison|journal=Episodes|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=3|pages=182&amp;ndash;193|url=http://www.episodes.org/index.php/epi/article/view/62654/48865|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century a new professional class of geologists emerged that included women. In this period the British tended to have far more women of significance to geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creese|first1=Mary R. S.|last2=Creese|first2=Thomas M.|title=British women who contributed to research in the geological sciences in the nineteenth century|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=5 January 2009|volume=27|issue=01|page=23|doi=10.1017/S0007087400031654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the [[Association for Women Geoscientists]] was formed to support women in this field as they remained under-represented. There have been advances since then although retention remains a problem.

'''Young Lives''' is an international research project on childhood poverty that was established in 2000 and is coordinated by a team based at the [[University of Oxford]]'s Department of International Development (Queen Elizabeth House), [[Great Britain]].

Young Lives, by its declaration, is tracing the changing lives of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam over a 15-year period. This is the time frame set by the UN to assess progress towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Through interviews, group work and case studies with the children, their parents, teachers, community representatives and others, the project is collecting information not only about their material and social circumstances, but also their perspectives on their lives and aspirations for the futures, set against the environmental and social realities of their communities.

Young Lives is following two groups of children in each country:
* 2,000 children who were born in 2001-02
* 1,000 children who were born in 1994-95.

These groups provide insights into every phase of childhood. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves. When this is matched with information gathered about their parents, it is possible to reveal much about the inter generational transmission of poverty, how families on the margins move in and out of poverty, and the policies that can make a real difference to their lives.

The research concentrates on 4 countries: [[Ethiopia]], [[India]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]), [[Peru]] and [[Vietnam]], chosen because they reflect a wide range of cultural, political, geographical and social contexts. They face some of the common issues experienced by developing countries, such as high debt burden, post-conflict reconstruction and adverse environmental conditions such as drought and flood. By covering these countries, Young Lives aims to reveal patterns, commonalities and differences in four very different contexts where childhood - especially childhood poverty - is changing.

The project is core-funded by the UK [[Department for International Development]] (DFID), with sub-studies funded by [[International Development Research Center]] (IDRC) (in [[Ethiopia]]), [[UNICEF]] (in [[India]]), [[Irish Aid]] (in Vietnam) and the [[Bernard van Leer Foundation]] (in [[India]] and [[Peru]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=904&amp;sitesectiontitle=Young+Lives Centre for Longitudinal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declared objectives ==
* provide good-quality information about the lives of children in different contexts;
* identify ways poverty affects children’s lives and their future prospects;
* better understand how poverty is transferred from one generation to another;
* trace linkages between key policy changes and children’s well-being;
* promote effective and sustainable poverty reduction policies;
* build capacity for and understanding of longitudinal research in the four study countries.
