'''Anjumani-shuara''' (Persian - "Poets council") was a literary council of the 19th century in [[Azerbaijan]].
It was first held by Sheykhali khan Kangarli in 1831 in [[Ordubad]]. From 1870-80 the council was led by Haji agha Fagir Ordubadi. Later this mission was obliged to Mohammad Taghi Sidgi. The council’s activity operated with different intervals and there were lots of well-known writers and poets. After the death of Fagir and shifting of Sidgi in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] the council was weakened and suspended its activities in 1890-1895.&lt;ref&gt;http://azerbaijans.com/content_1787_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artmedia''' was one of the first scientific projects concerning the relationship between art, technology, philosophy and [[aesthetics]]. It was founded in 1985 at the [[University of Salerno]]. For over two decades, until 2009, dozens of projects, studies, exhibitions and conferences on new technologies&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the ten international "Artmedia" conferences, which took place in Salerno and Paris from 1985 to 2008, the Laboratory has led to numerous other initiatives and events, such as "L'immaginario tecnologico", 1984 (conference and exhibition); "Technettronica", 1989 (Exhibition about the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e antropologia", 1983 (International Symposium); "Tecnologie e forme nell'arte e nella scienza", 2003 (International Symposium); "New Technologies: Roy Ascott, Maurizio Bolognini, Fred Forest, Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos", Museo del Sannio, 2003 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e tecnologia", 1987 (Symposium); "L'immateriale in piazza" (Aitiani, Forest, Mitropoulos, Grossi, Prado), Naples, 1992 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Un'estetica per i media" 1989 (RAI, Dipartimento Scuola Educazione, TV program); "Cartacarbone", 1990 (radio program); "Coincidences", 1995 (Aesthetics journal, in French); "Epiphaneia", 1995-1996 (Aesthetics journal, in Italian). See ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; made Artmedia a reference point for many internationally renowned scholars and artists,&lt;ref&gt;A. R., ''Des hauts et débats. Colloque Artmedia VIII'', "Liberation", November 29, 2002, p. 13; ''Dossier: De l’esthétique de la communication au Net Art'', "Art Press", 285, November 2002, pp. 37-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the growing cultural interest in the aesthetics of [[New media|media]], the aesthetics of [[Computer network|networks]], and their [[ethical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] implications.

==Beginnings and international events==
Since the late 1970s, a permanent ''Seminar of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication'' has been directed by its founder [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] at the University of Salerno. The basic principles of the aesthetics of technological communication were identified and conceptualized in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the "aesthetics of communication", especially upon its debut in the 1980s, is recorded in the book by Mario Costa,''The Aesthetics of Communication. Aesthetic use of simultaneity at a distance'', Rome, Castelvecchi, 1999; its basic principles, formulated by Costa, were expressed for the first time in ''News and Notes'', published by the International Center of Aesthetic Communication, Salerno, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A conference on "Technological Imaginary", held in 1984 at the Museo del Sannio in [[Benevento]], discussed the issue of the new relationship between art and technology and the consequent need to re-evaluate aesthetics, warning that "all our future existence will be played at the crossroads between technology and imaginary".&lt;ref&gt;"Aa. Vv., ''L’immaginario tecnologico'', Museo del Sannio, Benevento, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comprehensive relationship between art and [[technoscience]], technology, and philosophy has also been the theoretical subject of the ten international "Artmedia" conferences which were held in Salerno and Paris between 1985 and 2008. Particularly relevant were conferences held in Paris between 2002 and 2008, which took place at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]], the [[Bibliotheque Nationale de France]] (BNF) and the Institut National d'Histoire de l 'Art (INHA), with the partnership of the Société Française d'Esthétique, the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[Universidade de São Paulo]], the [[Sorbonne University|Université de Paris 1 Sorbonne]], and the U.S. magazine [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]].&lt;ref&gt;See Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan, and ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous debate between artists and theorists==

Artmedia wanted to gather theorists and artists from all over the world and encourage both joint and complementary work, beginning with the need to give attention to theoretical and artistic practices and developing both together. These also contributed towards spreading the spirit of the project, both in a number of festivals and shows, and through their own artworks and research.&lt;ref&gt;Antonella Fimiani, ''Arte &amp; tecnologia, la frontiera-Salerno'', in "Il Mattino", November 24, 1999, p. 23; Sylvie Lisiecki e Marie Saladin, ''Fenetrês sur les arts numériques'', in "Croniques de la Bibliothèque Nationale de France", 46, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists who worked with Artmedia and participated in its activities included [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[René Berger]], [[Abraham Moles]], [[Derrick De Kerckhove]], [[Pierre Levy]], Gillo Dorfles, [[Paul Virilio]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Roger Malina]], Daniel Charles, José Jiménez, Anne Cauquelin, [[Edgar Morin]], [[Thierry de Duve]], [[Catherine Millet]], Filiberto Menna, Andreas Broeckmann, Rudolf zur Lippe, [[Edmond Couchot]], Dominique Chateau, Yannick Geffroy, Philippe Queau, Arlindo Machado, Tetsuo Kogawa, and Bernard Teyssedre.

Artists included [[Fred Forest]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Takahiko Iimura]], [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [[Tom Klinkowstein]], Tom Sherman, [[Eduardo Kac]], Enzo Minarelli, [[James Dashow]], [[Peter D'Agostino]], Mit Mitropoulos, [[Shawn Brixey]], Bruno Di Bello, [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Orlan]], Kit Galloway, [[David Rokeby]], [[Miguel Chevalier]], [[Norman White]], Richard Kriesche, Olivier Auber, [[Caterina Davinio]] and [[Casey Reas]].&lt;ref&gt;On the participation of artists and theorists, see in particular: Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan; Mario Costa (ed.) (2004), ''New Technologies: [[Roy Ascott]], Maurizio Bolognini, [[Fred Forest]], Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos'', Salerno: Artmedia, Museo del Sannio; ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002, pp. 21-245; ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002; see also the OLATS/Leonardo websites: http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2002/mono_index.php and http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2008/mono_index.php .&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions raised in various projects promoted by Artmedia, in a continuous dialogue between artists and theorists, led to discussions on topics including ''Aesthetics of Communication and the anthropology of the future'' (1985), ''Global aesthetic communication'' (1986), ''Electronic performativity and the art system'' (1990), ''Neo-technological arts between aesthetics and communication'' (1992), ''Aesthetic research and technology'' (1995), ''Developments in aesthetics: change or mutation?'' (1999), ''From the Aesthetics of Communication to Net art'' (2002), and ''Ethics, aesthetics and techno-communication. The future of meaning'' (2008).

All Artmedia symposiums have been followed by many publications. For the two held in Paris, a complete video recording is also available, and can be viewed at the [[Institut National de l'Audiovisuel]].

An assessment of 25 years of Artmedia activity was made into a seminar on ''The aesthetic object of the future'', held at the [[University of Salerno]] in 2009. The Artmedia project produced a large number of publications and documents that are being catalogued, with a view to their proper placement and use.

The '''Carthage Treasure''' is a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] silver hoard, which was found in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], at the site of the ancient city of [[Carthage]]. The treasure principally consists of silver tableware and jewellery, most of which is now held at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=31013&amp;plaA=31013-3-2 British Museum Collection], British Museum, retrieved April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The hoard was unearthed in the nineteenth century at the Hill of St Louis in Carthage, which at the time of its deposition was the largest city of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsulare]].&lt;ref name=bowl/&gt;  Most of the treasure was purchased by Sir [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]], a senior curator at the British Museum, who bequeathed it to the museum upon his death in 1897. However, a small part of the treasure can be found in the [[Louvre]], including one of the silver covered bowls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=9434 Louvre Collection], Louvre Collection, retrieved April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and attribution==
[[Image:Carthage (2).JPG|thumb|A bowl with low relief scenes of shepherds]]
Dating to the second half of the fourth century AD, the Carthage Treasure comprises 31 different objects, primarily luxury silver tableware and jewellery that must have belonged to a wealthy Roman family who for some reason decided to [[hoard|bury it for safe-keeping]]. This may have been because of the religious feud around the year 400 but it is more likely that the treasure was hidden from the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals, led by [[Gaiseric]], invaded Africa Proconsulare from Spain in 429 and in 439 the city [[Battle of Carthage (439)|became]] capital of the [[Vandal Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=caygill&gt;{{cite book|last=Caygill|first=Marjorie|title=The British Museum A&amp;ndash;Z Companion|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135968942|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1135968942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscribed in the centre of one of the dishes around the [[tondo (art)|tondo]] is D D ICRESCONI CLARENT, which is associated with the Cresconii, a powerful Roman North African family in Carthage&lt;ref name=bowl&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/b/bowl_from_the_carthage_treasur.aspx Bowl from the Carthage Treasure], Highlights, British Museum, retrieved 3 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; who are well known from deeds and records of office-holders at this time.

==Description of the treasure==

The treasure includes a pair of flat dishes (one of which identifies the family), two bowls with chased and hammered pastoral scenes in relief around the edge,&lt;ref name=bowl /&gt; four hemispherical [[bowl]]s with high tapering feet (two of which still have their covers), a shallow bowl with handle and [[frog]] engraved in the centre, twelve silver spoons, and a mixed collection of [[jewellery]]: a finger ring, a cameo, a pair of ear rings, several [[Engraved gem|intaglios]] and two necklaces, one made of gold, the other with precious stones.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; The jewelled necklace consists of twelve polygonal emeralds, thirteen sapphires, matched by twenty five pearls all joined by gold links.&lt;ref name=arc&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofearly00britiala/catalogueofearly00britiala_djvu.txt ''Catalogue of early Christian antiquities and objects from the Christian East in the Department of British and mediaeval antiquities and ethnography of the British museum''], [[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|O. M. Dalton]], 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

The family would have owned two collections of silver: One known as ''argentum potorium'' that was the drinking set and another for eating called the ''argentum escarium''. Amongst this find were several silver hemispherical lidded bowls that measure 12&amp;nbsp;cm high and 12&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The vessels' elegant design includes a tall base that complements the knop of the bowl's lid. The bowls also incorporate subtle [[facet]]s on the lids' curved surfaces.&lt;ref name=coveredbowl /&gt; Similar bowls have been found at the Roman site of [[Viminacium]] near the modern town of [[Kostolac]] in Serbia.&lt;ref name=coveredbowl&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/silver-bowl-from-the-carthage-treasure/dwGIZejwDjWdNQ Silver bowl from the Carthage Treasure], British Museum, retrieved 10 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as Camposanto Nuovo, to distinguish it from Camposanto Vecchio, which is now known as [[Cemetery of the 366 Fossae, Naples|Cemetery of the 366 Fossae]]. It is delimited by the Largo Santa Maria del Pianto, Via del Riposo, Via Santa Maria del Pianto, and via nuova [[Poggioreale (Naples)|Poggioreale]], and is built upon the ruins of [[Alfonso II of Naples|Alphonso II]]'s [[Poggio Reale (villa)|Villa Poggio Reale]].

==History==
Until the 18th century most funeral monuments were located inside churches, closer to the divine air, and where they could either buy a generation of prayer, or at least be entombed within earshot of genuflecting masses, so as to be lifted into heaven by their overhead chants. As churches became crowded with tombs, this open air monumental cemetery allowed noble families to build private chapels and crypts in a slightly more secular location, on the southern side of the hill of [[Poggioreale (Naples)|Poggioreale]]. The cemetery was begun during the Napoleonic occupation, and remodelled in 1836-1837.

The layout is that of a garden. At the upper end is a [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]] church with a ''Pieta'' by [[Gennaro Cali]], in its tribune; and behind a large oblong square, surrounded by a portico of fluted Doric columns, out of which open 102 proprietary chapels, beneath each of which are the family vaults of the owners. The colossal, nondenominational figure of ''Religion'' in the centre of the quadrangle is by [[Tito Angelini]]. Most of the vaults are occupied by subscription to confraternities, or burial clubs.&lt;ref&gt;**{{cite book | first= John |last=Murray (Firm)| year=1878| title=A handbook for travellers in southern Italy| editor = | pages=  140–141| publisher= John Murray, London| id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KWUPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=Cemetery+of+Poggioreale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RIfhknuRQ_&amp;sig=2M5pCWqqioPNjzTGXU4R6TUnP5E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B19uUPjHB6nkywGIp4DwCQ&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Cemetery%20of%20Poggioreale&amp;f=false| authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who cannot afford to pay for their own graves are interred without coffins in another part of the grounds, as in the "Cemetery of the 366 Fossae"; but as the fee is small, not more than half-a-dozen bodies are deposited during the three days each pit remains open. At the southwest extremity is a space set aside for notable Neapolitans: a ''Quadrato degli uomini illustri'' (Quadrangle for illustrious men). Also adjacent are 19th-century Protestant and Jewish cemeteries of Naples.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; CrimethInc. emerged in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; initially as the hardcore  [[zine]] ''[[Inside Front]]'', and began operating as a collective in 1996.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Stacy |title=Punk Productions: Unfinished Business |publisher=SUNY Press |pages=109 |location=Albany |year=2004 |isbn=0-7914-6187-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since published widely read articles and zines for the anarcho-communist movement and distributed posters and books of its own publication.&lt;ref name=brandt&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandt |first=Jed |url=http://burning.typepad.com/burningman/2006/03/crimethinc_is_i.html |title=Crimethinc: In Love With Love Itself |work=[[Clamor (magazine)|Clamor]] |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5eW0gRYrS?url=http://burning.typepad.com/burningman/2006/03/crimethinc_is_i.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CrimethInc. cells have published books, released records, and organized national campaigns against globalization and representative democracy in favor of radical community organizing. Less public splinter groups have carried out direct action (including arson and [[hacktivism]]), hosted international conventions and other events, maintained local chapters, sparked riots, and toured with multimedia performance art or hardcore [[anarcho-punk]] musical ensembles. The collective has received national media and academic attention, as well as criticism and praise from other anarchists for its activities and philosophy. CrimethInc. has an association with the North American anarcho-punk scene due to its relationship with artists in the genre and its publishing of ''Inside Front'' as well as, more recently, the contemporary anti-capitalist movement.

CrimethInc. is connected to publishing collectives/organizations with similar ideas, notably the [[Curious George Brigade]], which has written a number of publications including ''Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs''. In 2005, they began publishing a half-gloss journal, ''Rolling Thunder'', with the byline "An Anarchist Journal of Dangerous Living", which released its eighth issue in 2009.

Since the summer of 2002, CrimethInc. has hosted annual conventions, termed "convergences", open to anyone. Typically featuring the performances of traveling theatrical troupes, musicians, direct-action and [[mutual aid (politics)|mutual-aid]] workshops from individual participants, the few-days-long camping trips have attracted coverage in newspaper articles,&lt;ref name=gouss/&gt; initiated multiple [[Reclaim the Streets]] actions, mobilized large [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] events, and catalyzed many other activities.&lt;ref name=ao7/&gt;

The 2007 convergence in [[Athens, Ohio]], saw an impromptu [[street party]] which resulted in arrests on minor charges.&lt;ref name=gouss&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Athens News'' characterized the convergence as "a sort of networking, resume-swapping opportunity for would-be radicals, free-thinkers, [[Levellers]], [[Diggers]], [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddites]] and other assorted malcontents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.athensnews.com/news/local/good-going-you-left-town-for-the-summer-and-missed/article_fbdcc78d-64dd-5cff-b2e0-8d368406181a.html |title=Good going; you left town for the summer and missed everything |publisher=The Athens News |accessdate=2008-02-25 |last=Phillips |first=Jim |date=2007-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical of these gatherings to require that all attendees have something to contribute to the momentum: whether it is bringing food or equipment to share, leading a discussion group, or providing materials with which to write to [[political prisoner]]s. There has been a pattern of promoting convergences as festivals, reminiscent of barnstorming [[flying circus]]es and travelling sideshows.&lt;ref name=ao7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2007073009151431 |title=Athens, Ohio: Police attack Crimethinc conference |work=Infoshop News |publisher=[[Infoshop.org]] |accessdate=2008-04-28 |date=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523102836/http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2007073009151431 |archivedate=2011-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' journalist Matthew Power described the 2006 convergence in [[Winona, Minnesota]] as follows:
{{quote|text=Several hundred young anarchists from around the country had train-hopped and hitchhiked there to attend the annual event known as the CrimethInc Convergence...Grimy and feral-looking, the CrimethInc kids squatted in small groups around a clearing....[they] were in the middle of several days of self-organized workshops, seminars, and discussions, ranging from the [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist banking]] theories of the nineteenth-century anarchist philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], to an introductory practicum on lock-picking, to a class on making one's own menstrual pads .... CrimethInc's adherents had come together there because they wanted to live their lives as some sort of solution. They saw 'the revolution' not as a final product but as an ongoing process; they wanted not just to destroy the capitalist system but to create something livable in its place.&lt;ref name="harper's"/&gt;|sign=Matthew Power|source=''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', March 2008}}

These convergences have been hosted by different groups within the collective each time, typically based on the initiative of local enthusiasts. Every year a different set of policy requests is released from locals in the field, typically encouraging a sober, consensus-based space in which no financial transactions are made. The one firm rule has been "No police informants," a regulation which has been ignored by the [[FBI]]. Information gathered by FBI informants at CrimethInc. convergences (in 2004, 2005, and 2008) contributed to the convictions of [[Eric McDavid]] and his associates, as well as [[2008 Republican National Convention]] protester Matthew DePalma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/41070787.html?elr=KArks:DCiUtEia_nDaycUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607063219/http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/41070787.html?elr=KArks%3ADCiUtEia_nDaycUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUU |date=2011-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Conventions/story?id=5718900&amp;page=1 |title=Michigan Man Accused of RNC Molotov Cocktail Plot |author=ABC News |work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.kovr.viacomlocalnetworks.com/~kovr/affidavit.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111192140/http://static.kovr.viacomlocalnetworks.com/~kovr/affidavit.pdf |title=Confidential Source "Anna"-issued affidavit |accessdate=2008-07-21 |format=[[.pdf]] |work=United States District Court Eastern District of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, CrimethInc. announced the ''We Are Everywhere'' campaign of national tours and events in lieu of the traditional convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2010/06/03/august-2010-we-are-everywhere/ |title=August 2010: We Are Everywhere - CrimethInc.

=== Music ===

CrimethInc. is associated with the [[North America]]n [[anarcho-punk]] scene because of its long relationship with notable musicians in the genre and its publishing of ''Inside Front'', a "journal of hardcore punk and anarchist action".&lt;ref name="thompson-music"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Stacy |title=Punk Productions: Unfinished Business |publisher=SUNY Press |pages=109 |location=Albany |year=2004 |isbn=0-7914-6187-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CrimethInc. releases include LPs, CDs, and 7"s from North American and European anarcho-punk, hardcore and [[anti-folk]] bands. Academic Stacy Thompson has described CrimethInc. as "exemplary of a more contemporary and nuanced approach" to the possible forms anarcho-punk could take to resist commodification through aesthetic expression.&lt;ref name="thompson-music"/&gt; However, Thompson does not consider the aesthetic choices of the collective to be substantially different from the anarcho- and [[crust punk]] bands released by fellow anarcho-punk collective ''[[Profane Existence]]'' in the mid-to-late 90s.&lt;ref name="thompson-music"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:CrimethInc. - eclipse the past.png|thumb|140px|"Eclipse the past" inside front cover image from CrimethInc.'s ''Days of War, Nights of Love'' (2001). A philosophical theme of CrimethInc.'s writings is the rejection of the "exclusive, anti-[[subjectivity|subjective]]" nature of history, and the need to take active control of one's own life.]]

CrimethInc as a loose association represents a variety of political views; the CrimethInc.

CrimethInc. is influenced by the [[Situationist International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lang |first=Daniel |date=May 2007 |title="Give Us the Dumpsters -Or- Give Us Life": Res Derilictae and the Trash of Free Trade |journal=Cultural Recycling |volume=3 |issue=1 |publisher=[[Other Voices (open-access journal of cultural criticism)|Other Voices]] |url=http://www.othervoices.org/3.1/dlang/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described by scholar Martin Puchner as "inheritors of the political [[avant-garde]]",&lt;ref&gt;Puchner, Martin (2005).

[[Princeton University Press]], Princeton and Oxford. 320pp., {{ISBN|978-0-691-12260-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Knabb]] has criticized CrimethInc. for presenting simplistic and in some cases false accounts of history in their manifesto ''Days of War, Nights of Love'', and for mythologizing themselves as "a pole of international subversion".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For their part, the authors of the book criticized the "exclusive, anti-[[subjectivity|subjective]]" nature of history as "paralyzing", advocating in its place a non-superstitious myth.&lt;ref&gt;''Days of War, Nights of Love'' (2001) , {{ISBN|0-9709101-0-X}}, p. 111–114&lt;/ref&gt; The collective has expressed a strident anti-copyright stance and advocacy of the appropriation of texts and ideas of others, which has attracted criticism from academic philosopher George MacDonald Ross as an endorsement of plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=George |last=MacDonald Ross |title=Plagiarism really is a crime:a counterblast against anarchists and postmodernists (and others) |booktitle=Plagiarism: Prevention, Practice and Policies 2004 Conference |date=2004-05-10 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228450982_Plagiarism_really_is_a_crime_a_counterblast_against_anarchists_and_postmodernists_and_others |accessdate=2008-04-07 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; CrimethInc.'s N©!

The active participants of CrimethInc. characterize it as a mindset and a way of life first and foremost, rather than as an organization ''per se''.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; Its main goal is to inspire people to take more active control of their own lives, becoming producers of culture and history instead of passive consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Summerisle |title=Times of Hate, Times of Joy, Lost Highway, Volume 1 |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4116-6506-4 |publisher=Lulu |location=Morrisville, NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimethinc.com/about/ |title=About CWC: Index |work=Crimethinc.com |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who ascribe to the CrimethInc. philosophy advocate radical ways of living one's life to the end of eliminating the perceived inequities and tyrannies within society. Contributors to publications are generally not credited in respect of an anonymity asserted by participants to be one of the organization's primary values.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; The name "CrimethInc." itself is a satirical self-criticism about the hypocrisy of revolutionary propaganda (and other "margin-walking between contradictions"&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimethinc.com/about/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2007-10-31 |work=Crimethinc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a direct reference to the concept of "[[thoughtcrime]]" developed in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">A '''cultural manager''' ({{lang-es|'''gestor cultural'''}}) is a person who is motivated by the improvement of [[art]], works independently and professionally with knowledge of the subject, and develops work as a mediator between governmental and/or private cultural institutions with artists from different areas to articulate their work in the market with promotion and national and international dissemination.&lt;ref name=uoc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gestiocultural.blogs.uoc.edu/2016/06/28/que-es-un-gestor-cultural-gestion-cultural/ |title=¿Qué es un gestor cultural? |trans-title=What is a Cultural Manager? |publisher=[[Open University of Catalonia]] |language=Spanish |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural manager works by looking for specific measures of success, always intending to improve the level of culture, seeking active cohesion between society, the governmental sector, the private sector, and the artists. The work of culture management poses learning challenges in diverse areas such as the administration of economic resources, training, and artistic communication.&lt;ref name=uoc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.educaweb.com/profesion/gestor-cultural-334/ |title=Gestor cultural |publisher=Educaweb |language=Spanish |access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural management is a new profession. A person who is dedicated to this work is characterized by having abilities to visualize and interpret talent, knowing how to establish a dialogue with artists to link them to cultural projects to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hHxeCA_ecYC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Gestión cultural: Entre conceptos lejanos y realidades cercanas |trans-title=Cultural Management: Between Distant Concepts and Nearby Realities |chapter=Acercando realidades a través de la gestión cultural |trans-chapter=Bringing Together Realities Through Cultural Management |first1=Silvia |last1=Aballay |first2=Carla Fernanda |last2=Avendaño Manelli |publisher=Eduvim |isbn=9789871518968 |pages=13-16 |language=Spanish |year=2010 |access-date=18 April 2018 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''D.O.A.''' is a Canadian [[punk rock]] band from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. They are often referred to as the "founders" of [[hardcore punk]] along with [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Angry Samoans]], the [[Germs (band)|Germs]], [[Negative Trend]], and [[Middle Class (band)|Middle Class]]. Their second album ''[[Hardcore '81]]'' was thought by many&lt;ref&gt;Zach Baron, October 25, 2006, [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38721/Various_Artists_American_Hardcore_The_History_of_American_Punk_Ro Pitchfork Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228155326/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38721/Various_Artists_American_Hardcore_The_History_of_American_Punk_Ro |date=2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to have been the first actual reference to the second wave of the American punk sound as [[hardcore punk|hardcore]].

Singer/guitarist [[Joey Keithley|Joey "Shithead" Keithley]] is the only founding member to have stayed in the band throughout its entire history, with original bassist [[Randy Rampage]] returning to the band twice after his original departure. D.O.A. has often released music on [[Jello Biafra]]'s [[Alternative Tentacles]] Records, and they have released an album titled ''[[Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors]]''.

D.O.A. is known for its outspoken political opinions and has a history of performing for many causes and benefits. Its slogan is "Talk Minus Action Equals Zero." The band's lyrics and imagery frequently advocate [[anti-racism]], [[anti-globalization]], [[freedom of speech]], and [[environmentalism]].

Founder Joe Keithley is also the founder of [[Sudden Death Records]] which has released music by D.O.A. and several other bands including [[Pointed Sticks]] and [[Young Canadians]].

== History ==

===Formation and early years (1977–1980)===
D.O.A. has its origins in [[The Skulls (Canadian band)|The Skulls]], an early Vancouver-area punk rock band that included future D.O.A members Joey "Shithead" Keithley, Brian "[[Wimpy Roy]]" Goble, and Ken "Dimwit" Montgomery.

When the Skulls broke up after an ill-fated move to [[Toronto]], Keithley moved back to Vancouver and formed D.O.A. in early 1978 with himself on guitar, Dimwit's brother [[Chuck Biscuits]] on drums, [[Randy Rampage]] on bass, and a lead singer known only as "Harry Homo", who suggested the band's name. The band's first gig took place at the Japanese Hall in Vancouver on February 20 of that year, after which Harry Homo was sacked for an apparent lack of rhythm; Keithley then became the band's singer. A second guitarist named "Randy Romance" played briefly with the band in March 1978 before leaving.

The band began playing frequently around Vancouver and added guitarist [[Brad Kent]] the following June. That summer, they recorded and self-released their first single, the four-song EP ''Disco Sucks''. The single soon topped the charts of the [[University of San Francisco]] radio station [[KUSF (defunct)|KUSF]], which prompted the band to begin touring down to [[San Francisco]]. They played their first shows there in August 1978 at [[Mabuhay Gardens]]. It was during this trip that the band first met [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman and future collaborator [[Jello Biafra]]. Kent was fired from the band in September and later that fall the band recorded and released their second single ''The Prisoner''.

In May 1979, the band embarked on their first North American tour. Upon its completion they hired Vancouver journalist and activist Ken Lester as their manager. Lester booked another tour for them the following October, in the middle of which they flew back to Vancouver to open for [[The Clash]] at the [[Pacific Coliseum]]. They soon after released their third single, ''World War 3/Whatcha Gonna Do?''.

In late 1979, they added second guitarist Dave Gregg. Soon after, Biscuits and Rampage left the band after a disastrous gig at the [[University of British Columbia]]'s Student Union Building and were replaced by Andy Graffiti and Simon "Stubby Pecker" Wilde on drums and bass, respectively. Keithley soon became dissatisfied with the band's performances with the new lineup, however, and Biscuits and Rampage both rejoined the band in March 1980.

D.O.A. released their full-length debut ''[[Something Better Change]]'' on Friends Records in 1980 and continued touring the United States and Canada extensively.

===Hardcore 81 and further lineup changes (1981–1989)===
On April 22, 1981 the band released their second album ''[[Hardcore '81]]''; the record's title and its extensive North American promotional tour is sometimes credited with popularizing the term "[[hardcore punk]]".

Randy Rampage was fired from the band on January 1, 1982 and was replaced by ex-Skulls drummer Dimwit on bass. After a short tour of California, Chuck Biscuits left the band and joined [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]. Dimwit switched back to drums and [[Subhumans (Canadian band)|Subhumans]] singer [[Brian Roy Goble|Wimpy Roy]] was hired as the new bass player and second singer, leaving Keithley as the only remaining original member.&lt;ref name="Ish"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joey |last=Keithley |title=I, Shithead: A life in punk |publisher=Arsenal Pulp Press|year=2003|pages=107–111 |isbn=1-55152-148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lineup would last from 1982–1983 and later 1985-1986 and produced several notable releases, including the EP ''[[War on 45]]'' (now expanded into a full-length album).  ''War on 45'' found the band expanding their sound with touches of funk and reggae, as well as making their anti-war and anti-imperialist political stance more clear.

1985's ''Let's Wreck The Party'' and 1987's ''True (North) Strong And Free'' saw the band taking on a more mainstream, hard-rock oriented production, but without watering down the band's political lyrical focus.  Meanwhile, the band's lineup changes continued after ''Let's Wreck the Party'', with Dimwit replaced by [[Kerr Belliveau]]. Belliveau stayed only three weeks with the band but recorded the ''Expo Hurts Everyone'' 7" as well as two songs for ''True (North) Strong and Free'' before being replaced by [[Jon Card]] from [[Personality Crisis (band)|Personality Crisis]]. Dave Gregg quit in 1988 after D.O.A. fired their manager Ken Lester, to which he was very close. The band hired Chris Prohom from the [[Dayglo Abortions]] as a replacement.&lt;ref name="Ish2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joey |last=Keithley |title=I, Shithead: A life in punk |publisher=Arsenal Pulp Press|year=2003|pages=202|isbn=1-55152-148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First breakup and reunion (1990–2002)===
1990's ''Murder'' featured rawer, almost thrash-metal production, rather than their original basic punk sound.  The same year also produced a collaboration with [[Dead Kennedys]] singer [[Jello Biafra]] with ''[[Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors]]''. In August 1990, Joey decided he was breaking up D.O.A. but, at the suggestion of promoter [[Dirk Dirksen]], they did a farewell tour of the West Coast, playing their "final" show on December 1, 1990 at the Commodore in Vancouver. In 1991, they released a posthumous live album entitled ''Talk Minus Action = 0'' while Keithley pursued an acting career.&lt;ref name="Ish3"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joey |last=Keithley |title=I, Shithead: A life in punk |publisher=Arsenal Pulp Press|year=2003|pages=219–224|isbn=1-55152-148-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19 months after D.O.A. broke up, Joey Shithead and Wimpy Roy had reunited as D.O.A in the summer of 1992. Fellow Canadian punk rock veteran [[John Wright (musician)|John Wright]] from [[NoMeansNo]] suggested they hire [[Ken Jensen]] from [[Red Tide (band)|Red Tide]] as the new drummer, which they did.&lt;ref name="Ish3"/&gt;  The new lineup released an EP and two albums in the early 1990s, ''[[13 Flavours Of Doom]]'' and ''Loggerheads''.  These albums found the band replacing the more hard-rock oriented sound of the 1980s with a return to punk rock, although it was a heavier, tighter brand of punk than their earlier work.  These albums were produced by Wright, who also played keyboards on the recordings. The band then added [[Ford Pier]] on guitar and vocals.

Tragedy struck in 1995 when drummer Ken Jensen died in a house fire. The "Ken Jensen Memorial Single" EP was released on Alternative Tentacles, including two tracks each from D.O.A. and Red Tide.  With John Wright filling in on drums, ninth full-length ''The Black Spot'' was recorded.  The album featured a more basic, sing-along type punk rock sound that was reminiscent of the band's late 1970s and early 1980s output.

The late 1990s found the band's lineup in turmoil, with Wimpy Roy leaving the band after a decade and a half of service.  Keithley experimented with different bassists and drummers and released the album ''Festival Of Atheists'' in 1998. By the early 2000s, the band had found a permanent drummer in the form of The Great Baldini. In 2002, Keithley put out his first solo album, ''Beat Trash'', and original bassist Randy Rampage returned to the band after nearly 20 years for the ''Win The Battle'' album. However, the reunion did not last, with Rampage leaving the band again after the recording of the album, to be replaced by Dan Yaremko.

''The Lost Tapes'' was the first release on Keithley's revived Sudden Death label, followed by ''Festival Of Atheists''.  During this period, Keithley also oversaw the re-release of the band's classic early records on Sudden Death, several of which had been out of print for many years.

===Later years and second hiatus (2003–2013)===
In 2003, Vancouver Mayor [[Larry Campbell]] declared December 21 to be "D.O.A. Day" in honour of the band's 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article-69929/d-o-a-s-punk-veterans-won-t-give-up-the-fight|title=D.O.A.'s punk veterans won't give up the fight|accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=The Georgia Straight|first=John|last=Lucas}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the same year, the band released a career-spanning retrospective entitled ''War And Peace''. 2004 found the band releasing the ska-flavoured ''Live Free or Die''. In 2006, Randy Rampage rejoined D.O.A. for his 3rd stint in the band.

The lineup remained stable until 2008, when The Great Baldini left the band to be replaced by new drummer James Hayden.  Also in 2008, it was announced that [[Bob Rock]], of [[Metallica]] fame would be producing the band's next album in time for their 30th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/27566|title=D.O.A. recording with Bob Rock|website=Punknews.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Hayden quit before D.O.A. started to record to be replaced by [[Floor Tom Jones]]  In September 2008, D.O.A. released ''Northern Avenger'' and embarked on their 30th anniversary tour.  On the eve of the tour, it was announced that Randy Rampage was being replaced by Dan Yaremko once again.

D.O.A. played several dates in the summer of 2009 as part of the Van's Warped Tour 2009.

On May 1, 2010, D.O.A. released their fourteenth full-length album ''Talk Minus Action = Zero'' (a similarly titled live album ''Talk Minus Action Equals Zero'' had previously been released in 1990). Drummer Jesse Pinner (of the band [[Raised by Apes]]) took the place of Floor Tom Jones beginning on D.O.A.'s subsequent August 2010 tour due to Floor Tom Jones' commitments to his job at [[Canada Post]].&lt;ref name="raised"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=22342223&amp;blogId=538222802 |title="Pincher is going across canada with punkrock legends D.O.A." on the "Raised by Apes" blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Joe announced that he would be seeking nomination as an NDP candidate in the B.C. provincial election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/punk-rocker-runs-for-ndp-nomination/article4496440/|title=Punk rocker runs for NDP nomination|accessdate=16 August 2018|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, D.O.A. announced an indefinite hiatus, and began their farewell tour on January 18, 2013 in celebration of the band's thirty-five year anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveatrickshaw.com/224/doas-farewell-show/|title=Rickshaw Theatre - Shows|website=Liveatrickshaw.com|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second reunion and recent activity (2014–present)===
On September 22, 2014, Keithley officially announced on the Sudden Death Records website that he had decided to reform the band with Paddy Duddy on drums and Mike "Maggot" Hodsall on bass, and would be embarking on a Canadian tour in October in support of the recently released live album, ''Welcome To Chinatown''. This lineup recorded and released the studio album ''Hard Rain Falling'' in 2015. In April 2016, the band released a new version of "Fucked Up Ronnie" entitled "Fucked Up Donald" (referring to the 2016 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nominee [[Donald Trump]]) as a single.

Bull's album Face was released in December 2011.  The 12-track album includes ten brand new songs as well as the 2010 tracks ''America'' and ''John Lennon''. The album focuses on topics such as medical recovery, war, love, [[Asperger's syndrome]], alcoholism, and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://itsdanbull.com/faq |title=FAQ |publisher=itsdanbull.com |date= |accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady '''Edith Blake''' (7 February 1846 – 18 April 1926) was an Irish [[botany|botanical]] illustrator and writer, noted for her work on the flora and fauna of countries such as The Bahamas, Jamaica and Ceylon.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Frances|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=Blake, Lady Edith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Edith Blake was born Edith Bernal Osborne on 7 February 1846 in [[Newtown Anner House]], near [[Clonmel]], County Tipperary. Though her date of birth is often cited at 1845. She was the eldest daughter of [[Catherine Isabella Osborne]] and [[Ralph Bernal Osborne]], who took his wife's surname following their marriage in 1844. The Osbornes appear to have become estranged early in their marriage, with her father living in London, seeing Edith and her Grace raised by her mother alone. Mrs Osbourne was a talented artist, and encouraged both her daughters to take up artistic pursuits.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; Artists often stayed at Newtown Anner, including [[Thomas Shotter Boys]] and [[Alexandre Calame]], and it is possible the sisters received tuition from them.&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Edith Blake (1845–1928)|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/art-nature-imaging/collections/art-themes/drawingconclusions/more/lifecycle_more_info.htm|website=Natural History Museum London|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edith developed an interest in botany around this time, corresponding over the years with Newtown Anner's garden designer [[Joseph Paxton]]. [[Fanny Currey]] was a frequent visitor to the house, with the pair collaborating on illustrating envelopes from 1858 to 1868.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

In 1874 she married widower and [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] sub-inspector [[Henry Arthur Blake]]. As her parents did not approve of the marriage and had been arranging a suitable marriage for her, the couple eloped.&lt;ref name=NHM /&gt; Following the marriage, Edith was disinherited. They were sheltered for a time by friends [[Richard Bagwell|Richard]] and [[Harriet Bagwell]] of Marlfield House. The couple went on to have two sons and a daughter. They first moved to [[Belfast]], seeing Henry appointed [[resident magistrate]] (RM) in 1876 and a "special RM" during the land war. When he received assassination threats, Edith would travel with him armed with a gun. Despite her husband's work, Blake was sympathetic to romantic nationalism and became friends with [[Anna Catherine Parnell|Anna Parnell]].&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

==Illustration and writing==
Blake toured Europe in 1872, visiting Austria, (Germany), Italy, Sicily, Greece, and Turkey. During these visits she took sketches of the local architecture, art, and culture which she published in her first book ''Twelve months in southern Europe'' (1876). Blake's second publication was ''The realities of Freemasonry'' in 1879. Blake's husband received his first appointment in the British colonial service in 1884, as governor of The Bahamas 1884 to 1887, followed by [[Newfoundland]] 1887 to 1888, Jamaica 1889 to 1897, Hong Kong 1898 to 1903, and Ceylon 1903 to 1907. Blake travelled with him, and rather than entertaining the local English expatriate community, she focused on her time on botany and painting. She studied local flora and fauna in watercolour, which she painted from nature. These were exhibited at the [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Museum of Science and Art, Dublin]] in 1894. 196 of her studies of the life stages of Jamaican [[lepidoptera]] are in the entomology library of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London, and more of her work is held by the [[National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)|National Botanic Gardens, Dublin]]. It is said that whilst in the Bahamas she was painted with a pet snake wrapped around her waist.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

Blake produced landscapes, and painted the opening of the 1888 Newfoundland Placentia Railway. She contributed to a number of English and American scientific journals, and was heavily involved in the development of the countries the couple lived in. The National Museum of the Native American in New York holds her collection of over a 100 Native American artefacts from the Bahamas. She was an accomplished linguist, speaking 9 languages including Irish, Russian, and Chinese.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; The couple's three children were painted by [[Winslow Homer]] in Arabian dress.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|title=The girl in the painting|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-girl-in-the-painting-2303618.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=The Independent|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Blake opened a Buddhist nunnery which was named in her honour in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Paul|title=Buddhism: Buddhism in South and Southeast Asia|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=9780415332330|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Queen|first1=Christopher S.|last2=King|first2=Sallie B.|title=Engaged Buddhism: Buddhist Liberation Movements in Asia|date=1996|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=9780791428436|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Upon Henry's retirement in 1907, the Blakes returned to Ireland. They settled in [[Myrtle Grove, Youghal]], County Cork, where many of Blakes sketchbooks are still held. The staircase was decorated by her with botanical illustrations. As Lady Blake she published 3 plays: ''Samhain's eve'', ''The quest of Edain'', and ''The swan'', all adapted from Irish mythology.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; Following her husband's death in 1918, Blake lived as a near recluse wearing widows weeds, but continued to paint.&lt;ref name=NHM /&gt; She died in Myrtle Grove on 18 April 1926.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; The couple are buried in the garden of the house.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;

Her collection in Natural History Museum, London was conserved in 1984 and are noted for their scientific value.&lt;ref name=NHM /&gt;

'''En plein air''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ plɛn ɛːʁ}}, [[French language|French]] for outdoors, or '''plein air painting''') is the act of [[painting]] outdoors. This method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules that might create a predetermined look.

== History ==
[[File:Sargent MonetPainting.jpg|thumb|''[[Claude Monet]] Painting by the Edge of a Wood'' (1885) by [[John Singer Sargent]]. Oil on canvas. 54.0 &amp;times; 64.8&amp;nbsp;cm. [[Tate Gallery]], London.]]
Artists have long painted outdoors, but in the mid-19th century, working in natural light became particularly important to the [[Barbizon school]], [[Hudson River School]], and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].

In 1830, the Barbizon School in France, inspired by [[John Constable]], enabled artists like Charles-François Daubigny and Théodore Rousseau to more accurately depict the appearance of outdoor settings in various light and weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Auricchio | first=Laura | date=October 2004 | title=The Transformation of Landscape Painting in France | journal=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | url= https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/lafr/hd_lafr.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1800s, the en plein air approach was incorporated with the impressionists’ style, and artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Frédéric Bazille]], and [[Edgar Degas]] began creating their work outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Malafronte | first=Allison | date=October 2009 | title=The History of the Plein Air Movement | journal=American Artist | pages=20–24 | url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/43929615/history-plein-air-movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; From France, the movement expanded to America, starting in California then moving to other American locales notable for their natural light qualities, including the Hudson River Valley in New York.

The [[Macchiaioli]] were a group of Italian painters active in Tuscany in the second half of the nineteenth century, who, breaking with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, did much of their painting outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and colour. This practice relates the Macchiaioli to the French Impressionists who came to prominence a few years later, although the Macchiaioli pursued somewhat different purposes. Their movement began in Florence in the late 1850s.

The [[Newlyn School]] in England is considered another major proponent of the technique in the latter 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/newlyn-school.htm |title=Newlyn School, Landscape Painting Artist Colony, Cornwall: History, Artists, Stanhope Forbes, Frank Bramley |publisher=Visual-arts-cork.com |date= |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of painting ''en plein air'' increased in the 1840s with the introduction of paints in tubes (like those for [[toothpaste]]). Previously, painters made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry [[pigment]] powders with [[linseed oil]].

The act of outdoor painting from observation has been continually popular well into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/06/05/1309330/artists-who-work-en-plein-air.html |title=Artists who work 'en plein air' share their motivations: Arts |publisher=adn.com |date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808223036/http://www.adn.com/2010/06/05/1309330/artists-who-work-en-plein-air.html |archivedate=8 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/landscapes/a/plein_air_paint.htm |title=Plein Air Painting - Painting Outside Plein Air |publisher=Painting.about.com |date=16 August 2010|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment and challenges ==
[[File:Robert Antoine Pinchon, 1898, painting Le chemin, oil on canvas, 22 x 32 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], 1898, painting ''Le chemin'', oil on canvas, 22 × 32 cm]]
It was during the mid-19th century that the ''box easel'', typically known as the ''French box easel'' or [[Easel#field|''field easel'']], was invented. It is uncertain who developed it, but these highly portable easels with telescopic legs and built-in paint box and [[Palette (painting)|palette]] made it easier to go into the forest and up the hillsides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Invention of box/ Field easel|url = http://artmovement.weebly.com/invention-of-box-field-easel.html|website = Realism &amp; Impressionism|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still made today, they remain a popular choice (even for home use) since they fold up to the size of a [[brief case]] and thus are easy to store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pleinair/ |title=Plein Air |publisher=PBS |date=6 August 2007|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pochade Box is a compact box that allows the artist to keep all their supplies and palette within the box and have the work on the inside of the lid. Some designs allow for a larger canvas which can be held by clamps built into the lid. There are designs which can also hold a few wet painting canvases or panels within the lid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dickblick.com/pochade/boxes/ ''Pochade Boxes'']&lt;/ref&gt; These boxes have a rising popularity as while they are mainly used for plein air painting, can also be used in the studio, home, or classroom. Since pochade boxes are mainly used for painting on location, the canvas or work surface may be small, usually not more than 20 inches (50&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pochade box|url=http://www.artworkessentials.com|website=Artwork Essentials|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges include the type of paint used to paint outdoors, animals, bugs, onlookers, and environmental conditions such as weather. [[Acrylic paint]] may harden and dry quickly in warm, sunny weather and it cannot be reused. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the challenge of painting in moist or damp conditions with precipitation. The advent of plein air painting predated the invention of acrylics. The traditional and well-established method of painting ''en plein air'' incorporates the use of oil paint.

== Advocates ==
French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painters such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] advocated plein air painting, and much of their work was done outdoors in the diffuse light of a large white umbrella. Claude Monet was an avid en plein air artist who deduced that to seize the closeness and likeness of an outside setting at a specific moment one had to be outside to do so rather than just paint an outside setting in their studio.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F. S., ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages (15th ed.), Boston, Cengage Learning, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in Russia, painters such as [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Valentin Serov]], [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[I. E. Grabar]] were known for painting ''en plein air''.

But enthusiasts of plein air painting were not limited to the [[Old World]]. [[American Impressionism|American impressionists]] too, such as those of the [[Old Lyme]] school, were avid painters ''en plein air''. American impressionist painters noted for this style during this era included [[Guy Rose]], [[Robert William Wood]], Mary DeNeale Morgan, John Gamble, and [[Arthur Hill Gilbert]]. In Canada, the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] and [[Tom Thomson]] are examples of ''en plein air'' advocates.

'''FACT''' ('''Foundation for Art &amp; Creative Technology''') is a [[new media art]]s centre based on ''Wood Street'' in [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. FACT hosts art projects and exhibitions as well as being a cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/liverpools-arts-hub-cinema-fact-8488181 |title= Liverpool's arts hub and cinema FACT reveal 2015 programme and exhibitions |date= 21 January 2015 |accessdate= 1 January 2016 |work= Liverpool Echo |author= Peter Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FACT was Liverpool's first purpose-built arts centre for more than 60 years. It was opened in February 2003 by its founding executive director Eddie Berg, having cost £10 million to build. The building is linked to [[Bold Street]], one of Liverpool's main shopping areas, by a public square off Wood Street and Colquitt Street.

==Events==
The cinema hosted a Question and Answer session with [[Quentin Tarantino]] in 2007 for the UK release of ''[[Death Proof]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2007/09/12/tarantino_review_feature.shtml |title= Tarantino in Liverpool |work= BBC News |author= Peter Argyle |date= 12 September 2007 |accessdate= 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 FACT hosted an art event in which [[Shia LaBeouf]] answered phone calls from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35059685 |title= Shia LaBeouf takes public calls in Liverpool art gallery |date= 16 December 2015 |accessdate= 1 January 2016 |work= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 22, 2017, FACT became the location of [[LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner]]'s He Will Not Divide Us project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fact.co.uk/news-articles/2017/03/hewillnotdivideus.aspx |title=HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US |work=FACT News |date= 21 March 2017 |accessdate= 22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The building ==
Designed by architectural firm [[Austin-Smith:Lord]], the building is situated on ''Wood Street'' in the Ropewalks area of the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fact.co.uk/main/visit/building/?group=4&amp;parent=28&amp;link_id=28&lt;/ref&gt; It contains three gallery spaces, four cinema screens and a multimedia suite and also comprises a cafe, a bar and a lounge area.

'''Indigenous Philippine art''' is [[art]] made by the [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]]. It includes works in raw materials such as extract from trees, fruits, and vegetables. Some of the art treasure of the Philippines is found in rock in caves, trees and woods.

==Agono Rock engravings==
In one cave, there are different [[carving]]s created by former resident tribes. They are the oldest known [[cave art]] carvings in the Philippines, dating to approximately 1000 B.C. Originally, there were 127 [[engraving]]s of human and animal figures in stick form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artesdelasfilipinas.com/archives/17/the-angono-petroglyphs/ |title=The Agono Petroglyphs |author=Teta Limcangco |publisher=Artesdelasfilipinas.com |date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joint authorship''' of a copyrightable work is when two or more persons contribute enough to the work to be the [[author]] of that work.{{sfn|Sterling|2008|p=210}} In the case of joint authorship, the authors share the copyright in the work with each other.

== International conventions ==
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/7bis.html Article 7bis] of the [[Berne Convention]] states the term of protection for works of joint authorship and extends the general terms of protection provided under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/7.html Article 7] to works of joint authorship, under the condition that the term of copyright protection must be measured from the death of the last surviving author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/7bis.html |title=BERNE CONVENTION, AS REVISED - Article 7bis |website=www.law.cornell.edu|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Berne Convention doesn’t define what works of joint authorship are, because various national legislations have a lot of variations while defining the same, and have a different approach to the topic.{{sfn|Sterling|2008|p=214}}

This problem relating to joint authorship is not specifically dealt with by other international agreements as well, like the [[Universal Copyright Convention|UCC]], [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]], and the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] 1996.{{sfn|Sterling|2008|p=215}}

== Law in the United States ==
A joint work is defined in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101 Section 101 of the U.S. Copyright Act] as "''a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole''".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html |title=17 U.S.C. § 101 |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/201 Section 201(a)] gives the status of co-ownership in the copyrighted work to such authors of a joint work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html |title=17 U.S.C. § 201(a) |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elements ===
Under the [[Copyright law of the United States|US copyright law]], a person has to prove the following two things for claiming joint authorship in a work:{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991}}
# First, he must show that he made a copyrightable contribution to the final work at issue. 
# Second, he must show that all of these contributors intended that their various contributions be merged into a unitary whole.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991}}

==== Copyrightable contribution ====
The individual contributions made by authors to a joint work need not necessarily be equal in quality or quantity.{{sfn|Nimmer|2010|p=6–6}} Nevertheless, the author has to show that his contribution to the joint work is copyrightable by itself.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991}}{{sfn|Ashton-Tate Corporation v Ross|1991}} A contribution of mere ideas is not sufficient.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–48}} In order to be a joint author, one must contribute expression.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=507}} For the expression to be copyrightable it has to be [[Threshold of originality#United States|original]] – that is independently created and possess at least a [[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|minimal degree of creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/case.html |title=Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co 499 U.S. 340 (1991) |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''Gaiman v. McFarlane'', where the issue of joint authorship was on the creation of new characters for an existing comic series, the court held that there will be joint-authorship even though the author's contribution was not independently copyrightable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1241893.html |title=Gaiman v McFarlane 360 F.3d 644 (2004) |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning given behind this was that if more than one person laboured to create a single copyrightable work, then it would be paradoxical if no one was able to claim copyright because the individual contributions were not themselves copyrightable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While in this case, recent decisions holding that individual contribution must be independently copyrightable were not explicitly overruled, they were distinguished on facts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Huang |first=Teresa |date=January 2005 |title=Gaiman v. McFariane: The Right Step in Determining Joint Authorship for Copyrighted Material |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1544&amp;context=btlj |journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also observed that the lower standard for joint authorship only applies to mixed media works.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Intention to be merged into a unitary whole ====
The core of joint authorship is joint labouring by two or more persons in order to complete a pre-concerted common design. In the absence of a pre-concerted common design, the completed work will not be regarded as a joint work.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998}} However, it is not required of the several authors that they must necessarily work in physical propinquity or in concert.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/47/490/1799427/ |title=Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co., 47 F. Supp. 490 (S.D.N.Y. 1942) |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co'', the court held that while producing a musical composition jointly, two men will be coauthors and owners of the copyright even if they labour at different times, without consulting each other, and remain strangers to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is a work of joint authorship if a person creates lyrics or music with the intention that his work shall be combined with the work of another person who shall create the music or write the lyrics, as the case may be, so as to make the composition complete.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The touchstone here is the intention, at the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit, although the parts themselves may be either "inseparable" (as the case of a novel or painting) or "interdependent" (as in the case of a motion picture, opera, or the words and music of a song).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:H.R._Rep._No._94-1476_(1976)_Page_120.djvu |title=House of Representatives Report No.  94-1476 |last= |first= |date= |website= |page=120|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, joint authors must have the intention of combining their respective works at the time of creating the work, and not at some later date.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, they are not required to have an express collaboration agreement creating a joint-author relationship.{{sfn|Nimmer|2010|p=6–6}}

There have also been situations wherein the parties shared a pre-concerted intent that their works be merged into one, and yet the court did not grant joint authorship.{{sfn|Nimmer|2010|p=6–27}} This was since all the participants in a work did not consider themselves or others to be joint authors.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991}}{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998}}

=== Relevant cases ===

==== ''Childress v. Taylor'' ====
In ''Childress v. Taylor'', actress Clarice Taylor asked playwright Alice Childress to write a play about legendary comedienne Jackie "Moms" Mabley. While writing, Childress accepted Taylor's assistance. Taylor mainly contributed ideas regarding the portrayal of characters in the play and also provided research on the life of "Moms" Mabley.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=502}} On finalization of the draft, Childress rejected that it was owned equally by her and Taylor and registered the same in her name.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=508}} Later, Taylor took a copy of the play and produced it at another theatre without Childress' permission.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=508}} As a response to a suit for infringement by Childress, Taylor claimed that she was a joint author of the script and hence had equal rights in it. The Court while determining this issue, looked at whether the both the participants intended to combine their works into a unitary whole. Additionally, the court checked whether the parties {{'}}''intended to be joint authors''{{'}} in the work.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=507–509}} The court held that Taylor was not a joint author of the script due to lack of contribution of sufficient expression.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=509}} It observed that no evidence was shown to establish Taylor's role as anything more than giving advice and ideas.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=509}}

==== ''Thomson v. Larson'' ====
In another case wherein both the participants had contributed expression, the court denied joint authorship status due to lack of requisite intent.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–59}} ''Thomson v. Larson'' revolved around the claims to co-authorship of the musical ''Rent'' made by a dramaturge. In this particular case, Jonathan Larson, the author, had written the original play and was having it produced by the New York Theatre Workshop ("NYTW").{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=197}} Lynn Thomson, who was a literature professor at New York University, was hired to help shape and form the plot.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=197}} The NYTW and Thomson entered into an agreement the terms of which stated that Thomson was to be listed as 'dramaturge' for billing purposes as an independent contractor.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=198}}

However, not long after the dress rehearsal, Larson passed away and Thomson filled in her shoes and concluded the book to be used for the musical. At this stage, Thomson was yet to sign a waiver which would entail her handing over any copyright interest in the concluded work.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=198}} Notwithstanding the fact that Thomson had a significant contribution in portions that could be copyrighted to the end result, the court held that ''Rent'' was not the product of joint work and as such Thomson could not claim the status of co-author.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=200}} The argument furthered in this regard was that there was a lack of expression of an indication on behalf of Larson which would indicate that it was ever his intention for Thomson to be a joint author. Instead, his intention as expressed characterized her capacity as an editor of his original work. The court reiterated the precedent established by ''Childress'', rejecting Thompson's argument that the requirement of intention needs to be met with only in a situation where an author's contributions are minimal.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=202}}

The court held that in order to be characterized as a joint author, an individual must show two things: first, that he or she produced independent copyright material within the context of the creative process and second, that both individual authors exhibited mutual intent to create the joint work. However, the court argued that, despite Thomson's significant contribution to the development of ''Rent,'' Thomson's claim was without a clear demonstration that Larson knowingly intended to share the playwright credit with her and hence Thomson would not qualify as a joint author.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=205}}

=== Difference from collective work ===
In the case of a [[collective work]], defined in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101 Section 101], separate and independent works are assembled into a collection, and while the independent works may have a copyright protection, the nature of copyright protection of the collection is different from that of the independent works.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The collective work exists as a distinct entity, other than the individual works that form the collection.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–15}} Therefore, the key characteristics are assemblage or collection of "separate and independent works into a collective whole".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike a work of joint authorship, a collective work such as periodicals{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–36}} lacks the elements of unity and merger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Difference from derivative work ===
{{See also|Derivative work}}
The definition of "joint works" has led to some concern that when a previously written work such as a play, novel or music is incorporated in a future work such as a motion picture, the authors of such previous works could claim to be the coauthors of the motion picture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is usually true that a motion picture would be a joint work and not a collective work with respect to the authors actually working on the film, but the usual status of "employees for hire" given to them would not let the question of co-ownership come up. Although an author such as a songwriter or novelist may write a work hoping and expecting that his work will be used in a motion picture, it will still be a work of independent authorship because the author did not write the work with the intention of it being used in the motion picture.{{sfn|Nimmer|2010|p=6–13}} In such a case, the motion picture will be a derivative work, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/103 Section 103] makes it amply clear that copyright in a derivative work is independent of, and does not affect the extent of any rights in any pre-existing works incorporated in the said derivative work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Economic effect ===
In the case of joint authorship, each author is the owner of not only the part he or she created but of the whole work.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–17}} Every author can freely use the work and [[license]] it out for others to use it.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=199}} A co-owner of a work of joint authorship does not require other authors' permission to use the work himself, and the other authors can't object to such a use.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–18}}

If the license has been granted by one of the joint authors unilaterally, then the license fee collected, if any, must be shared appropriately with other joint authors. In the absence of an agreement determining how the license fee is to be shared, every joint author must receive an equal share irrespective of the amount of their individual contribution to the joint work. A joint author can sign a written statement in compliance with [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/204 Section 204(a)] to alter his ownership shares he is initially vested with.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–18}}

A joint author may also sue any third party for copyright infringement without asking other co-owners to join the litigation.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–19}}

Moreover, a joint author does not require other joint authors' consent to transfer his exclusive proportional interest in the work.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–21}} However, a joint author cannot transfer all interest in the work without obtaining authorization from other co-owners, since that would result in "an involuntary transfer of the other joint owners' undivided interest in the whole".{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–22}}

The interest of a joint author in a work of joint authorship is passed on to his heirs after his death, and not the other joint authors. Hence, in this regard, joint authorship in copyright law is similar to tenancy in common in property law and not a joint tenancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:H.R._Rep._No._94-1476_(1976)_Page_121.djvu |title=House of Representatives Report No.  94-1476 |last= |first= |date= |website= |page=121|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law in India ==
[[Copyright law of India|Indian copyright law]] defines 'work of joint authorship' in [https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1242671/ Section 2(z)] of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 as ''"a work produced by the collaboration of two or more authors in which the contribution of one author is not distinct from the contribution of the other author or authors"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/797096/ |title=Section 2(z), Indian Copyright Act, 1957 |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term of copyright protection in case of joint authorship is calculated from the death of the last author, which is sixty years post the death of the last author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/535461/ |title=Section 22, Indian Copyright Act, 1957 |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relevant case ===
The leading case of joint authorship in India is ''Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors''. In this case, the plaintiff is the legal heir of the author of the book ''India Wins Freedom''. The defendant is the publisher of said book.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|pp=2–3}} The defendant entered into an agreement with one Prof. Humayun Kabir to make contents of the book known to the public.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|p=7}} The plaintiff obtained an injunction restraining defendants from breaking seals of covers of the complete book ''India Wins Freedom'' and from making its contents known to the public. According to the preface to the said book written by Kabir, Maulana Azad used to describe his experiences in Urdu, on the basis of which a draft in English would be prepared by Kabir.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|p=19}} The court held that active and close intellectual collaboration and cooperation between Maulana Azad implied that Kabir is a joint author of the book with Maulana Azad.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|p=28}} Hence, the defendants were allowed to break the seals of the covers of the complete book ''India Wins Freedom'' and make its contents known to the public.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|p=28}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4918">The ''Ordinance for the Regulating of Printing'' also known as the '''Licensing Order of 1643''' instituted pre-publication [[censorship]] upon Parliamentary [[England]]. [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' was written specifically against this Act.

==Abolition of the Star Chamber==
Parliament, by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]], abolished the [[Star Chamber]] in July 1641, which led to the de facto cessation of censorship. The loosening of controls led to an immediate rise in publishing.  Between 1640 and 1660, at least 300 news publications were produced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

==The Licensing Order of 1643==
[[Image:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|left|150px|First page of [[John Milton]]'s 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'', in it he argued forcefully against the Licensing Order of 1643.]]
The abolition of the Star Chamber and the severe 1637 [[Star Chamber Decree]], however, did not indicate Parliament's intention to permit freedom of speech and of the press; rather it indicated a desire on the part of Parliament to replace the Royal censorship machinery with its own.

Motivated by a desire to eliminate chaos and piracy in the printing industry, protect parliamentary activities and proceedings from its opponents, suppress royalist propaganda and check the widening currency of various sects’ radical ideas, Parliament instituted a new state-controlled censoring apparatus in ''An Ordinance for the Regulating of Printing'' of 14 June 1643.&lt;ref&gt;'June 1643: An Ordinance for the Regulating of Printing.', Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660 (1911), pp. 184-86. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=55829. Date accessed: 12 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Licensing Order reintroduced almost all of the stringent censorship machinery of the 1637 Star Chamber Decree including: 
* pre-publication licensing
* registration of all printing materials with the names of author, printer and publisher in the Register at Stationers’ Hall
* search, seizure and [[book burning|destruction]] of any books offensive to the government
* arrest and imprisonment of any offensive writers, printers and publishers.

The Stationers’ Company was given the responsibility of acting as censor, in return for a monopoly of the printing trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibas.re.kr/eng/journal/10-5.pdf|title = Areopagitica in the Licensing Controversy: Milton's Rhetorical Strategies and Modes|last = Park|first = Eunmi|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009090615/http://www.ibas.re.kr/eng/journal/10-5.pdf|archivedate = 2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Milton's ''Areopagitica''==
In protest, English poet and political writer, [[John Milton]] published the ''[[Areopagitica]]: A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England'' in November, 1644 (16 months following the Licensing Order).

==Censorship during the Restoration==
After the Restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s, even tighter controls were imposed on the press.  A single individual was given the authority to publish an official newspaper along with the responsibility of serving as censor for all other publications.

==1694: the Licensing Order lapses==

With the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, William and Mary were invited to ascend the throne on the condition that they agree to the terms spelled out in the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Declaration of Rights]]. This came to be understood as part of the British "constitution" that American patriots cited as the source of their own freedoms as "Englishmen".

The Licensing Order was allowed to lapse in 1694.  Although most accounts stipulate that "the Licensing act expired in 1695", the "expiration" was not the result of a simple lapse of attention on the part of the government.  Instead, the freedoms established by the Declaration of Rights created a more open society, and an explosion of print was the result.  In England, the emergence of publications like the ''[[Tatler (1709)|Tatler]]'' and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'' are given credit for creating a 'bourgeois public sphere' that allowed for a free exchange of ideas and information.  In America, the end of the Licensing Act also sparked the creation of new publications and set the stage for the battle of words that would lead to the [[American Revolution]] in the second half of the eighteenth century.

[[File:La ParcaGarciaVega.jpg|thumb|La Parca by Mexican artist [[Antonio García Vega]].]]
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Morta''' was the goddess of death. She is one of the [[Parcae]], related to the Roman conception of the Fates in [[Greek mythology]], the [[Moirai]]. Her Greek equivalent is [[Atropos]]. She is responsible for the pain and/or  death that occur in a half-wake, half-sleep time frame. Her father is the god of darkness and her mother is the goddess of night. She visits and warns in advance of the pain and/or death about to be endured.

[[File:A Child of the Honigh Family on its Deathbed.jpg|thumb|''A Child of the Honigh Family on its Deathbed'', by an unknown painter, 1675-1700]]
A '''mourning portrait''' or '''deathbed portrait''' is a portrait of a person who has recently died, usually shown on their deathbed, or [[lying in repose]], displayed for mourners. Though it seems like a morbid subject now, these were not rare in European homes of well-to-do people as a way of remembering and honoring the dead. Generally the name of the painter is unknown. Generally people were laid out in their best clothes with some sort of special headdress, and some sort of token in their hands. Today these portraits give insights into old funeral customs, but also various types of information regarding folk costumes.  In the 19th century [[post-mortem photography]] continued the tradition.

Recent research on deathbed portraits, which can be found also in prints and photographs up to today, shows that they became popular after the [[Protestant Reformation]] but were never treasured as family heirlooms in the same way as other artworks and thus relatively few early examples such as this one have survived. As a continuous art form, laying out traditions did not go away and photography has continued to preserve the deathbed portrait, though such photos were meant for mourners and did not find their way into photo albums. 

In the Netherlands, complicated wreaths of greens were placed around the heads of unmarried people, who were mostly children.&lt;ref name=Pelen&gt;[http://www.benhartman.nl/begrafenisrituelen/afleggen/versieren-pelen-van-het-lijk/ Afleggen en versieren van het lijk] ''Laying out and "palling" of the body'' on Dutch website&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dutch such a wreath is called a "hoedje" (little hat) and this is part of the general body decoration called "pelen".&lt;ref&gt;''Naar het lijk: het Nederlandse doodsportret 1500-heden'', catalog of [[Teylers Museum]] exhibition by Bert Sliggers, Walburg Pers, Zutphen, 1998 {{ISBN|9789057300424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "pelen" is related to the English word "pall", as in "pallbearer", which in funeral contexts refers to the cloth (sometimes a flag) over the body or casket.

An example of this type of portrait is the ''Mourning portrait of K. Horvath-Stansith, née Kiss'', an 1680s painting by an anonymous Baroque artist in the [[Slovak National Gallery]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.webumenia.sk/dielo/SVK:SNG.O_4842 collection record] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting shows a postmortem portrait of a woman from the Horvath-Stansith family, K. Horvath-Stansith. She appears to be lying on a bed, but her body has been specially prepared and she is lying not on a bed, but a prepared [[catafalque]] laid with a [[Kilim]] carpet and special red [[damask]] cushion. Her fingers have already discoloured and thread is wrapped around her thumbs. Theoretically, the location is her local church and this is how she looked during the funeral service. She is wearing the costume of the former Hungarian region of [[Levoča]] and the closefitting cap she has on is probably not the headgear she wore when she was alive.

'''Music-on-demand''' is a music distribution model conceived with the growth of two-way computing, telecommunications and the [[Internet]] in the early 1990s. Primarily, high-quality music is made available to purchase, access and play back using software on the [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Microsoft Windows]], set-top boxes and mobile devices from an available distribution point, such as a computer host or server located at a telephone, cable TV or wireless data center facility.

In 1992, [[computer modem]] speeds were limited to less than 28 thousand bits per second (28 kbit/s), compared with uncompressed music on [[compact disc]] (CD) that required 150 thousand [[bytes]] per second.  As a result, additional [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] is required to accommodate delivering audio at CD quality standards: 16-bit frame, 44.1 [[kHz]] [[sampling rate]], stereophonic (two channel audio).  This prompted telephony, [[CATV]], cellular and satellite providers to consider changing standards, assisting in creating the [[information superhighway]], in terms of building higher capacity for existing telecommunications [[infrastructure]]s.

Early attempts at designing and developing music-on-demand technology, in accordance with the laws of the United States such as the [[Audio Home Recording Act|Home Recording Act of 1992]], include [[Access Media Network]] (AMN) by inventor [[Dale Schalow]].  Schalow, born in Virginia, was an independent audio engineer and programmer in Los Angeles, California, who helped record albums and music scores for [[David Bowie]], [[Tin Machine]], [[Cypress Hill]], [[House of Pain]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Brothers]].  A [[multiplexed]] music-on-demand model was deployed using [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio sampling devices, Apple IIci, the [[Kermit (protocol)|KERMIT]] computer file transfer protocol, and [[SCSI]] storage systems by Schalow to validate processing 16-bit multi-channel audio from [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] in a professional recording studio environment, including his own independently operated '''Dascha''' company and '''38 Fresh Recordings'''.  The model conceived was introduced by Schalow to Apple Computer in 1992 after he submitted an entry into the "I Changed the World" contest, essentially describing how an Apple computer helped shape and change the world forever based upon its usage.  Apple acknowledged the "Accessible Music Network" (AMN) by awarding Schalow Honorable Mention and sending him a simple gray T-shirt with the Apple logo on it.  Stand-alone software created by AMN for consumer-based access was then developed for the [[Microsoft Windows]] computer operating system, as well as set-top box design prototypes conceptualized with 3D prototype imaging that required a telephone connector located next to a [[coaxial]] cable TV connector to converge low speed data uplinking with high speed downloading interactive communications.

Presently, music-on-demand is still the center of controversy with a focus on illegal music downloading, [[peer-to-peer]] file swapping and the lag of legislation for rapidly changing technology on the Internet.  Record labels represented by the [[RIAA]], as well as publishers and songwriters, have vigorously defended copyrighted materials and have been successful in enforcing current laws for protecting their intellectual property.  As of 2006, the new music industry has seen a rapid growth in overall revenues for legal digital music sales that has resulted in hitting and surpassing one billion dollars annually.

[[File:Nordamerikanische Kulturareale en.png|thumb|300px|North American ethnic regions]]
Native American cultures across the United States are notable for their wide variety and diversity of lifestyles, customs, art forms and beliefs. The culture of indigenous North America is usually defined by the concept of the Pre-Columbian culture area, namely a geographical region where shared cultural traits occur. The northwest culture area, for example shared common traits such as salmon fishing, woodworking, large villages or towns and a hierarchical social structure. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.britannica.com/topic/Native-American &lt;/ref&gt; 

Though cultural features, language, clothing, and customs vary enormously from one tribe to another, there are certain elements which are encountered frequently and shared by many tribes. Early European American scholars described the Native Americans as having a society dominated by [[clan]]s.&lt;ref name="Morgan1907"&gt;{{Cite book

European colonization of the Americas had a major impact on Native American culture through what is known as the [[Columbian exchange]]. The '''Columbian exchange''', also known as the '''Columbian interchange''', was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the [[Americas]] and the [[Old World]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|1492 voyage]].&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163–188 |jstor= 25703506 |doi= 10.1257/jep.24.2.163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbian exchange generally had a destructive impact on Native American culture through disease, and a 'clash of cultures', &lt;ref&gt;Emmer, Pieter. "The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500–1800." European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; whereby European values of private property, the family, and labor led to conflict, appropriation of traditional communal lands and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Emmer, Pieter. "The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500–1800." European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; 

The impact of the Columbian exchange was not entirely negative however. For example, the re-introduction of the horse to North America allowed  the [[Plains Indian]] to revolutionize their way of life by making hunting, trading, and warfare far more effective, and to greatly improve their ability to transport possessions and move their settlements. &lt;ref&gt; http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.na.038 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, while remaining faithful to their traditions, Native American cultures continue to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances.

==Cultural areas==
[[Native Americans in the United States]] fall into a number of distinct ethno-linguistic and territorial phyla, whose only uniting characteristic is that they were in a stage of either [[Mesolithic]] ([[hunter-gatherer]]) or [[Neolithic]] (subsistence farming) culture at the time of European contact.

They can be classified as belonging to a number of large cultural areas: that were not used today .

==Language==
{{Main|Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous languages of the Americas|}}
[[File:Early Localization Native Americans USA.jpg|thumb|300px|Early indigenous languages in the U.S.]]
There are approximately 296 spoken (or formerly spoken) indigenous languages north of Mexico, 269 of which are grouped into 29 families. 

The major ethno-linguistic phyla are:
*[[Na-Dene languages]],
*[[Iroquoian languages]],
*[[Caddoan languages]]
*[[Algonquian languages]]
*[[Algic languages]],
*[[Siouan–Catawban languages]],
*[[Uto-Aztecan languages]],
*[[Salishan languages]],
*[[Tanoan languages]]
*[[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] (Alaska)

The Na-Dené, Algic, and Uto-Aztecan families are the largest in terms of number of languages. Uto-Aztecan has the most speakers (1.95 million) if the languages in Mexico are considered (mostly due to 1.5 million speakers of [[Nahuatl]]); Na-Dené comes in second with approximately 200,000 speakers (nearly 180,000 of these are speakers of [[Navajo language|Navajo]]), and Algic in third with about 180,000 speakers (mainly [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]). Na-Dené and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]]) with two outliers in [[California]] ([[Yurok language|Yurok]] and [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]]). The remaining 27 languages are either isolates or unclassified){{citation needed|date=July 2018}}, such as [[Penutian languages]], [[Hokan languages|Hokan]], [[Gulf languages]] and others.

===Gens structure===
Early European American scholar described the Native Americans (as well as any other [[tribal]] society) as having a society dominated by [[clans]] or [[gens|gentes]] (in the Roman model) before tribes were formed. There were some common characteristics:
*The right to elect its [[sachem]] and chiefs.
*The right to depose its sachem and chiefs.
*The obligation not to marry in the gens.
*Mutual rights of inheritance of the property of deceased members.
*Reciprocal obligations of help, defense, and redress of injuries.
*The right to bestow names on its members.
*The right to adopt strangers into the gens.
*Common religious rights, query.
*A common burial place.
*A council of the gens.&lt;ref name="Morgan1907"&gt;{{Cite book

===Tribal structure===

Subdivision and differentiation took place between various groups. Some functions and attributes of tribes are:

*The possession of the gentes.
*The right to depose these sachems and chiefs.
*The possession of a religious faith and worship.
*A supreme government consisting of a council of chiefs.
*A head-chief of the tribe in some instances.&lt;ref name="Morgan1907"/&gt;

[[File:1940 govt photo minnesota farming scene chippewa baby teething on magazine indians at work.jpg|thumb|upright|Chippewa baby waits on a cradleboard while parents tend rice crops (Minnesota, 1940).]]

An early crop the Native Americans grew was [[squash (plant)|squash]]. Others early crops included [[cotton]], [[sunflower]], [[pumpkins]], [[tobacco]], [[goosefoot]], [[Polygonum erectum|knotgrass]], and [[Iva annua|sump weed]].

[[Agriculture in the prehistoric Southwest|Agriculture in the southwest]] started around 4,000 years ago when traders brought cultigens from Mexico. Due to the varying climate, some ingenuity was needed for agriculture to be successful. The climate in the southwest ranged from cool, moist mountains regions, to dry, sandy soil in the desert. Some innovations of the time included [[irrigation]] to bring water into the dry regions and the selection of seed based on the traits of the growing plants that bore them. In the southwest, they grew beans that were self-supported, much like the way they are grown today.

In the east, however, they were planted right by corn in order for the vines to be able to "climb" the cornstalks. The most important crop the Native Americans raised was [[maize]]. It was first started in [[Mesoamerica]] and spread north. About 2,000 years ago it reached eastern America. This crop was important to the Native Americans because it was part of their everyday diet; it could be stored in underground pits during the winter, and no part of it was wasted. The husk was made into art crafts, and the cob was used as fuel for fires. By 800 CE the Native Americans had established three main crops&amp;nbsp;— beans, squash, and corn&amp;nbsp;— called the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]].

The agriculture gender roles of the Native Americans varied from region to region. In the southwest area, men prepared the soil with [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]]. The women were in charge of planting, weeding, and harvesting the crops. In most other regions, the women were in charge of doing everything, including clearing the land. Clearing the land was an immense chore since the Native Americans rotated fields frequently. There is a tradition that [[Squanto]] showed the Pilgrims in New England how to put fish in fields to act like a fertilizer, but the truth of this story is debated.

Native Americans did plant beans next to corn; the beans would replace the [[nitrogen]] which the corn took from the ground, as well as using corn stalks for support for climbing. Native Americans used controlled fires to burn weeds and clear fields; this would put nutrients back into the ground. If this did not work, they would simply abandon the field to let it be fallow, and find a new spot for cultivation.

Europeans in the eastern part of the continent observed that Natives cleared large areas for cropland. Their fields in New England sometimes covered hundreds of acres. Colonists in Virginia noted thousands of acres under cultivation by Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Krech"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Krech III |first=Shepard |title=The ecological Indian: myth and history |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc. |location=New York, New York |year=1999 |edition=1 |page=107 |isbn=0-393-04755-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Americans commonly used tools such as the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[Sledgehammer|maul]], and [[dibber]]. The hoe was the main tool used to till the land and prepare it for planting; then it was used for weeding. The first versions were made out of wood and stone. When the settlers brought iron, Native Americans switched to iron hoes and hatchets. The dibber was a digging stick, used to plant the seed. Once the plants were harvested, women prepared the produce for eating. They used the maul to grind the corn into mash. It was cooked and eaten that way or baked as corn bread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/agriculture-american-indians? |work=Answers.com |title=American Indian Agriculture |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Native American ceremonies are still practiced by many tribes and bands, and the older theological belief systems are still held by many of the "traditional" people.{{Specify|date=July 2009}} These [[spirituality|spiritualities]] may accompany adherence to another faith, or can represent a person's primary religious identity. While much Native American spiritualism exists in a tribal-cultural continuum, and as such cannot be easily separated from tribal identity itself, certain other more clearly defined movements have arisen among "traditional" Native American practitioners, these being identifiable as "religions" in the prototypical sense familiar in the industrialized [[Western world]].

Traditional practices of some tribes include the use of sacred herbs such as tobacco, [[Hierochloe odorata|sweetgrass]] or [[Leucophyllum|sage]]. Many Plains tribes have [[sweatlodge]] ceremonies, though the specifics of the ceremony vary among tribes. Fasting, singing and prayer in the ancient languages of their people, and sometimes [[Native American music|drumming]] are also common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Midewiwin|Midewiwin Lodge]] is a traditional medicine society inspired by the oral traditions and prophesies of the [[Ojibwa]] (Chippewa) and related tribes.

Another significant religious body among Native peoples is known as the [[Native American Church]]. It is a [[Syncretism|syncretistic]] church incorporating elements of Native spiritual practice from a number of different tribes as well as symbolic elements from [[Christianity]]. Its main rite is the [[peyote]] ceremony. Prior to 1890, traditional religious beliefs included [[Wakan Tanka]]. In the American Southwest, especially [[New Mexico]], a syncretism between the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] brought by Spanish missionaries and the native religion is common; the religious drums, chants, and dances of the [[Pueblo people]] are regularly part of [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]'s [[Saint Francis Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csp.org/communities/docs/fikes-nac_history.html A Brief History of the Native American Church] by Jay Fikes. Retrieved 2006-02-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Native American-Catholic syncretism is also found elsewhere in the United States. (e.g., the National [[Kateri Tekakwitha]] Shrine in [[Fonda, New York]] and the [[National Shrine of the North American Martyrs]] in [[Auriesville, New York]]).

The [[eagle feather law]] (Title 50 Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations) stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain [[eagle]] feathers for [[religious]] or spiritual use. The law does not allow Native Americans to give [[eagle]] feathers to non-Native Americans.

==Gender roles==
{{Main|Gender roles in First Nations and Native American tribes}}

[[File:Doctor.susan.la.flesche.picotte.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dr. [[Susan La Flesche Picotte]] was the first Native American woman to become a [[physician]] in the [[United States]].]]

Gender roles were differentiated in most Native American tribes. Both sexes had power in decision making within the tribe. Many tribes, such as the [[Haudenosaunee]] Five Nations and the Southeast Muskogean tribes, had [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] systems, in which property and hereditary leadership were controlled by and passed through the maternal lines. The children were considered to belong to the mother's clan and achieved status within it. When the tribe adopted war captives, the children became part of their mother's clan and accepted in the tribe. In Cherokee and other matrilineal cultures, wives owned the family property. When young women married, their husbands joined them in their mother's household. This enabled the young women to have assistance for childbirth and rearing; it also protected her in case of conflicts between the couple. If they separated or the man was killed at war, the woman had her family to assist her. In addition, in matrilineal culture, the mother's brother was the leading male figure in a male child's life, as he mentored the child within the mother's clan. The husband had no standing in his wife's and children's clan, as he belonged to his own mother's clan. Hereditary clan chief positions passed through the mother's line. Chiefs were selected on recommendation of women elders, who also could disapprove of a chief. There were sometimes hereditary roles for men called peace chiefs, but war chiefs were selected based on proven prowess in battle. Men usually had the roles of hunting, waging war, and negotiating with other tribes, including the Europeans after their arrival.

Others were [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], although several [[Kinship and descent|different systems]] were in use.  In the [[patrilineal]] tribes, such as the [[Omaha]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and [[Ponca]], hereditary leadership passed through the male line, and children were considered to belong to the father and his [[clan]]. For this reason, when Europeans or American men took wives from such tribes, their children were considered "white" like their fathers, or "[[mixed race|half-breeds]]".  Generally such children could have no official place in the tribe because their fathers did not belong to it, unless they were adopted by a male and made part of his family.&lt;ref name="TrueLogan"&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/collections/vol19/v19p064.htm  Melvin Randolph Gilmore, "The True Logan Fontenelle"], ''Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society,'' Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, p. 64, at GenNet, accessed 2011-08-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Men hunted, traded and made war. The women had primary responsibility for the survival and welfare of the families (and future of the tribe); they gathered and cultivated plants, used plants and herbs to treat illnesses, cared for the young and the elderly, made all the clothing and instruments, and processed and cured meat and skins from the game. They tanned hides to make clothing as well as bags, saddle cloths, and tepee covers. Mothers used [[cradleboard]]s to carry an infant while working or traveling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030302141755/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_013100_gender.htm][[Beatrice Medicine]]&lt;span&gt;, "Gender"&lt;/span&gt;, ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians,'' February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least several dozen tribes allowed [[polygyny]] to sisters, with procedural and economic limits.&lt;ref name="Morgan1907"/&gt;

Apart from making homes, women had many additional tasks that were also essential for the survival of the tribes. They made weapons and tools, took care of the roofs of their homes and often helped their men hunt [[American bison|bison]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indians.org/articles/native-american-women.html "Native American Women"], Indians.org.

===Team based===
Native American ball sports, sometimes referred to as [[lacrosse]], stickball, or baggataway, was often used to settle disputes, rather than going to war, as a civil way to settle potential conflict. The [[Choctaw]] called it ''isitoboli'' ("Little Brother of War");&lt;ref name="choctaw_stickball"&gt;

The game is played with one or two rackets/sticks and one ball. The object of the game is to land the ball on the opposing team's goal (either a single post or net) to score and to prevent the opposing team from scoring on your goal. The game involves as few as 20 or as many as 300 players with no height or weight restrictions and no protective gear. The goals could be from around {{convert|200|ft}} apart to about {{convert|2|mi}}; in Lacrosse the field is {{convert|110|yd}}. A Jesuit priest{{Who|date=August 2009}} referenced stickball in 1729, and [[George Catlin]] painted the subject.

===Individual===
[[Chunkey]] was a game that consisted of a disk shaped stone that was about 1–2&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter. The disk was thrown down a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} corridor so that it could roll past the players at great speed. The disk would roll down the corridor, and players would throw wooden shafts at the moving disk. The object of the game was to strike the disk or prevent your opponents from hitting it.

==Music==
{{Main|Native American music}}
[[File:Jake fragua jemez pueblo.jpg|thumb|upright|Jake Fragua, [[Jemez Pueblo]] from [[New Mexico]]]]
Traditional [[Native American music]] is almost entirely [[Texture (music)|monophonic]], but there are notable exceptions. Native American music often includes [[drum]]ming and/or the playing of rattles or other percussion instruments but little other instrumentation. [[Native American flute|Flutes]] and whistles made of wood, cane, or bone are also played, generally by individuals, but in former times also by large ensembles (as noted by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto]]). The tuning of modern flutes is typically [[pentatonic]].

Performers with Native American parentage have occasionally appeared in American popular music, such as [[Robbie Robertson]] (The Band), [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Tori Amos]], [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]], and [[CocoRosie]]. Some, such as [[John Trudell]], have used music to comment on life in Native America, and others, such as [[R. Carlos Nakai]] integrate traditional sounds with modern sounds in instrumental recordings, whereas the music by artist [[Charles Littleleaf]] is derived from ancestral heritage and nature. A variety of small and medium-sized recording companies offer an abundance of recent music by Native American performers young and old, ranging from pow-wow drum music to hard-driving rock-and-roll and rap.

The most widely practiced public musical form among Native Americans in the United States is that of the pow-wow. At [[pow-wow]]s, such as the annual [[Gathering of Nations]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], members of drum groups sit in a circle around a large drum. Drum groups play in unison while they sing in a native language and dancers in colorful regalia dance clockwise around the drum groups in the center. Familiar pow-wow songs include honor songs, intertribal songs, crow-hops, sneak-up songs, grass-dances, two-steps, welcome songs, going-home songs, and war songs. Most indigenous communities in the United States also maintain traditional songs and ceremonies, some of which are shared and practiced exclusively within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bierhosrt, John |title=A Cry from the Earth: Music of North American Indians |publisher=Ancient City Press |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

[[Image:Kachina dolls.jpg|thumb|Drawings of kachina dolls, from an 1894 anthropology book.]]

[[Pueblo peoples]] crafted impressive items associated with their religious ceremonies. ''[[Kachina]]'' dancers wore elaborately painted and decorated masks as they ritually impersonated various ancestral spirits. Sculpture was not highly developed, but carved stone and wood fetishes were made for religious use. Superior weaving, embroidered decorations, and rich dyes characterized the textile arts. Both turquoise and shell jewelry were created, as were high-quality pottery and formalized pictorial arts.

[[Navajo people|Navajo]] spirituality focused on the maintenance of a harmonious relationship with the spirit world, often achieved by ceremonial acts, usually incorporating [[sandpainting]]. The colors—made from sand, charcoal, cornmeal, and pollen—depicted specific spirits. These vivid, intricate, and colorful sand creations were erased at the end of the ceremony. The Eastern Woodland Indians used the hoe.

Native American art comprises a major category in the world art collection. Native American contributions include [[Native American pottery|pottery]], [[painting]]s, [[jewelry]], [[weaving]]s, [[sculpture]], [[basketry]], and [[wood carving|carvings]]. [[Franklin Grits]] was a Cherokee artist who taught students from many tribes at Haskell Institute (now [[Haskell Indian Nations University]]) in the 1940s, the ''Golden Age'' of Native American painters. The integrity of certain Native American artworks is protected by an act of Congress that prohibits representation of art as Native American when it is not the product of an enrolled Native American artist.

==Writing and communication==
[[File:Sequoyah.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sequoyah]], inventor of the Cherokee syllabary]]
Native Americans in the United States have developed several original systems of communication, both in Pre-Columbian times, and later as a response to European influences. For example, the [[Iroquois]], living around the [[Great Lakes]] and extending east and north, used strings or belts called ''[[wampum]]'' that served a dual function: the knots and beaded designs mnemonically chronicled tribal stories and legends, and further served as a medium of exchange and a unit of measure. The keepers of the articles were seen as tribal dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tolatsga.org/iro.html Iroquois History]. Retrieved 2006-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of communication was the [[Wiigwaasabak]], [[birch bark]] scrolls on which the [[Ojibwa]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing.

A widely used form of communication was [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] (PISL), also known as '''Plains Sign Talk''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of Calgary|author=Darin Flynn|url=http://ucalgary.ca/dflynn/can|title=Canadian Languages|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Plains Sign Language''' and '''First Nation Sign Language'''. PISL is a trade language (or [[international auxiliary language]]), formerly a [[trade pidgin]], that was once the [[lingua franca]] across central Canada, central and western United States and northern Mexico, used among the various [[Plains Indians|Plains Nations]]. It was also used for story-telling, oratory, various ceremonies, and by deaf people for ordinary daily use.&lt;ref name="McKay-Cody 1998"&gt;{{Citation

In the late 1810s and early 1820s, the [[Cherokee syllabary]] was invented by the silversmith [[Sequoyah]] to write the [[Cherokee language]]. His creation of the [[syllabary]] is particularly noteworthy as he could not previously read any script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|date=1999|publisher=Norton|location=New York, New York|isbn=0393317552|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first experimented with [[logogram]]s, before developing his system into a syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a [[syllable]] rather than a single [[phoneme]]; the 85 (originally 86){{sfn|Sturtevant|Fogelson|2004|p=337}} characters provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Although some symbols resemble [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letters, the relationship between symbols and sounds is different.

The success of the Cherokee syllabary inspired [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]], a missionary in what is now [[Manitoba]], during the 1840s to develop [[Cree syllabics]]. Evans had originally adapted the [[Latin script]] to Ojibwe (see [[Ojibwe writing systems#Evans system|Evans system]]), but after learning of the Cherokee syllabary, he experimented with invented scripts based on his familiarity with [[shorthand]] and [[Devanagari]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{Cite web|title = Plains Cree History| url = http://www.sicc.sk.ca/plains-cree_overview_history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Evans later worked with the closely related Cree, and ran into trouble with the Latin alphabet, he turned to his Ojibwe project and in 1840 adapted it to the [[Cree language]].&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book

Cree syllabics are primarily a Canadian phenomenon, but are used occasionally in the United States by communities that straddle the border.

==Economy==

===Traditional economy===
[[Iñupiat]], the [[Inuit]] of [[Alaska]], prepared and buried large amounts of dried meat and fish. [[Pacific Northwest]] tribes crafted seafaring dugouts {{convert|40|–|50|ft}} long for fishing. Farmers in the Eastern Woodlands tended fields of maize with hoes and digging sticks, while their neighbors in the Southeast grew tobacco as well as food crops. On the Plains, some tribes engaged in agriculture but also planned buffalo hunts in which herds were driven over bluffs.

Dwellers of the Southwest deserts hunted small animals and gathered acorns to grind into flour with which they baked wafer-thin bread on top of heated stones. Some groups on the region's mesas developed irrigation techniques, and filled storehouses with grain as protection against the area's frequent [[droughts]].

In the early years, as these native peoples encountered European explorers and settlers and engaged in trade, they exchanged food, crafts, and furs for blankets, iron and steel implements, horses, trinkets, firearms, and alcoholic beverages.

===Slavery===
{{Further|Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Slavery among Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}

The majority of Native American tribes did practice some form of slavery before the European introduction of African slavery into North America, but none exploited slave labor on a large scale. In addition, Native Americans did not buy and sell captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members.&lt;ref name="amslav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mmslibrary.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/slavery-and-native-americans-in-british-north-america-and-the-united-states.pdf |title=Slavery and Native Americans in British North America and the United States: 1600 to 1865 |author= Tony Seybert |accessdate=2009-06-20 |year=2009 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions of enslaved Native Americans varied among the tribes. In many cases, young enslaved captives were adopted into the tribes to replace warriors killed during warfare or by disease. Other tribes practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes; but, this status was only temporary as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society.&lt;ref name="amslav"/&gt;

Among some [[Pacific Northwest]] tribes, about a quarter of the population were slaves.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display_printable.cfm?HHID=59 Slavery in Historical Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614062348/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display_printable.cfm?HHID=59 |date=2012-06-14 }}".

''Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====European enslavement====
When Europeans arrived as [[colonists]] in North America, Native Americans changed their practice of [[slavery]] dramatically.  Native Americans began selling war captives to whites rather than integrating them into their own societies as they had done before. As the demand for labor in the [[West Indies]] grew with the cultivation of [[sugar cane]], Europeans enslaved Native Americans for the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and some were exported to the "sugar islands." The British settlers, especially those in the southern colonies, purchased or captured Native Americans to use as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, rice, and indigo.  Accurate records of the numbers enslaved do not exist. Scholars estimate tens of thousands of Native Americans may have been enslaved by the Europeans, being sold by Native Americans themselves.

Slavery became a caste of people who were foreign to the English (Native Americans, Africans and their descendants) and non-Christians.  The Virginia General Assembly defined some terms of slavery in 1705:
{{quote|All servants imported and brought into the Country... who were not Christians in their native Country... shall be accounted and be slaves. All Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves within this dominion ... shall be held to be real estate. If any slave resists his master ... correcting such slave, and shall happen to be killed in such correction ... the master shall be free of all punishment ... as if such accident never happened.|Virginia General Assembly declaration, 1705&lt;ref name="pbsafna"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr3.html |title=The Terrible Transformation:From Indentured Servitude to Racial Slavery |accessdate=2010-01-07 |year=2009 |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The slave trade of Native Americans lasted only until around 1730.  It gave rise to a series of devastating wars among the tribes, including the [[Yamasee War]]. The [[Indian Wars]] of the early 18th century, combined with the increasing importation of African slaves, effectively ended the Native American slave trade by 1750. Colonists found that Native American slaves could easily escape, as they knew the country.  The wars cost the lives of numerous colonial slave traders and disrupted their early societies.  The remaining Native American groups banded together to face the Europeans from a position of strength. Many surviving Native American peoples of the southeast strengthened their loose coalitions of language groups and joined confederacies such as the [[Choctaw]], the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], and the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] for protection.

Native American women were at risk for rape whether they were enslaved or not; during the early colonial years, settlers were disproportionately male.  They turned to Native women for sexual relationships.&lt;ref name="udayu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/Race/05intersection/Gender/rape.htm|title="The Realities of Enslaved Female Africans in America", excerpted from ''Failing Our Black Children: Statutory Rape Laws, Moral Reform and the Hypocrisy of Denial'' |author=Gloria J.

==Interracial relations==
Interracial relations between Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans is a complex issue that has been mostly neglected with "few in-depth studies on interracial relationships".&lt;ref name="lin"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n4_v11/ai_18953815|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050609074754/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n4_v11/ai_18953815|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-06-09|title=The Indian connection|author=Mary A.

===Assimilation===
{{Main|Cultural assimilation of Native Americans}}

European impact was immediate, widespread, and profound—more than any other race that had contact with Native Americans during the early years of colonization and nationhood. Europeans living among Native Americans were often called "white indians". They "lived in native communities for years, learned native languages fluently, attended native councils, and often fought alongside their native companions."&lt;ref name="white_indians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/background/nat_white_ind.html |title=Sharing Choctaw History |accessdate=2008-02-05 |publisher=A First Nations Perspective, Galafilm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226024218/http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/background/nat_white_ind.html |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Early contact was often charged with tension and emotion, but also had moments of friendship, cooperation, and intimacy.&lt;ref name="white_red_relations1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages took place in English, Spanish, and French colonies between Native Americans and Europeans. Given the preponderance of men among the colonists in the early years, generally European men married American Indian women.

[[File:Charles eastman smithsonian gn 03462a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Eastman]] was one of the first Native Americans to become certified as a [[Medical Doctor|medical doctor]], after he graduated from Boston University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipl.org/div/natam/bin/browse.pl/A29 |title=Indian Achievement Award |publisher=Ipl.org |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/charles-eastman |title=Charles A. Eastman |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There was fear on both sides, as the different peoples realized how different their societies were.&lt;ref name="white_red_relations1"/&gt; The whites regarded the Indians as "savage" because they were not Christian. They were suspicious of cultures which they did not understand.&lt;ref name="white_red_relations1"/&gt; The Native American author, Andrew J. Blackbird, wrote in his ''History of the [[Ottawa]] and [[Chippewa]] Indians of Michigan,'' (1897), that white settlers introduced some immoralities into Native American tribes. Many Indians suffered because the Europeans introduced alcohol and the whiskey trade resulted in alcoholism among the people, who were [[Alcohol tolerance#Alcohol tolerance in different ethnic groups|alcohol-intolerant]].&lt;ref name="white_red_relations1"/&gt;

As European-American women started working independently at missions and Indian schools in the western states, there were more opportunities for their meeting and developing relationships with Native American men. For instance, [[Charles Eastman]], a man of European and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] descent whose father sent both his sons to [[Dartmouth College]], got his medical degree at [[Boston University]] and returned to the West to practice. He married [[Elaine Goodale]], whom he met in South Dakota. He was the grandson of [[Seth Eastman]], a military officer from Maine, and a chief's daughter. Goodale was a young European-American teacher from Massachusetts and a reformer, who was appointed as the US superintendent of Native American education for the reservations in the Dakota Territory. They had six children together.

===Relation with African Americans===
{{Further|Black Indians|Native American slave ownership}}
African and Native Americans have interacted for centuries. The earliest record of Native American and African contact occurred in April 1502, when Spanish colonists transported the first Africans to [[Hispaniola]] to serve as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Muslims in American History : A Forgotten Legacy'' by Dr. Jerald F. Dirks. {{ISBN|1-59008-044-0}} p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buffalo soldiers1.jpg|thumb|[[Buffalo Soldier]]s, 1890. The nickname was given to the "Black Cavalry" by the Native American tribes they fought.]]

Europeans considered both races inferior and made efforts to make both Native Americans and Africans enemies.&lt;ref name="nawomen"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UYWs-GQDiOkC&amp;pg=PA214|title=Women in early America |author=Dorothy A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans were rewarded if they returned escaped slaves, and African Americans were rewarded for fighting in the late 19th-century [[Indian Wars]].&lt;ref name="nawomen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cherslav"/&gt;&lt;ref name="infr"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sHJMNVV31T0C&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Race and the Cherokee Nation |author=Fay A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Native Americans, during the transitional period of Africans becoming the primary race enslaved, were enslaved at the same time and shared a common experience of enslavement. They worked together, lived together in communal quarters, produced collective recipes for food, shared herbal remedies, myths and legends, and in the end they intermarried."&lt;ref name="afrna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/ethnography/aah/aaheritage/lowCountry_furthRdg1.htm |title=African American Heritage and Ethnography: Work, Marriage, Christianity |author=National Park Service |date=May 30, 2009 |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of a shortage of men due to warfare, many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups, to create stronger, healthier children from the unions.&lt;ref name="nadis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djembe.dk/no/19/08biwapi.html |title=Black Indians want a place in history |author=Nomad Winterhawk |accessdate=2009-05-29 |year=1997 |publisher=''Djembe Magazine'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714113317/http://www.djembe.dk/no/19/08biwapi.html |archivedate=2009-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While numerous tribes used captive enemies as servants and slaves, they also often adopted younger captives into their tribes to replace members who had died. In the Southeast, a few Native American tribes began to adopt a slavery system similar to that of the American colonists, buying African American slaves, especially the [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]]. Though less than 3% of Native Americans owned slaves, divisions grew among the Native Americans over slavery.&lt;ref name="wil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamlkatz.com/Essays/History/AfricansIndians.php |title=Africans and Indians: Only in America |author=William Loren Katz |accessdate=2009-05-06 |year=2008 |publisher=William Loren Katz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513235755/http://www.williamlkatz.com/Essays/History/AfricansIndians.php |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Cherokee, records show that slave holders in the tribe were largely the children of European men that had shown their children the economics of slavery.&lt;ref name="cherslav"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/SLAVE_RV.HTM |title=CHEROKEE SLAVE REVOLT OF 1842 |author=Art T.

Among the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], mixed-race slaveholders were generally part of an elite hierarchy, often based on their mothers' clan status, as the societies had [[matrilineal]] systems. As did Benjamin Hawkins, European fur traders and colonial officials tended to marry high-status women, in strategic alliances seen to benefit both sides. The Choctaw, Creek and Cherokee believed they benefited from stronger alliances with the traders and their societies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The women's sons gained their status from their mother's families; they were part of hereditary leadership lines who exercised power and accumulated personal wealth in their changing Native American societies. The historian Greg O'Brien calls them the Creole generation to show that they were part of a changing society.{{Citation needed|reason=not sure this is helpful|date=October 2011}} The chiefs of the tribes believed that some of the new generation of mixed-race, bilingual chiefs would lead their people into the future and be better able to adapt to new conditions influenced by European Americans.

==Philosophy==
Native American authors have written about aspects of "tribal philosophy" as opposed to the modern or Western worldview. Thus, [[Yankton Dakota]] author Vine Deloria Jr. in an  essay "Philosophy and the Tribal Peoples"{{year needed|date=October 2015}} argued that  whereas a "traditional Westerner" [[syllogism|might reason]], "Man is mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is mortal," aboriginal thinking might read, 'Socrates is mortal, because I once met Socrates and he is a man like me, and I am mortal.'&lt;ref&gt;Romano, Carlin. America the Philosophical. New York: Random House Inc., 2012. 446. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Deloria explains that both of the statements assume that all men are mortal, and that these statements are not verifiable on these grounds. The line of Indian thinking, however uses empirical evidence through memory to verify that Socrates was in fact a man like the person originally making the statement, and enhances the validity of the thinking. Deloria made the distinction, "whereas the Western syllogism simply introduces a doctrine using general concepts and depends on faith in the chain of reasoning for its verification, the Indian statement would stand by itself without faith and belief."&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Anne. American Indian Thought. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2004. 6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Deloria also comments that Native American thinking is very specific (in the way described above) compared to the broadness of traditional Western thinking, which leads to different interpretations of basic principles. American thinkers have previously denounced Native ideas because of this narrower approach, as it leads to 'blurry' distinctions between the 'real' and the 'internal.'&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Anne. American Indian Thought. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2004. 6-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this basic variance, what Americans{{who|date=October 2015}} classify as "classical American pragmatism," may actually have been heavily influenced by the ways of Native American thinking; according to Romano (2012), the best resource on a characteristically "Native American Philosophy" is Scott Pratt's, ''Native Pragmatism: Rethinking the Roots of American Philosophy'', which relates the ideas of many 'American' philosophers like Pierce, James, and Dewey to important concepts in early Native thought.&lt;ref&gt;Romano, Carlin. America the Philosophical. New York: Random House Inc., 2012. 447. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pratt's publication takes his readers on a journey through American philosophical history from the colonial time period, and via detailed analysis, connects the experimental nature of early American pragmatism to the empirical habit of indigenous Americans. Though Pratt makes these alliances very comprehensible, he also makes clear that the lines between the ideas of Native Americans and American philosophers are complex and historically difficult to trace.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Scott. Native Pragmatism: Rethinking the Roots of American Philosophy. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002. 6-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Notes Left Behind''''' is a 2009 [[non-fiction]] book by Keith and Brooke Desserich, the parents of a six-year-old girl named Elena who died of cancer. The book is a publication of some of the hundreds of notes Elena left for her parents to find after her death. It follows Elena's battle against brain cancer.

==Background==
Elena Desserich, from the [[Cincinnati]] suburb of [[Wyoming, Ohio]], United States, was diagnosed with an inoperable rare form of brain cancer in 2006 and her parents were told she had just 275 days to live. Her parents vowed to make what remained of Elena's life as special as possible. She lived for 10 months after her diagnosis, eventually being paralysed and left unable to speak by the cancer. She died in August 2007. Shortly after, her parents and younger sister began finding notes all over the house.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/721390--dying-6-year-old-girl-leaves-love-notes-behind?bn=1|title=Dying 6-year-old girl leaves love notes behind|last=Gordon|first=Andrea|date=5 November 2009|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Star Media Group]]|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents didn't tell Elena her prognosis, but retrospectively believe that she knew it.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;

==Narrative==
After her diagnosis at the age of five, Elena Desserich wrote hundreds of "love messages" to her parents, Keith and Brooke Desserich, who published the notes in ''Notes Left Behind'' in 2009.&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6506509/Notes-left-by-cancer-victim-six-for-family-turned-into-book.html|title=Notes left by cancer victim, six, for family turned into book|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 July 2010 | location=London | date=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hid the messages at various places in their house so that her parents would find them after her death.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33505113/ns/today-today_books/|title=Parents share diary of child’s cancer battle|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elena, who turned 6 in the nine months between her diagnosis and her death, died in August 2007 and her parents published the book in November 2009. The book also contains entries from Elena's parents' diary as well as several of Elena's drawings.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

Her parents said that they found the first of the notes several days after Elena's death, but "then they kept on showing up everywhere and now we have three large boxes full of them".&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

==Impact==
Originally self-published in 2009, it soon received national attention and was later re-published in 2009 by [[HarperCollins]] Publishers.  It was listed as a [[New York Times Bestseller|''New York Times'' Best Seller]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Sellers, Hardcover Nonfiction|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=November 6, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html?_r=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Elena's paintings, which she titled ''I love You'', was displayed at the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]] next to a work by [[Pablo Picasso]], one of Elena's lifelong ambitions which she had recorded on her wish list during her illness.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/JobClub/story?id=6494966&amp;page=1|title='Notes Left Behind' Inspired by 5-Year-Old|date=19 December 2008|work=[[ABC News]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors, Brooke and Keith Desserich, live in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], and founded the Cure Starts Now Foundation, an organization dedicated to researching a cure for all cancers, starting first with pediatric brain cancer. A percentage of the funds raised from the sale of ''Notes Left Behind'' goes towards the Cure Starts Now Foundation.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;

The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s '''Pomological Watercolor Collection''' is an archive of some 7500 botanical watercolors created for the USDA between the years 1886 and 1942 by around five dozen artists.&lt;ref name=pomo/&gt; Housed by the [[United States National Agricultural Library]], it is a unique resource documenting existing fruit and nut cultivars, new introductions, and specimens discovered by USDA's plant explorers, representing 38 plant families in all.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; It has been called "one of the world's most unusual holdings of late 19th and early 20th century American botanical illustrations".&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;

The archive spans the years in which American agriculture greatly expanded the range of fruits and vegetables grown on a commercial scale and developed many new cultivars. The USDA artists created the watercolors in an effort to catalog these cultivars—many of which went under different names in different regions of the United States—and to show the damage resulting from typical diseases and pests of specific fruits. During this period, many of the watercolors were issued as lithographic illustrations in USDA bulletins and the department's annual yearbooks.&lt;ref name=dgp/&gt;

==History of the collection==
The period between 1886 and 1916—when most of these watercolors were painted—was a time when the major fruit-producing regions in the United States were just beginning to emerge, as farmers worked with the USDA to establish orchards for expanding markets. Photography was not yet in widespread use as a documentary medium, so the government relied on artists to produce technically accurate drawings of cultivars for its publications.&lt;ref name=fusonie/&gt;

Some 65 different artists are represented in the collection, of whom one-third were women; working as a government illustrator was one of the few artists' jobs open to women at a time when they were just beginning to be able to gain formal training at American art schools.&lt;ref name=djk/&gt; All but a handful of the collection's 7584 watercolors were created by just nine of the artists, of whom six were women. The top three contributors were [[Deborah Griscom Passmore]], [[Amanda Newton (illustrator)|Amanda Almira Newton]], and [[Mary Daisy Arnold]], who each painted over 1000 watercolors and between them are responsible for half the collection. Passmore's watercolors in particular have been called the finest done by the early USDA illustrators and a national treasure.&lt;ref name=fusonie/&gt; Among the other most prolific artists were [[Royal Charles Steadman]] (over 850 watercolors), [[J. Marion Shull]] (who later became a noted plant breeder; over 750 watercolors), [[Ellen Isham Schutt]] (over 700), Bertha Heiges (over 600), [[Elsie Lower Pomeroy|Elsie E. Lower]] (over 250), [[William Henry Prestele]] (over 100), and the noted [[mycologist]] [[Louis Charles Christopher Krieger]].  

Slightly over half of the watercolors show apple cultivars, a good many of which are no longer cultivated.&lt;ref name=pomo/&gt; The remainder range from common types of fruits and nuts (grapes, berries, stone fruit, melons, citrus, walnuts, hickory nuts) to lesser-known native fruits ([[Amelanchier|Eastern shadbush]]) and species newly introduced in the United States or not yet grown there: [[cherimoya]], [[avocado]], [[natal plum]], [[sweetsop]], etc. The specimens depicted were collected throughout the United States and its territories and in nearly 30 other countries as well.&lt;ref name=pomo/&gt; The typical watercolor in the collection depicts the whole fruit (sometimes with its leaves) together with a half-view showing its flesh and seeds; some show the fruit in a diseased state.

'''Portrait painting''' is a [[Hierarchy of genres|genre]] in [[painting]], where the intent is to depict a human subject.  The term 'portrait painting' can also describe the actual painted portrait. Portraitists may create their work by commission, for public and private persons, or they may be inspired by admiration or affection for the subject. Portraits are often important state and family records, as well as remembrances.

Historically, portrait paintings have primarily memorialized the rich and powerful. Over time, however, it became more common for middle-class patrons to commission portraits of their families and colleagues. Today, portrait paintings are still commissioned by governments, corporations, groups, clubs, and individuals. In addition to painting, portraits can also be made in other media such as [[etching]], [[lithography]], [[photography]], video and [[digital media]].

==Technique and practice==
[[File:Sir Anthony Van Dyck - Charles I (1600-49) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anthony van Dyck]], ''[[Charles I in Three Positions]]'', 1635-1636, shows profile, full face and three-quarter views, to send to [[Bernini]] in Rome, who was to sculpt a bust from this model.]]
A well-executed [[portrait]] is expected to show the inner essence of the subject (from the artist's point of view) or a flattering representation, not just a literal likeness.  As [[Aristotle]] stated, "The aim of Art is to present not the outward appearance of things, but their inner significance; for this, not the external manner and detail, constitutes true reality."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon C. Aymar, ''The Art of Portrait Painting'', [[Chilton Book Co.]], Philadelphia, 1967, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Artists may strive for photographic realism or an impressionistic similarity in depicting their subject, but this differs from a [[caricature]] which attempts to reveal character through exaggeration of physical features. The artist generally attempts a representative portrayal, as [[Edward Burne-Jones]] stated, "The only expression allowable in great portraiture is the expression of character and moral quality, not anything temporary, fleeting, or accidental."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, this results in a serious, closed lip stare, with anything beyond a slight smile being rather rare historically.  Or as [[Charles Dickens]] put it, "there are only two styles of portrait painting: the serious and the smirk."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Even given these limitations, a full range of subtle emotions is possible from quiet menace to gentle contentment. However, with the mouth relatively neutral, much of the facial expression needs to be created through the eyes and eyebrows. As author and artist Gordon C. Aymar states, "the eyes are the place one looks for the most complete, reliable, and pertinent information" about the subject. And the eyebrows can register, "almost single-handedly, wonder, pity, fright, pain, cynicism, concentration, wistfulness, displeasure, and expectation, in infinite variations and combinations."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Portrait painting can depict the subject "{{vanchor|full-length}}" (the whole body), "{{vanchor|half-length}}" (from head to [[waist]] or [[hip]]s), "{{vanchor|head and shoulders}}" ([[portrait bust|bust]]), or just the head. The subject's head may turn from "{{vanchor|full face}}" (front view) to profile (side view); a "{{vanchor|three-quarter view}}" ("two-thirds view") is somewhere in between, ranging from almost frontal to almost profile (the fraction is the sum of the profile [one-half of the face] plus the other side's "quarter-face";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Betty|title=Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofXvl2eDsnwC&amp;pg=PT292|date= 2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-56180-5|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, each side is considered a third). Occasionally, artists have created composites with views from multiple directions, as with [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s triple portrait of ''[[Charles I in Three Positions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; There are even a few portraits where the front of the subject is not visible at all.  [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s ''[[Christina's World]]'' (1948) is a famous example, where the pose of the disabled girl – with her back turned to the viewer – integrates with the setting in which she is placed to convey the artist's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Renoir - Madame Georges Charpentier et ses enfants.jpg|thumb|left|''Mme. Charpentier and her children'', 1878, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]
[[File:Gilbert Stuart Williamstown Portrait of George Washington.jpg|upright|right|thumb|[[Gilbert Stuart]], ''Portrait of [[George Washington]]'', c.1796]] 
Among the other possible variables, the subject can be clothed or nude; indoors or out; standing, seated, reclining; even horse-mounted. Portrait paintings can be of individuals, couples, parents and children, families, or collegial groups.  They can be created in various media including [[oil painting|oils]], [[watercolor]], [[pen and ink]], [[pencil]], [[charcoal]], [[pastel]], and [[mixed media]].  Artists may employ a wide-ranging palette of colors, as with [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]'s ''Mme. Charpentier and her children'', 1878 or restrict themselves to mostly white or black, as with [[Gilbert Stuart]]'s ''Portrait of George Washington'' (1796).

Sometimes, the overall size of the portrait is an important consideration.  [[Chuck Close]]'s enormous portraits created for museum display differ greatly from most portraits designed to fit in the home or to travel easily with the client. Frequently, an artist takes into account where the final portrait will hang and the colors and style of the surrounding décor.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

Creating a portrait can take considerable time, usually requiring several sittings.  Cézanne, on one extreme, insisted on over 100 sittings from his subject.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Goya on the other hand, preferred one long day's sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The average is about four.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Simon, ''The Portrait in Britain and America'', G. K. Hall &amp; Co., Boston, 1987, p. 131, {{ISBN|0-8161-8795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portraitists sometimes present their sitters with a portfolio of drawings or photos from which a sitter would select a preferred pose,  as did [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]]. Some, such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] make a drawing of the face, then complete the rest of the painting without the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, it would typically take about one year to deliver a completed portrait to a client.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing the sitter's expectations and mood is a serious concern for the portrait artist.  As to the faithfulness of the portrait to the sitter's appearance, portraitists are generally consistent in their approach.  Clients who sought out [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] knew that they would receive a flattering result, while sitters of [[Thomas Eakins]] knew to expect a realistic, unsparing portrait. Some subjects voice strong preferences, others let the artist decide entirely. [[Oliver Cromwell]] famously demanded that his portrait show "all these roughnesses, pimples, warts, and everything as you see me, otherwise I will never pay a farthing for it."&lt;ref name="Aymar, p. 262"&gt;Aymar, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

After putting the sitter at ease and encouraging a natural pose, the artist studies his subject, looking for the one facial expression, out of many possibilities, that satisfies his concept of the sitter's essence. The posture of the subject is also carefully considered to reveal the emotional and physical state of the sitter, as is the costume. To keep the sitter engaged and motivated, the skillful artist will often maintain a pleasant demeanor and conversation. [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] advised fellow artists to flatter women and compliment their appearance to gain their cooperation at the sitting.&lt;ref name="Aymar, p. 262"/&gt;

Central to the successful execution of the portrait is a mastery of [[human anatomy]].  Human faces are asymmetrical and skillful portrait artists reproduce this with subtle left-right differences.  Artists need to be knowledgeable about the underlying bone and tissue structure to make a convincing portrait.
[[File:Margaret in Skating Costume.jpg|thumb|right|upright| ''Margaret in Skating Costume'' by [[Thomas Eakins]]]]
For complex compositions, the artist may first do a complete pencil, ink, charcoal, or oil sketch which is particularly useful if the sitter's available time is limited. Otherwise, the general form then a rough likeness is sketched out on the canvas in pencil, charcoal, or thin oil.  In many cases, the face is completed first, and the rest afterwards. In the studios of many of the great portrait artists, the master would do only the head and hands, while the clothing and background would be completed by the principal apprentices. There were even outside specialists who handled specific items such as drapery and clothing, such as [[Joseph van Aken]]&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists in past times used [[lay-figure]]s or dolls to help establish and execute the pose and the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The use of symbolic elements placed around the sitter (including signs, household objects, animals, and plants) was often used to encode the painting with the moral or religious character of the subject, or with symbols representing the sitter's occupation, interests, or social status.  The background can be totally black and without content or a full scene which places the sitter in their social or recreational milieu.

Self-portraits are usually produced with the help of a mirror, and the finished result is a mirror-image portrait, a reversal of what occurs in a normal portrait when sitter and artist are opposite each other. In a self-portrait, a righted handed artist would appear to be holding a brush in the left hand, unless the artist deliberately corrects the image or uses a second reversing mirror while painting.
[[File:Madame Récamier by Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[Jacques-Louis David]], portrait of ''[[Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier|Madame Récamier]]'' (1800), [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris]]
Occasionally, the client or the client's family is unhappy with the resulting portrait and the artist is obliged to re-touch it or do it over or withdraw from the commission without being paid, suffering the humiliation of failure. [[Jacques-Louis David]] celebrated [[portrait of Madame Récamier]], wildly popular in exhibitions, was rejected by the sitter, as was [[John Singer Sargent]]'s notorious ''[[Portrait of Madame X]]''. [[John Trumbull]]'s full-length portrait, ''[[General George Washington at Trenton]]'', was rejected by the committee that commissioned it.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 268, 271, 278&lt;/ref&gt; The famously prickly [[Gilbert Stuart]] once replied to a client's dissatisfaction with his wife's portrait by retorting, "You brought me a potato, and you expect a peach!"&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful portrait, however, can gain the lifelong gratitude of a client. Count Balthazar was so pleased with the portrait [[Raphael]] had created of his wife that he told the artist, "Your image…alone can lighten my cares.  That image is my delight; I direct my smiles to it, it is my joy."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient world===
[[File:Fayum-02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Roman-Egyptian funeral portrait of a woman]]
Portraiture's roots are likely found in prehistoric times, although few of these works survive today. In the art of the ancient civilizations of the [[Fertile Crescent]], especially in Egypt, depictions of rulers and gods abound.  However, most of these were done in a highly stylized fashion, and most in profile, usually on stone, metal, clay, plaster, or crystal.  Egyptian portraiture placed relatively little emphasis on likeness, at least until the period of [[Akhenaten]] in the 14th century BC.  Portrait painting of notables in China probably goes back to over 1000 BC, though none survive from that age. Existing Chinese portraits go back to about 1000 AD&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

From literary evidence we know that [[ancient Greek painting]] included portraiture, often highly accurate if the praises of writers are to be believed, but no painted examples remain. Sculpted heads of rulers and famous personalities like [[Socrates]] survive in some quantity, and like the individualized busts of [[Hellenistic portraiture|Hellenistic]] rulers on coins, show that Greek portraiture could achieve a good likeness, and subjects were depicted with relatively little flattery - Socrates' portraits show why he had a reputation for being ugly.  The successors of [[Alexander the Great]] began the practice of adding his head (as a [[Greek hero cult|deified]] figure) to their coins, and were soon using their own.

[[Roman portraiture]] adopted traditions of portraiture from both the [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]] and Greeks, and developed a very strong tradition, linked to their religious use of ancestor portraits, as well as Roman politics.  Again, the few painted survivals, in the [[Fayum portrait]]s, [[Tomb of Aline]] and the [[Severan Tondo]], all from Egypt under Roman rule, are clearly provincial productions that reflect Greek rather than Roman styles, but we have a wealth of sculpted heads, including many individualized portraits from middle-class tombs, and thousands of types of coin portraits.

Much the largest group of painted portraits are the funeral paintings that survived in the dry climate of Egypt's [[Fayum]] district (see illustration, below), dating from the 2nd to 4th century AD.  These are almost the only paintings of the Roman period that have survived, aside from [[fresco]]s, though it is known from the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]] that portrait painting was well established in Greek times, and practiced by both men and women artists.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Faxon, and Russo, ''Self-Portraits by Women Painters'', Ashgate Publishing, Hants (England), 2000, p. 7, {{ISBN|1-85928-424-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his times, Pliny complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, "The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out…Indolence has destroyed the arts." &lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, ''The Portrait in the Renaissance'', Bollingen Foundation, New York, 1966, pp. 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XXXV:2 trans H. Rackham 1952.  Loeb Classical Library&lt;/ref&gt; These full-face portraits from Roman Egypt are fortunate exceptions. They present a somewhat realistic sense of proportion and individual detail (though the eyes are generally oversized and the artistic skill varies considerably from artist to artist). The Fayum portraits were painted on wood or ivory in wax and resin colors (encaustic) or with [[tempera]], and inserted into the mummy wrapping, to remain with the body through eternity.
       
While free-standing portrait painting diminished in Rome, the art of the portrait flourished in Roman sculptures, where sitters demanded realism, even if unflattering. During the 4th century, the sculpted portrait dominated, with a retreat in favor of an idealized symbol of what that person looked like. (Compare the portraits of Roman Emperors [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] and [[Theodosius I]]) In the [[Late Antique]] period the interest in an individual likeness declined considerably, and most portraits in late Roman coins and [[consular diptych]]s are hardly individualized at all, although at the same time [[Early Christian art]] was evolving fairly standardized images for the [[depiction of Jesus]] and the other major figures in Christian art, such as [[John the Baptist]], and [[Saint Peter]].

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Wilton diptych.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The small private [[Wilton Diptych]] for [[Richard II of England]], c. 1400, with stamped gold backgrounds and much [[ultramarine]].]]  
Most early medieval portraits were [[donor portrait]]s, initially mostly of popes in Roman [[mosaic]]s, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, an example being a self-portrait by the writer, mystic, scientist, illuminator, and musician [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1152).&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Faxon, and Russo, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  As with contemporary coins, there was little attempt at a likeness.  Stone [[tomb monument]]s spread in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period.   Between 1350-1400, secular figures began to reappear in frescos and [[panel painting]]s, such as in [[Master Theodoric]]'s ''Charles IV receiving fealty'',&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, ''The Illustrated Library of Art'', Portland House, New York, 1986, p. 297, {{ISBN|0-517-62336-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portraits once again became clear likenesses.  Around the end of the century, the first oil portraits of contemporary individuals, painted on small wood panels, emerged in Burgundy and France, first as profiles, then in other views.  The [[Wilton Diptych]] of ca. 1400 is one of two surviving panel portraits of [[Richard II of England]], the earliest English King for whom we have contemporary examples. Leading [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] masters of the portrait included [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Robert Campin]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]].  Portraits of donors began to be shown as present, or participate in the main sacred scenes shown, and in more private court images subjects even appeared as significant figures such as the [[Virgin Mary]].

===Renaissance===
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - 1500 self-portrait (High resolution and detail).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Albrecht Dürer]], ''[[Self-Portrait (Dürer)|Self-Portrait]]'', 1500]]

The [[Renaissance]] marked a turning point in the history of portraiture. Partly out of interest in the natural world and partly out of interest in the classical cultures of ancient Greece and Rome, portraits—both painted and sculpted—were given an important role in Renaissance society and valued as objects, and as depictions of earthly success and status.  Painting in general reached a new level of balance, harmony, and insight, and the greatest artists (Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael) were considered "geniuses", rising far above the tradesman status to valued servants of the court and the church.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Many innovations in the various forms of portraiture evolved during this fertile period. The tradition of the [[portrait miniature]] began, which remained popular until the age of photography, developing out of the skills of painters of [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|the miniatures in illuminated manuscripts]]. Profile portraits, inspired by ancient medallions, were particularly popular in Italy between 1450 and 1500. Medals, with their two–sided images, also inspired a short-lived vogue for two-sided paintings early in the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Classical sculpture, such as the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'', also influenced the choice of poses utilized by Renaissance portraitists, poses that have continued in usage through the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern European artists led the way in realistic portraits of secular subjects.  The greater realism and detail of the Northern artists during the 15th century was due in part to the finer brush strokes and effects possible with [[oil painting|oil colors]], while the Italian and Spanish painters were still using [[tempera]].  Among the earliest painters to develop oil technique was [[Jan van Eyck]]. Oil colors can produce more texture and grades of thickness, and can be layered more effectively, with the addition of increasingly thick layers one over another (known by painters as ‘fat over lean’).  Also, oil colors dry more slowly, allowing the artist to make changes readily, such as altering facial details. [[Antonello da Messina]] was one of the first Italians to take advantage of oil. Trained in Belgium, he settled in Venice around 1475, and was a major influence on [[Giovanni Bellini]] and the Northern Italian school.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 54, 63&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, oil as a medium spread in popularity throughout Europe, allowing for more sumptuous renderings of clothing and jewelry.  Also affecting the quality of the images, was the switch from [[panel painting|wood]] to [[canvas#For painting|canvas]], starting in Italy in the early part of the 16th century and spreading to Northern Europe over the next century. Canvas resists cracking better than wood, holds pigments better, and needs less preparation―but it was initially much scarcer than wood.

Early on, the Northern Europeans abandoned the profile, and started producing portraits of realistic volume and perspective. In the Netherlands, [[Jan van Eyck]] was a leading portraitist. ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait|The Arnolfini Marriage]]'' (1434, [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], London) is a landmark of Western art, an early example of a full-length couple portrait, superbly painted in rich colors and exquisite detail. But equally important, it showcases the newly developed technique of oil painting pioneered by van Eyck, which revolutionized art, and spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''[[Portrait of Sir Thomas More (Holbein)|Portrait of Sir Thomas More]]'', 1527]]

Leading German portrait artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] who all mastered oil painting technique. Cranach was one of the first artists to paint life-sized full-length commissions, a tradition popular from then on.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, England had no portrait painters of the first rank, and artists like Holbein were in demand by English patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; His painting of [[Sir Thomas More]] (1527), his first important patron in England, has nearly the realism of a photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; Holbein made his great success painting the royal family, including [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  Dürer was an outstanding draftsman and one of the first major artists to make a sequence of self-portraits, including a full-face painting. He also placed his self-portrait figure (as an onlooker) in several of his religious paintings.&lt;ref name="Bonafoux, p. 35"&gt;Bonafoux, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer began making self-portraits at the age of thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, pp. 124-126&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Rembrandt would amplify that tradition.

In Italy, [[Masaccio]] led the way in modernizing the fresco by adopting more realistic perspective. [[Filippo Lippi]] paved the way in developing sharper contours and sinuous lines&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; and his pupil [[Raphael]] extended realism in Italy to a much higher level in the following decades with his monumental wall paintings.&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 20"&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the betrothal portrait became popular, a particular specialty of [[Lorenzo Lotto]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early Renaissance, portrait paintings were generally small and sometimes covered with protective lids, hinged or sliding.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Renaissance, the Florentine and Milanese nobility, in particular, wanted more realistic representations of themselves.  The challenge of creating convincing full and three-quarter views stimulated experimentation and innovation.  [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Lorenzo di Credi]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and other artists expanded their technique accordingly, adding portraiture to traditional religious and classical subjects. Leonardo and [[Pisanello]] were among the first Italian artists to add allegorical symbols to their secular portraits.&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 20"/&gt;

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or ''La Gioconda'', 1503–1505/1507]]

One of best-known portraits in the Western world is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting titled ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', named for [[Lisa del Giocondo]],&lt;ref name="subject"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mona Lisa – Heidelberger Fund klärt Identität (English: Mona Lisa – Heidelberger find clarifies identity)|language=German|url=http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/news/monalisa.html|publisher=[[University of Heidelberg]]|accessdate=2008-08-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206113230/http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/news/monalisa.html|archivedate=2008-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German experts crack the ID of ‘Mona Lisa’ |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22652514/?GT1=10755 |publisher=[[MSN]] |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2008-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116210319/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22652514/?GT1=10755 |archivedate=2008-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Researchers Identify Model for Mona Lisa |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/arts/AP-Art-Mona-Who.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-08-29 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the Gherardini family of [[Florence]] and [[Tuscany]] and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo.  The famous "Mona Lisa smile" is an excellent example of applying subtle asymmetry to a face.  In his notebooks, Leonardo advises on the qualities of light in portrait painting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A very high degree of grace in the light and shadow is added to the faces of those who sit in the doorways of rooms that are dark, where the eyes of the observer see the shadowed part of the face obscured by the shadows of the room, and see the lighted part of the face with the greater brilliance which the air gives it. Through this increase in the shadows and the lights, the face is given greater relief.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, pp. 103-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leonardo was a student of [[Verrocchio]].  After becoming a member of the Guild of Painters, he began to accept independent commissions. Owing to his wide-ranging interests and in accordance with his scientific mind, his output of drawings and preliminary studies is immense though his finished artistic output is relatively small. His other memorable portraits included those of noblewomen ''Ginevra de’ Benci'' and ''Cecilia Gallerani''.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

Raphael's surviving commission portraits are far more numerous than those of Leonardo, and they display a greater variety of poses, lighting, and technique. Rather than producing revolutionary innovations, Raphael's great accomplishment was strengthening and refining the evolving currents of Renaissance art.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly expert in the group portrait. His masterpiece ''[[the School of Athens]]'' is one of the foremost group frescoes, containing likenesses of Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante, and Raphael himself, in the guise of ancient philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pascal Bonafoux]], ''Portraits of the Artist: The Self-Portrait in Painting'', Skira/Rizzoli, New York, 1985, p. 31, {{ISBN|0-8478-0586-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the first group portrait of artists. Decades earlier, [[Paolo Uccello]] had painted a group portrait including [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], [[Antonio Manetti]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].&lt;ref name="Bonafoux, p. 35"/&gt; As he rose in prominence, Raphael became a favorite portraitist of the popes. While many Renaissance artists eagerly accepted portrait commissions, a few artists refused them, most notably Raphael's rival [[Michelangelo]], who instead undertook the huge commissions of the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 20"/&gt;

In Venice around 1500, [[Gentile Bellini]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]] dominated portrait painting. They received the highest commissions from the leading officials of the state.  Bellini's portrait of Doge Loredan is considered to be one of the finest portraits of the Renaissance and ably demonstrates the artist's mastery of the newly arrived techniques of oil painting.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Bellini is also one of the first artists in Europe to sign their work, though he rarely dated them.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 16th century, [[Titian]] assumed much the same role, particularly by expanding the variety of poses and sittings of his royal subjects. Titian was perhaps the first great child portraitist.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; After Titian succumbed to the plague, [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] became leading Venetian artists, helping the transition to Italian [[Mannerism]].  The Mannerists contributed many exceptional portraits that emphasized material richness and elegantly complex poses, as in the works of [[Agnolo Bronzino]] and [[Jacopo da Pontormo]]. Bronzino made his fame portraying the [[Medici]] family. His daring portrait of [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], shows the austere ruler in armor with a wary eye gazed to his extreme right, in sharp contrast to most royal paintings which show their sitters as benign sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; [[El Greco]], who trained in Venice for twelve years, went in a more extreme direction after his arrival in Spain, emphasizing his "inner vision" of the sitter to the point of diminishing the reality of physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the best portraitists of 16th-century Italy was [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] from Cremona, who infused her individual and group portraits with new levels of complexity.
   
Court portraiture in France began when Flemish artist [[Jean Clouet]] painted his opulent likeness of [[Francis I of France]] around 1525.&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 187"&gt;John Hope-Hennessy, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; King Francis was a great patron of artists and an avaricious art collector who invited Leonardo da Vinci to live in France during his later years. The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' stayed in France after Leonardo died there.&lt;ref name="John Hope-Hennessy, p. 187"/&gt;

===Baroque and Rococo===

During the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods (17th and 18th centuries, respectively), portraits became even more important records of status and position. In a society dominated increasingly by secular leaders in powerful courts, images of opulently attired figures were a means to affirm the authority of important individuals. Flemish painters [[Sir Anthony van Dyck]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens]] excelled at this type of portraiture, while [[Jan Vermeer]] produced portraits mostly of the middle class, at work and play indoors. Rubens’ portrait of himself and his first wife (1609) in their wedding attire is a virtuoso example of the couple portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Rubens fame extended beyond his art—he was a courtier, diplomat, art collector, and successful businessman.  His studio was one of the most extensive of that time, employing specialists in still-life, landscape, animal and genre scenes, in addition to portraiture. Van Dyck trained there for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, pp. 408-410&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles I of England]] first employed Rubens, then imported van Dyck as his court painter, knighting him and bestowing on him courtly status. Van Dyck not only adapted Rubens’ production methods and business skills, but also his elegant manners and appearance. As was recorded, "He always went magnificently dress’d, had a numerous and gallant equipage, and kept so noble a table in his apartment, that few princes were not more visited, or better serv’d."&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]] dominated in much the same way, as a remarkable chronicler of royalty, painting the portraits of five French kings.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the innovations of Renaissance art was the improved rendering of facial expressions to accompany different emotions. In particular, Dutch painter [[Rembrandt]] explored the many expressions of the human face, especially as one of the premier self-portraitists (of which he painted over 60 in his lifetime).&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; This interest in the human face also fostered the creation of the first caricatures, credited to the Carracci Academy, run by painters of the Carracci family in the late 16th century in Bologna, Italy (see [[Annibale Carracci]]).

[[File:Retrato del Papa Inocencio X. Roma, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumb|right|[[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], ''[[Pope Innocent X]]'', c. 1650, [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]], Rome.]]
    
Group portraits were produced in great numbers during the Baroque period, particularly in the Netherlands. Unlike in the rest of Europe, Dutch artists received no commissions from the Calvinist Church which had forbidden such images or from the aristocracy which was virtually non-existent. Instead, commissions came from civic and businesses associations. Dutch painter [[Frans Hals]] used fluid brush strokes of vivid color to enliven his group portraits, including those of the civil guards to which he belonged. [[Rembrandt]] benefitted greatly from such commissions and from the general appreciation of art by bourgeois clients, who supported portraiture as well as still-life and landscapes painting. In addition, the first significant art and dealer markets flourished in Holland at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

With plenty of demand, Rembrandt was able to experiment with unconventional composition and technique, such as [[chiaroscuro]]. He demonstrated these innovations, pioneered by Italian masters such as [[Caravaggio]], most notably in his famous ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642).&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp|''The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp'' (1632)]] is another fine example of Rembrandt's mastery of the group painting, in which he bathes the corpse in bright light to draw attention to the center of the painting while the clothing and background merge into black, making the faces of the surgeon and the students standout.  It is also the first painting that Rembrandt signed with his full name.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;
    
In Spain, [[Diego Velázquez]] painted ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (1656), one of the most famous and enigmatic group portraits of all time.  It memorializes the artist and the children of the Spanish royal family, and apparently the sitters are the royal couple who are seen only as reflections in a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Starting out as primarily a genre painter, Velázquez quickly rose to prominence as the court painter of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], excelling in the art of portraiture, particularly in extending the complexity of group portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

Rococo artists, who were particularly interested in rich and intricate ornamentation, were masters of the refined portrait. Their attention to the details of dress and texture increased the efficacy of portraits as testaments to worldly wealth, as evidenced by [[François Boucher]]'s famous portraits of Madame de Pompadour attired in billowing silk gowns.

[[File:The Blue Boy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Gainsborough]], ''[[The Blue Boy]]'', c.1770, [[Huntington Library]], [[San Marino, California]]]]

The first major native portrait painters of the British school were English painters [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], who also specialized in clothing their subjects in an eye-catching manner.  Gainsborough's ''[[The Blue Boy|Blue Boy]]'' is one of the most famous and recognized portraits of all time, painted with very long brushes and thin oil color to achieve the shimmering effect of the blue costume.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Gainsborough was also noted for his elaborate background settings for his subjects.

The two British artists had opposite opinions on using assistants.  Reynolds employing them regularly (sometimes doing only 20 percent of the painting himself) while Gainsborough rarely did.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 13, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a client would extract a pledge from the artist, as did Sir Richard Newdegate from portraitist [[Peter Lely]] (van Dyck's successor in England), who promised that the portrait  would be "from the Beginning to ye end drawne with my owne hands."&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the exactitude employed by the Flemish masters, Reynolds summed up his approach to portraiture by stating that, "the grace, and, we may add, the likeness, consists more in taking the general air, than in observing the exact similitude of every feature."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Also prominent in England was [[William Hogarth]], who dared to buck conventional methods by introducing touches of humor in his portraits.  His "Self-portrait with Pug" is clearly more a humorous take on his pet than a self-indulgent painting.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, female painters gained new importance, particularly in the field of portraiture. Notable female artists include French painter [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]], Italian pastel artist [[Rosalba Carriera]], and Swiss artist [[Angelica Kauffman]].  Also during that century, before the invention of photography, miniature portraits―painted with incredible precision and often encased in gold or enameled lockets―were highly valued.

In the United States, [[John Singleton Copley]], schooled in the refined British manner, became the leading painter of full-size and miniature portraits, with his hyper-realistic pictures of [[Samuel Adams]] and [[Paul Revere]] especially well-regarded.  Copley is also notable for his efforts to merge portraiture with the academically more revered art of history painting, which he attempted with his group portraits of famous military men.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Equally famous was [[Gilbert Stuart]] who painted over 1,000 portraits and was especially known for his presidential portraiture. Stuart painted over 100 replicas of [[George Washington]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart worked quickly and employed softer, less detailed brush strokes than Copley to capture the essence of his subjects. Sometimes he would make several versions for a client, allowing the sitter to pick their favorite.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for his rosy cheek tones, Stuart wrote, "flesh is like no other substance under heaven.  It has all the gaiety of the silk-mercer's shop without its gaudiness of gloss, and all the softness of old mahogany, without its sadness." &lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent American portraitists of the colonial era were [[John Smibert]], [[Thomas Sully]], [[Ralph Earl]], [[John Trumbull]], [[Benjamin West]], [[Robert Feke]], [[James Peale]], [[Charles Willson Peale]], and [[Rembrandt Peale]].

===19th century===
[[File:Michałowski Artist's daughter on horseback.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Piotr Michałowski]], ''Artist's daughter on horseback'', ca 1853, [[National Museum in Warsaw]]]]
In the late 18th century and early 19th century, [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] artists continued the tradition of depicting subjects in the latest fashions, which for women by then, meant diaphanous gowns derived from ancient Greek and Roman clothing styles. The artists used directed light to define texture and the simple roundness of faces and limbs. French painters [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] demonstrated virtuosity in this draftsman-like technique as well as a keen eye for character.  Ingres, a student of David, is notable for his portraits in which a mirror is painted behind the subject to simulate a rear view of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; His portrait of Napoleon on his imperial throne is a tour de force of regal portraiture. (see Gallery below)

[[Romanticism|Romantic]] artists who worked during the first half of the 19th century painted portraits of inspiring leaders, beautiful women, and agitated subjects, using lively brush strokes and dramatic, sometimes moody, lighting. French artists [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[Théodore Géricault]] painted particularly fine portraits of this type, especially dashing horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of artist of romantic period in [[Poland]], who practised a horserider portrait was [[Piotr Michałowski]] (1800-1855). Also noteworthy is Géricault's series of portraits of mental patients (1822–1824).  Spanish painter [[Francisco de Goya]] painted some of the most searching and provocative images of the period, including ''[[La maja desnuda]] ''(c. 1797-1800), as well as famous court portraits of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]].

[[File:EakinsTheGrossClinic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Thomas Eakins]], ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'', 1875]]
The [[Realism (arts)|realist]] artists of the 19th century, such as [[Gustave Courbet]], created objective portraits depicting lower and middle-class people.  Demonstrating his romanticism, Courbet painted several self-portraits showing himself in varying moods and expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Other French realists include [[Honoré Daumier]] who produced many caricatures of his contemporaries.  [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] chronicled some of the famous performers of the theater, including Jane Avril, capturing them in motion.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt; French painter [[Édouard Manet]], was an important transitional artist whose work hovers between realism and [[impressionism]]. He was a portraitist of outstanding insight and technique, with his painting of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] being a good example of his transitional style.  His contemporary [[Edgar Degas]] was primarily a realist and his painting ''[[Portrait of the Bellelli Family]]'' is an insightful rendering of an unhappy family and one of his finest portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, [[Thomas Eakins]] reigned as the premier portrait painter, taking realism to a new level of frankness, especially with his two portraits of surgeons at work, as well as those of athletes and musicians in action.  In many portraits, such as "Portrait of Mrs. Edith Mahon", Eakins boldly conveys the unflattering emotions of sorrow and melancholy.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  
    
[[File:VanGogh 1887 Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'', 1887]]   
   
The Realists mostly gave way to the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] by the 1870s.  Partly due to their meager incomes, many of the Impressionists relied on family and friends to model for them, and they painted intimate groups and single figures in either outdoors or in light-filled interiors. Noted for their shimmering surfaces and rich dabs of paint, Impressionist portraits are often disarmingly intimate and appealing. French painters [[Claude Monet]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] created some of the most popular images of individual sitters and groups. American artist [[Mary Cassatt]], who trained and worked in France, is popular even today for her engaging paintings of mothers and children, as is Renoir.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 589"&gt;Piper, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]], both [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]], painted revealing portraits of people they knew, swirling in color but not necessarily flattering.  They are equally, if not more so, celebrated for their powerful self-portraits.

[[John Singer Sargent]] also spanned the change of century, but he rejected overt Impressionism and Post-Impressionism.  He was the most successful portrait painter of his era, using a mostly realistic technique often effused with the brilliant use of color. He was equally apt at individual and group portraits, particularly of upper-class families. Sargent was born in Florence, Italy to American parents. He studied in Italy and Germany, and in Paris. Sargent is considered to be the last major exponent of the British portrait tradition beginning with van Dyck.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 589"/&gt; Another prominent American portraitist who trained abroad was [[William Merritt Chase]].  American society painter [[Cecilia Beaux]], called the "female Sargent", was born of a French father, studied abroad and gained success back home, sticking with traditional methods. Another portraitist compared to Sargent for his lush technique was Italian-born Parisian artist [[Giovanni Boldini]], a friend of Degas and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]].

American-born Internationalist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was well-connected with European artists and also painted some exceptional portraits, most famously his ''Arrangement in Grey and Black, The Artist's Mother'' (1871), also known as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; Even with his portraits, as with his tonal landscapes, Whistler wanted his viewers to focus on the harmonic arrangement of form and color in his paintings. Whistler used a subdued palette to create his intended effects, stressing color balance and soft tones.  As he stated, "as music is the poetry of sound, so is painting the poetry of sight, and the subject-matter has nothing to do with the harmony of sound or of color."&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Form and color were also central to [[Cézanne]]'s portraits, while even more extreme color and brush stroke technique dominate the portraits by [[André Derain]], and [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 576&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of photography in the 19th century had a significant effect on portraiture, supplanting the earlier [[camera obscura]] which had also been previously used as an aid in painting. Many modernists flocked to the photography studios to have their portraits made, including [[Baudelaire]] who, though he proclaimed photography an "enemy of art", found himself attracted to photography's frankness and power.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 552&lt;/ref&gt; By providing a cheap alternative, photography supplanted much of the lowest level of portrait painting.  Some realist artists, such as [[Thomas Eakins]] and [[Edgar Degas]], were enthusiastic about camera photography and found it to be a useful aid to composition.  From the Impressionists forward, portrait painters found a myriad number of ways to reinterpret the portrait to compete effectively with photography.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Sargent and Whistler were among those stimulated to expand their technique to create effects that the camera could not capture.

===20th century===

Other early 20th-century artists also expanded the repertoire of portraiture in new directions. [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] artist [[Henri Matisse]] produced powerful portraits using non-naturalistic, even garish, colors for skin tones. [[Cézanne]]'s relied on highly simplified forms in his portraits, avoiding detail while emphasizing color juxtapositions.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 582&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian [[Gustav Klimt]]'s unique style applied Byzantine motifs and gold paint to his memorable portraits.  His pupil [[Oskar Kokoschka]] was an important portraitist of the Viennese upper class.  Prolific Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]] painted many portraits, including several [[Cubism|cubist]] renderings of his mistresses, in which the likeness of the subject is grossly distorted to achieve an emotional statement well beyond the bounds of normal caricature.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  
An outstanding female portrait painter of the turn of the 20th century, associated with the [[French impressionism]],  was [[Olga Boznańska]] (1865-1940).
[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painters provided some of the most haunting and compelling psychological studies ever produced. German artists such as [[Otto Dix]] and [[Max Beckmann]] produced notable examples of expressionist portraiture. Beckmann was a prolific self-portraitist, producing at least twenty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;Aymar, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amedeo Modigliani]] painted many portraits in his elongated style which depreciated the "inner person" in favor of strict studies of form and color. To help achieve this, he de-emphasized the normally expressive eyes and eyebrows to the point of blackened slits and simple arches.&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 646&lt;/ref&gt;

British art was represented by the [[Vorticists]], who painted some notable portraits in the early part of the 20th century. The [[Dada]] painter [[Francis Picabia]] executed numerous portraits in his unique fashion.  Additionally, [[Tamara de Lempicka]]'s portraits successfully captured the [[Art Deco]] era with her streamlined curves, rich colors and sharp angles. In America, [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]] were fine portraitists of the 1920s and 1930s of the American realist school.  [[Max Ernst]] produced an example of a modern collegial portrait with his 1922 painting ''All Friends Together''.&lt;ref&gt;Bonafoux, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant contribution to the development of portrait painting of 1930-2000 was made by Russian artists, mainly working in the traditions of realist and figurative painting. Among them should be called [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Nikolai Fechin]], [[Abram Arkhipov]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sergei Ivanov (Art historian)|Sergei V. Ivanov]]. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' - Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – 448 p. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Portrait production in Europe (excluding Russia)  and the Americas generally declined in the 1940s and 1950s, a result of the increasing interest in abstraction and nonfigurative art.  One exception, however, was [[Andrew Wyeth]] who developed into the leading American realist portrait painter.  With Wyeth, realism, though overt, is secondary to the tonal qualities and mood of his paintings. This is aptly demonstrated with his landmark series of paintings known as the "Helga" pictures, the largest group of portraits of a single person by any major artist (247 studies of his neighbor Helga Testorf, clothed and nude, in varying surroundings, painted during the period 1971–1985).&lt;ref&gt;’’An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art, Boston, 1987, Little Brown &amp; Company, p. 123, {{ISBN|0-8212-1652-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s and 1970s, there was a revival of portraiture. English artists such as [[Lucian Freud]] (grandson of [[Sigmund Freud]]) and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] have produced powerful paintings. Bacon's portraits are notable for their nightmarish quality. In May 2008, Freud's 1995 portrait ''[[Benefits Supervisor Sleeping]]'' was sold by auction by [[Christie's]] in New York City for $33.6 million, setting a world record for sale value of a painting by a living artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Freud work sets new world record | date = 14 May 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7398949.stm | publisher = BBC News Online | accessdate = 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many contemporary American artists, such as [[Andy Warhol]], [[Alex Katz]] and [[Chuck Close]], have made the human face a focal point of their work. 

Warhol was one of the most prolific portrait painters in the 20th-century. Warhol's painting ''[[Shot Marilyns|Orange Shot Marilyn]]'' of [[Marilyn Monroe]] is an iconic early example off his work from the 1960s, and [[Prince (painting)|Orange Prince (1984)]] of the pop singer [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] is later example, both exhibiting Warhol's unique graphic style of portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.widewalls.ch/10-faces-by-andy-warhol-february-2015/mao-tse-tung-8/|title=Andy Warhol Portraits That Changed The World Forever|last=|first=|date=|work=Widewalls|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/61240|title=Andy Warhol.

Close's specialty was huge, hyper-realistic wall-sized "head" portraits based on photographic images. [[Jamie Wyeth]] continues in the realist tradition of his father Andrew, producing famous portraits whose subjects range from Presidents to pigs.

==Disney==

===Animated film===
{{main|Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)}}
'''Alice''' is the main character of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[animated film]] ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. Alice is portrayed as being very curious, often seen daydreaming and giving herself advice instead of listening to the advice of others. The closest thing Alice has to a friend is Dinah, her kitten, and not even she understands Alice's dreams of finding "a world of her own." Alice is well mannered, polite, courteous, mature and has an elegance and gentleness of a young woman, although once she falls into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]] she finds it harder and harder to maintain her composure. She is shown to be determined, but her determination is often overpowered by her temper, seeing as she does not give up on finding the [[White Rabbit]] until she gets frustrated, and is easily put off by rudeness. She wears a blue balloon-shaped gown with a white pinafore apron over-top, white stockings, black Mary Jane shoes, white bloomers over her stockings and under her dress, and a black hair bow.

''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' had served as inspiration for [[Walt Disney]]'s earlier [[Alice Comedies]].&lt;ref name="walt disney"/&gt; By 1931, he had "storyboards and sketches" for a film adaptation of the children's novel; however, the release of [[Alice in Wonderland (1931 film)|another ''Alice'' film]] during the same year caused him to put the project on hold.&lt;ref name="walt disney"/&gt; With the conclusion of [[World War II]], Disney considered the film again, planning it to be a combination of live-action and animation starring [[Ginger Rogers]] as Alice.&lt;ref name="walt disney"/&gt; In 1946, however, Disney decided to drop the live-action aspect of his ''Alice'' film and make it completely animated instead.&lt;ref name="walt disney"/&gt; For the voice of Alice, he wanted one "that would be English enough to satisfy British audiences and preserve the feeling of an English literary classic, but not so English that it would put off American audiences."&lt;ref name="walt disney"&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Disney Magic Every Day of Your Life|year=2004|last1=Williams|first1=Pat|last2=Denney|first2=James|location=[[Deerfield Beach, Florida]]|publisher=Health Communications|pages=162–4|isbn=978-0-757302312|oclc=55109141}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that in young actress [[Kathryn Beaumont]], when watching her in ''[[On an Island with You]]''.&lt;ref name="walt disney"/&gt; Successfully auditioning for the role of Alice, Beaumont voiced the character and acted as reference material for the animators: her acting was recorded and used by them to animate the character.&lt;ref name="walt disney"/&gt; During the recording of her voice acting, Beaumont dressed as Alice to better aid her with "getting into character".&lt;ref name="walt disney"/&gt; Despite not being trained as a singer, she also provided Alice's singing voice, as Disney envisioned the songs as possessing a "childlike feel" to them.&lt;ref name="walt disney"/&gt; 
 
She also appears in many episodes of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' and in the direct-to-video releases ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''. She is now voiced by [[Hynden Walch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hynden.wordpress.com/category/from-the-workshop/ All About Hynden!] Retrieved 29 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Alice can be seen as a meetable character in the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]]. Alice can also be considered an unofficial [[Disney Princess]], seeing as she appears in many instances of Disney Princess art, videos and other media (such as being a 'Princess of Heart' in Kingdom Hearts). In the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]],'' Alice is mentioned as "Allyson Wonderland" on some graffiti written on the bathroom wall in Toontown.

===Disney Princess===
Alice has appeared in official Disney Princess art, and is included in the Disney Princess music video "It's Not Just Make Believe" and "The Perfect Princess Tea" with the then eight official princesses, though she still remains excluded from the official lineup (see [[Disney Princess]]). It's also interesting to point out that despite not being recognized as an official Disney Princess, Alice was crowned Queen of the Looking-Glass Kingdom in Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There."

===Kingdom Hearts series===
Alice is featured as a character in the video game series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. She is the second Princess of Heart encountered in the game and her world, Wonderland, is also the second Disney-based world visited. Alice also appears in the sequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', as a figment of the memories of Sora, the game's protagonist. She is also present in ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded]]'', as a data-based version from Jiminy's Journal. Though she does not make an appearance in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', she, along with all of the other Princesses of Heart, was referenced. In the Japanese version she was voiced by [[Mika Doi]], and in the English version Alice was originally voiced by her original voice actress Kathryn Beaumont for ''Kingdom Hearts'', but following her retirement from the role, Alice was voiced by Beaumont's replacement Hyden Walch for the HD Cinematics of ''Re:Coded'' in ''[[Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix]]''.

===Disney Magical World===
Wonderland is one of the four Disney movie-themed worlds accessible in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game "[[Disney Magical World]]," and several characters from the film appear in the game, including Alice herself. The player may also collect items and clothing pieces inspired by the Disney movie.

===Tim Burton film===
{{main|Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)}}
'''Alice Mollinia Kingsleigh''' ([[Mia Wasikowska]]) is a 19-year-old young girl "who doesn't quite fit into Victorian society and structure."&lt;ref name="d23"/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph100215&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Salisbury | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/7205720/Tim-Burton-and-Johnny-Depp-interview-for-Alice-In-Wonderland.html | title = Tim Burton and Johnny Depp interview for Alice In Wonderland | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | publisher=Telegraph Media Group | date = 15 February 2010 | accessdate = 15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her return to Wonderland - having previously visited it as a child, although she has since forgotten it as anything other than a dream, and now required to return to defeat the [[Jabberwocky]] - "becomes a rite of passage as she discovers her voice and herself."&lt;ref name="d23"&gt;{{cite news| first = Mark | last =Salisbury |url= |title=Through Tim Burton's Looking Glass|work= Disney 23|date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news| first = Jonathan | last = Morrison |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6995090.ece?slideshowPopup=true&amp;articleId=6995090&amp;nSlide=2&amp;sectionName=Film |title=Exclusive: sneak peek at Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland|work= [[The Times]] | publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=20 January 2010|accessdate=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made Alice the opposite.&lt;ref name="nytfeb2610"&gt;{{cite news| first = Larry | last = Rohter |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/movies/28alice.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Drinking Blood: New Wonders of Alice’s World |work= The New York Times | publisher=|date=26 February 2010|accessdate=26 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100304064805/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/movies/28alice.html?pagewanted=1| archivedate= 4 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls, describing the character as "stubborn, brave, [and] non-girlie."&lt;ref name="nytfeb2610"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indeprm"&gt;{{cite news| first = Liz | last = Hoggard |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/liz-hoggard-revenge-of-the-lifesavvy-over40s-1909603.html |title=Liz Hoggard: Revenge of the life-savvy over-40s: Burton's Alice – a role model for girls of 2010 |work= [[The Independent]] | publisher= |date=25 February 2010|accessdate=27 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100227035519/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/liz-hoggard-revenge-of-the-lifesavvy-over40s-1909603.html| archivedate= 27 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alice is portrayed in the movie as a pretty young girl with a calm, serene disposition and a soothing voice tone.

===''Once Upon a Time in Wonderland''===
Alice is the central character in the 2013 fantasy series ''[[Once Upon a Time in Wonderland]]'' (a spin-off to ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') portrayed by [[Sophie Lowe]]. The story is set in a fictional Victorian England-theme world and takes place after Alice has returned from Wonderland. Due to the stories she tells about the hookah-smoking caterpillar and Cyrus, played by [[Peter Gadiot]], the genie she fell in love with and believed to be dead, she is declared insane and placed in London’s Bethlem Asylum.  The doctors decide that the best treatment for Alice is a procedure that will make her forget Wonderland and all of the events that happened there. Alice, wanting to forget her painful past, agrees to the procedure. The night before the procedure, the White Rabbit, voiced by [[John Lithgow]], and the Knave of Hearts, played by [[Michael Socha]] arrive in the asylum and tell Alice that Cyrus is not dead but may be in danger. Hearing this, Alice agrees to go back to Wonderland and help find her true love. It is later revealed that Cyrus is being held prisoner by Jafar (played by [[Naveen Andrews]]) who wants to use Cyrus’ magic to take over Wonderland and who is also working with the evil Red Queen (played by [[Emma Rigby]]). 
Throughout the series, Alice and the Knave of Hearts work together to try and rescue Cyrus and stop the Red Queen and Jafar from wrecking more havoc in Wonderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Once Upon a Time in Wonderland|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/once-upon-a-time-in-wonderland|work=abc.go.com|publisher=ABC Television Network|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Once Upon a Time''===

Alice is a recurring character in Season Seven of the fantasy series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', portrayed by [[Rose Reynolds]]. She is the daughter of the Wish Realm version of [[Killian Jones]] (played by [[Colin O'Donoghue]]) and [[Mother Gothel]] (played by [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]]). Alice is the lover of Robin, played by [[Tiera Skovbye]], who is the daughter of [[Robin Hood]] ([[Sean Maguire]]) and [[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena]] ([[Rebecca Mader]]). Her cursed identity in Hyperion Heights was "Tilly".

==Appearances in other media==
Besides the books and the Disney film, Alice has appeared in many other works.
In 1987 film ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', she is a young and shy blonde girl with an apparent self-esteem problem, as she thinks that she is not "special," until the Care Bears decide she is the girl who more closely resembles the missing Princess of Wonderland, so Alice takes the place of the Princess and ultimately learns to believe in herself. In this film, Alice is shown wearing casual clothing (a white shirt with a pink stripe, purple pants, blue jacket and pink shoes) and having a ponytail in her hair.

In the early 70's psychedelic themed psa Curious Alice, a young girl learns about drug use in wonderland.

She appears in [[Atlus]]' 1987 [[video game]] series ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' as a mini-boss and a usable demon, on whose role differs from each version. However, as most demons in ''Shin Megami Tensei'' come from mythology and folklore, it is theorized that Alice is actually based on a Scandinavian legend of a girl who died and kills bad children so that they can be friends in death, used to scare unruly children into behaving ("if you don't behave, Alice will come and take you away"). {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The Czech surrealist [[Jan Švankmajer]] retold the story in a very dark 1988 film titled simply ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]''. Kristýna Kohoutová portrayed her and her English dub was done by [[Camilla Power]]. [[Woody Allen]]'s film ''[[Alice (1990 film)|Alice]]'', while not a direct adaptation, did follow a woman who has a series of surreal adventures.

Alice also appears as an aging woman in [[Alan Moore]] and [[Melinda Gebbie]]'s 1991 pornographic graphic novel ''[[Lost Girls]]''. Here she is given the surname "Fairchild."

''[[Warehouse 13]]'', a Syfy channel TV series, featured an evil version of Alice during the second half of season 1. In the show, Lewis Carroll's books weren't fake, but chronicles based on Alice's adventures in Wonderland masquerading as fiction. The mirror she passed through, after enough uses, made Alice go "Mad as a Hatter", turning her into a sociopathic killer.

Alice has appeared in two manga  by [[Clamp (manga artists)|CLAMP]]: ''[[Miyuki-chan in Wonderland]]'' (1993) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=MacDonald |first=Christopher |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/miyuki-chan-in-wonderland/dvd |title=Miyuki-chan In Wonderland DVD |work=Anime News Network |date=9 April 2002 |accessdate=21 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Key Princess Story: Eternal Alice Rondo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alexander |first=Matthew |url=http://www.mania.com/key-princess-story-eternal-alice-rondo-vol-01_article_83008.html |title=Key Princess Story: Eternal Alice Rondo Vol. #01 |work=Mania |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606230147/http://www.mania.com/key-princess-story-eternal-alice-rondo-vol-01_article_83008.html |archivedate=6 June 2014 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pandora Hearts]] had Alice as the heroine but has a twin sister the white hair Alice The Intention of Abyss who are also based on the red queen and White Queen as well as Alice and her sister.They had Oz the B-Rabbit and Cheshire Cat as companions  were originally a stuff rabbit and a Cat but later become chains with human bodies.Their Mother of Lacie which is an anagram of Alice.

[[File:American McGee Alice cover.png|thumb|right|Box of ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'']]
In the 2000 PC game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'', Alice is portrayed as an older, dark-brown haired girl with emerald green eyes. In the game, Alice is a tortured young woman, who at a young age was orphaned when her parents and her sister were burned alive in an accidental fire caused by her cat Dinah. Afterward, she falls into a [[catatonic state]], and is condemned to Rutledge's Asylum for treatment. There she remains for many years, faced with her own [[survivor's guilt]] and the mistreatment of patients in the mental hospitals of the time. Then, the White Rabbit arrives in her cell and tells her she must return to Wonderland and save the creatures there from the tyrannical Queen of Hearts. By doing so, she not only saves Wonderland, but her own sanity.

In the 2011 sequel, ''[[Alice: Madness Returns]]'', Alice is again tormented by hallucinations of a corrupted Wonderland, being destroyed by the mysterious Infernal Train and increasingly blending with reality. Throughout the game, she battles the mysterious Ruin, a mark of the Train's influence on Alice's mind, while struggling to piece together her repressed memories of the fire that killed her parents and sister.

In [[Frank Beddor]]'s 2004 novel, ''[[The Looking Glass Wars]]'', an adaptation of the ''Alice'' books, Alice is re-imagined as Alyss Heart, the rightful heir to the throne of Wonderland and a warrior princess with magical powers of her own. The preface of the story is that Alyss fled to Earth where she met Lewis Carroll and told him her story. He turned it into a nonsensical fairytale in which he even misspelled her name.

Alice appears as a college-attending teenager alongside [[Wendy Darling]], [[Dorothy Gale]], and [[Susan Pevensie]] in Chicago of 2005 and 2006, in the comic book series ''[[The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles]].''

In the 2009 miniseries ''[[Alice (TV miniseries)|Alice]]'', Alice ([[Caterina Scorsone]]) is a 20-year-old judo instructor. A man named Jack Chase gives her the Stone of Wonderland before being kidnapped by the White Rabbit. Alice follows Jack to Wonderland, set 150 years after the original adventure, where the Red Queen rules the land.

In the 2011 anime ''[[Black Butler]]'' season 2, the main character is read Alice in Wonderland by his butler while in a coma. As a result, Ciel dreampt that he was Alice.

The '''Society for Art History in Switzerland''' ({{lang-de|Gesellschaft für Schweizerische Kunstgeschichte (GSK)}}, {{lang-fr|Société d'histoire de l'art en Suisse (SHAS)}}, {{lang-it|Società di storia dell' arte in Svizzera (SSAS)}}) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[learned society]] dedicated to promoting the understanding of Swiss [[art history]] and particularly of Swiss [[topography of art]], including the study and maintenance of Swiss [[cultural heritage]] sites.

The society founded in 1880 publishes a wide range of monographies, guides and inventories. These include the series ''Art monuments of Switzerland'' ({{lang-de|Kunstdenkmäler der Schweiz}}, {{lang-fr|Monuments d'art et d'histoire de la Suisse}}), which includes more than hundred volumes, the first of which was published in 1927. It also publishes the quarterly journal ''Kunst und Architektur in der Schweiz''.

==  The origins of the «Gesellschaft für schweizerische Kunstgeschichte» (Society for the history of art in Switzerland)  ==
===  Precursor of the Swiss National Museum and the Federal Commission of Historic Monuments  ===

The ''«Gesellschaft für schweizerische Kunstgeschichte GSK»'' ('''Society for the history of art in Switzerland''' SHAS), named thus since 1934, was founded in June 1880 in [[Zofingen]] under the name of the ''«Vaterländische Gesellschaft für Erhaltung historischer Denkmäler»'' (Patriotic Society for the preservation of historic monuments). Its creation was due to important personalities, members of the Schweizerischer Kunstverein (Swiss society of fine arts), and its first president was the [[Geneva]]n painter, [[Theodore de Saussure]], grandson of the celebrated naturalist [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]]. The vice-presidency was held by the [[Zurich]] art historian Johann Rudolf Rahn. The «Patriotic society for the preservation of historic monuments» had as its aim to preserve and restore architectural [[monument]]s, but also to save scattered works of art by bringing them together in museums, to arouse a better understanding for the «[[fine arts]]» and to support artists, painters and sculptors. In the statutes adopted at the meeting of this committee on 20 June 1880, the name of the society was altered to «Verein für Erhaltung vaterländischer Kunstdenkmäler» (Association for the preservation of artistic monuments of the fatherland). The regulations stipulated that the sums received must be divided and entered in the accounts in two equal shares to be used, on the one hand, to finance publications and, on the other hand, to buy works of art and old objects of value. This second part of the fund was also allocated for the restoration of [[historic monument]]s that were at risk of being destroyed or falling into ruin.

The association changed its name once more at the general meeting in [[Lausanne]] in 1881 to become the ''«Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Erhaltung historischer Kunstdenkmäler»'' (Swiss society for the preservation of historic art monuments). It then dealt mainly with buying items and buildings of national importance, without neglecting its publications. A brief treatise on the [[reliquary]] cross of [[Engelberg]] (end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century) appeared in 1881 from the pen of the art historian Johann Rudolf Rahn. The same author wrote a description of the [[stained glass]] window dating from 1530 in the Reformed Church of St Saphorin ([[Vaud]]), then an article on the Casa Borrani (or Serodine) in [[Ascona]] with its [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] façade.

At the general meeting in 1882, a request was made to set up an inventory of buildings requiring preservation or restoration works and of [[objets d'art]] which were at risk of being destroyed or sold.

In March 1884, the [[Federal Department of the Interior (Switzerland)|Federal Department of the Interior]] responded to a motion on the subject of the creation of a [[Swiss National Museum]] and entrusted the «Society for the preservation of historical art monuments» with the acquisition of a certain number of objects of its choice, but the ownership of which would revert to the Confederation. In the implementing ordinance of 25 February 1887, a Federal Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities of Switzerland was created and its competences and duties were passed to the committee of the «Society for the preservation of historical art monuments». In the same year, the statutes of the latter were adapted to its new function.

===  Creation of the Swiss National Museum  ===

In 1891, the [[Federal Council of Switzerland|Federal Council]] (Swiss Government) founded the Swiss National Museum with its head office in Zurich and the purchase of [[antiquities]] then no longer came within the competence of the «Society for the preservation of historical art monuments». This decision was confirmed on 12 March 1892. The Society continued its inventory, preservation and restoration work on historic works of art, and excavations. In 1896, Karl Stehlin, then President of the Society (1895–1898) who had succeeded Julius Kunkler (1888–1895), was called on to take charge of a new subsidiary research commission relating to the Roman period. [[Josef Zemp]] (1898–1904 and 1915–1916) and Albert Naef, who took over the presidency from Zemp between 1904 and 1915, pleaded for equality of treatment of the different old styles, rejecting any organisation of the periods into a hierarchy. They attached great importance to as complete a job of preservation as possible of the authentic work and a distinction between what was original and what was reconstructed, in order to avoid any pastiche. Starting from 1899, the «Anzeiger für schweizerische Altertumskunde» (Directory of Swiss Antiquities), published by the Swiss National Museum, served as the official organ of the «Society for the preservation of historical art monuments», complemented from 1901 on by the publication of the Communications in two editions, German and French. The first issue of this series was devoted to the stained-glass windows of the [[chancel]] of the church in [[Oberkirch, Switzerland|Oberkirch]] near [[Frauenfeld]] and the Weinmarkt (wine market) fountain in [[Lucerne]], with texts by Johann Rudolf Rahn and Josef Zemp. The state archivist Robert Durrer edited the statistics of the monuments of [[Obwalden]] and [[Nidwalden]], published in a supplement to the «Anzeiger für schweizerische Altertumskunde» and reprinted in 1971.

At the same time, in 1900 Paul Ganz suggested the establishment of a directory with photographs of old stained-glass windows in [[Switzerland]], as well as working drawings and designs of stained-glass windows. Appointed director of the Art Museum in [[Basle]], he succeeded in building up a small collection by 1902 which became the starting point of the «Archiv für schweizerische Kunstgeschichte» (Archives of the history of art in Switzerland). At the same time, Johann Rudolf Rahn began to draw up an inventory of Switzerland’s art and history monuments.

===  Creation of the «Eidgenössische Kommission für Denkmalpflege» (Federal Commission of Historic Monuments)  ===

In 1915, the Department of the Interior created a Federal Commission of Historic Monuments and the Society’s activity in the field of the preservation of monuments thus had to come to an end. Funds of 2000 francs – later 3000 – for «small restoration works» were, however, granted to the Society as consolation. These funds were paid until 1960. Having thus been successively relieved of two essential tasks, that is the acquisition or works of art and the preservation of monuments, the Society devoted itself from then on more intensely to the publication of works.

===  The «Inventar der Kunstdenkmäler der Schweiz» (Inventory of Monuments of art and history of Switzerland)  ===

In 1920, under the presidency of the Genevan architect Camille Martin (1916–1922), the scholarly inventory of Switzerland’s art and history monuments was able to commence: Samuel Guyer undertook the architectural inventory of the canton of [[Zurich (canton)|Zurich]], Linus Birchler that of the cantons of [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]] and [[Uri (canton)|Uri]]. The Society’s committee submitted a request for grants to the federal authorities and drew up rules in 1924 to determine the organisation of these far-reaching works. In 1925, in agreement with the Department of the Interior and various scholarly associations, the Society undertook the publication of the national inventory of the ''Monuments of art and history of Switzerland'' in close collaboration with the cantons. The first volume, devoted to three districts of the canton of Schwyz, that is [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]], [[March, Switzerland|March]] and [[Höfe District|Höfe]], appeared in 1927. It was the work of the architectural historian Linus Birchler, the first president of the Federal Commission of Historic Monuments.

Since then, more than 120 volumes of this collection have been published. They were complemented between 1982 and 2004 by the ''«Inventar der neueren Schweizer Architektur, 1850-1920 INSA»'' (Swiss inventory of architecture), a collection of eleven volumes. The «Society for the history of art in Switzerland» also publishes the ''«Schweizerischer Kunstführer»'' (Guides to Swiss monuments), a series launched in 1935 by Paul Ganz, of regional or cantonal guides, special issues touching on specific subjects linked to the history of art and architecture, as well as its quarterly revue ''«Kunst+Architektur in der Schweiz»'' (Art+Architecture in Switzerland).

[[File:Speculum75R.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacob's Ladder]] from a ''Speculum'' of c. 1430, pre-figuring the Ascension, right]]
[[File:Speculum 74v.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] from the same manuscript, see left. Danish Royal Library]]
The '''''Speculum Humanae Salvationis''''' or ''Mirror of Human Salvation'' was a bestselling anonymous illustrated work of popular theology in the [[late Middle Ages]], part of the genre of encyclopedic [[speculum literature]], in this case concentrating on the medieval theory of [[Typology (theology)|typology]], whereby the events of the [[Old Testament]] prefigured, or foretold, the events of the [[New Testament]].  The original version is in rhyming Latin verse, and contains a series of New Testament events each with three Old Testament ones that prefigure it.  It is one of the most common books found as an [[illuminated manuscript]], and also in early printing in both [[blockbook]] and [[incunabulum]] forms.

==Contents==
After a short Prologue (two pages) and Prohemium (four), both unillustrated, the first two chapters deal with the Creation, the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|Fall of Satan]], the story of [[Adam and Eve]] and the [[Deluge (mythology)#Genesis:|Deluge]] in four pages.  Then follow forty more double-page chapters where a [[New Testament]] event is compared with three from the [[Old Testament]], with four pictures each above a column of text. Usually each chapter occupies one two page opening.  The last three chapters cover the Seven [[Stations of the Cross]], and the [[Seven Joys of the Virgin|Seven Joys]] and [[Seven Sorrows of Mary|Sorrows]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]], at double this length.  In all a complete standard version has fifty-two leaves, or 104 pages, and 192 illustrations (including a blank page at the beginning and end).  The blockbook editions were much shorter, with 116 pictures, two to a woodblock.&lt;ref&gt;Hind p.245&lt;/ref&gt;  

The writing of the text follows an exact scheme: twenty-five lines per column, with two columns per page, one under each miniature, so a hundred lines per standard chapter.  Sometimes there are captions over the pictures as well, of varying content.  Many copies reduced the original text, often by omitting the non-standard chapters at the beginning or end, whilst others boosted the content with calendars and commentaries, or extra illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson pp.27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and manuscript copies==
[[File:IRHT 126277-p.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Miniature from a manuscript ''Speculum''. [[Eleazar Maccabeus]] kills the elephant and is crushed.]]
The work originated between 1309, as a reference to the [[Avignon Papacy|Pope being at Avignon]] indicates, and 1324, the date on two copies.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.26&lt;/ref&gt;  A preface, probably from the original manuscript, says the author does not give his name out of humility, though numerous suggestions have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  He was almost certainly a cleric, and there is evidence he was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ludolph of Saxony]] is a leading candidate for authorship, and [[Vincent of Beauvais]] has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.26–27&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first versions are naturally in [[illuminated manuscript]] form, and in Latin.  Many copies were made, and several hundred still survive (over 350 in Latin alone), often in translations into different vernacular languages; at least four different translations into French were made, and at least two into English.  There were also translations into German, Dutch, and Czech.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.10; Hind p.602&lt;/ref&gt; 

Manuscript versions covered the whole range of the manuscript market: some are lavishly and expensively decorated, for a de luxe market, whilst in many the illustrations are simple, and without colour.  In particular, superb Flemish editions were produced in the 15th century for [[Philip the Good]] and other wealthy bibliophiles.  The ''Speculum'' is probably the most popular title in this particular market of illustrated popular theology, competing especially with the ''[[Biblia pauperum]]'' and the ''[[Ars moriendi]]'' for the accolade.

==Printed editions==
[[File:LOC SHS.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Opening from a mixed [[blockbook]] and [[movable type]] Netherlandish edition, ca 1470]]
In the 15th century, with the advent of [[printing]], the work then appeared in four [[blockbook]] editions, two Latin and two in Dutch, and then in sixteen [[incunabulum]] editions by 1500. The blockbooks present unique questions as only editions of this work combine hand-rubbed [[woodcut]] pages with text pages printed in [[movable type]].  Further eccentricities include a run of twenty pages in one edition which are text cut as a woodcut, based on tracings of pages from another edition printed with movable type. Though the circumstances of production of these editions are unknown, two of the editions are in Dutch and the Netherlands was probably the centre of production, as with most blockbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Hind places them in Holland, from about 1470–75.&lt;ref&gt;Hind p.247&lt;/ref&gt;  It appears the ''Prohemium'' may have been sold separately as a pamphlet, as one version speaks of the usefulness of it for "poor preachers who cannot afford the entire book".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.120&lt;/ref&gt; 

The incunabulum editions, from eleven different presses, mostly, but not all, printed their [[woodcut]] illustrations in the [[printing press]] with the text.  Some seem to have been printed in two sessions for texts and images. [[Günther Zainer]] of [[Augsburg]], a specialist in popular illustrated works, produced the first one in 1473, in Latin and German, and with a metrical summary newly added for each chapter; this is considered an especially beautiful edition.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.207&lt;/ref&gt; Further incunabulum editions include Latin, German, French, Spanish and Dutch versions, and it was the first illustrated book printed in both Switzerland, at [[Basel]], and France, at [[Lyon]], which used the Basel picture blocks, later also used in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor nos.33–34, appears to contradict Hind p.602&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Speyer]] edition has woodcuts whose design has been attributed to the [[Master of the Housebook]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.208&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the first of the somewhat legendary editions supposedly produced by [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]], working earlier than [[Johannes Gutenberg]], was a ''Speculum''.  Even if the Coster story is ignored, the work seems to have been the first printed in the Netherlands, probably in the early 1470s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.111 ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Editions continued to be printed until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which changed the nature of religious devotion on both sides of the Catholic/Protestant divide, and made the ''Speculum'' seem outdated.

==Iconographic influence==
The images in the ''Speculum'' were treated in many different styles and media over the course of the two centuries of its popularity, but generally the essentials of the compositions remained fairly stable, partly because most images had to retain their correspondence with their opposite number, and often the figures were posed to highlight these correspondences.  Many works of art in other media can be seen to be derived from the illustrations; it was for example, the evident source for depictions for the ''Vision of Augustus'' in [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Bladelin Altarpiece]]'' and other [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] works.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson p.28&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the work was used as a pattern-book for [[stained glass]], but also for [[tapestry|tapestries]] and [[sculpture]].

'''St Ives''' ({{lang-kw|Porth Ia}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/pdf/placename_masterlist.pdf |title=List of Place-names agreed by the MAGA Signage Panel |accessdate=11 January 2015 |publisher=[[Cornish Language Partnership]] |date=May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729194902/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/pdf/placename_masterlist.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "St Ia's cove") is a seaside [[town]], [[civil parish]] and port in [[Cornwall]]. The town lies north of [[Penzance]] and west of [[Camborne]] on the coast of the [[Celtic Sea]]. In former times it was commercially dependent on fishing. The decline in fishing, however, caused a shift in commercial emphasis, and the town is now primarily a popular [[seaside resort]], notably achieving the title of Best UK Seaside Town from the British Travel Awards in both 2010 and 2011. St Ives was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1639. St Ives has become renowned for its number of artists. It was named best seaside town of 2007 by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper. It should not be confused with [[St Ive]], a [[village]] and civil parish in south-east Cornwall.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:John Payne memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Payne memorial, St Ives]]
The origin of St Ives is attributed in legend to the arrival of the Irish saint [[Ia of Cornwall]], in the 5th century. The parish church bears her name, and St Ives derives from it.&lt;ref name=tde&gt;{{citation |last=Lewis |first=Samuel|title=Ives, St. - Ixworth-Thorpe|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51066#s4 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of England |publisher=British History Online |pages=30–33|year=1848 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=A.

[[File:Rocky landscape.JPG|thumb|Rocky landscape]]

[[The Sloop Inn]], which lies on the wharf was a fisherman's pub for many centuries and is dated to "circa 1312", making it one of the oldest inns in Cornwall. The town was the site of a particularly notable atrocity during the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] of 1549. The English [[provost marshal]], [[Anthony Kingston]], came to St Ives and invited the [[portreeve]], John Payne, to lunch at an inn. He asked the portreeve to have the [[gallows]] erected during the course of the lunch. Afterwards the portreeve and the Provost Marshal walked down to the gallows; the Provost Marshal then ordered the portreeve to mount the gallows. The portreeve was then [[hanging|hanged]] for being a "busy rebel".

The seal of St Ives is ''Argent, an ivy branch overspreading the whole field Vert'', with the legend ''Sigillum Burgi St. Ives in Com. Cornub. 1690''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pascoe|first=W. H.|title=A Cornish Armory|page=134|year=1979|publisher=Lodenek Press|location=Padstow, Cornwall|isbn=0-902899-76-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[3rd Spanish Armada|Spanish Armada of 1597]] two Spanish ships, a [[Barque|bark]] and a [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]] had made their way to St Ives to seek shelter from the storm which had dispersed the Spanish fleet. They were captured by the English warship [[English ship Warspite (1596)|''Warspite'']] of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] leaking from the same storm. The information given by the prisoners was vital on learning the Armada's objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Edward|title=The Life of Sir Walter Ralegh: Letters Volume 2|date=1868|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Company|pages=186–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRI5AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishing===
[[File:St. Ives, Porthminster Bay, Cornwall, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|right|[[Photochrom]] of St Ives, 1895]]
From medieval times fishing was important at St Ives; it was the most important fishing port on the north Cornish coast. The pier was built by [[John Smeaton]] in 1767–70 but has been lengthened at a later date. The octagonal lookout with a cupola belongs to Smeaton's design.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N.(1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed. Penguin; p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. K. Hamilton Jenkin]] describes how the St Ives fisherman strictly observed Sunday as a day of rest. St Ives was a very busy fishing port and seining was the usual method of fishing. Seining was carried out by a set of three boats of different sizes, the largest two carrying seine nets of different sizes. The total number of crew was seventeen or eighteen. However this came to an end in 1924. In the decade 1747–1756 the total number of pilchards dispatched from the four principal Cornish ports of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], [[Fowey]], [[Penzance]], and St Ives averaged 30,000 hogsheads annually (making a total of 900 million fish). Much greater catches were achieved in 1790 and 1796. In 1847 the exports of pilchards from Cornwall amounted to 40,883 hogsheads or 122 million fish while the greatest number ever taken in one seine was 5,600 hogsheads at St Ives in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria History of Cornwall'', vol. I, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the catch was exported to Italy: for example, in 1830, 6400 hogsheads were sent to Mediterranean ports. From 1829 to 1838, the yearly average for this trade was 9000 hogsheads.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkin (1932) ''Cornish Seafarers''; chapter on fishing&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once the spring mackerel season ends, the fishing fleet head north. In July 1882, ninety luggers and six hundred men were engaged in the Scottish [[herring]] fishery.

While commercial fishing is much reduced, the harbour is still in use, often as well for recreational boating, tourist fishing and day trips to the nearby seal colonies on the Carrack Rocks and other locations along the coast. Recently, a class of Victorian fishing boat unique to St. Ives, known as a "jumbo," has been replicated by boatbuilder Jonny Nance to celebrate the town's maritime heritage. Today's jumbos are operated by the St. Ives Jumbo Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stivesjumbo.com |title=St.Ives Jumbo Association - Home |website=Stivesjumbo.com |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lifeboat====
{{Main|St Ives Lifeboat Station}}
[[File:St Ives Lifeboat Station viewed across the harbour.jpg|thumb|Lifeboat station in the harbour]]
The first [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] was stationed in the town in 1840. In 1867 the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] built a boathouse at Porthgwidden beach. It proved to be a difficult site to launch from and in 1867 it was replaced by a building in Fore Street. In 1911 a new boathouse was built on the Quay, and then in 1993 a larger station was built at the landward end of the West Pier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Leach |first= Nicholas |title= Cornwall's Lifeboat Heritage |origyear= 2000 |year= 2006 |publisher= Twelveheads Press |location= Chacewater |isbn= 0-906294-43-6 |page= 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven crewmen died in the St Ives lifeboat tragedy of 1939. In the early hours of 23 January 1939 there was a [[Beaufort scale|Force 10]] storm blowing with gusts up to {{Convert|100|mph|km/h}}. The lifeboat ''John and Sara Eliza Stych'' was launched at 3 o'clock to search for a ship reported in trouble off [[Cape Cornwall]]. It rounded The island where it met the full force of the storm as it headed westwards. It capsized three times and drifted across St Ives Bay when its propeller was fouled. The first time it turned over four men were lost; the second time one more; the third time left only one man alive. He scrambled ashore when the boat was wrecked on rocks near [[Godrevy]] Point.&lt;ref name=Bray&gt;{{cite book |last= Bray |first= Lena |author2=Bray, Donald  |title= St Ives Heritage |edition= 2nd  |origyear= 1981 |year= 1992 |publisher= Landfall Publications |location= Devoran |isbn= 1-873443-06-4 |pages= 24–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later history===
[[File:St_Ives_Harbour_Beach_(2011)_by_Walter_Scott_(1974-_).jpg|thumb|St Ives Harbour Beach (2011) by local artist Walter Scott (1974- )]]
The modern seaside resort developed as a result of the arrival of the [[St Ives Bay Line|St Ives Bay branch line]] from [[St Erth]], part of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1877. With it came a new generation of Victorian seaside holidaymakers. Much of the town was built during the latter part of the 19th century. The railway, which winds along the cliffs and bays, survived the [[Beeching cuts]] and has become a tourist attraction itself.

In 1952, the [[Royal Navy]] [[warship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Historian recreates drama and danger of minesweeper crew's close call |url=http://www.cornwalllive.com/historian-recreates-drama-danger-minesweeper-crew-s-close/story-11452873-detail/story.html |work=This is Cornwall |date=30 November  2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HMS Wave]] ran aground near the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/15187.html HMS Wave ashore]&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was later salvaged, repaired and returned to service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/defence/veterans-attend-commemoration-of-hms-wave-rescue-1-6082303 Veterans attend commemoration of HMS Wave rescue]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[propeller]] believed to be from HMS Wave was washed ashore in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/articles/2008/02/04/aboutcornwall_hmswave_feature.shtml HMS Wave propeller found]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the town was the first landfall of the [[Solar eclipse of 11 August 1999]]. A live BBC programme with the astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] was clouded out and the eclipse was missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroimaging.org.uk/john/reports/eclipse99.htm |title=Report on Total Solar Eclipse as seen from St Ives |author=John Moore |publisher=Astroimaging |date=11 August 1999|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sharks====
On 28 July 2007 there was a suspected sighting of a [[great white shark]]. The chairman of the [[Shark Trust]] said that "it was impossible to make a conclusive identification and that it could have also been either a [[Shortfin mako shark|Mako]] or a [[Porbeagle]] shark".

==Geography==
[[File:Porthgwidden Beach - geograph.org.uk - 1263150.jpg|thumb|Porthgwidden Beach]]
St Ives is on the western shore of [[St Ives Bay]], its harbour sheltered by St Ives Island (a headland) and Smeaton's pier. Close to the harbour, in the old part of the town, the streets are narrow and uneven while its wider streets are in the newer parts of the town on rising ground.&lt;ref name=tde/&gt; The town has four beaches: Porthmeor a surfing beach, Porthgwidden a small sandy cove, Harbour by the working port and Porthminster which has almost half a mile of sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The beaches|url=http://www.stives-cornwall.co.uk/beaches-in-stives.html|publisher=St Ives Tourism association|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Ives has an [[oceanic climate]] and has some of the mildest winters and warmest summers in Britain and Northern Europe. It is therefore a popular tourist resort in the summer, and also benefits from an amount of sunshine per year that is above the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/image/5/1/sunshine_annual2010.gif |format=GIF |title=Map showing annual 2010 sunshine for UK |website=Metoffice.gov.uk |accessdate=20 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009093142/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/image/5/1/sunshine_annual2010.gif |archivedate=9 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South West Coast Path]] passes through the town.

==Politics and administration==
St Ives' local government administration has a two-tier structure consisting of two separate councils both of which are democratically elected statutory bodies which St Ives Town Council and [[Cornwall Council]].

The first tier of local government in St Ives is the Town Council which is the closest tier to the general public with a membership of 16 elected town councillors from three wards. The last elections were held in May 2013. The council has responsibilities for providing grant funding to local organisations, public footpaths, bus shelters, beach patrols, traffic control and allotments. The Council is a statutory body which is consulted regarding planning decisions in the town’s area and makes recommendations to the planning authority, Cornwall Council.

Before 1974, St Ives Borough Council was the principal local authority for what now forms the civil parish of St Ives. Since the [[Local Government Act 1972|reform of local government in 1974]], St Ives has an elected town council. The area overseen by the [[Town council|Town Council]] of St Ives includes [[Lelant]], [[Carbis Bay]], [[Halsetown]] and St Ives.  The elected town council members also become charter trustees of the original borough charter (for the duration of their term in office) which dates back to 1639 entitling them to carry out various ceremonial functions such as appointing a Mayor, awarding [[Freedom of the Borough|freedom of the borough]] to individuals, representing the Borough at formal occasions such as [[Remembrance Sunday]] wearing [[Robes|formal ceremonial robes]] and using the [[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]].  Typically, the Mayor of the Town of St Ives is also the Mayor of the Borough of St Ives.  However, most of the other principal local authority functions for St Ives were undertaken by [[Penwith District Council]] and the [[Cornwall County Council]]. From 1 April 2009 Penwith and the other five Cornish district councils were replaced by a unified council, [[Cornwall Council]].

Like St Ives Town Council, Cornwall Council is a statutory body incorporated by Act of Parliament. Cornwall Council is the second tier of local government in the area and is a unitary authority with a far wider range of powers. The Council deals with roads, street lighting, highways, social services, children and family care, schools and public libraries. St Ives itself elects three of the 123 councillors.

==Religion==
[[File:St Ives Street - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|Methodist Church, Fore Street]][[File:Catholic Church of The Sacred Heart, St Ives - geograph.org.uk - 317565.jpg|thumb|Church of the Sacred Heart (R.C.)]]
The [[St. Ia's Church, St. Ives|parish church]] is dedicated to Saint [[Ia of Cornwall]], an Irish holy woman of the 5th or 6th century, and [[St Andrew]], the patron saint of fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=St Ives Parish Church|url=http://www.stiveschurch.org.uk/|publisher=St Ives Church|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1408 the townsmen attempted to get a papal bull to authorise the consecration of their church and cemetery, but they did not achieve this, so they continued without the rights of baptism or burial. However, they undertook the building of the present church between 1410 and 1434 as a chapel of ease, St Ives being within the parish of [[Lelant]]. They were able to obtain the right to a font in 1428 but consecration of the cemetery only in 1542. For over a century the vicars of Lelant had resisted demands from the inhabitants of St Ives and Towednack for the right of sepulture but in 1542 the right was granted so the vicars transferred their residence to St Ives and abandoned the vicarage of Lelant.&lt;ref&gt;''Cornish Church Guide'' (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 112, 141&lt;/ref&gt; There was damage to the church in 1697 when a storm broke through the sea-wall and damaged the roof and a large window over the altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Church.|work=The Cornishman|issue=10|date=19 September 1878|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are chapels dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas]] on the headland of St Ives Island and [[Leonard of Noblac|St Leonard]] on the quay which were used by the fishermen and have been converted for other uses.&lt;ref&gt;''Cornish Church Guide''; p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The former chapel of St Nicholas was partially demolished by the [[War Office]] in 1904&lt;ref&gt;Mee, Arthur (1937) ''Cornwall''. (The King's England.) London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton; p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; but rebuilt in 1909, possibly by [[Edmund Harold Sedding|E H Sedding]], from the old materials. It is plain and rectangular and has since been converted into the New Gallery.

The Roman Catholic Church of the [[Sacred Heart]] and St Ia was built in 1909 to a design by [[Alexander Scoles|A J C Scoles]]. There are also two Methodist chapels, one in [[Fore Street]] of 1831, and another of 1845 higher up the valley, and a Congregational chapel of 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed. Penguin; p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Art===
[[Bernard Leach]] and [[Shōji Hamada]] set up the [[Leach Pottery]] in 1920. Leach was a [[studio potter]] and art teacher,&lt;ref&gt;Cortazzi, Hugh. [http://www.japansociety.org.uk/reviews/05leach.html  "Review of Emmanuel Cooper's ''Bernard Leach Life &amp; Work.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502023614/http://www.japansociety.org.uk/reviews/05leach.html |date=2 May 2008 }} Japan Society (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; and is known as the "Father of British studio pottery",&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080912153818/http://collection.britishcouncil.org/html/artist/artist.aspx?id=18557]&lt;/ref&gt; learned pottery under the direction of Shigekichi Urano (Kenzan VI) in [[Japan]] where he also met Shōji Hamada. They promoted pottery from the point of view of Western and Eastern arts and philosophies. Leach produced work until 1972, and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] held an exhibition of his work in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiopottery.com/cgi-bin/mp.cgi?item=3 |title=Bernard Leach |website=Studiopottery.com |date= |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leach Pottery remains operational and houses a small museum showcasing work by Leach and his students.&lt;ref&gt;Leach Pottery website, http://www.leachpottery.com/, last examined Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] artist [[Alfred Wallis]] and [[Ben Nicholson]] and [[Christopher Wood (English painter)|Christopher Wood]] met at St Ives and laid the foundation for the [[St Ives School|artists' colony]]. In 1939, Ben Nicholson, [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] settled in St Ives, attracted by its beauty. In 1993, a branch of the [[Tate Gallery]], the [[Tate St Ives]], opened. The Tate looks after the [[Barbara Hepworth Museum]] and her [[sculpture garden]]. The town attracted artists from overseas, such as [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Maurice Sumray]], who moved from [[London]] in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Davies | first = Peter | title = Obituary: Maurice Sumray - Offbeat St Ives painter| work = [[The Independent]] | date = 23 July 2004 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maurice-sumray-550144.html | accessdate = 30 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to do so today with younger artists such as Michael Polat, who took up residence there from his native Germany in 1999.

Before the 1940s, most artists in St Ives and West Cornwall belonged to the St Ives Society of Artists; but events in the late 1940s led to a dispute between the [[Abstract art|abstract]] and [[Figurative art|figurative]] artists in the group. In 1948 the abstract faction broke away to form the [[Penwith Society of Artists]] led by Barbara Hepworth and [[Ben Nicholson]].

In 1962 [[Frederick Spratt]] took a sabbatical in Britain for one year, where he lived and painted representationally in St Ives.

The studio pottery [[Troika Pottery|Troika]] was set up in 1963.

A 2010, a BBC4 film, ''The Art of Cornwall'', presented by [[James Fox (art historian)|James Fox]] said that the St Ives artists "went on to produce some of the most exhilarating art of the twentieth century...for a few dazzling years this place was as famous as Paris, as exciting as New York and infinitely more progressive than London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wbn80 |title=BBC Four - The Art of Cornwall |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme explored the lives and works of the key figures and their contributions in establishing St Ives as a major centre of British art from the 1920s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcornwall.org/The_Art_of_Cornwall_BBC4.htm |title=The Art of Cornwall |website=Artcornwall.org |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===
The Barbara Hepworth Museum and her sculpture garden are the responsibility of Tate St Ives. It was the wish of the late sculptor to leave her work on public display in perpetuity. The St Ives Museum has exhibits illustrating local history and culture, including mining, fishing, agriculture and domestic life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070220132937/http://www.museumsincornwall.org.uk/museums/st-ives-museum] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
[[File:Knill's Monument - geograph.org.uk - 107848.jpg|Knill's Monument, near St Ives, commemorating the mayor, John Knill|thumb]]
[[John Knill]], a former mayor, constructed the Knill Steeple, a granite monument overlooking the town. In 1797, Knill laid down instructions for the celebration of the Knill Ceremony, which was to take place every five years on 25 July (St James's Day). The ceremony involves the Mayor of St Ives, a customs officer, and a vicar accompanied by two widows and ten girls who should be the "daughters of fishermen, tinners, or seamen".

A second celebration, of perhaps greater antiquity, is St Ives Feast, a celebration of the founding of St Ives by St Ia, which takes place on the Sunday and Monday nearest to 3 February each year. It includes a civic procession to Venton Ia, the well of St Ia, and other associated activities. It is one of the two surviving examples of [[Cornish Hurling]] (in a gentler format than its other manifestation at [[St Columb Major]]).

A third festival is the St Ives May Day, a modern revival of [[West Cornwall May Day celebrations]] that were once common throughout west Cornwall.

The St Ives September Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary in September 2008. It is one of the longest running and widest ranging Festivals of the Arts in the UK lasting for fifteen days and includes music (folk, jazz, rock, classical &amp; world), poetry, film, talks and books. It was founded in 1978 as a joint venture by local entrepreneurs and the International Musicians Seminar. Many local artists open up their studios to allow visitors to see how their art is produced. There is free music in many pubs almost every night, and concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = St Ives September Festival | publisher = St Ives September Festival Committee | url = http://www.stivesseptemberfestival.co.uk | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many events are held at the Western Hotel or St Ives Guildhall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stivestic.co.uk |title=Tourist board for St Ives, West Cornwall, UK - VisitStIves.org.uk |website=Stivestic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Ives has a 500-seat theatre which hosts some of the festival events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kidz R Us St Ives Theatre | publisher = Kidz R Us | url = http://www.kidzrus.net | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">The '''Swedish Art Music Society''' ({{Lang|sv|Musikaliska konstföreningen}}) is a non-profit organisation with the aim of publishing Swedish art music. It was founded by Swedish composers in 1859 to facilitate the publishing of Swedish art music, then largely controlled by German publishers.

Each year, one or a couple of pieces of music are selected for publication. Composers include [[Wilhelm Stenhammar|Stenhammar]], [[Amanda Röntgen-Maier|Röntgen-Maier]], [[Hugo Alfvén|Alfvén]], [[Otto Olsson|Olsson]], [[Gunnar de Frumerie|de Frumerie]], [[Dag Wirén|Wirén]], Carlstedt and Welin. Often, contemporary music is chosen, but sometimes the organisation elects to publish older masterpieces which have remained unpublished, such as the recent publication of the symphonies by the Swedish 18th-century composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert|Eggert]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4962">The so-called '''Symphony No. 37 in G major''', [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 444/425a, is an introduction by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] to a symphony in G by [[Michael Haydn]].

== History ==

The complete symphony was for a long time believed to be a work by Mozart, but is now known to have actually been mostly written by Michael Haydn, being his [[Symphony No. 25 (Michael Haydn)|Symphony No. 25]] in [[G major]], Perger 16, Sherman 25, MH 334. The true authorship was discovered by Lothar Perger in 1907. Modern commentators find it "difficult to comprehend how the editors of the [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel|Breitkopf]] edition of Mozart could have considered the three movements of the G major Symphony as the immediate successor of the [[Symphony No. 36 (Mozart)|'Linz' Symphony]]; the infinitely simpler and more archaic art of the [[Salzburg]] master offers such a contrast that one might well suppose this symphony to date much earlier than 1783" if Mozart had been the one to write it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges de Saint-Foix|Saint-Foix, Georges de]]. ''The Symphonies of Mozart'', transl. Leslie Orrey. London: Dennis Dobson Ltd. (1949): 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction was probably composed in late 1783 to be performed in the same concert in [[Linz]] in which Mozart's [[Symphony No. 36 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 36]] received its premiere.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Silke (ed.): ''Mozart-Handbuch.'' Kassel: [[Bärenreiter]] 2005, {{ISBN|3-7618-2021-6}}, p.&amp;nbsp;307&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozart probably copied out the [[Sheet music|score]] in order to learn from it, but he wrote a new ''[[Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings|Adagio]] [[Glossary_of_musical_terminology#M|maestoso]]'' introduction for it (few of Michael Haydn's symphonies have slow introductions). Mozart's introduction in [[Triple metre|triple time]] ends with a [[fermata]] on a [[Dominant seventh chord|V&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Chord (music)|chord]], which leads into a [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] chord beginning Haydn's work. [[Georges de Saint-Foix]] considers the introduction "an expressive [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], which, moreover, is by no means entirely in key with the movement it is intended to prepare."&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Foix, Georges de. ''The Symphonies of Mozart'', transl. Leslie Orrey. London: Dennis Dobson Ltd. (1949): 95&lt;/ref&gt;

}
&lt;/score&gt;


Mozart did not copy the rest of the work verbatim: he removed a [[bassoon]] solo from the middle ''[[Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings|Andante]] [[Glossary_of_musical_terminology#S|sostenuto]]'' movement, and "appears to have reduced the [[colla parte]] writing in the [[woodwind|winds]] throughout the work," according to Gary Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mozartforum.com/Lore/article.php?id=534|title=Haydn, Michael (1737–1806)|first=Gary|last=Smith|work=mozartforum.com|accessdate=6 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630062132/http://www.mozartforum.com/Lore/article.php?id=534|archivedate=30 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers for Mozart's Symphonies Nos. [[Symphony No. 38 (Mozart)|38]] through [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|41]] have not been adjusted because of this symphony.

According to the [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] edition, the score calls for [[flute]], 2 [[Oboe|oboes]], 2 [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] and [[String section|strings]]; performances tend to include bassoons (always in [[unison]] with the [[Cello|celli]] except for significant passages in the [[Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings|adagio]]), which were part of Michael Haydn's original score but left out by Mozart, and a [[harpsichord]] playing [[figured bass]], based on the [[cello]] line. The flute is only used for the first section of the slow movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mozartforum.com/Lore/article.php?id=085|first=Dennis|last=Pajot|title=K444 Symphony #37|work=mozartforum.com|accessdate=2009-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091530/http://www.mozartforum.com/Lore/article.php?id=085|archivedate=2007-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">[[Gara Garayev]]'s '''Symphony No. 3''' was composed in 1964. It was the last of the composer's three numbered symphonies and it marks a development from his two previous contributions to the genre, composed in the mid-1940s during his studies in the [[Leningrad Conservatory]] under [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.wanadoo.nl/ovar/karaev.htm List of works] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414004304/http://home.wanadoo.nl/ovar/karaev.htm |date=2006-04-14 }} in Onno van Rijen's Shostakovich &amp; other Soviet composers page&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first [[serialism|serial]] symphonies composed in the [[Soviet Union]], fusing the [[twelve-tone technique]] with [[Azerbaijan]]i [[folk music]] influences in the [[ashug]] tradition in the frame of a classical structure, attempting ''to find to new ways of artistic expression, new principles of form and construction, and, most notably, new means of expressive musical language'' and wanting to prove that ''strictly following the twelve-tone technique it is possible to  write [[musical nationalism|nationalistic music]], and not simply nationalistic, but specifically ashug'' according to the composer.&lt;ref&gt;Booklet notes by Anastasia Belina to the Russian Philharmonic - Yablonsky Naxos release, 8.570720&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony is scored for a [[chamber orchestra]] and it lasts c. 25 minutes, consisting of four movements:

# Allegro moderato
# Allegro vivace
# Andante
# Allegro

'''''The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished''''' is a large [[oil painting]] on canvas by English artist [[William Etty]], first exhibited in 1825 and now in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]]. Inspired by the [[Elgin Marbles]] and intended by the artist to provide a moral lesson on "the beauty of mercy", it shows a near-nude warrior whose sword has broken, forced to his knees in front of another near-nude soldier who prepares to inflict a killing blow. A woman, also near-nude, clutches the victorious warrior to beg him for mercy. Very unusually for a [[history painting]] of the period, ''The Combat'' does not depict a scene from history, literature or religion and is not based on an existing artwork, but is instead a scene from the artist's own imagination.

When it was shown at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] of 1825, it attracted near-universal praise from critics for its technical excellence, its fusion of the styles of different schools of painting, and its subject matter. Nevertheless, it failed to find a buyer at the Summer Exhibition, and was instead bought by fellow artist [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]. The painting proved too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]. It was transferred in 1910 to the National Gallery of Scotland, where it remains.

==Background==
[[File:William Etty - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Etty, 1823, shortly before ''The Combat'' was painted|alt=Bearded man in his 30s]]
[[William Etty]] was born in 1787, the son of a [[York]] baker and miller.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=8925|title=William Etty}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began as an apprentice printer in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=23}} On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London "with a few pieces of chalk crayons",{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=157}} with the intention of becoming a [[history painting|history painter]] in the tradition of the [[Old Masters]].{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=86}} Strongly influenced by the works of [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], he submitted paintings to the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and the [[British Institution]], all of which were either rejected or received scant attention when exhibited.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=31}}

In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, ''[[The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia]]'' (also known as ''The Triumph of Cleopatra'').{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=31}} The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. Following the praise for ''Cleopatra'', Etty tried to replicate its success by painting [[Nude (art)|&lt;!-- Normally this would be overlinking, but in this context readers are likely to want to learn more about the tradition of nude art --&gt;nude figures]] in biblical, literary and mythological settings,&lt;ref name="MAG Etty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html |title=About the artist |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |accessdate=10 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024806/http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably ''[[Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm|A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)]]'' in 1822,{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=178}}{{efn-ua|''A Sketch from one of Gray's Odes'' was later developed into 1828's ''[[Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm]]'', one of Etty's best known works.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=63}}}} and the controversial ''Pandora Crowned by the Seasons'' in 1824. Etty had travelled extensively in Italy in 1823, and painted ''Pandora'' hastily on his return as a "testimonial of recent progress" he had made while studying paintings in Italian collections.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=118}} Critical opinion of ''Pandora'' was highly divided, with some critics greatly praising it as a technical accomplishment, while others saw it as a rushed pastiche of Titian and Rubens.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|pp=108–109}}{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=22}} ''Pandora Crowned by the Seasons'' sold for 300&amp;nbsp;[[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|315|1824|r=-3}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}),{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=22}} and secured Etty the position of Associate at the Royal Academy of Arts.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=109}}

[[File:William Etty - Pandora Crowned by the Seasons, 1824.jpg|right|thumb|''Pandora Crowned by the Seasons'' (1824) helped cement Etty's reputation for pastiche of Rubens and Titian, and for the use of mythological and literary subjects as a pretext for nudity.|alt=Standing naked woman, surrounded by naked people, being crowned by four scantily-dressed figures]]
While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 [[Society for the Suppression of Vice|Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice]].{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=53}} Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=55}} Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p = 54}}

==Composition==
[[File:Sketches of the Elgin Marbles by William Etty YORAG 2005 493 2.jpg|left|thumb|Sketch from the Elgin Marbles by William Etty. Etty was fascinated with the scenes of combat depicted by the Marbles, which had recently been put on display in London.|alt=Pencil sketch of warriors on horseback]]
Etty was fascinated with [[Classical antiquity|classical]] artworks such as those he had seen during his recent travels in Italy, and in particular with the [[Elgin Marbles]], a set of major [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] sculptures taken to London in controversial circumstances in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=112}}

''The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished'' is a large painting, 399&amp;nbsp;cm (13&amp;nbsp;ft 1&amp;nbsp;in) across.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=111}} It depicts a defeated soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from the grip of the victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=112}} The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.&lt;ref name="EuropeanMag"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 June 1825|title=The Fifty-Seventh Annual Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=The European Magazine, and London Review|publisher=Sherwood, Jones and Co.|location=London|volume=87|issue=May 1825|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etty did not base ''The Combat'' on any single incident from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, but on his own imagination;{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=112}} this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature or religion.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=47}}{{efn-ua|In 1832 Etty returned to the idea of a history painting drawn entirely from imagination with ''[[The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate]]'', which he described as "a finished sketch of that class of compositions called by the Romans ''Visions'', not having their origin in history or poetry."&lt;ref name="Times1832"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Royal Academy |day_of_week=Thursday |date=24 May 1832 |page_number=3 |issue=14860 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=47}} During this visit Etty had met [[Antonio Canova]] and been very impressed by him; ''The Combat'' is clearly influenced by his work.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=99}} As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of [[Old Master]] works he had seen while in Italy.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=112}} As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, rather than as a group.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=120}}

Etty, writing in 1849, described the purpose of ''The Combat'' as "to paint a great moral on the heart [of] the beauty of mercy."&lt;ref name="Spectator1849"&gt;{{cite journal|date=16 June 1849|title=The Etty Collection at the Society of Arts|journal=The Spectator|publisher=Joseph Clayton|location=London|volume=22|issue=1094|page=568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr points out similarities in the composition of ''The Combat'' and [[John Flaxman]]'s drawing ''Heracles Killing a Man to whom a Woman Clings'', but while Etty and Flaxman were contemporaries at the Royal Academy, it is not known if Etty was aware of this drawing.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=142}}{{efn-ua|Sculptor [[John Flaxman]] (1755–1826) was also from York. When Etty was eventually elected a Royal Academician in 1828, it was to fill the vacancy created by Flaxman's death two years earlier.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=23}}}}

[[File:Etty – The Combat (1825 study).jpeg|right|upright|thumb|In the preliminary study for the defeated warrior, the character bears a more defiant expression and posture than seen in the finished version.|alt=Naked man]]
In the initial [[oil study]] for the defeated warrior ([[York Art Gallery]]), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch he is not on his knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression of defiance and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=204}}

The completed ''The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished'' was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1825.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=22}}

==Reception==
On its exhibition, ''The Combat'' was generally highly praised by critics for its technical excellence, its combination of the Venetian and English styles of painting, and as an indication that Etty was moving away from nudity and towards history painting.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=111}} ''[[The European Magazine, and London Review]]'' commented that "in colour this picture strongly reminds us of the great heroes of the Venetian school, while in learned intelligence of form, and energy of action, it greatly surpasses them", observing that "we should not have the least objection to seeing this picture placed in one of the very first galleries, by the side of Titian and [[Paolo Veronese|Paul Veronese]]."&lt;ref name="EuropeanMag" /&gt;

[[File:Flaxman – Heracles Killing a Man to whom a Woman Clings.jpg|left|thumb|''Heracles Killing a Man to whom a Woman Clings'' by [[John Flaxman]] possibly influenced the composition of ''The Combat''.|alt=Naked man about to strike another naked man with a club, who is being held by a woman]]
In similar vein, ''[[The Lady's Magazine]]'' felt that ''The Combat'' "strongly demonstrates the progress of [Etty] to excellence", remarking that "never was a {{sic|groupe|hide=y}} more calculated to display the action in which the power of conquest is so eminently and fearfully delineated" and that "we have little doubt that the works of Titian were, on their first appearance&amp;nbsp;... what this piece is now." The same correspondent did find some flaws in the overly pronounced muscles of the victor's thigh and the lack of definition of muscle in the legs of the defeated man, but felt that despite this ''The Combat'' was "one of the finest and most masterly works that ever graced the walls of the Royal Academy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=31 May 1825|title=Fine Arts|journal=The Lady's Magazine|publisher=S Robinson|location=London|volume=6|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The London Magazine]]'' was similarly effusive about the painting, admiring Etty's ability to fuse his own imagination with themes derived from the Elgin Marbles and from the Venetian Old Masters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1825|title=The Fine Arts: Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=The London Magazine|publisher=Hunt and Clarke|location=London|volume=2|pages=256–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenting that "it is always gratifying to those who feel for the honour and independence of painting when, as in the present instance, an artist successfully relies on nature and the resources of his own mind for his subject, and on the appreciation of collegial minds for his mode of treating it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1825|title=The Fine Arts: Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=The London Magazine|publisher=Hunt and Clarke|location=London|volume=2|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'', a newspaper which had previously condemned Etty as "offensive and indecent",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lord Gwydyr |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=29 January 1822 |page_number=3 |issue=11466 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; felt that "though defective in some respects" ''The Combat'' was "a masterly effort" that successfully fused "the florid beauties of the Venetian school" with the "sober dignity and power of the Roman school" and that compared with his previous paintings, which were "too uniformly feeble in character and meretricious in effect to entitle them to any very decided praise", the painting proved Etty "capable of maintaining a much higher station in art than we had been led to expect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Exhibition at the Royal Academy |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=3 May 1825 |page_number=3 |issue=12643 |column=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous reviewer in the first issue of the short-lived&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Parthenon: A Magazine of Art and Literature|year=1826|publisher=Black, Young, and Young|location=London|page=iv|chapter=Preface|oclc= 1761936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Cite book, not cite journal; this is a citation to the preface of the book which collected all their back issues --&gt; ''The Parthenon'' magazine admired ''The Combat'' greatly, in particular the right foot of the female figure:
{{Quote|width=25em|text=[Etty is] an artist who has hitherto appeared before the public only in a few small easel-pictures, striking indeed from their arrangement, and their approach towards the Venetian system of colour, but destitute of any particular interest. He has now come forward in a new character—as a painter in the great style of epic composition; and if his future efforts do but equal the expectations raised by his first essay, we shall have reasons to rejoice at the change. His ideal group of "The Combat", in the present exhibition at the Royal Academy, is particularly striking, from its uncommon combination of beauties, without possessing any very extraordinary merit in any single quality, taken separately. Its style of colouring, perhaps, forms its most distinguishing feature; and in this respect the artist has still adhered closely to the system pursued by the Venetian school. The arrangement of his colours is admirably successful, and we could instance individual passages of extraordinary beauty. Of these, none is more eminently deserving than the right foot of the female, which seems actually to glow with the rich juice of life. Generally speaking, the extremities are well understood, and carefully executed, and the composition of the figures is in the most masterly style.|sign=''The Parthenon'' review of ''The Combat'', 11 June 1825&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=11 June 1825|title=Exhibitions of Pictures, &amp;c|journal=The Parthenon|publisher=Black, Young, and Young|location=London|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The foot in question was not universally admired by critics; the anonymous correspondent for ''The London Magazine'', who was otherwise effusive in his praise for ''The Combat'', felt that said foot "looks too much as if painted from a modern foot accustomed to compression in a shoe, for the heroic character and classical air of the rest of the work" and that her leg appeared too short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1825|title=The Fine Arts: Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=The London Magazine|publisher=Hunt and Clarke|location=London|volume=2|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Dennis Farr believes that the slight distortion of the female figure is the result of Etty standing too close to the model in the studio.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=88}}}}

The painting is the subject of one of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures in her 1826 collection, The Troubadour.

==Legacy==
Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition,{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=49}} ''The Combat'' was bought from Etty by fellow artist [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] for 300&amp;nbsp;guineas (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|300|1825|r=-3}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=48}}{{efn-ua|Alison Smith's 1996 ''The Victorian Nude'' states that ''The Combat'' was bought at exhibition by [[John Bligh, 4th Earl of Darnley]],{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=70}} but this is incorrect; Darnley admired ''The Combat'' and commissioned Etty to paint ''The Judgement of Paris'' having seen ''The Combat'' at the Royal Academy.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=141}}}} The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the [[Royal Scottish Academy]].{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=48}} It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby [[National Gallery of Scotland]] where it remains.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=141}} One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|Art Treasures Exhibition]] of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=141}}

[[File:The Sirens and Ulysses by William Etty, 1837.jpg|right|thumb|The success of ''The Combat'' prompted Etty to produce other very large paintings, such as the 442.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 297&amp;nbsp;cm (14&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in by 9&amp;nbsp;ft 9&amp;nbsp;in) ''[[The Sirens and Ulysses]]'' (1837).|alt=Three naked women sitting on a pile of rotting corpses, beckoning to a group of sailors in a boat]]
Throughout his life, ''The Combat'' continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings.&lt;ref name="Spectator1849" /&gt; In 1845, Etty took a smaller {{convert|89|by|118|cm|in|abbr=on}} copy of ''The Combat'', which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an [[engraving]] by [[George Thomas Doo]].{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=142}} The engraving was published three years later,{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=110}} and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the [[Ringling Museum]] in 1934.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=142}}&lt;!-- I'm aware Robinson says there are two more in circulation, but unless there's a source please don't add them. Robinson is not the most reliable of sources, and no other source—including the usually impeccable Farr—appears to have heard of them --&gt; A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of ''A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished'', are also in circulation.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=142}}

After the success of ''The Combat'', Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including ''Cleopatra'', ''Pandora'' and ''The Combat'') all but one contained a nude figure.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}} He was elected a full [[Royal Academy of Arts#Membership|Royal Academician]] in 1828,{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=118}} at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}}{{efn-ua|In Etty's time, honours such as knighthoods were only bestowed on presidents of major institutions, not on even the most well respected artists.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}}}} ''The Combat'' was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.&lt;ref name="Spectator1849" /&gt;

The 1832 exhibition of ''[[Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm]]'', a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=36}} From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude figures for the rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=42}} This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=2}}

'''''The Duel After the Masquerade''''' is a painting by the French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], currently housed in the [[Musée Condé]] in [[Château de Chantilly|Chantilly]], France.

==History==
In 1859, [[William Thompson Walters]] purchased ''The Duel After the Masquerade'' at the National Academy of Design in New York for $2,500.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt;{{rp|17}} The painting is a replica by Gérôme of his 1857 work ''Suite d'un bal masqué'', painted for the duc d'Aumale. The original is part of the collection of the [[Musée Condé]] in [[Château de Chantilly|Chantilly]], France.&lt;ref name="Musée Condé"/&gt; It was not unusual for artists to replicate their own paintings and other versions had also been painted for [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Prince Alexander]] of Russia and for the [[Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha|Ali Pacha]].  Walters asked the manager of the exhibition at the National Academy of Design for a letter of authentication from Gérôme and a comparison of the work he had purchased to the original.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt;{{rp|241}}

The original became famous almost overnight with the critics of the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] speculating about Gerome's sources for the incident depicted in the painting.&lt;ref name=Ackerman/&gt; In a poll taken in the winter of 1909–1910, Baltimoreans were asked to identify their fifty-five favorite works of art and  ''The Duel After the Masquerade'' topped the list.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt;{{rp|183}}

==Composition==
The scene is set on a gray winter morning in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], trees bare and snow covering the ground.  A man dressed as a [[Pierrot]] has been mortally wounded in a duel and has collapsed into the arms of a [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Duc de Guise]].  A surgeon, dressed as a [[doge of Venice]], tries to stop the flow of blood, while a [[Domino costume|Domino]] clutches his own head.

The survivor of the duel, dressed as an [[Native Americans in popular culture|American Indian]], walks away with his second, [[Harlequin]], leaving behind his weapon and some feathers of his [[War bonnet|headdress]], towards his carriage, shown waiting in the background.

The bizarreness of the scene in regard to the brightly colored costumes turns to pathos at the sight of blood on the Pierrot.&lt;ref name=Ackerman/&gt;

'''''The Gate of Calais''''' or '''''O, the Roast Beef of Old England''''' is a 1748 painting by [[William Hogarth]], reproduced as a print from an [[engraving]] the next year. Hogarth produced the painting directly after his return from France, where he had been arrested as a spy while sketching in [[Calais]]. The scene depicts a side of beef being transported from the harbour to an English tavern in the port, while a group of undernourished, ragged French soldiers and a fat [[friar]] look on hungrily. Hogarth painted himself in the left corner with a "soldier's hand upon my shoulder."&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;hl=en p.63]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;hl=en p.64] ''"I meant to display to my own countryman the striking difference of food, priests, soldiers, &amp;c. of two nations"'' ... ''"The melancholy and miserable Highlander, browzing on his scanty fare, consisting of a bit of bread and an onion, is intended for one of the many that fled this country after the rebellion in 1745."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In July 1748, Hogarth took a trip to Paris, taking advantage of the armistice which preceded the signing of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in October that year. He travelled with some artist friends, including [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]], [[Joseph Van Aken|Joseph]] and Alexander Van Aken, [[Francis Hayman]], and [[Henry Cheere]]. [[George Vertue]] reports that the group split up on the return journey, with Hogarth and Hayman making their way to Calais to catch the boat to England and the others continuing their tour to [[Flanders]] and [[the Netherlands]].

While waiting in Calais, Hogarth decided to sketch the gate of the port and drawbridge which were still adorned with the English arms&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"/&gt; (Calais had been an English enclave until 1558 and still retained many English architectural features). His sketching of the fortifications aroused suspicion, and he was arrested and taken before the Governor. Most accounts relate that Hogarth showed his other sketches to his captors; and when it became clear that he was merely an artist, he was discharged into the parole of his landlord to await the changing of the wind and the boat to England.&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"/&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] elaborates the account, reporting that Hogarth was forced to demonstrate his abilities by producing sketches and [[caricature]]s as demanded by the French, "particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the Lion d'Argent, the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it." At any rate, Hogarth was discharged and returned to England by the next boat.

==Painting==
According to Hogarth's autobiographical notes, he started on the painting as soon as he arrived home from Calais.&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"/&gt; The painting was completed in short order, followed by an engraving early the next year.

The painting takes a viewpoint under an archway in the main outer wall of Calais. The scene within centres around a [[sirloin]] of beef destined for the English tavern, the ''Lion d'Argent'', carried by a chef who stands out in his bright white apron and cap. The French soldiers, dressed in rags and forced to eat their watery [[wikt:soupe-maigre|soupe maigre]], gather round licking their lips. Two soldiers in [[Clog (shoe)|sabots]] can be seen carrying a cauldron of the grey unappetising soup. The [[Franciscan]] friar who greedily rubs his finger in the fat of the beef joint, is thought to be based on Hogarth's friend John Pine.&lt;ref name=Hogarth&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Tapestry Hangings of the House of Lords'|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/researchers/collections/by-type/archive-and-library/item-of-the-month/previous/the-%27tapestry-hangings-of-the-house-of-lords%27|publisher=The National Maritime Museum|accessdate=8 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821013006/http://www.rmg.co.uk/researchers/collections/by-type/archive-and-library/item-of-the-month/previous/the-'tapestry-hangings-of-the-house-of-lords'|archivedate=21 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground, a [[Gàidhealtachd|Highlander]], an exile from the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]],&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"/&gt; sits slumped against the wall, his strength sapped by the poor French fare – a raw onion and a crust of bread. Hogarth is seen sketching to the left in the background, but the tip of the [[halberd]] and hand of the soldier who will arrest him are just appearing round the corner behind him.

There are strong references to the celebration of [[Eucharist]] in the picture. Through the gates, under the sign of a [[dove]] (that of an inn) a [[Roman Catholic]] [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] is being celebrated. In the foreground, but still aligned with those in the background under the cross of the gate, the principal characters worship the beef. The man carrying it bows under the weight appearing to offer it up to the friar on partially bended knee. Above the scene in front of the gate, the dove of peace is replaced by a [[carrion]] bird, the [[crow]]. In the foreground fishwives superstitiously [[Jenny Haniver|worship the face of a ray]], and the Jacobite also clasps his hand together in prayer.

Hogarth's antipathy to the French had been apparent in his art since ''Noon'' in his ''[[Four Times of the Day]]'' series, painted in 1736. ''[[The March to Finchley]]'', which he painted in 1749/50, provides a companion theme to ''The Gate of Calais'': it depicts a fictional gathering of robust English guardsman who are to march north to defend London against the invasion of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s Jacobites in 1745. Further anti-French sentiment is apparent in his two ''Invasion'' engravings, published in 1756, and in ''Beer Street'', where Rev. [[James Townley]]'s accompanying verses stress the superiority of the English. ''The Gate of Calais''{{'}} secondary title, ''O, the Roast Beef of Old England'', is a reference to the popular patriotic ballad '[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]' from [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The Grub-Street Opera]]'' (1731), which told of how the food "ennobled our brains and enriched our blood" and laughed at "all-vapouring France"".

The painting was bought by the [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|1st Earl of Charlemont]] sometime after the 1761 Society of Artists' Exhibition at which it was displayed, by which time England had been [[Seven Years' War|at war]] with France again for 5 years. Ian Pears believes that by showing ''The Gates of Calais'' at the exhibition (one of only three comic histories that he displayed),&lt;!--the others?--&gt; Hogarth was challenging the patriotic spirit of the British by asking them to pay as much for a work by an Englishman as they would for a work by a continental painter. The painting was acquired by the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|1st Duke of Westminster]] at an auction at [[Christie's]] in 1891; he donated it to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in 1895, and it was transferred to the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1951.

==Print==
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England.png|thumb|right|The engraving of the print. The hand on Hogarth's shoulder can now be clearly seen, as can the Scotsman and his fare]]
The print, produced from an engraving that was completed in part by Charles Mosley, was published on 6 March 1749. Entitled "O The Roast Beef of Old England", it was priced at 5 shillings and advertised as:

{{quote|A print design'd and engrav'd by MR HOGARTH, representing a PRODIGY which lately appear'd before the Gate of CALAIS.&lt;br /&gt;O the Roast-beef of Old England, &amp;c.&lt;br /&gt; To be had at the Golden Head in Leicester-Square, and at the Print Shops.}}

The main difference between the painting and the engraving is the crow on top of the gate, which is absent in the engraving. The crow was a late addition to the painting to disguise an accidental tear, apparently caused by the canvas falling on a nail shortly after it was completed, although no evidence of damage was found when the painting was restored in 1966.

===Guest cast===
On September 25, 1956, [[Myron Healey]] played a drunken gunfighter [[Clay Allison]], who comes into Dodge City to confront the Earp legend. In the story line, Pete Albright, a storeowner played by [[Charles Fredericks (actor)|Charles Fredricks]], tries to hire Allison to gun down Earp because the marshal is fighting crime in the town and costing merchants business in the process. Allison makes a point of not taking money, but is willing to challenge Earp until he is overcome by his own drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631772/?ref_=tt_ep_ep21|title="Clay Allison", September 25, 1956|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Mike Ragan]] played Clay Allison in a 1957 episode, "The Time for All Good Men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631916/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title="The Time for All Good Men" (June 4, 1957)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
The series was produced by [[Desilu Productions]] and filmed at the [[Desilu-Cahuenga Studio]]. Sponsors included [[General Mills]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and [[Parker Pen Company]]. An off-camera [[barbershop quartet]] sang the theme song and hummed the background music in early episodes.  The theme song "The Legend of Wyatt Earp" was composed by [[Harry Warren]].  Incidental music was composed by [[Herman Stein]].

===Casting===
O'Brian was chosen for the role in part because of his physical resemblance to early photographs of Wyatt Earp. 

The series had a large supporting cast of more than 30 actors during its six-year run. [[Jimmy Noel]] was cast in 144 episodes as an unnamed, uncredited townsman; [[Buddy Roosevelt]] appeared similarly in 65 episodes of the series. [[William Tannen (actor)|William Tannen]] played Deputy Hal Norton in 56 episodes which aired between 1956 and 1958; in some of the segments he was uncredited, and in most his role was tangential to the script. [[Randy Stuart]] was cast in 12 episodes in the 1959-1960 season as Tombstone saloon and hotel owner [[Nellie Cashman]], a romantic interest for Earp. Earlier she played Nellie Dawson, a widow living on a ranch, in "Little Gray Home in the West".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631817/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title="Little Gray Home in the West", May 5, 1959|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In five episodes, [[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]] played Earp's brother, [[Virgil Earp]]; in four other episodes, including "Big Brother Virgil" and "The Trail to Tombstone", [[Ross Elliott]] played the part of Virgil. In 15 segments from 1956 to 1961, [[Ray Boyle]], then using the stage name "Dirk London", portrayed another brother, [[Morgan Earp]]. Between 1958 and 1961, [[Morgan Woodward]], later on CBS's ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' in the role of Marvin "Punk" Anderson and a frequent guest star on ''Gunsmoke'', as well, played folksy loyal deputy "Shotgun" Gibbs in 42 episodes.

[[Douglas Fowley]] and [[Myron Healey]] were cast 49 and 10 times, respectively, as Earp's close friend [[Doc Holliday|John H. "Doc" Holliday]], whom Earp had met in [[Texas]] prior to 1880. [[Carol Montgomery Stone]] played Kate Holliday or "[[Big Nose Kate]]", Holliday's [[common-law]] wife, in 10 episodes of the series in the 1957-1958 season. [[Collette Lyons]] played Big Kate in two 1958 episodes and "Rowdy Kate" in two other segments in 1955 and 1956. At times Holliday seemed affectionate toward Kate; at other time, he seemed oblivious to her existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Fred Stone's Daughter, Carol, Now on ABC-TV |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/518445922.html?dids=518445922:518445922&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=May+12%2C+1957&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Fred+Stone%27s+Daughter%2C+Carol%2C+Now+on+ABC-TV&amp;pqatl=google  |quote=Fred Stone's Daughter, Carol, Now on ABC-TV.

Earlier, on September 25, 1956, Healey played a drunken gunfighter Clay Allison, who comes into Dodge City to confront the Earp legend. In the story line, Pete Albright, a storeowner played by [[Charles Fredericks (actor)|Charles Fredricks]], tries to hire Allison to gun down Earp because the marshal is fighting crime in the town and costing merchants business in the process. Allison makes a point of not taking money, but is willing to challenge Earp until he is overcome by his own drunkenness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631772/?ref_=tt_ep_ep21|title="Clay Allison", September 25, 1956|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Mike Ragan]] played Clay Allison in a 1957 episode, "The Time for All Good Men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631916/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title="The Time for All Good Men" (June 4, 1957)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mason Alan Dinehart]], or Alan Dinehart, III, son of film stars [[Alan Dinehart]] and [[Mozelle Britton]], was cast in 34 episodes between 1955 and 1959 as [[Bat Masterson]], a role filled on the [[Bat Masterson (TV series)|NBC series]] of the same name by the late [[Gene Barry]]. Dinehart played Masterson from the ages of 19 to 23.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

The bearded [[Paul Brinegar]] in 33 episodes played [[James H. Kelley|James H. "Dog" Kelley]], a veteran of the [[Union Army]], the owner of the Alhambra Saloon, and a city council member and then the mayor while Earp is the deputy marshal in Dodge City. Their paths in history crossed for no more than one year. In the second and third episodes of the second season of the series, set in Dodge City and titled "Dodge City Gets a New Marshal" (September 4, 1956)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1100802/?ref_=tt_ep_ep18|title="Dodge City Gets a New Marshal", September 4, 1956|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Fight or Run" (September 11, 1956), Kelley is the hold-out vote on the city council regarding Earp's plan to require gun owners to check in their weapons upon entering town. The Big T Cattle Company, angry with Earp for trying to clean up Dodge City and reduce business from the cowboys, enlists Kelley's help in arranging an ambush of Earp. Kelley is depicted as a reluctant "good guy"/"bad guy" split personality in many of the episodes in which he appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1100803/?ref_=tt_ep_ep19|title="Fight or Run", September 11, 1956|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Brinegar subsequently played the cantankerous cooks Wishbone and Jelly Hoskins on the [[CBS]] Westerns, ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' and ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]''. In three episodes, [[Margaret Hayes]] was cast as [[Dora Hand]], the popular dance-hall actress and singer who had a romantic interest in Mayor Kelley. She is inadvertently shot to death in October 1878 by a rival suitor, James W. "Spike" Kenedy, a son of the [[South Texas]] rancher baron [[Mifflin Kenedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/the-killing-of-dora-hand.htm|title=Susan Leiser Silva and Lee A. Silva, "The Killing of Dora Hand", October 1, 2009|publisher=historynet.com; originally in ''Wild West Magazine''|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "It Had to Happen" (April 1, 1958), after Masterson is slightly wounded from a gunshot fired by a man whom Earp had struck in the shoulder to avoid killing him, Mayor Kelley orders Earp to "shoot to kill" when apprehending lawbreakers. Earp, however, has always used restraint and tried to avoid killing those who would fire upon him. When Earp kills a culprit, he has second thoughts about his role as a lawman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631800/?ref_=tt_ep_pr|title="It Had to Happen", April 1, 1958|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Haggerty]] was cast in the role of Wichita newspaperman Marsh Murdock in 21 segments of the first season. [[Trevor Bardette]] was cast 21 times as the unscrupulous [[Old Man Clanton|Newman Haynes Clanton]], known as Old Man Clanton, when the setting of the series moved to Arizona, but Bardette appeared in earlier episodes, too, under other names. [[John Milford]] appeared in eight episodes as the historical [[Ike Clanton]]. In seven episodes in 1959 and 1961, [[Carol Thurston]] played the fictitious Emma Clanton, daughter of Old Man Clanton and an unlikely romantic interest for Earp. Thurston also was cast in different roles in four earlier episodes before she landed the continuing role as Emma Clanton. [[James Seay]] was cast 16 times as Judge Spicer, who became a close friend of Earp's.

[[William Phipps (actor)|William Phipps]] in 16 episodes played the gunman and rustler [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]]. In the episode "The Clantons' Family Row", Brocius is facing a potential gunfight with [[Johnny Ringo]] (Peter M. Thompson), who is irate that Brocius accidentally shot and killed Ringo's horse, though he replaced the animal with another.

A town mob demands that Curly Bill be hanged, but Earp places [[dynamite]] under the main street to protect his prisoner until the trial. Earp must defend Curly Bill in court because White accidentally caused Curly Bill's gun to discharge; White signed a statement attesting to the facts prior to his death. Doc Holliday noted at the end of the episode that Earp could have merely let Curly Bill hang for past crimes had he not been a just marshal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631814/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_901|title="Let's Hang Curly Bill" (January 26, 1960)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]] played the dishonest [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] Sheriff Johnny Behan in 9 episodes from 1960 to 1961; [[Lash La Rue]] played him in eight other segments, one uncredited. La Rue first appeared in the October 20, 1959 segment, "You Can't Fight City Hall" as an agent of territorial [[governor of Arizona|Governor]] [[John Charles Frémont]].&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

[[Damian O'Flynn]], a [[Boston]] native, was cast in a combined 60 episodes, as Judge Tobin in the Dodge City segments and as Dr. Goodfellow, when the setting shifts to Tombstone; in the Wichita episodes, he plays Doc Fabrique.  Many episodes show Douglas Fowley as playing the part of Doc Fabrique when he actually is not in the episodes.  O'Flynn was left off the credits most of the time.  In "Frontier Surgeon" (January 19, 1960), Dr. Goodfellow must obtain a truce with Marshal Earp, who is apprehending a wounded outlaw. The man will die if moved after surgery, but he does not wait the three days to recuperate out of distrust of Earp and the protection of the $15,000 loot his gang and he have taken from [[Wells Fargo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631786/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_181|title="Frontier Surgeon" (January 19, 1960)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Coy]] appeared twice on ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'', as Henry Mason in "The Doctor" (1960) and as [[Ben Thompson (lawman)|Ben Thompson]] in "Dodge Is Civilized" (1959). In eight other episodes beginning at the start of the series, [[Denver Pyle]] had portrayed Ben Thompson, the gunfighter who was Earp's sometimes rival and reluctant friend, and who later became the marshal in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; Pyle was cast as Thompson beginning with the second episode of the series. In "Bill Thompson Gives In" (September 20, 1955), Earp uses a pair of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] scouts, rather than a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]], to help capture Ben Thompson and his brother, [[Billy Thompson (gunman)|Billy Thompson]] ([[Hal Baylor]]), who when inebriated killed the previous Ellsworth sheriff, Chauncey Whitney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631764/?ref_=tt_ep_ep3|title=Bill Thompson Gives In", September 20, 1955|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killing was subsequently ruled accidental.

In "Marshal Earp Meets General Lee", Earp uses creativity to defuse a tense situation involving a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer and cattle drovers who threaten to tear down Ellsworth. Earp simply declares January 19, 1874, the 67th birthday of [[General]] [[Robert E. Lee]], as "Robert E. Lee Day" in Ellsworth and pays respect to Lee as a defeated warrior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631821/?ref_=tt_ep_ep4|title="Marshal Earp Meets General Lee", September 27, 1955|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two actors who portrayed Earp's [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] friends and informers were [[Rico Alaniz]], a native of [[Mexico]], Mr. Cousin in 19 episodes between 1955 and 1959, and [[Rodd Redwing]] as Mr. Brother in eight episodes. The role of Mr. Brother ended with the 1958 episode "One" because the character is killed by four outlaws called the Dry Gulch Gang. Earp spent several subsequent episodes entitled "Two", "Three", and "Four" apprehending the gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631833/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_24|title="One", April 15, 1958|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of Buntline Special ===
In the show, O'Brian [[open carry|openly carried]] a [[Colt Buntline|Buntline Special]], a pistol with a 12-inch barrel, which triggered a mild toy craze at the time the series was originally broadcast. No credible evidence has been found that Wyatt Earp ever owned such a gun. The myth of Earp carrying a Buntline Special was created in [[Stuart N. Lake]]'s best-selling 1931 biography ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'', later admitted by the author to be highly fictionalized.&lt;ref name=shillingberg&gt;{{cite journal|title= Wyatt Earp and the Buntline Special Myth |url=http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-wyatt-earp-and-the-buntline-special-myth/13255 | first=William B. |last= Shillingberg |date=Summer 1976 |volume= 42|number= 2|pages=113–154 |journal=Kansas Historical Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent movie, ''[[Wyatt Earp: Return to Tombstone]],'' was released in 1994 featuring new footage of O'Brian as Earp mixed with flashbacks consisting of colorized scenes from the original series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Retro : The Wonder of Wyatt: Mixing the Old Series With New Scenes Brings Earp Back to TV--and Tombstone|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-06-26/news/tv-8527_1_wyatt-earp|accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new sequences co-starred [[Bruce Boxleitner]] (who had himself played Earp in the [[telefilm]] ''I Married Wyatt Earp''), Paul Brinegar (who later joined the ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' cast), [[Harry Carey, Jr.]] (who had, a year earlier, played Marshal Fred White in ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''), and [[Bo Hopkins]].

With the emergence of television in the 1950s, producers spun out a large number of Western-oriented shows. At the height of their popularity in 1959,  more than two dozen "cowboy" programs were on weekly. At least five others were connected to some extent with Wyatt Earp: ''Bat Masterson'', ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'', ''[[Broken Arrow (TV series)|Broken Arrow]]'', ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.&lt;ref name=guinn&gt;{{cite book|last=Guinn|first=Jeff|title=The Last Gunfight: The Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K.

An episode of ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' is aired each weekday at 4:45&amp;nbsp;pm ET on the [[Encore (TV channel)|Encore Western Channel]]. The episodes are presented in order of original air date.  Two episodes of the show are aired every day on [[Cozi TV]].

'''''The Slave Ship''''', originally titled '''''Slavers Throwing overboard the Dead and Dying—Typhoon&lt;!--sic--&gt; coming on''''',&lt;ref&gt;Turner's title, with period spelling of [[typhoon]]. [http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/slave-ship-slavers-throwing-overboard-the-dead-and-dying-typhoon-coming-on-31102]&lt;/ref&gt; is a painting by the British artist [[J. M. W. Turner]], first exhibited in 1840. Measuring 35 3/4 x 48 1/4 in. in [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]], it is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. In this classic example of a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[maritime painting]], Turner depicts a ship, visible in the background, sailing through a tumultuous sea of churning water and leaving scattered human forms floating in its wake.

== History ==
J.M.W. Turner was inspired to paint ''The Slave Ship'' in 1840 after reading ''The History and Abolition of the Slave Trade''&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages A Global History'', Volume II. Belmont: Wadsworth, 2008, p. 795.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Thomas Clarkson]]. In 1781, the captain of the [[slave ship]] ''[[Zong Massacre|Zong]]'' had ordered 133 slaves to be thrown overboard so that insurance payments could be collected. This event probably inspired Turner to create his landscape and to choose to coincide its exhibition with a meeting of the British [[Anti-Slavery Society]]. Although slavery had been outlawed in the [[British Empire]] since [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|1833]], Turner and many other [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] believed that slavery should be outlawed around the world. Turner thus exhibited his painting during the anti-slavery conference, intending for [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who was speaking at the event, to see it and be moved to increase British anti-slavery efforts.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}} Placed next to the painting were lines from Turner's own untitled poem, written in 1812:

::"Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay;
::Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds
::Declare the Typhon's coming.
::Before it sweeps your decks, throw overboard
::The dead and dying – ne'er heed their chains
::Hope, Hope, fallacious Hope!
::Where is thy market now?"

== Description ==
The first impression that the painting creates is of an enormous deep-red sunset over a stormy sea, an indication of an approaching typhoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20070513/NEWS/705130496|title=Early warning signs of an approaching tropical cyclone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon closer inspection one can discern a ship sailing off into the distance. The masts of the ship are red, matching the blood-red colour of the sky and the sickly copper colour of the water, which serves to blur the lines between various objects in the painting.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt; The ship's sails are furled, revealing that it is preparing for the typhoon. In the foreground can be seen a number of bodies floating in the water; their dark skin and chained hands and feet indicate that they are slaves, thrown overboard from the ship. Looking even more carefully, one can see fish and sea monsters swimming in the water, possibly preparing to eat the slaves, and sea gulls circling overhead above the chaos.

Consistent with Turner's emphasis on colour in many of his other works, the painting's central focus is on the interactions of various colours. Few defined brush strokes appear in the painting, and objects, colours, and figures become indistinct. Rather, objects are defined by their colours in the painting, and some objects (like the bodies of the slaves and the incoming storm) have no real border at all, being solely defined by the contrast with the pigments around them. The most prominent colours are the red of the sunset which encroaches into the water and ship as well, and the maroon of the bodies and hands of the slaves.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt;

== Style and interpretation ==
Turner's emphasis on colour rather than design is typical of many Romantic works of the time. The indistinct shapes and the pervasiveness of the sunset's blood-red colour serve to convey a focus on nature and illustrate the idea that nature is superior to man. Other colours in the painting, such as the cool blue of the ocean and the black caps of the water, bring the ocean's hues to life and give the viewer a sense of the true emotions of the natural world. The fact that the figures in the painting are depicted as minuscule and that even the ship is shunted to the background in favour of the water and the sun further serve to decrease the emphasis on humanity and transfer it to nature.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt;

By placing the emphasis on nature rather than on figures or objects, Turner evokes the concept of the "sublime", coined by [[Edmund Burke]]. The idea of the sublime is of the utter powerlessness and terror of humanity in the face of nature; by dramatising the strength of the waves and sun, Turner uses ''The Slave Ship'' to encapsulate, perfectly, Burke's definition of the term. Turner's decision to paint the work with a series of quick, frenzied brush strokes rather than carefully defined lines adds to the intensity of the painting, serving to make the viewer feel even more overwhelmed.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt; Though the painting's size is relatively small compared to many Romantic landscape paintings, it still captivates the viewer in arguably a more powerful way.

Some viewers have argued that ''The Slave Ship'' actually represents Turner's reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The painting might be viewed as an [[allegory]] against the exploitation of slaves and other human labour in favour of machines and economic advancement, represented by the coming storm engulfing the cruel captain. However, the storm could also be viewed as a representation of nature's dominance over man and of the ultimate futility in trying to industrialise and advance society.&lt;ref name="gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston Museum of Fine Arts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/slave-ship-slavers-throwing-overboard-the-dead-and-dying-typhoon-coming-on-31102|title=Slave Ship (Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, Typhoon Coming On)|date=25 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/art/crisis/crisis4e.html George P. Landow, ''J.M.W. Turner, The Slave Ship'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==

Mr. [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] is educated in art up to a point where that picture throws him into as mad an ecstasy of pleasure as it used to throw me into one of rage, last year, when I was ignorant. His cultivation enables him—and me, now—to see water in that glaring yellow mud, and natural effects in those lurid explosions of mixed smoke and flame, and crimson sunset glories; it reconciles him—and me, now—to the floating of iron cable-chains and other unfloatable things; it reconciles us to fishes swimming around on top of the mud—I mean the water. The most of the picture is a manifest impossibility—that is to say, a lie; and only rigid cultivation can enable a man to find truth in a lie. But it enabled Mr. Ruskin to do it, and it has enabled me to do it, and I am thankful for it. A Boston newspaper reporter went and took a look at the Slave Ship floundering about in that fierce conflagration of reds and yellows, and said it reminded him of a tortoise-shell cat having a fit in a platter of tomatoes. In my then uneducated state, that went home to my non-cultivation, and I thought here is a man with an unobstructed eye. Mr. Ruskin would have said: This person is an ass. That is what I would say, now.}}

The [[art critic]] [[John Ruskin]], who was the first owner of ''The Slave Ship'', wrote, "If I were reduced to rest Turner's immortality upon any single work, I should choose this."&lt;ref name="Boston Museum of Fine Arts" /&gt;

The painting was the subject of an extended poetic sequence or [[verse novel]] by [[David Dabydeen]], ''Turner'' (1994; reissued 2002).

'''''The World as Will and Representation''''' ('''''WWR'''''; {{lang-de|Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung}}, '''''WWV''''') is the central work of the [[List of German-language philosophers|German philosopher]] [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. The first edition was published in 1818/19,&lt;ref&gt;Although the first volume was published by December 1818, it was printed with a title page erroneously giving the year as 1819 ({{citation |last=Braunschweig |first=Yael |contribution=Schopenhauer and Rossinian Universiality: On the Italianate in Schopenhauer's Metaphysics of Music &lt;!--|pp=283–304--&gt; |title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor-last=Mathew |editor-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Walton |editor2-first=Benjamin |display-editors=0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]] |date=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-76805-4 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 297, n. 7]}}).&lt;/ref&gt; the second expanded edition in 1844, and the third expanded edition in 1859. In 1948, an abridged version was edited by [[Thomas Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mann, ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung von Schopenhauer in einer gekürzten Fassung dargeboten von Thomas Mann'' (Zurich: Classen, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

==English translations==
In the English language, this work is known under three different titles. Although English publications about Schopenhauer played a role in the recognition{{who|date=February 2016}} of his fame{{who|date=February 2016}} as a philosopher in later life (1851 until his death in 1860)&lt;ref&gt;especially John Oxenford, "Iconoclasm in German Philosophy," in ''[[Westminster Review]]'', new series 3 (1853): 388–407&lt;/ref&gt; and a three volume translation by [[R. B. Haldane]] and J. Kemp, titled ''The World as Will and Idea'', appeared already in 1883–1886,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''The World As Will and Idea'', 3 vols. transl. R. B. Haldane and J. Kemp (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1883–1886)&lt;/ref&gt; the first English translation of the expanded edition of this work under this title ''The World as Will and Representation'' appeared by E. F. J. Payne (who also translated several other works of Schopenhauer) as late as in 1958&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer "The world as will and representation", transl. by E. F. J. Payne (Indian Hills, Colorado: The Falcon’s Wing, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; (paperback editions in 1966 and 1969).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer "The world as will and representation", Courier Dover Publications (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; A later English translation by Richard E. Aquila in collaboration with David Carus is titled ''The World as Will and Presentation'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''The World as Will and Presentation'', trans. Richard E. Aquila in collaboration with David Carus (New York: Longman, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Present-day translator Richard Aquila argues that the reader will not grasp the details of the philosophy of Schopenhauer properly without this new title: "The World as Will and &lt;u&gt;Pre&lt;/u&gt;sentation". According to him, "Idea", "&lt;u&gt;Re&lt;/u&gt;presentation", and "&lt;u&gt;Pre&lt;/u&gt;sentation" are all acceptable renderings of the word ''Vorstellung'', but it is the notion of a performance or a theatrical presentation that is key in his interpretation. The world that we perceive is a "presentation" of objects in the theatre of our own mind; the observers, the "subject", each craft the show with their own stage managers, stagehands, sets, lighting, code of dress, pay scale, etc. The other aspect of the world, the Will, or "thing in itself", which is not perceivable as a presentation, exists outside time, space, and causality. Aquila claims to make these distinctions as linguistically precise as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkshirereview.newyorkarts.net/2009/06/24/presntationnew-look-at-schopenhauer/|title=It’s All in the Presentation: A New Look at Schopenhauer|publisher=|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2012-05-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130722063326/http://berkshirereview.newyorkarts.net/2009/06/24/presntationnew-look-at-schopenhauer/|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to earlier philosophical work==
[[Image:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815, second of the critical five years of the initial composition of ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung'']]
The main body of the work states at the beginning that it assumes prior knowledge of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s theories,&lt;ref&gt;WWR I, xv.&lt;/ref&gt; and Schopenhauer is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant's metaphysical system of [[transcendental idealism]] than any of the other later [[German Idealism|German Idealists]]. However, the book contains an appendix entitled "[[Critique of the Kantian Philosophy]]," in which Schopenhauer rejects most of Kant's [[ethics]] and significant parts of his [[epistemology]] and [[aesthetics]]. Schopenhauer demands that the introduction be read before the book itself, although it is not fully contained in this book but appeared earlier under the title ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He also states in his introduction that the reader will be at his best prepared to understand his theories if he has lingered in the school of [[Plato]] or he is already familiar with [[Indian philosophy]].

Schopenhauer believed that Kant had ignored inner experience, as intuited through the [[Will (philosophy)|will]], which was the most important form of experience.  Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian [[thing-in-itself]]. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body. According to Schopenhauer, the entire world is the representation of a single Will, of which our individual wills are phenomena. In this way, Schopenhauer's metaphysics go beyond the limits that Kant had set, but do not go so far as the rationalist system-builders who preceded Kant.  Other important differences are Schopenhauer's rejection of eleven of Kant's twelve categories, arguing that only [[causality]] was important.  [[Matter]] and causality were both seen as a union of [[time]] and [[space]] and thus being equal to each other.

Schopenhauer frequently acknowledges drawing on [[Plato]] in the development of his theories and, particularly in the context of aesthetics, speaks of the [[Platonic forms]] as existing on an intermediate [[ontology|ontological]] level between the representation and the Will.

==Development of the work==
The development of Schopenhauer's ideas took place very early in his career (1814–1818) and culminated in the publication of the first volume of ''Will and Representation'' in 1819. This first volume consisted of four books – covering his epistemology, [[ontology]], aesthetics and ethics, in order. Much later in his life, in 1844, Schopenhauer published a second edition in two volumes, the first a virtual reprint of the original, and the second a new work consisting of clarifications to and additional reflections on the first. His views had not changed substantially.

His belated fame after 1851 stimulated renewed interest in his seminal work, and led to a third and final edition with 136 more pages in 1859, one year before his death. In the preface to the latter, Schopenhauer noted: "If I also have at last arrived, and have the satisfaction at the end of my life of seeing the beginning of my influence, it is with the hope that, according to an old rule, it will last longer in proportion to the lateness of its beginning."&lt;ref&gt;WWR I, xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Will==
Schopenhauer used the word ''[[Will (philosophy)|will]]'' as a human's most familiar designation for the concept that can also be signified by other words such as  ''desire,'' ''striving,'' ''wanting,'' ''effort,'' and ''urging.'' Schopenhauer's philosophy holds that all nature, including man, is the expression of an insatiable ''will to life''.
It is through the will that mankind finds all their suffering. Desire for more is what causes this suffering. He argues that only aesthetic pleasure creates momentary escape from the Will. Although the concept of desire may be influenced by Buddhist teachings, it should not be treated as direct reference since desire is not thought to be the fundamental nature of human beings in Buddhism.

==Volume 1==

===Epistemology (Book 1)===
As mentioned above, Schopenhauer's notion of the will comes from the Kantian thing-in-itself, which Kant believed to be the fundamental reality behind the representation that provided the matter of perception, but lacked form. Kant believed that space, time, causation, and many other similar phenomena belonged properly to the form imposed on the world by the human mind in order to create the representation, and these factors were absent from the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer pointed out that anything outside of time and space could not be differentiated, so the thing-in-itself must be one and all things that exist, including human beings, must be part of this fundamental unity.  Our inner-experience must be a manifestation of the noumenal realm and the will is the inner kernel of every being.  All knowledge gained of objects is seen as self-referential, as we recognize the same will in other things as is inside us.

===Ontology (Book 2)===
In Book 2, [[electricity]] and [[gravity]] are described as fundamental forces of the will. [[Knowledge]] is something that was invented to serve the will and is present in both human and non-human animals. It is subordinate to the demands of the will for all animals and most humans. The fundamental nature of the universe and everything in it is seen as this will. Schopenhauer presents a pessimistic picture on which unfulfilled desires are painful, and pleasure is merely the sensation experienced at the instant one such pain is removed. However, most desires are never fulfilled, and those that are fulfilled are instantly replaced by more unfulfilled ones.

===Aesthetics (Book 3)===
Like many other aesthetic theories, Schopenhauer's centers on the concept of [[genius]]. Genius, according to Schopenhauer, is possessed by all people in varying degrees and consists of the capacity for aesthetic experience. An aesthetic experience occurs when an individual perceives an object and understands by it not the individual object itself, but the [[Platonic form]] of the object. The individual is then able to lose himself in the object of contemplation and, for a brief moment, escape the cycle of unfulfilled desire by becoming "the pure subject of will-less knowing". Those who have a high degree of genius can be taught to communicate these aesthetic experiences to others, and objects that communicate these experiences are works of art. Based on this theory, Schopenhauer viewed Dutch [[still-life]] as the best type of painting, because it was able to help viewers see beauty in ordinary, everyday objects. However, he sharply criticized depictions of nude women and prepared food, as these stimulate desire and thus hinder the viewer from the aesthetic experience and becoming "the pure subject of will-less knowing".

Music also occupies a privileged place in Schopenhauer's aesthetics, as he believed it to have a special relationship to the will. Where other forms of art are imitations of things perceived in the world, music is a direct expression and articulation of the will.

===Ethics (Book 4)===
Schopenhauer claims in this book to set forth a purely descriptive account of human ethical behavior, in which he identifies two types of behavior: the affirmation and denial of the will.

According to Schopenhauer, the Will (the great Will that is the [[thing-in-itself]], not the individual wills of humans and animals, which are phenomena of the Will) conflicts with itself through the [[Psychological egoism|egoism]] that every human and animal is endowed with.  Compassion arises from a transcendence of this egoism (the penetration of the illusory perception of individuality, so that one can [[empathise]] with the suffering of another) and can serve as a clue to the possibility of going beyond desire and the will.  Schopenhauer categorically denies the existence of the "freedom of the will" in the conventional sense, and only adumbrates how the will can be "released" or negated, but is not subject to change, and serves as the root of the chain of [[causality|causal]] [[determinism]].  His praise for [[asceticism]] led him to think highly of [[Buddhism]] and [[Vedanta]] [[Hinduism]], as well as some monastic orders and ascetic practices found in [[catholic Church|Catholicism]].  He expressed contempt for [[Protestantism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]], which he saw as optimistic, devoid of [[metaphysics]] and cruel to non-human animals. According to Schopenhauer, the deep truth of the matter is that in cases of the over-affirmation of the will – that is, cases where one individual exerts his will not only for its own fulfillment but for the improper domination of others – he is unaware that he is really identical with the person he is harming, so that the Will in fact constantly harms itself, and justice is done in the moment in which the crime is committed, since the same metaphysical individual is both the perpetrator and the victim.

Schopenhauer discusses suicide at length, noting that it does not actually destroy the Will or any part of it in any substantial way, since death is merely the end of one particular phenomenon of the Will, which is subsequently rearranged. By asceticism, the ultimate denial of the will, one can slowly weaken the individual will in a way that is far more significant than violent suicide, which is, in fact, in some sense an affirmation of the will.

According to Schopenhauer, denial of the will to live is the way to salvation from suffering. "Schopenhauer tells us that when the will is denied, the sage becomes nothing, without actually dying."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannan, ''The Riddle of the World'', Chapter 5, "Pessimism, Depression, and Salvation," "Salvation as Denial of the Will," p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; When willing disappears, both the willer and the world become nothing. "...[T]o one who has achieved the will-less state, it is the world of the willer that has been disclosed as 'nothing'. Its hold over us, its seeming reality, has been 'abolished' so that it now stands before us as nothing but a bad dream from which we are, thankfully, awaking."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Young, ''Schopenhauer'', Routledge, NY, 2005, Chapter Eight, "Salvation," p. 197 f.&lt;/ref&gt; As Schopenhauer wrote: "...to those in whom the will has turned and denied itself, this very real world of ours, with all its [[Sun]]s and [[Milky Way]]s, is – nothing."&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', Volume I, § 71. [...ist Denen, in welchen der Wille sich gewendet und verneint hat, diese unsere so sehr reale Welt mit allen ihren Sonnen und Milchstraßen – Nichts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy (Appendix)===
At the end of Book 4, Schopenhauer appended a thorough discussion of the merits and faults of Kant's philosophy. Schopenhauer's [[critique of the Kantian philosophy]] asserted that Kant's greatest error was the failure to distinguish between perceptual, intuitive knowledge, or insight and conceptual, discursive knowledge, or investigative thinking. One of Kant's greatest contributions, according to Schopenhauer, was the distinction of the [[phenomenon]] from the [[thing-in-itself]].

==Volume 2==
The second volume consisted of several essays expanding topics covered in the first.  Most important are his reflections on [[death]] and his theory on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], which saw it as a manifestation of the whole will making sure that it will live on and depriving humans of their [[reason]] and sanity in their longing for their loved ones. Less successful is his theory of [[genetics]]: he argued that humans inherit their will, and thus their character, from their fathers, but their intellect from their mothers and he provides examples from biographies of great figures to illustrate this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Recent genetics research might show Schopenhauer to be right.  For example, from New Scientist: "Eric 'Barry' Keverne ... and Azim Surani ... have evidence that in the mouse the mother's genes contribute more to the development of the 'thinking', or 'executive', centres of the brain, while paternal genes have a greater impact on the development of the 'emotional' limbic brain." (by Gail Vines, 03 May 1997, p 34, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420804.300-where-did-you-get-your-brains--baby-mice-may-inherit-their-mothers-wits-and-their-fathers-basicinstincts-but-what-does-this-mean-for-us-asks-gail-vines.html Where did you get your brains?])&lt;/ref&gt;  The second volume also contains attacks on contemporary philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]].

==Influence==
The first decades after its publication ''The World as Will and Representation'' was met with near silence. Exceptions were [[Goethe]] and [[Jean Paul]]. Goethe immediately started to read the [[magnum opus]] of Schopenhauer when it arrived and "read it with an eagerness as she [Ottilie von Goethe] had ''never'' before seen in him.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe told his daughter-in-law that he had now pleasure for an entire year, because he would read it completely, contrary to his custom of sampling pages to his liking. The influence of Schopenhauer can be read in [[Gespräche mit Goethe]] and {{interlanguage link|Urworte. Orphisch|de|Urworte. Orphisch}}.

In the years where the work was largely ignored, [[Jean Paul]] praised it as “a work of philosophical genius, bold, universal, full of penetration and profoundness — but of a depth often hopeless and bottomless, akin to that melancholy lake in Norway, in whose deep water, beneath the steep rock-walls, one never sees the sun, but only starts reflected.”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthur-schopenhauer-studienkreis.de/Arthur_Schopenhauer_7/arthur_schopenhauer_7.html|title=Unsere Zeit.

This neglect came to an end in the last years of his life. Schopenhauer would become the most influentual philosopher in Germany until [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Weltschmerz"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900.|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0198768710|location=Oxford|pages=14–16|quote=Arthur Schopenhauer was the most famous and influential philosopher in Germany from 1860 until the First World War. ... Schopenhauer had a profound influence on two intellectual movements of the late 19th century that were utterly opposed to him: neo-Kantianism and positivism. He forced these movements to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored, and in doing so he changed them markedly. ... Schopenhauer set the agenda for his age.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially artists were attracted to the work. No philosopher had given so much importance to art: one fourth of ''The World as Will and Representation'' is concerned with [[aesthetics]]. To be mentioned are [[Wagner]] ([[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]]), [[Arnold Schönberg|Schönberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Pamela C.|date=1984|title=Schopenhauer and Schoenberg|url=|journal=Journal of the Arnold Schoenberg Institute|volume= 8| issue =  1|pages=39–57|quote=The influence of Schopenhauer on Schoenberg's thinking can be seen in several different ways. First, the influence is reflected directly in Schoenberg's own essays, and philosophical writings about music and other matters. … Schoenberg owned almost all of the works of Schopenhauer … Schoenberg's use of his Schopenhauer volumes may be compared to his books by other philosophers: of Kant, Schopenhauer's direct intellectual forebear, he owned practically everything. Of Hegel, no books at all!|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805214/75341/sample/9780521475341wsc00.pdf Mahler: Das Lied von der Erde by Stephen Helfling]&lt;/ref&gt; who cites ''The World as Will and Representation'' as “the most profound writing on music he had ever encountered”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mahler’s Third Symphony and the Languages of Transcendence|last=Megan H. Francisco|first=|publisher=University of Washington|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Samuel Beckett]].

The philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Philipp Mainländer]] both described the discovery of ''The World as Will and Representation'' as a revelation. Nietzsche commented, “I belong to those readers of Schopenhauer who know perfectly well, after they have turned the first page, that they will read all the others, and listen to every word that he has spoken.”

[[Charles Darwin]] quoted ''The World as Will and Representation'' in ''[[The Descent of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADescent_of_Man_1875.djvu/602|title=The Descent of Man|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some read ideas in it that can be found in the theory of evolution, for example, that sexual instinct is a tool of nature to ensure the quality of the offspring and that intellect is a mere means to preserve life. Schopenhauer argued in favor of transformism by pointing to one of the most important and familiar evidences of the truth of the theory of descent, the homologies in the inner structure of all the vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Arthur O.|date=April 1911|title=SCHOPENHAUER AS AN EVOLUTIONIST|jstor=27900310|journal=The Monist|volume= 21| issue =  2|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's ideas on the unconscious can be found in [[psychoanalysis]] and the works of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. Whereas Jung acknowledged Schopenhauer's influence, Freud denied to have read Schopenhauer until late in life, a claim which is considered to be doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schopenhauer and Freud.|first=Young C. -  Brook A.|date=February 1994|title=Schopenhauer and Freud.|url=|journal=Int J Psychoanal.|volume=|pages=|quote=A close study of Schopenhauer's central work, 'The World as Will and Representation', reveals that a number of Freud's most characteristic doctrines were first articulated by Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer's concept of the will contains the foundations of what in Freud became the concepts of the unconscious and the id. Schopenhauer's writings on madness anticipate Freud's theory of repression and his first theory of the aetiology of neurosis. Schopenhauer's work contains aspects of what become the theory of free association. And most importantly, Schopenhauer articulates major parts of the Freudian theory of sexuality. These correspondences raise some interesting questions about Freud's denial that he even read Schopenhauer until late in life.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's discussions of language and ethics were a major influence on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the deeper preoccupation of his [Wittgenstein’s] later years remained the same as that of his youth: to complete the logical and ethical tasks begun by Kant and Schopenhauer." Allan Janik and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''Wittgenstein’s Vienna'', Chapter 7, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Moving on by way of Schopenhauer to Wittgenstein .... The only hope for the individual is to save his own soul; and even this he can do only by avoiding worldly entanglements. One of the few pieces of authentic moral advice Wittgenstein was heard to give in his later years is the maxim, ‘One must travel light.’" Allan Janik and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''Wittgenstein’s Vienna'', Chapter 8, p. 244. Also, "The only life that is happy is the life that can renounce the amenities of the world." Wittgenstein, ''Notebooks 1914–1916'', Note of August 13, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In theoretical matters, Wittgenstein’s later philosophy of the ''Philosophical Investigations'' is very different from – according to many an explicit rejection of – the philosophy of the ''Tractatus''. But since his personal life was rather clearly an attempt to live the ‘ethical’ life as conceived in the ''Tractatus'', it seems that in existential matters he did not change his mind. Given that this conception of the ethical life is so strongly influenced by Schopenhauer, it may be said that, in a way, Schopenhauer stayed with him all his life."  Julian Young, ''Schopenhauer'', Routledge, New York, 2005, p. 232 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's views on the independence of spatially separated systems, the ''[[principium individuationis#Arthur Schopenhauer|principium individuationis]]'', influenced [[Einstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Howard|first=Don A.|title=Albert Einstein as a Philosopher of Science|date=December 2005|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~dhoward1/vol58no12p34_40.pdf|journal=Physics Today|volume=58|issue=12|pages=34–40|publisher=American Institute of Physics|format=PDF|bibcode=2005PhT....58l..34H|doi=10.1063/1.2169442|accessdate=2015-03-08|via=University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, author's personal webpage|quote=From Schopenhauer he had learned to regard the independence of spatially separated systems as, virtually, a necessary a priori assumption ...

This view implies that difference of location suffices to make two systems different in the sense that each has its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other.
