      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">'''Airwave novels''' are stories told over [[radio broadcast]]s. It is a term mostly used within [[Culture of Hong Kong|Hong Kong culture]]. The stories can be anywhere from 15 minutes to hours long.

==History==
The first radio station to offer airwave novel entertainment in Hong Kong was [[Radio Rediffusion]]. [[Li Ngaw]] is generally considered the pioneer of the Chinese story broadcast format.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, Grant. Tam, Maria. [1997] (1997). Hong Kong: the anthropology of a Chinese metropolis. {{ISBN|0-7007-0601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he did not begin the art in Hong Kong as he was already doing the story broadcasts in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]].&lt;ref name="lcsd"&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/HKFA/english/newsletter/nl08_2.html lcsd.gov.hk]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art form was popular in Hong Kong during the [[1950s in Hong Kong|1950s]].&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

The term ''"Airwave novel"'' was first suggested by director Yam Wu-fa, when he bought the rights to [[Crime Doesn't Pay]] in 1949. The film originally started out as the airwave novel titled [[Flame of Lust]] by Li Ngaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/HKFA/english/newsletter02/nl27_2.html lcsd newsletter]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
Today radio stations in Hong Kong continue to broadcast stories. The format largely consist of [[Mogwai (Chinese culture)|mogwai]] and [[jiangshi]] tales (鬼故, literally Ghost tales). A number of [[Taxicabs of Hong Kong|Hong Kong taxi]] drivers do tune into the shows regularly, since radio remains to be their main form of entertainment. The stories are also for people with a deep interest in [[urban legend]] type haunted stories. The format, however, is considered an older style alternative entertainment to present day [[internet]], [[television]] etc.

[[File:American Christmas card 1850.jpg|thumb|250px|A 19th-century American Christmas card]]

A '''Christmas card''' is a [[greeting card]] sent as part of the traditional celebration of [[Christmas]] in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to  [[Christmastide]] and the [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday season]]. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding [[Christmas Day]] by many people (including some non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads "wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year". There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or [[Bible verse|Biblical verse]]; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive "Season's greetings".

A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas narrative]] with [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Jesus]], or have [[Christian symbols]] such as the [[Star of Bethlehem]] or a white [[dove]] representing both the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Peace]]. Many Christmas cards show [[Christmas tradition]]s, such as seasonal figures (e.g., [[Santa Claus]], [[snowman|snowmen]], and [[Santa Claus's reindeer|reindeer]]), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, [[holly]], baubles, and [[Christmas tree]]s, and Christmastime activities such as [[Christmas shopping#Shopping|shopping]], [[caroling]], and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as [[crinoline]]d shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his [[Christmas elf|elves]].

==History==

[[File:Christmas Shopping, 1910.JPG|thumb|250px| Children looking at Christmas cards in [[New York City|New York]]  1910]]
[[File:Christmas card2 byLouisPrang.png|thumb|250px|Christmas card by Louis Prang, showing a group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] frogs parading with banner and band.]]
The first recorded Christmas cards were sent by [[Michael Maier]] to [[James I of England]] and his son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]] in 1611.&lt;ref name="RCC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodall|first1=Paul|title=A Rosicrucian Christmas Card|journal=Rosicrucian Digest|date=2011|issue=1|pages=41–45|url=https://1bd9723bc8b0724b89d9-3657cf458561592fd0c7e3ec3895a19d.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/10_rosicrucian_christmas_card_052411.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in 1979 by [[Adam McLean]] in the [[Scottish Record Office]].&lt;ref name="McLean"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLean|first1=Adam|title=A Rosicrucian Manuscript of Michael Maier|journal=The Hermetic Journal|date=1979|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They incorporated [[Rosicrucian]] imagery, with the words of the greeting – "A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612"  –  being laid out to form a rose.

The next cards were commissioned by Sir [[Henry Cole]] and illustrated by [[John Callcott Horsley]] in London on 1 May 1843.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christmas Card|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Christmas-card|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1679110.stm Christmas card sold for record price] [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 12 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;György Buday, George Buday (1992). ''The history of the Christmas card.'' p.8. Omnigraphics, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London, England), 26 November 2001, p.8 12 cards from the original print run are said to survive: one, sent by Henry Cole and his wife to his grandmother, was sold in 2001 for £20,000.&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the [[Penny Post]] three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a [[shilling]] each.&lt;ref name="speech history"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Earnshaw| first = Iris| title = The History of Christmas Cards |url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~invhs/welcome.htm |publisher=Inverloch Historical Society Inc.|date=November 2003|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the [[lithograph]] firm [[Louis Prang|Prang and Mayer]] began creating [[greeting card]]s for the popular market in Britain The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America.  Its owner, [[Louis Prang]], is sometimes called the "father of the American Christmas card."&lt;ref name="meggspage148"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. ©1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 148 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the [[chromolithography]] process of printmaking.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the [[postcard]] spelled the end for elaborate Victorian-style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive [[Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection]] from the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] gathers 32,000 [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MMU Special Collections - Victorian Ephemera| publisher = [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]| date= | url =http://www.specialcollections.mmu.ac.uk/victoria.php| author = |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Small Museums #1: Manchester Metropolitan University’s Special Collections| publisher = Creative Tourist |date=10 May 2013 |url=http://www.creativetourist.com/articles/festivals-and-events/manchester/small-museums-manchester-metropolitan-universitys-special-collections/| author=Susie Stubbs |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand [[Hallmark Cards]] was established in 1913 by [[Joyce Hall]] with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards.&lt;ref name="American Economic History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=James S|author2=Abraham O Mendoza|title=American Economic History: A Dictionary and Chronology|date=1946|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Greenwood|page=287&lt;!--|pages=695--&gt;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZK5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA287&amp;dq=hallmark+christmas+cards+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yXBPCmGqJb&amp;sig=s-Kb30W6Zufd8U5rfwegRkK9hPk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wzaIVdnzKMa3oQSxwrmgDA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hallmark%20christmas%20cards%20history&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of [[World War I]] increased demand for cards to send to soldiers.&lt;ref name="American Economic History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=James S|author2=Abraham O Mendoza|title=American Economic History: A Dictionary and Chronology|date=1946|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Greenwood|page=287&lt;!--|pages=695--&gt;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZK5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;lpg=PA287&amp;dq=hallmark+christmas+cards+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yXBPCmGqJb&amp;sig=s-Kb30W6Zufd8U5rfwegRkK9hPk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wzaIVdnzKMa3oQSxwrmgDA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hallmark%20christmas%20cards%20history&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Wars]] brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic "studio cards" with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/metro/dec04/286613.asp |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Journal Sentinel]] |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828143811/http://www.jsonline.com/news/metro/dec04/286613.asp |archivedate=28 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters - especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/005870.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some card manufacturers now provide [[E-card]]s. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greetingcardassociation.org.uk/info-resource/market-info/facts-and-figures Facts And Figures - GCA: The Greeting Card Association] Retrieved 17 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
In mostly non-religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are rather called [[New Year Card]]s, however they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols.

===Official Christmas cards===
[[Image:Johnson White House Christmas Card.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]]'s 1967 White House Christmas card]]
"Official" Christmas cards began with [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in the 1840s. The [[British royal family]]'s cards are generally portraits reflecting significant personal events of the year.

Despite the governing practice of the [[separation of church and state]] within American politics, there is a long-standing custom for the [[President of the United States|President]] and [[First Lady]] to send [[White House]] Christmas Cards each holiday season.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=David|title=Signed, Sealed, Secular |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/18/opinion/la-oe-greenberg-xmascards-20111218|website=LA Times|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice originated with President [[Calvin Coolidge]], who was the first president to issue a written statement of peaceful tidings during the holidays in 1927.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storm|first1=Christian|title=Happy Holidays from the White House|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/presidential-holiday-cards-2014-12#calvin-coolidge-1927-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Herbert Hoover]] was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt;

In 1953, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] issued the first official [[White House]] card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/07/politics/main1103160.shtml |title=Bush 'Holiday' Cards Cause Stir |author=Melissa McNamara |date=7 December 2005 |work= |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial Christmas cards===
[[File:Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947.jpg|thumb|120px|Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947]]

Many businesses, from small local businesses to multi-national enterprises send Christmas cards to the people on their customer lists, as a way to develop general goodwill, retain brand awareness and reinforce social networks. These cards are almost always discrete and secular in design, and do not attempt to sell a product, limiting themselves to mentioning the name of the business. The practice harkens back to [[trade cards]] of the 18th century, an ancestor of the modern Christmas card.

===Charity Christmas cards===
[[Image:Royal Typewriter Christmas Card 1909.jpg|thumb|120px|  Christmas card promoting [[Royal Typewriter Company|Royal typewriters]]]]

Many organizations produce special Christmas cards as a fundraising tool. The most famous of these enterprises is probably the [[UNICEF]] Christmas card program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/philippines/downloads/07Consumer%20Brochure.pdf UNICEF Christmas Card Program, ''UNICEF Philippines'']&lt;/ref&gt; launched in 1949, which selects artwork from internationally known artists for card reproduction. The UK-based Charities Advisory Trust gives out an annual "Scrooge Award" to the cards that return the smallest percentage to the charities they claim to support&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charitiesadvisorytrust.org.uk/charitiesadvisorytrust/awards.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Charitiesadvisorytrust.org.uk |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not universally well received by the Christmas card producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digiprintchristmas.com/blog/2012/06/charities-advisory-trust/ The Charities Advisory Trust – Killing a UK market in decline]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christmas stamps and stickers===
[[File:Santa Coming Down the Chimney Drawing.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Coming Down the Chimney]]
Many countries produce official Christmas [[postage stamp|stamps]], which may be brightly colored and depict some aspect of Christmas tradition or a Nativity scene. Small decorative stickers are also made to seal the back of envelopes, typically showing a trinket or some symbol of Christmas.

In 2004, the German post office gave away 20 million free scented stickers, to make Christmas cards smell of a fir Christmas tree, cinnamon, gingerbread, a honey-wax candle, a baked apple and an orange.

===Collectors items===
From the beginning, Christmas cards have been avidly collected. [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] amassed a large collection that is now housed in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian Christmas Cards|publisher=World Collectors Net|url=http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/magazine/issue13/iss13p3.html|website=WCN Magazine|accessdate=9 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827104410/http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/magazine/issue13/iss13p3.html|archivedate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University College London]]'s [[Slade School of Fine Art]] houses a collection of handmade Christmas Cards from alumni such as [[Paula Rego]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] and are displayed at events over the Christmas season, when members of the public can make their own Christmas cards in the '''Strang Print Room'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/uclart/events |title=UCL Slade Art Collection Events |author= |date= |work= |publisher=UCL.co.uk |accessdate=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specimens from the "golden age" of printing (1840s–1890s) are especially prized and bring in large sums at auctions. In December 2005, one of Horsley's original cards sold for nearly £9,000. Collectors may focus on particular images like [[Santa Claus]], poets, or printing techniques. The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J.&amp;nbsp;C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole. The card, one of the world's first, was sold in 2001 by UK auctioneers Henry Aldridge to an anonymous bidder for a record breaking £22,250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warner|first1=Gerald|title=A perfect excuse not to send Christmas cards|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/6443371/A-perfect-excuse-not-to-send-Christmas-cards.html|accessdate=24 December 2015|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home-made cards===
[[File:Happy Christmas.jpg|thumb|Christmas card made on a [[personal computer|PC]] incorporating [[digital photography]].]]
Since the 19th century, many families and individuals have chosen to make their own Christmas cards, either in response to monetary necessity, as an artistic endeavour, or in order to avoid the commercialism associated with Christmas cards. With a higher preference of handmade gifts during the 19th century over purchased or commercial items, homemade cards carried high sentimental value as gifts alone. Many families make the creation of Christmas cards a family endeavour and part of the seasonal festivity, along with stirring the Christmas cake and decorating the tree. Over the years such cards have been produced in every type of paint and crayon, in collage and in simple printing techniques such as potato-cuts. A revival of interest in paper crafts, particularly [[scrapbooking]], has raised the status of the homemade card and made available an array of tools for stamping, punching and cutting.

Advances in [[digital photography]] and printing have provided the technology for many people to design and print their own cards, using their original graphic designs or photos, or those available with many computer programs or online as [[clip art]], as well as a great range of typefaces. Such homemade cards include personal touches such as family photos and holidays snapshots. [[Crowdsourcing]], another trend enabled by the Internet, has allowed thousands of independent and hobbyist graphic designers to produce and distribute holiday cards around the world.

==The Christmas card list==
[[File:Christmarkt.jpg|thumb|Christmas Market in Nürnberg, lithography from the 19th century.]]
[[File:Carl Røgind julekort.jpg|thumb|Danish Christmas card, 1919]]
Many people send cards to both close friends and distant acquaintances, potentially making the sending of cards a multi-hour chore in addressing dozens or even hundreds of envelopes. The greeting in the card can be personalized but brief, or may include a summary of the year's news. The extreme of this is the '''Christmas letter''' (below). Because cards are usually exchanged year after year, the phrase "to be off someone's Christmas card list" is used to indicate a falling out between friends or public figures.

===Christmas letters===
{{main|Round-robin letter}}
Some people take the annual mass mailing of cards as an opportunity to update those they know with the year's events, and include the so-called "Christmas letter" reporting on the family's doings, sometimes running to multiple printed pages. In the UK these are known as [[round-robin letter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Round Robins|url=http://www.debretts.com/etiquette/home-life/family-occasions/christmas/round-robins.aspx|work=Debrett's|publisher=Debrett's}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a practical notion, Christmas letters meet with a mixed reception; recipients may take it as boring minutiae, bragging, or a combination of the two, whereas other people appreciate Christmas letters as more personal than mass-produced cards with a generic missive and an opportunity to "catch up" with the lives of family and friends who are rarely seen or communicated with. Since the letter will be received by both close and distant relatives, there is also the potential for the family members to object to how they are presented to others; an entire episode of ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' was built around conflict over the content of just such a letter.

==Environmental impact and recycling==
[[File:Holly Christmas card from NLI.jpg|thumb|Christmas card with holly]]
[[File:Hnizdovsky Rizdvo1.gif|thumb|[[Jacques Hnizdovsky]] Christmas card]]
During the first 70 years of the 19th century it was common for Christmas and other greeting cards to be recycled by women's service organizations who collected them and removed the pictures, to be pasted into scrap books for the entertainment of children in hospitals, orphanages, kindergartens and missions. With children's picture books becoming cheaper and more readily available, this form of scrap-booking has almost disappeared.

Recent concern over the environmental impact of printing, mailing and delivering cards has fueled an increase in e-cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/28/AR2007112800673_2.html?sid=ST2007112801072 |title=The Greening of Christmas |author=Jura Koncius |date=29 November 2007|work= |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/dec/13/christmas2006.greenchristmas |title=Avoiding the wrap tap |author=Hilary Osborne |date=13 December 2006 |work= |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=22 September 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] conservation charity [[Woodland Trust]] runs an annual campaign to collect and [[recycling|recycle]] Christmas cards to raise awareness of recycling and collect donations from corporate sponsors and supporters. All recycled cards help raise money to plant more trees. In the 12 years that the Woodland Trust Christmas Card Recycling Scheme has been running, more than 600 million cards have been recycled. This has enabled the Woodland Trust to plant more than 141,000 trees, save over 12,000 tonnes of paper from landfill and stop over 16,000 tonnes of CO2 from going into the atmosphere – the equivalent to taking more than 5,000 cars off the road for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/cards/|title = Christmas Card Recycling Scheme|author = |date = |work = Woodland Trust Website|publisher = Woodland Trust|accessdate = |deadurl = |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme has had celebrity supporters including Jo Brand, Dermot O' Leary and Sean Bean and is the longest running scheme of its type in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/our-partners/corporate-partners/marks-and-spencer/|title = Woodland Trust M&amp;S Partnership|date = |accessdate = 9 November 2015|website = Woodland Trust Website|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney: The Archers''''' is an oil-on-canvas painting by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] undertaken between 1769 and 1770.&lt;ref name="artf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/9525/colonel-acland-and-lord-sydney-the|title=Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney: The Archers|accessdate=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=70921&amp;searchid=10016&amp;tabview=work|title=Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney: The Archers  1769|accessdate=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork depicts the two [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s [[John Dyke Acland|Colonel John Dyke Acland]] (1746–1778; at right) and [[Dudley Cosby, 1st Baron Sydney|Lord Sydney]] (1732–1774), a diplomat. Reynolds began the work in 1769, and completed it the next year. In 1769 Reynolds had become the first president of the new [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name="artf" /&gt; In September 2005, the [[Tate Gallery]] purchased the painting for more than £2.5 million, equivalent to [[United States|US]]$4.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Archers saved for the Nation - A first for Tate's new Collection Fund'' (Press release of 6 September 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

The work portrays the two men holding each a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], while the [[shotgun]] was the more popular choice of weapon at the time.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}
These two bow-wielding men can be seen in the clearing of a forest. They are both garbed in [[archery|archer]] clothing; their hunted prey lies close to their feet. Their facial expressions, coupled with Cosby's eagerness and poise, suggest that they are both preparing to loose an [[arrow]] at an approaching animal.
Distantly in the background, a river, a clump of trees, and a meadow can be seen. Further back, at the skyline mountain peaks can be seen below thick grey clouds.

The portrait shares the same textural schemes and design of several other works by Reynolds. The allusion to the classical era is apparent in both the clothing worn by the two aristocrats, and their choice of weapon.&lt;ref name="artf" /&gt;

== Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}}However, the use of the bow for recreational use was, at the time, coming back into revival, and so this may not have been too uncommon when Reynolds created the work.

In three dimensional [[geometry]], there are four infinite series of [[point groups in three dimensions]] (''n''≥1) with ''n''-fold rotational or reflectional symmetry about one axis (by an angle of 360°/''n'') that does not change the object.

They are the finite [[symmetry group]]s on a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]. For ''n'' = ∞ they correspond to four [[frieze group]]s. [[Arthur Moritz Schönflies|Schönflies]] notation is used. The terms horizontal (h) and vertical (v) imply the existence and direction of reflections with respect to a vertical axis of symmetry. Also shown are [[Coxeter notation]] in brackets, and, in parentheses, [[orbifold notation]].
[[File:Order 4 dihedral symmetry subgroup tree.png|thumb|Example symmetry subgroup tree for dihedral symmetry: ''D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt;'', [4,2], (*224)]]

== Types ==

;Chiral:
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, (''nn'')''' of order ''n'' - ''n''-fold rotational symmetry - '''acro-n-gonal group''' (abstract group [[cyclic group|''Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']]); for ''n''=1: '''no symmetry''' ([[trivial group]])
;Achiral:
[[File:S shaped packing.jpeg|thumb|Piece of loose-fill [[cushioning]] with ''C&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt;'' symmetry]]
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2], (''n''*)''' of order 2''n'' - '''prismatic symmetry''' or '''ortho-n-gonal group''' (abstract group [[cyclic group|''Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'']] &amp;times; ''Dih&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''); for ''n''=1 this is denoted by '''''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1*)''' and called '''[[reflection symmetry]]''', also '''[[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]]'''. It has [[reflection symmetry]] with respect to a plane perpendicular to the ''n''-fold rotation axis.
*'''''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'', [n], (*''nn'')''' of order 2''n'' - '''pyramidal symmetry''' or '''full acro-n-gonal group''' (abstract group ''Dih&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''); in biology  ''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called '''biradial symmetry'''. For ''n''=1 we have again ''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1*). It has vertical mirror planes. This is the symmetry group for a regular ''n''-sided [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]].
*'''''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,2n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], (''n''&amp;times;)''' of order 2''n'' - '''gyro-n-gonal group''' (not to be confused with [[symmetric group]]s, for which the same notation is used; abstract group ''Z&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;''); It has a 2''n''-fold [[improper rotation|rotoreflection]] axis, also called 2''n''-fold improper rotation axis, i.e., the symmetry group contains a combination of a reflection in the horizontal plane and a rotation by an angle 180°/n. Thus, like ''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'', it contains a number of improper rotations without containing the corresponding rotations.
** for ''n''=1 we have ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ('''1&amp;times;'''), also denoted by '''''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''; this is [[Inversion in a point|inversion symmetry]]. 

'''''C&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2,2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (2*)''' and '''''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'', [2], (*22)''' of order 4 are two of the three 3D symmetry group types with the [[Klein four-group]] as abstract group. ''C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;'' applies e.g. for a rectangular tile with its top side different from its bottom side.

== Frieze groups ==
In the limit these four groups represent Euclidean plane [[frieze group]]s as C&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;∞v&lt;/sub&gt;, and S&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. Rotations become translations in the limit. Portions of the infinite plane can also be cut and connected into an infinite cylinder.

[[Image:Dalahäst i avesta.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The world's largest Dalecarlian horse, made of [[concrete]] and located in [[Avesta Municipality|Avesta]], [[Sweden]].]]

A '''Dalecarlian horse''' or  '''Dala horse''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɑː|l|ə|ˈ|k|ɑːr|l|i|ə|n}};&lt;ref&gt;"Dalecarlia", ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'', 2013, web: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dalecarlia MWeb-Dal].&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish: '''Dalahäst''') is a traditional carved, painted wooden statue of a [[horse]] originating in the Swedish province of [[Dalarna]] (Dalecarlia). In the old days the Dalecarlian horse was mostly used as a toy for children; in modern times it has become a symbol of Dalarna, as well as of [[Sweden]] in general. Several different types of Dalecarlian horses are made, with distinguishing features common to the locality of the site where they are produced. One particular style has, however, become much more common and widespread than others. It is stoutly carved and painted bright red with details and a [[horse harness|harness]] in white, green, yellow and blue.

==History==

It was in the small log cabins deep in the forests during the long winter nights in front of a log fire that the forerunner of the Dala horse was born. Using simple tools, generally only a knife, woodcarvers made toys for their children. It was only natural that many of these toys were horses, because the horse was invaluable in those days, as a trusty friend and worker who could pull great loads of timber from the forests during the winter months, and in the summer could be of just as much use on the farm.

The art of carving and painting the small horses quickly flourished in the 19th century, as economic hardship in the region inspired greater production of the small horses, and they became an important item of [[barter]]. Horse-making may have started as something to do during the long dark winter months, but soon the Dala horses were traded in exchange for household goods and their carving and painting blossomed into a full-fledged cottage industry. The rural families depended on horse production to help keep food on the table, as the skills of horse carving and painting were passed on from generation to generation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Image:Dalecarlian horse.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|The wooden horses are painted in the ''[[kurbits]]'' style. This one from around 1950.]]
The carving of Dala horses as a livelihood is thought to have started in the village of [[Bergkarlås]] in central Sweden, though the nearby "horse" villages of [[Risa (Sweden)|Risa]], [[Vattnäs]], and [[Nusnäs]] were also centres of horse-making. The villages were involved in the art of furniture and clock-making, and it is likely the leftover scraps of wood were put to use in the production of Dala horses.&lt;ref&gt;''Art &amp; Technique of Scandinavian Style Woodcarving'' by Harley Refsal (2004) - Fox Chapel Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Many early Dala horses were not painted at all, but in the beginning of the 19th century painting them in a single color, white or red, became common practice. The decoration of the Dala horse has its roots in furniture painting and was perfected over the years. According to a local tale, a wandering painter in the style of ''[[kurbits]]'' came across one of these Dala horses in a farm he was decorating. When asked by one of the children why that horse was not as beautifully painted as the ones in the decorations, he painted the Dala horse in the same style. This tradition was then carried on in order to raise the market value of the Dala horses.

The earliest references to wooden horses for sale are from 1623—nearly 400 years ago. In the 19th century, [[Stikå-Erik Hansson]] from the village Risa in the parish of [[Mora, Sweden|Mora]] introduced the technique of painting with two colours on the same brush, still used today. In the book "The Wooden Horses of Sweden," the author mentions that this famous Dala painter is buried in a small churchyard in Nebraska after having immigrated to the Midwest in 1887 at the age of 64.) He changed his name to Erik Erikson upon coming to America and is buried at Bega Cemetery in Stanton County Nebraska, outside of Norfolk.

While there were many horse whittlers in the early production of Dala horses, there were comparatively few horse painters. The large number of whittlers and a lack of distinguishing features makes it difficult to distinguish between different whittlers. Early painters very rarely signed their work, but they did have their own distinct pattern from which it is often possible to identify who painted a particular horse. In the 1930s (especially after the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|World's Expo in Paris 1937]] and [[1939 New York World's Fair|World's Fair in New York 1939]] in which Dala horses were shown) [[mass production]] of Dala horses started. This marks the beginning of a new era for the Dala horse, transitioning from toy to a national symbol and popular souvenir.

The Dalecarlian horse of today is still a handcrafted article, made of pine, and its pattern is about 150 years old. At least nine different people contribute their skills to create each horse. The distinctive shape of the horse is due to the usage of [[Scandinavian flat-plane style of woodcarving|flat-plane style carving]].

===Folklore===
An apocryphal legend of the Dalecarlian horse is that they became the national toy in 1716. According to the legend, soldiers loyal to [[Charles XII of Sweden|King Charles XII]] were quartered in the Dalecarlian region and carved the toys as gifts for their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;''Oddball Minnesota: A Guide to Some Really Strange Places'' by Jerome Pohlen (2003) - Chicago Review Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical differences==
[[Image:Rytter Olof Matsson Dala Horse.jpg|200px|right|thumb|alt=Rytter Olof Matsson Dala Horse|A Dala horse painted by Rytter Olof Matsson, Risa, around 1910.]]
Early production of Dala horses was concentrated to four villages: Bergkarlås, Risa, Vattnäs, and Nusnäs, all in the parish of Mora. Production is believed to have started in
Bergkarlås and later spread to nearby villages Risa and Vattnäs through kindred. At about the same time production started independently in Nusnäs, and being farther away their style was less influenced by those of the other villages. The individual painters each had their particular style, and the few who are old enough to remember first- or second-hand the history can often tell which village, and in some cases which carver or painter, turned out a particular horse. The distinguishing features of many early painters from these villages have now been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} [http://www.dalahorse.info Dalahästen - en kulturskatt] (online encyclopedia of early carvers and painters)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} ''Dalahästen från Nusnäs, Sverigesymbolen'' by Ivar Johansson (2009) - Notdraget Lidingö&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the works by the earliest horse makers are no longer in existence but those that remain are cherished by their owners and have often been passed down through generations. These are also coveted by collectors, and their value has risen markedly over the years.

Today, many of the villages in Dalarna county make Dala horses with individual styles representing the district of origin. These horses also have distinctive shapes and often come in different sizes. Some horses like the Nusnäs horse are stocky work horses; others are lean and upright with stately countenance like the [[Rättvik]] horse. Many of these can be seen at a yearly exhibition (since the year 2000), which is held at [[Klockargården]] in [[Leksand]], Sweden. Currently about forty present carvers and painters show their Dala horses and put them up for sale.

==Production==
Today, Nusnäs is the centre of Dala horse production with the most famous being the [[Nils Olsson]] and [[Grannas Olsson]] workshops. Grannas A. Olssons Hemslöjd AB, founded in 1922, is the oldest company which still makes Dalecarlian horses.  Nils Olssons Hemslöjd is almost as old. The horses made at these workshops share the same familiar pattern which most people associate to Dala horses. Apart from these, old-style horses are also hand-carved and painted in limited editions to replicate the style of the antique horses found in Swedish museums or held in private family collections. These are numbered and signed, so that they cannot be confused with an original early Dala horse.

The wood from which the figures are carved comes from the slow-growing pine forests around [[Siljan (lake)|Lake Siljan]]. The wood is ideal for carpentry and carving. The trees to be made into horses are marked out while still standing in the forest. Only the best timber will be selected for carving into horses. The trees are felled and sawed into pieces of a suitable size for the blanks that will eventually be made into Dalecarlian horses.

The blanks are sawed and carved by hand. Because of this, no two horses are exactly alike. The horses are dipped in primer immediately after carving, to reveal any defects in the wood that may need to be fixed. After priming, any cavities in the wood are filled in to ensure extra smoothness. The horses are polished to give them a smooth, attractive finish.

After sanding, the horses are dipped into paint of the appropriate colour. The traditional pattern is painted free-hand by practised "ripple" painters. The art of rippling requires great skill and takes many years to learn. Finally, "all the fine horses" are varnished and sent out from Nusnäs to serve as a symbol of Sweden in the outside world.

Dala horses were introduced to North America at the [[1939 World's Fair]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dalahästens Hemsida - Dalahästar hos Grannas A Olssons Hemslöjd AB|url = http://www.grannas.com/mainframe.php?page=1939|website = www.grannas.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects Sven Markelius and Anders Beckman chose the dala horse because they were searching for a powerful symbol for the Swedish pavilion at the fair. 

A similar dala horse can be seen in [[Andersonville, Chicago]], donated by the Swedish American Women's Educational Association (SWEA) to the [[Swedish American Museum]]. SWAE commissioned the Swedish Artist Lars Gillis to paint the dala horse in a way that represents the connection between Sweden and Chicago. After eight years, the original dala horse could not withstand the harsh Chicago weather conditions and was removed in 2013 for restoration that took a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Andersonville's Dala Horse Returns to the Neighborhood|url = https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140206/andersonville/andersonvilles-dala-horse-returns-neighborhood|website = DNAinfo Chicago|access-date = 2016-01-25|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160130144352/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140206/andersonville/andersonvilles-dala-horse-returns-neighborhood|archivedate = 2016-01-30|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now kept in the lobby of the Swedish American Museum, which provided a [[fiberglass]] replica placed on the corner of Clark and Farragut streets.

The '''dictator novel''' ({{lang-es|'''novela del dictador'''}}) is a [[literary genre|genre]] of [[Latin American literature]] that challenges the role of the [[dictator]] in Latin American society. The theme of ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]''&amp;mdash;the régime of a charismatic ''caudillo'', a political strongman&amp;mdash;is addressed by examining the relationships between [[Power (philosophy)|power]], dictatorship, and writing. Moreover, a dictator novel often is an allegory for the role of the writer in a Latin American society. Although mostly associated with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the dictator-novel genre has its roots in the nineteenth-century non-fiction work ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]. As an indirect critique of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s dictatorial régime in Argentina, ''Facundo'' is the forerunner of the dictator novel genre; all subsequent dictator novels hearken back to it. As established by Sarmiento, the goal of the genre is not to analyze the rule of particular dictators, or to focus on historical accuracy, but to examine the abstract nature of [[Authority|authority figures]] and of authority in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be considered a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the ''caudillo'', and some general reflection on the nature of [[authoritarianism]]. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes ''[[I, the Supreme]]'' (1974), by [[Augusto Roa Bastos]], about [[Dr. Francia]] of Paraguay, and ''[[The Feast of the Goat]]'' (2000), by [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], about [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in ''Reasons of State'' (1974), by [[Alejo Carpentier]], in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential in the development of a Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] dispensers of wisdom, like that of the ''caudillo'' whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.

==Literary context==
{{Literature}}
Literary critic [[Roberto González Echevarría]] argues that the dictator novel is “the most clearly indigenous thematic tradition in Latin American literature”, and traces the development of this theme from “as far back as Bernal Díaz del Castillo’s and Francisco López de Gómara’s accounts of Cortés’s conquest of Mexico.”&lt;ref name="gonzech65"&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nineteenth century saw significant literary reflections on political power, though on the whole the dictator novel is associated with the [[Latin American Boom]], a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For critic [[Gerald Martin]], the dictator novel marks the end of the Boom and even (as he says of Roa Bastos's ''I, the Supreme'') “the end of an entire era in Latin American history, the era which had stretched from Sarmiento's ''Facundo'' in 1845."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, many dictator novels focused on the figure “of the aging dictator, prey to the boredom of a limitless power he is on the verge of losing.”&lt;ref name="gonzech65" /&gt;

== Definition ==

Miguel Ángel Asturias's ''[[El Señor Presidente]]'' (written in 1933, but not published until 1946) is, in the opinion of critic Gerald Martin, "the first real dictator novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other literary treatments of the dictator figure followed, such as Jorge Zalamea's ''El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto'', but the genre did not gain impetus until it was reinvented in the political climate of the [[cold war]], through the [[Latin American Boom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1984|p= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictator novel came back into fashion in the 1970s, towards the end of the Boom. As Sharon Keefe Ugalde remarks, "the 1970s mark a new stage in the evolution of the Latin American dictator novel, characterized by at least two developments: a change in the perspective from which the dictator is viewed and a new focus on the nature of language."&lt;ref name="Keefe369"&gt;Keefe Ugalde, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;  By this she means that the dictator novels of the 1970s, such as ''[[The Autumn of the Patriarch]]'' or ''I, the Supreme'', offer the reader a more intimate view of their subject: "the dictator becomes protagonist"&lt;ref name = Keefe369/&gt; and the world is often seen from his point of view. With the new focus on language, Keefe Ugalde points to the realisation on the part of many authors that "the tyrant's power is derived from and defeated by language."&lt;ref name = Keefe369/&gt; For example, in Jorge Zalamea's ''El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto'' the dictator bans all forms of language.&lt;ref name = "1Martin269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Raymond L. Williams, it was not until the 1970s, when enough Latin American writers had published novels dealing with military regimes, that "dictator novel" became common nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2003|p= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most celebrated novels of this era were Alejo Carpentier's ''Reasons of State'' (1974), Augusto Roa Bastos's ''I, the Supreme'' (1974), and Gabriel García Marquez's ''The Autumn of the Patriarch'' (1975). He defines the dictator novel as a novel which draws upon the historical record to create fictionalized versions of dictators. In this way, the author is able to use the specific to explain the general, as many dictator novels are centred around the rule of a one particular dictator.&lt;ref name = 1Martin266&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this group he includes those novelists who took to task authoritarian figures such as Vargas Llosa's ''Conversation in the Cathedral'' (1969) and Denzil Romero's ''La tragedia del Generalísimo'' (1984). He even includes Sergio Ramírez's ''¿Te dio miedo la sangre?'' (1977), a novel about Nicaraguan society under the Somoza dictatorship, which has been described as a "dictator novel without the dictator".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Craft| 1997|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and theme ==
The novelists of the dictator novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing.&lt;ref name="2Williams4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern techniques, constructed largely in the late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality.&lt;ref name = 2Williams4/&gt; Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to the dictator novel genre pioneered what came to be known as [[magical realism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the use of this technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.

A predominant theme of the dictator novel is power,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; which according literary critic Michael Valdez Moses, in his 2002 review of ''Feast of the Goat'', is linked to the theme of dictatorship: "The enduring power of the Latin American dictator novel had everything to do with the enduring power of Latin American dictators".&lt;ref name="moses"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moses|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As novels such as ''El Señor Presidente'' became more well-known, they were read as ambitious political statements, denouncing the authority of dictators in Latin America.&lt;ref name="2Williams11"/&gt; As political statements, dictator novel authors challenged dictatorial power, creating a link between power and writing through the force wielded by their pen. For example, in Roa Bastos's ''I, The Supreme'', the novel revolves around a central theme of language and the power inherent in all of its forms, a power that is often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarría argues that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of Policarpo Patiño ..., [and] his constant worry about writing all stem from the fact that he has found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supremo defines power as being able to do through others what we are unable to do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves. Dr. Francia has also realized that he cannot control language, particularly written language, that it has a life of its own that threatens him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another constant theme which runs throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is the interdependence of the Latin American tyrant and [[American imperialism|United States imperialism]].&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; In Mario Vargas Llosa's ''The Feast of the Goat'', for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the [[CIA]], previously held for over 32 years in light of his anti-communist leanings.&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt;

Gender is an additional overarching theme within dictator novels. National portraits in Latin America often insist on the importance of women (and men) that are healthy, happy, productive, and patriotic, yet many national literary treasures often reflect government rhetoric in the way they code active citizenship as male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Biron|2000|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinity is an enduring motif in the dictator novel. There is a connection between the pen and the penis in Latin American fiction, but this pattern cannot be explained by machismo alone&amp;mdash;it is far more complex. According to Rebecca E. Biron, "where we find violent, misogynistic fantasies of masculinity, we also [find] violent social relations between actual men and women."&lt;ref name="biron16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Biron|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Latin American works "include characters who act out violent fictions of masculinity, and yet their narrative structure provides readers with alternative responses to misogynistic fantasies of masculine identity formation".&lt;ref name="biron16" /&gt;

==Historical context==

===Dictators in Latin American history===
Since independence, Latin American countries have been subject to both right and left-wing [[authoritarian]] regimes, stemming from a history of [[colonialism]] in which one group dominated another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this long history, it is unsurprising that there have been so many novels "about individual dictators, or about the problems of dictatorship ''caudillismo'', ''caciquismo'', militarism and the like."&lt;ref name = 1Martin266/&gt; The legacy of colonialism is one of racial conflict sometimes pushing an absolute authority to rise up to contain it&amp;mdash;thus the tyrant is born. Seeking unlimited power, dictators often amend constitutions, dismantling laws which prevent their reelection. [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera|Licenciado Manuel Estrada Cabrera]], for example, altered the [[Guatemala]]n Constitution in 1899 to permit his return to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|p=470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictators who have become the focus of the dictator novel (Augusto Roa Bastos's ''I, the Supreme'', for instance, is based on Paraguay's dictator of the early nineteenth century, the so-called Dr Francia) do not differ much from each other in terms of how they govern. As author González Echevarría states: "they are male, militaristic, and wield almost absolute personal power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their strong-arm tactics include exiling or imprisoning their opposition, attacking the freedom of the press, creating a centralized government backed by a powerful military force, and assuming complete control over free thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|pp=468, 470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martinez &gt;{{Harvnb|Arévalo Martínez|1945|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite intense criticisms leveled at these figures, dictators involved in [[Nationalism|nationalist movements]] developed three simple truths, "that everybody belonged, that the benefits of Progress should be shared, and that industrial development should be the priority".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chasteen|2006|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epitácio Lindolfo da Silva Pessoa|Epitácio Pessoa]], who was elected President of Brazil in 1919, wanted to make the country progress regardless of whether or not Congress passed the laws he proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, during the [[Great Depression]], Latin American activist governments of the 1930s saw the end of [[neocolonialism]] and the infusion of nationalist movements throughout Latin America, increasing the success of [[import substitution industrialization]] or ISI.&lt;ref name = "Chasteen226"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chasteen|2006|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive side-effect of the collapse of international trade meant local Latin American manufacturers could fill the market niches left vacant by vanishing exports.&lt;ref name = Chasteen226/&gt;

In the twentieth century, prominent Latin American dictators have included the [[Somoza]] dynasty in Nicaragua, [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in Paraguay, and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile, among others. As an outside influence, United States interference in Latin American politics is controversial and has often been severely criticized. As García Calderon noted as far back as 1925: "Does it want peace or is it controlled by certain interests?"&lt;ref name="Calderon469"&gt;{{Harvnb|Calderon|1925|p=469}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a theme in the dictator novel, the link between U.S. imperialism and the power of the tyrant is very important. Dictators in Latin America have accepted military and financial support from the United States when it suited them, but have also turned against the United States, using anti-American campaigning to gain favour with the people. In the case of Trujillo, "Nothing promises to reinvigorate his flagging popularity more than to face up to the Yankee aggressor in the name of la patria."&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt;

In the first decade of the 21st century, the pendulum swung in the other direction, introducing a series of 'left wing' governments to the region that curtailed civil liberties and set up their own messy version of popular dictatorships through a process that has been called "competitive authoritarianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Elections Without Democracy: The Rise of Competitive Authoritarianism|journal=Harvard University Journal of Democracy|volume= 13| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known of these was President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, and came to include other countries in his Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras - and in some ways Argentina, though it was not an official member) in what was called the [[Pink tide|Pink Tide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ALBA: Inside Venezuela's Bolivarian Alliance|last=Hirst|first=Joel|publisher=Inter-American Institute for Democracy|year=2012|isbn=1477497625|location=Miami, USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Los Padres de la Patria ===
In 1967 during a meeting with [[Alejo Carpentier]], [[Julio Cortázar]], and [[Miguel Otero Silva]], the Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] launched a project consisting of a series of [[biography|biographies]] depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called ''Los Padres de la Patria'' (The Fathers of the Fatherland).&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in ''Patriotic Gore'', Fuentes recounts, "Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, we thought it would be a good idea to have a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fuentes|1986|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas Llosa was to write about [[Manuel A. Odría]], [[Jorge Edwards]] about [[José Manuel Balmaceda]], [[José Donoso]] about [[Mariano Melgarejo]], and Julio Cortázar about [[Eva Perón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Donoso|1972|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the [[Latin American Boom|Latin American literary boom]], such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Langa Pizarro|2001|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the genre==

=== Forerunners ===
[[File:Juan Manuel de Rosas.jpg|alt=Painting of the head and shoulders of a man in 19th century military garb with ornate epaulettes and sash. He is looking at the viewer.|thumb|right|[[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], Argentine caudillo, by [[Cayetano Descalzi]] (1809-1886)]]
Both [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' and [[José Marmol]]'s ''[[Amalia (novel)|Amalia]]'', published in the nineteenth century, were precursors to the twentieth century dictator novel; however, "all fictional depictions of the Latin American 'strong-man', have an important antecedent in Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's ''Facundo'', a work written as a sociolodical treatise".&lt;ref name = "Kristal10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kristal|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Facundo'' is an indirect critique of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]'s dictatorship, directed against the actual historical figure, [[Juan Facundo Quiroga]], but is also a broader investigation into Argentine history and culture. Sarmiento's ''Facundo'' has remained a fundamental fixture because of the breadth of its literary exploration of the Latin American environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brotherston|1977|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Facundo'', Sarmiento criticizes the historical figure Facundo Quiroga, a provincial caudillo, who like Rosas (dictator of Argentina from 1829 to 1853) was opposed to the enlightened ideas of progress. After returning from exile, Sarmiento worked to reinvent Argentina, eventually becoming president himself from 1868 to 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brotherston|1977|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarmiento's analysis of Facundo Quiroga was the first time that an author questioned how figures like Facundo and Rosas could have maintained such absolute power,&lt;ref name = Kristal10/&gt; and in answering this question, ''Facundo'' established its place as an inspirational text to later authors. Sarmiento perceived his own power in writing ''Facundo'' as "within the text of the novel, it is the novelist, through the voice of omniscience, who has replaced God",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|González Echevarría|1985|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby creating the bridge between writing and power that is characteristic of the dictator novel.

Set in post-colonial Buenos Aires, ''Amalia'' was written in two parts and is a semi-autobiographical account of José Mármol that deals with living in Rosas's police state. Mármol's novel was important as it showed how the human consciousness, much like a city or even a country, could become a terrifying prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=109,151}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amalia'' also attempted to examine the problem of dictatorships as being one of structure, and therefore the problem of the state "manifested through the will of some monstrous personage violating the ordinary individual's privacy, both of home and of consciousness."&lt;ref name = 1Martin266/&gt; In the early twentieth century, the Spaniard [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán]]'s ''[[Tirano Banderas]]'' (1926) acted as a key influence on those authors whose goal was to critique power structures and the status quo.

===Classic dictator novels===
*''[[Tirano Banderas]]'' is a 1926 novel by Spanish writer Ramon Maria del Valle-Inclan (aka [[Valle-Inclan]] or Valle). Although was published in Madrid (Spain), this novel is influenced by [[Facundo]] by Ramon Sarmiento and it is the first of dictator novels. It recounts the fall of the South American dictator Santos Banderas, which directs the fictitious region of Santa Fe de Tierra Firme of despotic mode and cruel to staying in power through terror and oppression. The work describes the behavior of the tyrant and the beginning of a revolutionary movement that will eventually overthrow him before his clumsiness.
*''[[El Señor Presidente]]'' is a 1946 novel by Guatemalan Nobel Prize-winning writer and diplomat [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]]. Although the novel does not explicitly identify its setting as early twentieth-century Guatemala, Asturias was inspired by the 1898–1920 presidency of [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] for his title character.&lt;ref name = "2Williams11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel explores the nature of political dictatorship and its effects on society, and is an overtly political novel in which Asturias denounces Latin American dictators.&lt;ref name = 2Williams11/&gt; By keeping time and place ambiguous, Asturias's novel represents a break from former narratives, which until this point had been judged on how adequately they reflected reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asturias's distinctive use of dream imagery, onomatopoeia, simile, and repetition, combined with a discontinuous structure consisting of abrupt changes of style and viewpoint, sprang from [[surrealist]] and [[Ultraist movement|ultraist]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it made early use of a literary technique that would come to be known as magic realism.&lt;ref name = "2Swanson8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The President'' went on to influence a generation of Latin American authors, becoming an early example of the "new novel" and a precursor to the Latin American literary boom.&lt;ref name = 2Swanson8/&gt;
*[[Jorge Zalamea]], ''[[El gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto]]'' ("The Great Burundún Burundá is Dead", 1951). For Keefe Ugalde, "''El gran Burundún Burundá''&amp;nbsp;... occupies an important midway point in the evolution of the dictator novel"&lt;ref name = Keefe369/&gt; and Peter Neissa emphasizes "its cultural and political importance and subsequent influence on dictator narratives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Neissa|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, Martin describes this "remarkable Colombian novelette" as seeming to contain "the seeds of García Márquez's mature style."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book describes the (fictional) dictator "Burundún's rise to power, selected events during his regime, and a description of his funeral."&lt;ref name = Keefe369/&gt;  It is at this funeral that it is revealed that the body of the dictator is absent, and has somehow been replaced by or transformed into "a great big parrot, a voluminous parrot, an enormous parrot, all swollen, inflated and wrapped in documents, gazettes, mail from abroad, newspapers, reports, annals, broadsheets, almanacs, official bulletins."&lt;ref name = 1Martin269/&gt;
*[[Enrique Lafourcade]]'s ''[[King Ahab's Feast]]'' (''La Fiesta del rey Acab'', 1959) portrays the fictional dictator César Alejandro Carrillo Acab, and opens with what Claude Hulet describes as an "amusingly ironic, tongue-in-cheek note in preface" which declares that "This is a mere work of fiction.&amp;nbsp;... Indeed, no one is unaware that neither the United Nations, nor the Organization of American States, permits the continued existence of regimes like the one that serves as pretext to this novel."  As Hulet observes, Lafourcade's "powerful and razor sharp satire" is directed "presumably against the Trujillo regime and others like it."&lt;ref&gt;Hulet, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alejo Carpentier]]'s, ''[[Reasons of State (novel)|Reasons of State]]'' (''El recurso del método'', 1974), is a synthesis of several historical figures from Latin American, most prominently [[Gerardo Machado]], dictator of Cuba.&lt;ref name="2Williams3435"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1998|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half of his life in Europe,&lt;ref name = 2Williams3435/&gt; perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.&lt;ref name = 2Williams3435/&gt;
*[[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s ''[[I, the Supreme]]'' (''Yo, el Supremo'', 1974) is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]]. However, it is also a historical account, making use of real documents and accounts of people who knew Francia.&lt;ref name = "Boyers34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyers|1987|pp=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roa's portrayal of a despot in Latin American fiction is distinguished "not only by the quantity of detail lavished on him, but by his remarkable capacity to seem at one moment a person, at another an embodiment of contradictory elements not usually associated with a single person, let alone a powerful tyrant".&lt;ref name = Boyers34/&gt; Its title was derived from the fact that Francia referred to himself as "El Supremo" or "the Supreme". Making use of non-traditional writing techniques, the novel is composed of separate discourses with their own distinctive styles, and the demarcation between them is often blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyers|1987|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Martin claims that Roa Bastos's novel "was more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', and critics seemed to suspect that its strictly historical importance might be even greater than that of García Márquez's fabulously successful creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Patriarch]]'' (''El otoño del patriarca'', 1975) details the life of an eternal dictator, "el macho", a fictional character who lives to be over 200 years old.&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; The book is divided into six sections, each retelling the same story of the infinite power held by the archetypal [[Caribbean]] tyrant. Márquez based his fictional dictator on a variety of real-life autocrats, including [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]] of his [[Colombia]]n homeland, [[Generalissimo]] [[Francisco Franco]] of [[Spain]] (the novel was written in [[Barcelona]]), and [[Venezuela]]'s [[Juan Vicente Gómez]]. One of the key characters of the novel is the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] General [[Saturno Santos]], who devotes himself to "inscrutable service to the patriarch."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Brotherston|1980|p= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this novel, García Márquez proposes an interesting contradiction: "that Latin America's patriarchs owe their most intimate support to their victims of longest standing; and that America's revolution is inconceivable without the Indian".&lt;ref name="Brotherstonchap53"&gt;{{Harvnb |Brotherston|1980|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrating the importance of the Indian in Latin America is all the more prudent given that García Márquez's home country, Colombia, is distinguished as literarily &lt;!-- or literally?? --&gt; not recognizing the Indian populations which are very much alive today.&lt;ref name = Brotherstonchap53/&gt;
*[[Luisa Valenzuela]]'s ''[[The Lizard's Tail]]'' (''Cola de lagartija'', 1983) is set in the period after Juan Perón's return to Argentina in 1973, when the Argentine president was heavily influenced by the sinister ''[[éminence grise]]'' [[José López Rega]]. The novel deals specifically with themes surrounding the nature of male-female relationships during this regime of military oppression. The novel's title is a reference to an instrument of torture that was invented in the [[Southern Cone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tomás Eloy Martínez]]'s ''The Perón Novel'' (''La novela de Perón'', 1985) uses a mixture of historical facts, fiction, and documents to retell the life story of [[Juan Domingo Perón]], "dramatizing the rivalries within the ranks of Peronism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2003|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the author to construct an intimate portrait of Perón rather than an historically accurate one. This method of analyzing Perón, that delves into his early history and family upbringing to theorize the motivation for his actions later in life, can be linked to Sarmiento's similar analyses of Facundo, and through him, Rosas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|pp=340–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'' (''El general en su laberinto'', 1989) is a fictionalized account of the last days in the life of [[Simón Bolívar]]. Bolívar, also known as the Great Liberator, freed from [[Spain|Spanish]] rule the territory that would subsequently become [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], and [[Ecuador]]. However the character of the General is not portrayed as the glorious hero that traditional history has presented; instead García Márquez develops a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gertel| 1992| p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mario Vargas Llosa]]'s ''[[The Feast of the Goat]]'' (''La fiesta del chivo'', 2000) recounts with "gruesome detail and dramatic intensity" the last days of the tyrant and dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], as he becomes infuriated that, despite being a long-standing ally of the United States because of his anti-communist stance, he is no longer in favour with the U.S. administration who have withdrawn their backing on discovering his extensive [[human rights]] violations.&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; Following several interwoven storylines&amp;mdash;those of Trujillo, his assassins, and the daughter of a man who once served in Trujillo's inner circle of advisers, Urania Cabral&amp;mdash;this novel reveals both the political and social environment in the Dominican Republic, past and present.&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt; The story opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative in terms of remembering and understanding the past and its legacy for the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Neissa| 2004|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Burning'' picks up the story after 30 years of revolution, when the country is left as a wasteland and El Comandante - the central figure - has died; and how the student leader who has been a political prisoner and the soldier who became a general and dictator in his own right attempt to find meaning in the aftermath of a revolution that has collapsed.

=== 'Not quite' dictator novels ===

Latin American novels that explore political themes, but that do not centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”.&lt;ref name = "2Williams167"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2003|p= 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Libro de Manuel]]'' (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by [[Julio Cortázar]], is a [[postmodernism|postmodern]] novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of [[Aesthetic interpretation|interpretation]].&lt;ref name = 2Williams167/&gt; ''[[In the Time of the Butterflies]]'' (1994), by [[Julia Alvarez|Julia Álvarez]], tells the story of the [[Mirabal sisters]], whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the [[Rafael Trujillo|Trujillo régime]] in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hickman|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine ''how'' the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hickman|2006|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of ''El imperio de los sueños'' 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by [[Giannina Braschi]], the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the [[Latin American Boom]] in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “[[United States of Banana]]” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner [[Segismundo]] overthrows his father, the King of the [[United States of Banana]], who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the [[Statue of Liberty]], for the crime of having been born. The story of ''[[Distant Star]]'' (1996), by [[Roberto Bolaño]], begins on 11 September 1973, with the ''[[1973 Chilean coup|coup d’état]]'' by General [[Augusto Pinochet]] against [[Salvador Allende]], the President of Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power”.&lt;ref name = 2Williams167/&gt;

==Legacy==

Although it is difficult to establish the exact origin of the dictator novel in the nineteenth century, its [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] influence spans [[Latin American Literature]]. Most of the novels were written in the middle  years of the twentieth century, and each has a unique [[Literary language|literary style]] that employed techniques of the “new novel”, by which the writer rejected the formal structure of conventional [[literary realism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that “its simplistic assumption that reality is easily observable” is a narrative flaw.&lt;ref name="Swanson3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a genre, the dictator novel redefined the literary concept of “[[Novel|the novel]]” in order to compel the readers to examine the ways in which political and social mores affect their daily lives. Therefore, the regional politics and the social issues of the stories yielded to universal human concerns, thus the traditional novel’s “ordered world view gives way to a fragmented, distorted or fantastic narrative” in which the reader has an intellectually active role in grasping the ''thematic'' gist of the story.&lt;ref name="Swanson3" /&gt; Additional to the narrative substance, the novelists redefined the formal literary categories of ''author'', ''narrator'', ''character'', ''plot'', ''story'', and ''reader'', in order to examine the [[Etymology|etymological]] link between “author” and “authority”, wherein the figure of the novelist (the author) became very important to the telling of the tale. In the dictator novels, the writers questioned the traditional story-teller role of the novelist as the “privileged, paternal figure, as the authoritative ‘father’, or divine creator, in whom meaning would be seen to originate”, and so, the novelists fulfilled the role of the dictator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Kerr|1992 |pp=viii-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7639">'''Disability in children's literature''' is a subject that has been the focus of changing attitudes in broader society since the 1970s. The movement to include children and youth with disabilities into mainstream [[society]] has led to new approaches on the part of authors, as well as educators.

In the [[United States]], 10% of the population has a physical, cognitive, mental or health disability, a rate that is consistent worldwide. Disabilities may also include sensory or [[learning disability|learning difficulties]], and may range from severe to mild. The approach of children and youth literature (collectively called "juvenile literature") can have a significant impact on the children reading it, whether they personally have experienced disability or not; literature "has proven to be an agent capable of influencing attitudes and acceptance of impairments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denman-West|first=Margaret W.|title=Children's Literature: A Guide to Information Sources|year=1998|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781563084485|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{blockquote|Perhaps no group has been as overlooked and inaccurately represented in children's books as individuals with disabilities. Most often they were not included in stories and when they were, many negative [[stereotypes]] prevailed, such as characters who were pitiful or pathetic, evil or superheroes, or a burden and incapable of fully participating in the events of everyday life. Often the difference or disability was the main personality trait emphasized to the reader, not a balance of strengths and weaknesses. Blaska, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1940 to 1970, around 311 books for children were published in the United States that included characters with disabilities. Some of these books romanticized the disability, some were infantilized, while others portrayed the disabled characters as avoiding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the classic children's book ''[[Heidi]]''. It portrays the character Clara as a spoiled and insulated child, who regains the ability to walk after befriending Heidi and overcoming a vague and unexplained [[psychological]] problem, the apparent cause of her physical [[paralysis]], which in reality would be medically unlikely. Another oddity is that the portrayal of [[Blindness|blind]] individuals was in excess of their actual numbers in the real population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blindness was noted as being the most common disability among African-American characters in children's fiction, used as a plot device to represent the ability to see beyond racial prejudices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keith|first=Lois|title=Take up thy bed and walk: death, disability and cure in classic fiction for girls|year=2001|publisher=Women's Press|isbn=9780704346512|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the disability secondary to its significance as a plot device.

Beginning in the 1970s, the [[United States Congress]] passed several Acts to legally protect the right of children and adults with disabilities to be included in schools and the workforce, first with the [[Rehabilitation Act]] of 1973 and then the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975. In 1986, the [[Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act]] (IDEA) was put into force in the United States, which ended the exclusion of children with disabilities from publicly funded school systems. With the integration of children with disabilities into public schools, educators, librarians and publishers took a new interest in children's literature that dealt with disability in a balanced, accurate, and constructive way. An overall growth in public awareness of disability and its portrayal in media has supported a trend towards more detailed medical descriptions of conditions in juvenile literature. [[Barbara Holland Baskin]] and [[Karen H. Harris]] conducted influential research into the portrayal of disability in children and youth literature in the late 1970s. They published the seminal study ''Notes from a Different Drummer'' (1977), followed by ''More Notes from a Different Drummer'' (1984). Today, disability in juvenile literature is a standard topic included in bibliographies, research, criticism, and review sources. Several bibliographies and studies reviewing fiction and non-fiction have been produced in the years since.

The evolution of the portrayal of disability can be seen in the books written since the 1970s. [[Judy Blume]] shows the experience of a teenage girl diagnosed with [[idiopathic scoliosis]] in ''[[Deenie]]'' (1973). The protagonist, Deenie, faces the challenges brought by having to wear a body brace during her treatment, which impacts her perceptions of herself and those of her family and fellow students. Deenie does not overcome the disability by the end of the story, nor is she defeated by it; the conclusion more realistically shows her continuing to face challenges and learning to adjust to them. 

A trend in current juvenile fiction is the portrayal of characters with "hidden disabilities" that have become more common diagnoses in recent decades. Examples include [[Petra Mathers]]' ''Sophie and Lou'', about extreme shyness that is an emotional and [[social disability]], and [[Caroline Janover]]'s ''The Worst Speller in Jr. High'' (1995) about a boy with [[dyslexia]]. In fiction for older youth, disability has recently been dealt with in complex situations with nuanced techniques such as multiple-perspective narrative; an example is [[Erika Tamar]]'s ''Fair Game'' (1993), about a group of male students who repeatedly sexually assault an intellectually disabled girl at their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernice E. Cullinan, Diane Goetz Person|title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9780826417787|pages=238–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bibliographer Debra Robertson, who wrote ''Portraying Persons with Disabilities: An Annotated Bibliography of Fiction for Children and Teenagers'' (1992), pointed out in the early 1990s that not every disability has to be a "metaphor for a protagonist's development", and the tendency of writers to romanticize or stigmatize medical conditions in this way is a persistent problem in juvenile literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recent studies have indicated that educators may improve student understanding of disability with "follow-up discussion or activities and stories that portray characters with disabilities accurately, realistically, and positively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salem|first=Linda C.|title=Children's Literature Studies: Cases And Discussions|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591580898|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Sheriff Curtis''' (February 16, 1868 – October 19, 1952) was an American [[photographer]] and [[ethnology|ethnologist]] whose work focused on the [[Western United States|American West]] and on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="makepeace" /&gt;

==Early life==
Curtis was born on February 16, 1868, on a farm near [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="lawlor"&gt;Laurie Lawlor (1994). ''Shadow Catcher: The Life and Work of Edward S. Curtis''. New York: Walker.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; His father, the [[Reverend]] Asahel "Johnson" Curtis (1840–1887), was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], farmer, and [[American Civil War]] [[veteran]]&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; born in [[Ohio]]. His mother, Ellen Sheriff (1844–1912), was born in [[Pennsylvania]]. Curtis's siblings were Raphael (1862–c.1885), also called Ray; Edward, called Eddy; Eva (1870–?); and [[Asahel Curtis]] (1874–1941).&lt;ref name="lawlor"/&gt; Weakened by his experiences in the Civil War, Johnson Curtis had difficulty in managing his farm, resulting in hardship and poverty for his family.&lt;ref name="lawlor"/&gt;

Around 1874, the family moved from [[Wisconsin]] to [[Minnesota]] to join Johnson Curtis's father, Asahel Curtis, who ran a grocery store and was a postmaster in [[Le Sueur County, Minnesota|Le Sueur County]].&lt;ref name="lawlor"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/curtis_e.html |title=Shadow Catcher |accessdate=August 26, 2007 |publisher=[[American Masters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis left school in the [[sixth grade]] and soon built his own camera.

==Career==

===Early career===

In 1885, at the age of 17, Curtis became an [[apprentice]] photographer in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. In 1887 the family moved to [[Seattle, Washington]], where he purchased a new camera and became a partner with Rasmus Rothi in an existing photographic studio. Curtis paid $150 for his 50% share in the studio. After about six months, he left Rothi and formed a new partnership with Thomas Guptill. They established a new studio, Curtis and Guptill, Photographers and Photoengravers.&lt;ref name=makepeace &gt;{{cite book |last=Makepeace |first=Anne|title=Edward S. Curtis: Coming to Light |year=2001 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |location= | pages= |isbn=0-7922-6404-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

In 1895, Curtis met and photographed [[Princess Angeline]] (c. 1820–1896), also known as Kickisomlo, the daughter of [[Chief Sealth]] of [[Seattle]]. This was his first portrait of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]. In 1898, three of Curtis's images were chosen for an exhibition sponsored by the [[National Photographic Society]]. Two were images of Princess Angeline, "The Mussel Gatherer" and "The Clam Digger". The other was of Puget Sound, entitled "Homeward", which was awarded the exhibition's grand prize and a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward S.

Rainier]], Curtis came upon a small group of scientists who were lost and in need of direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egan|first1=Timothy|title=Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher|asin=B006R8PH4I|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of them was [[George Bird Grinnell]], considered an "expert" on Native Americans by his peers. Curtis was appointed the official photographer of the [[Harriman Alaska Expedition]] of 1899, probably as a result of his friendship with Grinnell. Having very little formal education Curtis learned much during the lectures that were given aboard the ship each evening of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gidley|first=Mick|title=Edward S.

===''The North American Indian''===
[[File:The North American Indian.jpg|upright|thumb|right|alt=cover page of ''The North American Indian'', published in 1907|''The North American Indian'', volume 1, 1907]]
In 1906, [[J. P. Morgan]] provided Curtis with $75,000 to produce a series on Native Americans.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news |title=American Indian in 'Photo History{{'-}} |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/06/06/104729426.pdf|newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 6, 1908 |accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was to be in 20 volumes with 1,500 photographs. Morgan's funds were to be disbursed over five years and were earmarked to support only fieldwork for the books, not for writing, editing, or production of the volumes. Curtis received no salary for the project,&lt;ref name="egan2012" /&gt; which was to last more than 20 years. Under the terms of the arrangement, Morgan was to receive 25 sets and 500 original prints as repayment.

Once Curtis had secured funding for the project, he was able to hire several employees to help him. For writing and for recording Native American languages, he hired a former journalist, William E. Myers.&lt;ref name="egan2012" /&gt; For general assistance with logistics and fieldwork, he hired Bill Phillips, a graduate of the [[University of Washington]]. Perhaps the most important hire for the success of the project was [[Frederick Webb Hodge]], an anthropologist employed by the [[Smithsonian Institution]], who had researched Native American peoples of the southwestern United States.&lt;ref name="egan2012" /&gt; Hodge was hired to edit the entire series.

Eventually 222 complete sets were published. Curtis's goal was not just to photograph but also to document as much of Native American traditional life as possible before that way of life disappeared. He wrote in the introduction to his first volume in 1907, "The information that is to be gathered ... respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost." Curtis made over 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of Native American language and music. He took over 40,000 photographic images of members of over 80 tribes. He recorded tribal lore and history, and he described traditional foods, housing, garments, recreation, ceremonies, and funeral customs. He wrote biographical sketches of tribal leaders. His material, in most cases, is the only written recorded history, although there is still a rich oral tradition that preserves history.&lt;ref name=makepeace/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Vaughn|title=Fort Worth's Amon Carter Museum Acquires a Long-Sought Masterpiece of American Indian Photography|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/804/story/1499188.html|date=September 21, 2009|accessdate=September 22, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958– ) says: The Morgan Library says it still has a box of correspondence between the Morgans and Curtis and between Morgan and Charles Lauriat --&gt;
His work was exhibited at the [[Rencontres d'Arles]] festival in France in 1973.

===''In the Land of the Head Hunters''===
{{main|In the Land of the Head Hunters}}
Curtis had been using motion picture cameras in fieldwork for ''The North American Indian'' since 1906.&lt;ref name="egan2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Egan | first = Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Egan | title = Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher: The Epic Life and Immortal Photographs of Edward Curtis | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year = 2012 | location = Boston | page = 370 | isbn = 0618969020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked extensively with the ethnographer and British Columbia native [[George Hunt (ethnologist)|George Hunt]] in 1910, which inspired his work with the [[Kwakiutl]], but much of their collaboration remains unpublished.&lt;ref name=Glass&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=Aaron|title=A Cannibal in the Archive: Performance, Materiality, and (In)Visibility in Unpublished Edward Curtis Photographs of the Kwakwaka’wakw Hamats|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|year=2009|volume=25|pages=128–149|doi=10.1111/j.1548-7458.2009.01038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1912, Curtis decided to create a feature film depicting Native American life, partly as a way of improving his financial situation and partly because film technology had improved to the point where it was conceivable to create and screen films more than a few minutes long. Curtis chose the Kwakiutl tribe, of the [[Queen Charlotte Strait]] region of the [[British Columbia Coast|Central Coast of British Columbia]], Canada, for his subject. His film, ''[[In the Land of the Head Hunters]]'', was the first feature-length film whose cast was composed entirely of Native North Americans.&lt;ref name="film-site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curtisfilm.rutgers.edu/|title=Web site for ''In the Land of the Head Hunters'' re-release, a joint project of U'mista and Rutgers University |accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Indian Days of the Long Ago.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=cover page of ''Indian Days of the Long Ago'' published in 1915|''Indian Days of the Long Ago'', 1915]]
The photographer [[Ella E. McBride]] assisted Curtis in his studio beginning in 1907 and became a friend of the family. She made an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the studio with Curtis's daughter Beth in 1916, the year of Curtis's divorce, and left to open her own studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= McBride, Ella E. (1862–1965) |last= Martin |first= David M. |work= HistoryLink.org – The Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History |date= March 3, 2008 |accessdate = March 26, 2014 |url= http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=8513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1922, Curtis moved to [[Los Angeles]] with Beth and opened a new photo studio. To earn money he worked as an assistant [[camera operator|cameraman]] for [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and was an uncredited assistant cameraman in the 1923 filming of ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''. On October 16, 1924, Curtis sold the rights to his [[Ethnographic film|ethnographic motion picture]] ''In the Land of the Head-Hunters'' to the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He was paid $1,500 for the master print and the original camera negative. It had cost him over $20,000 to create the film.&lt;ref name=makepeace/&gt;

In 1927, after returning from [[Alaska]] to Seattle with Beth, Curtis was arrested for failure to pay [[alimony]] over the preceding seven years. The total owed was $4,500, but the charges were dropped. For Christmas of 1927, the family was reunited at the home of his daughter Florence in [[Medford, Oregon]]. This was the first time since the divorce that Curtis was with all of his children at the same time, and it had been 13 years since he had seen Katherine.

In 1928, desperate for cash, Curtis sold the rights to his project to [[J. P. Morgan Jr]]. The concluding volume of ''The North American Indian'' was published in 1930. In total, about 280 sets were sold of his now completed ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.

In 1930, his ex-wife, Clara, was still living in Seattle operating the photo studio with their daughter Katherine. His other daughter, Florence Curtis, was still living in Medford, Oregon, with her husband, Henry Graybill. After Clara died of heart failure in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;Certificate of death for Clara J. Curtis, Center for Health Statistics, Department of Health, State of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; his daughter Katherine moved to [[California]] to be closer to her father and Beth.&lt;ref name=makepeace/&gt;

===Loss of rights to ''The North American Indian''===
In 1935, the Morgan estate sold the rights to ''The North American Indian'' and remaining unpublished material to the Charles E. Lauriat Company in [[Boston]] for $1,000 plus a percentage of any future royalties. This included 19 complete bound sets of ''The North American Indian'', thousands of individual paper prints, the copper printing plates, the unbound printed pages, and the original glass-plate negatives. Lauriat bound the remaining loose printed pages and sold them with the completed sets. The remaining material remained untouched in the Lauriat basement in Boston until they were rediscovered in 1972.&lt;ref name=makepeace/&gt;

==Personal life==

===Marriage and divorce===
In 1892, Curtis married Clara J. Phillips (1874–1932), who was born in [[Pennsylvania]]. Her parents were from [[Canada]]. Together they had four children: Harold (1893–1988); Elizabeth M. (Beth) (1896–1973), who married Manford E. Magnuson (1895–1993); Florence (1899–1987), who married Henry Graybill (1893–?); and Katherine (Billy) (1909–?).

In 1896, the entire family moved to a new house in [[Seattle]]. The household then included Curtis's mother, Ellen Sheriff; his sister, Eva Curtis; his brother, [[Asahel Curtis]]; Clara's sisters, Susie and Nellie Phillips; and their cousin, William.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During the years of work on ''The North American Indian'', Curtis was often absent from home for most of the year, leaving Clara to manage the children and the studio by herself. After several years of estrangement, Clara filed for divorce on October 16, 1916. In 1919 she was granted the divorce and received Curtis's photographic studio and all of his original [[Negative (photography)|camera negatives]] as her part of the settlement. Curtis and his daughter Beth went to the studio and destroyed all of his original [[glass negative]]s, rather than have them become the property of his ex-wife. Clara went on to manage the Curtis studio with her sister Nellie (1880–?), who was married to Martin Lucus (1880–?). Following the divorce, the two oldest daughters, Beth and Florence, remained in Seattle, living in a [[boarding house]] separate from their mother. The youngest daughter, Katherine, lived with Clara in Charleston, [[Kitsap County, Washington]].&lt;ref name=makepeace/&gt;&lt;!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958– ) says: Nellie and Martin's descendants have been contacted in the hope they can provide more information on the siblings of Edward --&gt;

===Death===
On October 19, 1952, at the age of 84, Curtis died of a [[heart attack]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], in the home of his daughter Beth. He was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]]. A brief obituary appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on October 20, 1952:

{{quote|Edward S. Curtis, internationally known authority on the history of the North American Indian, died today at the home of a daughter, Mrs. Beth Magnuson. His age was 84. Mr. Curtis devoted his life to compiling Indian history. His research was done under the patronage of the late financier, [[J. Pierpont Morgan]]. The foreward [sic] for the monumental set of Curtis books was written by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Mr. Curtis was also widely known as a photographer.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Edward S.

==Collections of Curtis materials==

===Northwestern University===
The entire 20 volumes of narrative text and photogravure images for each volume are online.&lt;ref&gt;http://curtis.library.northwestern.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Each volume is accompanied by a portfolio of large photogravure plates. The online publishing was supported largely by funds from the [[Institute for Museum and Library Services]].

===Library of Congress===
The Prints and Photographs Division Curtis collection consists of more than 2,400 [[Gelatin silver process|silver-gelatin]], first-generation photographic prints – some of which are [[Sepia tone|sepia-toned]] – made from Curtis's original [[glass negative]]s. Most are {{convert|5|x|7|in|cm}} although nearly 100 are {{convert|11|x|14|in|cm}} and larger; many include the Curtis file or negative number in the lower left-hand corner of the image.

The [[Library of Congress]] acquired these images as [[Copyright registration|copyright deposits]] from about 1900 through 1930. The dates on them are dates of registration, not the dates when the photographs were taken. About two-thirds (1,608) of these images were not published in ''The North American Indian'' and therefore offer a different glimpse into Curtis's work with indigenous cultures. The original glass plate negatives, which had been stored and nearly forgotten in the basement of the [[Morgan Library]], in New York, were dispersed during [[World War II]]. Many others were destroyed and some were sold as junk.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/coll/067_curt.html |title=Edward S. Curtis Collection |accessdate=August 26, 2007 |quote=Although unknown for many years, Edward S. Curtis is today one of the most well-recognized and celebrated photographers of Native people. Born near White Water,(sic) Wisconsin, on February 16, 1868, he became interested in the emerging art of photography when he was quite young, building his first camera when he was still an adolescent. In Seattle, where his family moved in 1887, he acquired part interest in a portrait photography studio and soon became sole owner of the successful business, renaming it Edward S. Curtis Photographer and Photoengraver. |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958– ) says: the LOC has an extensive collection of Curtis images, but almost none of him available online. They have been contacted and are looking into providing a scan of some of his self portraits for this article --&gt;

===Charles Lauriat archive===
Around 1970, Karl Kernberger, of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], went to Boston to search for Curtis's original [[Copper-plate engraving|copper plates]] and [[photogravure]]s at the Charles E. Lauriat rare bookstore. He discovered almost 285,000 original photogravures as well as all the copper plates. With Jack Loeffler and David Padwa, they jointly purchased all of the surviving Curtis material that was owned by Charles Emelius Lauriat (1874–1937). The collection was later purchased by another group of investors led by Mark Zaplin, of Santa Fe. The Zaplin Group owned the plates until 1982, when they sold them to a California group led by Kenneth Zerbe, the owner of the plates as of 2005.&lt;!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958– ) says: Zerbe has been contacted to see if they will provide a higher reolution image of Curtis --&gt; 1985 Kern donated a portion of the collection to the Museum of the American Indian (National Museum of the American Indian New York). Other glass and nitrate negatives from this set are at the Palace of the Governors Photo Archives (Santa Fe, New Mexico).

===Peabody Essex Museum===
[[Charles Goddard Weld]] purchased 110 prints that Curtis had made for his 1905–06 exhibit and donated them to the [[Peabody Essex Museum]], where they remain. The 14" by 17" prints are each unique and remain in pristine condition. Clark Worswick, curator of photography for the museum, describes them as:
{{quote|... Curtis' most carefully selected prints of what was then his life's work ... certainly these are some of the most glorious prints ever made in the history of the photographic medium. The fact that we have this man's entire show of 1906 is one of the minor miracles of photography and museology.&lt;ref name=pem&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pem.org/exhibitions/exhibition.php?id=9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128195328/http://www.pem.org/exhibitions/exhibition.php?id=9 |archive-date=January 28, 2008 |title=The Master Prints of Edwards S.

Morgan, among others. |publisher=[[Peabody Essex Museum]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Indiana University===
Two hundred seventy-six of the wax cylinders made by Curtis between 1907 and 1913 are held by the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~libarchm/ Archives of Traditional Music]&lt;/ref&gt; These include recordings of music of the following Native American groups: Clayoquot, Cowichan, Haida, Hesquiat, and Kwakiutl, in British Columbia; and Arapaho, Cheyenne, Cochiti, Crow, Klikitat, Kutenai, Nez Percé, Salish, Shoshoni, Snohomish, Wishram, Yakima, Acoma, Arikara, Hidatsa, Makah, Mandan, Paloos, Piegan, Tewa (San Ildefonso, San Juan, Tesuque, Nambé), and possibly Dakota, Clallam, Twana, Colville and Nespelim in the western United States.

Toppan Rare Books Library at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming, holds the entire 20 volumes of narrative text and photogravure images. Each volume is accompanied by a portfolio of large photogravure plates.

==Legacy==

===Revival of interest===
Though Curtis was largely forgotten at the time of his death, interest in his work revived and continues to this day. Casting him as a precursor in [[visual anthropology]], [[Harald E.L. Prins]] reviewed his oeuvre in the journal [[American Anthropologist]] and noted: "Appealing to his society's infatuation with romantic primitivism, Curtis portrayed American Indians to conform to the cultural archetype of the 'vanishing Indian.' Elaborated since the 1820s, this ideological construct effectively captured the ambivalent racism of Anglo-American society, which repressed Native spirituality and traditional customs while creating cultural space for the invented Indian of romantic imagination. [Since the 1960s,] Curtis's sepia-toned photographs (in which material evidence of Western civilization has often been erased) had special appeal for this 'Red Power' movement and even helped inspire it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Prins | first = Harald E.L.| title = American Anthropologist Vol.102 (4):891-95 | year = 2000 | url = http://www.makepeaceproductions.com/reviews/Coming-to-Light/harald-prins.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative evaluation of ''The North American Indian'' is that of Mick Gidley, [[Emeritus Professor]] of [[American Literature]], at [[Leeds University]], in [[England]], who has written a number of works related to the life of Curtis:
"''The North American Indian''—extensively produced and issued in a severely limited edition—could not prove popular. But in recent years anthropologists and others, even when they have censured what they have assumed were Curtis' methodological assumptions or quarrelled with the text's conclusions, have begun to appreciate the value of the project's achievement: exhibitions have been mounted, anthologies of pictures have been published, and ''The North American Indian'' has increasingly been cited in the researches of others ... ''The North American Indian'' is not monolithic or merely a monument. It is alive, it speaks, if with several voices, and among those perhaps mingled voices are those of otherwise silent or muted Indian individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gidley | first = Mick | title = Edward S. Curtis (1868–1952) and The North American Indian | year = 2001 | url = http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/ienhtml/essay1.html | accessdate = January 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the full Curtis opus [[N. Scott Momaday]] wrote, "Taken as a whole, the work of Edward S. Curtis is a singular achievement. Never before have we seen the Indians of North America so close to the origins of their humanity ... Curtis' photographs comprehend indispensable images of every human being at every time in every place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Momaday | first1 = N. Scott | first2 = Joseph D. | last2 = Horse Capture | first3 = Anne | last3 = Makepeace | title = Sacred Legacy: Edward S. Curtis and the North American Indian | location = Burlington | publisher = Verve | year= 2005 | isbn = 0976912716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Gulbrandsen, the author of ''Edward Sheriff Curtis: Visions of the First Americans'', put it this way in his introductory essay on Curtis's life: "The faces stare out at you, images seemingly from an ancient time and from a place far, far away ... Yet as you gaze at the faces the humanity becomes apparent, lives filled with dignity but also sadness and loss, representatives of a world that has all but disappeared from our planet."{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In ''Shadow Catcher: The Life and Work of Edward S. Curtis'', Laurie Lawlor revealed that "many Native Americans Curtis photographed called him Shadow Catcher. But the images he captured were far more powerful than mere shadows. The men, women, and children in ''The North American Indian'' seem as alive to us today as they did when Curtis took their pictures in the early part of the twentieth century. Curtis respected the Native Americans he encountered and was willing to learn about their culture, religion and way of life. In return the Native Americans respected and trusted him. When judged by the standards of his time, Curtis was far ahead of his contemporaries in sensitivity, tolerance, and openness to Native American cultures and ways of thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawlor|first=Laurie|title=Shadow Catcher: The Life and Work of Edward S. Curtis|year=2005|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803280467|page=6|edition=Reprint|author2=Curtis, Edward S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Theodore Roosevelt Orotone.JPG|right|thumb|upright|alt=portrait of Theodore Roosevelt from 1904, [[orotone]] process by [[Edward Sheriff Curtis]]|U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], 1904, [[orotone]] by Curtis]]

Theodore Roosevelt, a contemporary of Curtis's and one of his most fervent supporters, wrote the following comments in the foreword to Volume 1 of ''The North American Indian'':
{{quote|In Mr. Curtis we have both an artist and a trained observer, whose work has far more than mere accuracy, because it is truthful. ... because of his extraordinary success in making and using his opportunities, has been able to do what no other man ever has done; what, as far as we can see, no other man could do. Mr. Curtis in publishing this book is rendering a real and great service; a service not only to our own people, but to the world of scholarship everywhere.}}

Curtis has been praised as a gifted photographer but also criticized by some contemporary ethnologists for manipulating his images. Although the early twentieth century was a difficult time for most Native communities in America, not all natives were doomed to becoming a "vanishing race."&lt;ref name=vanish&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/ienhtml/essay2.html |title=The Myth of the Vanishing Race |accessdate=August 26, 2007 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when natives' rights were being denied and their treaties were unrecognized by the federal government, many natives were successfully adapting to Western society. By reinforcing the native identity as the [[noble savage]] and a tragic vanishing race, some believe Curtis deflected attention from the true plight of American natives. At the time when he was witnessing their squalid conditions on reservations first-hand, they were attempting to find their place in Western culture and adapt to their changing world.&lt;ref name=vanish/&gt;

Curtis did not remove parasols, suspenders, wagons that some have claimed because these can all be found in photographs published by him. In his photogravure ''In a Piegan Lodge'', published in ''The North American Indian'', Curtis retouched the image to remove a clock between the two men seated on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/ienhtml/essay3.html |title=Edward Curtis: Pictorialist and Ethnographic Adventurist |accessdate=August 26, 2007 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also is known to have paid natives to pose in staged scenes, dance and partake in simulated ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa047.shtml |title=The Shadow Catcher |accessdate=August 26, 2007|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Curtis's picture ''Oglala War-Party'', the image shows 10 [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]] men wearing feather headdresses, on horseback riding down hill. The photo caption reads, "a group of Sioux warriors as they appeared in the days of inter tribal warfare, carefully making their way down a hillside in the vicinity of the enemy's camp". In truth, headdresses would have been worn only for special occasions and, in some tribes, only by the chief of the tribe. The photograph was taken in 1907, when natives had been relegated to reservations and warring between tribes had ended. Curtis paid natives to pose as warriors at a time when they lived with little dignity and few rights and freedoms. It has been suggested that he altered and manipulated his pictures to create an ethnographic simulation of native tribes untouched by Western society.

'''Fair Isle''' (/fɛəraɪ̯l/) is a traditional [[knitting]] technique used to create patterns with multiple colours.  It is named after [[Fair Isle]], one of the [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]] islands. Fair Isle knitting gained a considerable popularity when the Prince of Wales (later [[Edward VIII]]) wore Fair Isle jumpers in public in 1921. Traditional Fair Isle patterns have a limited palette of five or so colours, use only two colours per row, are worked in the round, and limit the length of a run of any particular colour.&lt;ref name="McGregorTraditional"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGregor|first=Sheila|authorlink=Sheila McGregor |date=1981 |title=The Complete Book of Traditional Fair Isle Knitting |location=London |publisher=Batsford |isbn=978-0-7134-1432-5 |oclc=8064374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people use the term "Fair Isle" to refer to any colourwork knitting where stitches are knitted alternately in various colours, with the unused colours stranded across the back of the work. Others use the term "stranded colourwork" for the generic technique, and reserve the term "Fair Isle" for the characteristic patterns of the Shetland Islands.&lt;ref name="StarmoreFairIsle"&gt;{{cite book |last=Starmore|first=Alice|authorlink=Alice Starmore |date=1990 |title=The Fair Isle Knitting Handbook |location=London |publisher=Blandford |isbn=978-0-7137-2206-2 |oclc=60047818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other techniques for knitting in colour include [[Intarsia (knitting)|intarsia]], [[slip-stitch knitting|slip-stitch colour]] (also known as [[mosaic knitting]]).

== Technique ==
[[File:Prince of Wales, painting by Lander.jpg|thumb|[[Edward VIII|HRH Edward, Prince of Wales]] in a Fair Isle pullover]]
Basic two-colour Fair Isle requires no new techniques beyond the basic knit stitch: the purl stitch is not used if circular knitting needles or 3 double-pointed needles are used.  At each knit stitch, there are two available "active" colours of yarn; one is drawn through to make the knit stitch, and the other is simply held behind the piece, carried as a loose strand of yarn behind the just-made stitch. To avoid "loose" strands larger than 3-5 stitches, the yarn not in use can be "caught" by the yarn in use without this being seen on the front of the work - see below. Knitters who are comfortable with both [[English knitting|English style]] and [[Continental knitting|Continental style]] knitting can carry one colour with their right hand and one with their left, although it is also possible to simply use two different fingers for the two colours of yarn and knit both using the same style.&lt;ref name="McGregorTraditional"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest Fair Isle pattern uses circular or double pointed needles, cast on any number of stitches. Knitting then continues round and round, with the colours alternated every stitch. If the pattern is started with an even number of stitches, a vertically striped tube of fabric will be formed, while an odd number will create a diagonal grid that appears to mix the two colours.

Traditional Fair Isle patterns normally had no more than two or three consecutive stitches of any given colour, because they were ''stranded'', and too many consecutive stitches of one colour means a very long strand of the other, quite easy to catch with a finger or button.  A more modern variation is ''woven'' Fair Isle, where the unused strand is held in slightly different positions relative to the needles and thereby woven into the fabric, still invisible from the front, but trapped closely against the back of the piece.  This permits a nearly limitless variety of patterns with considerably larger blocks of colour.&lt;ref name="StarmoreFairIsle"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Fair Isle jumper construction involves knitting the body of the jumper completely in the round.  ''Steeks'' (from the Scottish word meaning 'stitch', 'to close shut', and comprising several stitches) are worked across the armhole openings allowing the body to be completed in the round without interruption. Once the main body of the jumper is complete, the armhole steeks are cut open (sometimes these are secured before cutting). Stitches are then picked up around the armhole opening and the sleeve is knitted down toward the cuff in the round. 

Since the 1990s, the term "Fair Isle" has been applied very generally and loosely to any stranded colour knitting regardless of its relation to the knitting of Fair Isle or any of the other Shetland Islands.

'''''Freedomland''''' is a 2006 American [[crime film|crime]] [[drama film|drama]] [[mystery film]] directed by [[Joe Roth]] and starring [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Edie Falco]], [[Ron Eldard]], [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]], [[Aunjanue Ellis]], and [[Anthony Mackie]]. It is based on [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]]'s [[Freedomland (novel)|1998 novel of the same name]], which touches on themes of covert [[racism]].

==Plot==
Brenda ([[Julianne Moore]]) walks through a predominantly [[African American]] housing project and enters an emergency room, apparently in shock and with cut and bleeding hands.  Police detective Lorenzo Council ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) is sent to take a statement from Brenda, who says that her car has been stolen. When Lorenzo gets there, she reveals that her young son, Cody, was in the back seat of the car.  The police frantically begin searching for Cody.

Brenda's brother, Danny ([[Ron Eldard]]), a police officer in a neighboring town, calls a massive police presence in to search the housing project for clues.  This angers the residents who protest their innocence.  Lorenzo begins to suspect that Brenda is holding back details from him and pressures her to tell the truth.  She insists that she has told the truth and would never harm her son. With a sketch artist she produces a picture of the man she says stole her car. Danny's white coworkers arrest a man from the housing project who they think matches the picture. Danny flies into a rage and beats him.  

Desperate to find Cody, Lorenzo enlists the aid of a volunteer group which helps search for missing children.  He suggests that they search Freedomland, an abandoned foundling hospital nearby.  As they search, the group's leader Karen Collucci ([[Edie Falco]]) talks with Brenda.  Collucci had lost her own son years before and convinces Brenda to admit that Cody is dead.  She leads them to a nearby park where they find Cody's body in a shallow grave, covered with heavy rocks.  

Lorenzo realizes that Brenda could not have moved the rocks herself.  Under interrogation Brenda admits to having been engaged in an affair with a man named Billy ([[Anthony Mackie]]) who lived in the projects.  She would give Cody cough syrup so that he would fall asleep and she could visit Billy.  On the night in question she had returned to find Cody dead, having drunk a whole bottle of cough syrup.  Billy helped her bury his body.  When the police go to arrest Billy, they are confronted by residents angry over previous unfounded police harassment and a riot erupts.  Brenda is charged with criminal neglect, and Lorenzo promises to visit her in jail.

'''Garghabazar caravanserai''' ({{lang-az|Qarğabazar karvansarayı}}) is a historic monument of XVII century. It is located in [[Qarğabazar, Fuzuli|Garghabazar village]], of [[Fuzuli District]], in [[Azerbaijan]].

==History==
The caravanserai was built in 1681 on a hill. It is known as Garghabazar caravanserai as it was built in Garghabazar village. The historic monument is sometimes referred as Shah Abbas caravansary. The architect of the monument is unknown, since inscription on the caravanserai is destroyed.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Qarğabazar karvansarayı (Füzuli)|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/museum/8ed5c332d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the occupation of Garghabazar village, the monument was ruined by Armenian forces.&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"&gt;{{cite web|title= Qarğabazar karvansarası - Füzuli rayonunun əsir abidələri|url= http://karabakhmedia.az/main/7072-qargabazar-karvansarasi-fuzuli-rayonunun-esir-abideleri-foto.html|publisher= karabakhmedia.az|language= az|accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural features==

 [[File:Qarğabazar karvansarasının planı və kəsiyi.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Plan and cross-section of the caravanserai]]
According to its architectural style, Garghabazar caravanserai is similar to architectural traditions of Albanian  period.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

The plan and architectural style of the caravanserai is made obedient to the general design by solving centered axis symmetrically. It consists of two large-sized [[Animal stall|camel stall]]s, two small rooms for guards on the right and left sides, 6 square-shaped rooms for caravanserai owner and merchants. The importance of these rooms is also reflected in the fact that they are built at the highest point of relief. Two high pavements were planted in front of these rooms according to their functions and relief.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

The width of the caravanserai is 23.67 meters in width and 34.70 meters in length. The main mass of the monument was built of unhewn stone. It is in a rectangular shape with a corner cut. On left and right sides of the entrance, in front of guard rooms, there are two large flagstones. It is considered that guards used to stand on those flagstones. The doors of the rooms are opening to a medium-sized balcony. The balcony is decorated 3 semicircular piers.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

There are special sewer lines in both halls of the caravanserai where camels were kept. This proves once again that in the Karabakh monarchy, sewage issues were still very much focused since ancient times.&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

In [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], and [[psychoanalysis]], the '''gaze''' (translated from French ''le regard'') is the act of seeing and being seen.

Numerous [[existentialism|existentialists]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] have addressed the concept of gaze beginning with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Part 3, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] elaborated on gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''. [[Derrida]] also elaborated on the relations of animals and humans via the gaze in ''The Animal That Therefore I Am''. The concept of a male gaze was originally theorized by feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]], and has since been applied to many other forms of media and technology, such as advertisements, the work space, and video games.

==In psychoanalysis==

In [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] psychoanalytic theory, it is the anxious state that comes with the awareness that one can be viewed. The psychological effect, Lacan argues, is that the subject loses a degree of autonomy upon realizing that he or she is a visible object. This concept is bound with his theory of the [[mirror stage]], in which a child encountering a mirror realizes that he or she has an external appearance. Lacan suggests that this gaze effect can similarly be produced by any conceivable object such as a chair or a television screen. This is not to say that the object behaves optically as a mirror; instead it means that the [[awareness]] of any object can induce an awareness of also ''being'' an object.

It has also been called an aspect of one of the "most powerful human forces"; that is, "the meeting of the face and the gaze" because "Only there do we exist for one another."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ove Knausgaard, "The Inexplicable," ''The New Yorker,'' May 25, 2015, page 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems of power and the gaze==
[[Michel Foucault]] first used the term "medical gaze" in ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' to explain the process of medical diagnosis, power dynamics between doctors and patients, and the hegemony of medical knowledge in society. He elaborated on the gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', such as surveillance and the function of related disciplinary mechanisms and self-regulation in a prison or school as an apparatus of power.

The gaze is not something one has or uses; rather, it is the relationship into which someone enters. As [[Marita Sturken]] and [[Lisa Cartwright]] write in ''Practices of Looking'', "The gaze is integral to systems of power and ideas about knowledge."&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;Sturken, Marita; Cartwright, Lisa. ''Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 94, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main concepts that Foucault introduced are [[panopticism]], [[power/knowledge]], and [[biopower]]. These concepts all address self-regulation under systems of [[surveillance]]. This refers to how people modify their behaviour under the belief that they are constantly being watched even if they cannot directly see who or what is watching them. This possible surveillance, whether real or unreal, has self-regulating effects.&lt;ref&gt;Sturken, Marita and Lisa Cartwright. ''Practices of Looking: an introduction to visual culture''. Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The male gaze ==
{{main article|Male gaze}}
In her 1975 essay ''Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema'', [[Laura Mulvey]] introduced the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] concept of "[[male gaze]]" as a feature of gender power asymmetry in film. The concept was present in earlier studies of the gaze,{{specify|date=June 2016}} but it was Mulvey who brought it to the forefront. Mulvey stated that women were objectified in film because heterosexual men were in control of the camera. Hollywood films played to the models of [[voyeurism]] and [[scopophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturken, Marita and Lisa Cartwright. ''Practices of Looking: an introduction to visual culture''. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has subsequently been influential in [[feminist film theory]] and [[media studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, Roberta. ''Interview with Laura Mulvey: Gender, Gaze and Technology in Film Culture''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, September 2011, 28(5) p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The feminine gaze ==
{{Main article|Judith Butler}}

In [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', she proposed the idea of the feminine gaze as a way in which men choose to perform their masculinity by using women as the ones who force men into self-regulation.

== Imperial gaze&lt;!-- linked from 'Male gaze'--&gt; ==
[[E. Ann Kaplan]] has introduced the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] concept of the imperial gaze, in which the observed find themselves defined in terms of the privileged observer's own set of value-preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Ashcroft et al, ''Post-Colonial Studies'' (2000) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the colonised, the imperial gaze infantilizes and trivializes what it falls upon,&lt;ref&gt;Vijay Mishra, ''Bollywood Cinema'' (2002) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; asserting its command and ordering function as it does so.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Yekani, ''The Privilege of Crisis'' (2011) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan comments: "The imperial gaze reflects the assumption that the white western subject is central much as the male gaze assumes the centrality of the male subject."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Patricia Waugh, ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 514&lt;/ref&gt;

== The oppositional gaze ==
In her 1992 essay titled "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bell hooks]] counters [[Laura Mulvey]]'s notion of the [[Male gaze|(male) gaze]] by introducing the oppositional gaze of Black women. This concept exists as the reciprocal of the normative white spectator gaze. As [[Laura Mulvey|Mulvey]]'s essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contextualizes the [[Male gaze|(male) gaze]] and its objectification of white women, [[Bell hooks|hooks]] essay&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; opens "oppositionality [as] a key paradigm in the feminist analysis of the 'gaze' and of scopophilic regimes in Western culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking Differently: A Reader in European Women's Studies|last=Griffin|first=Gabriele, and Rosi Braidotti|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=London: Zed, 2002|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oppositional gaze remains a critique of rebellion due to the sustained and deliberate misrepresentation of Black women in cinema as characteristically [[Mammy archetype|Mammy]], [[Jezebel]] or Sapphire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.|first=West, Carolyn|date=2012-01-01|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire, and Their Homegirls: Developing an "Oppositional Gaze" Toward the Images of Black Women|url=http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_pub/270/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postcolonial gaze===
First referred to by Edward Said as "orientalism", the term "post-colonial gaze" is used to explain the relationship that colonial powers extended to people of colonized countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|title=Orientalism|year=1978|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the colonized in a position of the "[[Other (philosophy)#Imperialism and colonialism|other]]" helped to shape and establish the colonial's identity as being the powerful conqueror, and acted as a constant reminder of this idea.&lt;ref name = Beardsell&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postcolonial gaze "has the function of establishing the subject/object relationship&amp;nbsp;... it indicates at its point of emanation the location of the subject, and at its point of contact the location of the object".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, this means that the colonizer/colonized relationship provided the basis for the colonizer's understanding of themselves and their identity.&lt;ref name = Beardsell/&gt; The role of the appropriation of power is central to understanding how colonizers influenced the countries that they colonized, and is deeply connected to the development of post-colonial theory. Utilizing postcolonial gaze theory allows formerly colonized societies to overcome the socially constructed barriers that often prohibit them from expressing their true [[Economic, social and cultural rights|cultural, social, economic]], and [[civil and political rights|political rights]].&lt;ref name = Beardsell/&gt;


'''The international gaze'''
The international gaze is the term used to describe the Neo Liberal and globalising manifestation of the imperial,- / post-colonial gaze. Both latter terms are helpful in defining the dominated status of developing countries. However, the international gaze offers a way of understanding how internationalism, seemingly neutral and optimistic in outlook, is deeply rooted in a discourse of advantage and power. It inculcates an implicit assumption of dominance by those empowered to be international, whilst obviating the innate power relations. This term is first used by A. Gardner-McTaggart (2018) in ''International Capital, International Schools, Leadership and Christianity

''
'''The male tourist gaze'''

The tourism image is created through cultural and ideological constructions and advertising agencies that have been male dominated. What is represented by the media assumes a specific type of tourist: white, Western, male, and heterosexual, privileging the gaze of the "master subject" over others.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pritchard and Morgan|first1=Annette and Nigel|title=Privileging the Male Gaze|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=2000|issue=27.4|pages=884–905|doi=10.1016/s0160-7383(99)00113-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the representation of the typical tourist because those behind the lens, the image, and creators are predominantly male, white, and Western. Those that do not fall into this category are influenced by its supremacy. Through these influences female characteristics such as youth, beauty, sexuality, or the possession of a man are desirable while the prevalence of stereotypes consisting of submissive and sensual women with powerful "macho" men in advertising are projected.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4557">'''Globs''' are millimeter-sized color modules  found beyond the [[Visual cortex|visual area V2]] in the [[brain]]'s color processing [[Two Streams hypothesis|ventral]] (also known as parvocellular) pathway. They are scattered throughout the posterior [[inferior temporal cortex]] in an area called the [[Visual cortex|V4 complex]]. They are clustered by color preference, and organized as color [[Cortical column|column]]s. They are the first part of the brain in which color is processed in terms of the full range of [[hue]]s found in [[color space]].&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;Conway BR, Tsao DY. (2009). Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106:18035-18039. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.0810943106}} {{PMID|19805195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohon, Hermann, Conway|title=Representation of perceptual color space in macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex (the V4 Complex)|journal=eNeuro|date=2016|doi=10.1523/ENEURO.0039-16.2016|url=http://eneuro.org/content/early/2016/08/11/ENEURO.0039-16.2016|accessdate=September 3, 2016|pmc=5002982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "glob" was proposed by [[Bevil Conway]] and [[Doris Tsao]]&lt;ref name="Conway07"&gt;Conway BR, Moeller S, Tsao DY. (2007). Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex. Neuron. 56(3):560-73. {{PMID|17988638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;Conway BR, Tsao DY. (2009). Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106:18035-18039. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.0810943106}} {{PMID|19805195}}&lt;/ref&gt; on an analogy with the cytochrome-oxidase
[[blob (visual system)|blob]]s of [[visual cortex|V1]], an earlier stage in the hierarchical elaboration of color.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone MS, Hubel DH. (1984). [http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/4/1/309 Anatomy and physiology of a color system in the primate visual cortex.] J Neurosci. 4(1):309-56. {{PMID|6198495}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also distinguishes them from other types of modules found elsewhere in the [[cerebral cortex]] such as face patches, and inferior
temporal feature columns.&lt;ref name="Conway07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;

==Properties==
Globs are found in the V4 complex, an area in the inferior temporal cortex, forward of area V3, that includes areas V4, the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] part of the posterior inferior temporal cortex and the rear part of the inferior temporal near the occipital lobe called TEO. Their neurons are not restricted to a single color preference. Neurons in adjacent glob cells  have similar color tuning and form clusters that are arranged spatially within the cortex.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt; In between them are ‘‘interglob’’ areas that were not color sensitive but respond to shape.&lt;ref name="Conway07"/&gt;  

The color-tuned neurons are arranged in color columns that are of a finer scale than single globs. These columns are between 50 and 100 μm in size. Color preferences of neurons recorded sequentially along given columns are arranged according to a chromotopic map that reflects perceptual [[color space]].&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt; 

They are studied using [[functional MRI]]&lt;ref name="Conway07"/&gt; and [[single-unit recording]].&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;

==Color perception==
{{Main|Color vision}}
Three types of retinal [[Cone cell|cone]] create signals that get transformed in the visual pathway to create the perception of color.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conway BR. (2009). Color vision, cones, and color-coding in the cortex. Neuroscientist. 15(3):274-90. {{PMID|19436076}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the neurons processing them in the [[retina]], [[lateral geniculate nucleus]], and V1 and V2 early parts of the visual cortex  encode using the [[opponent process]] only a limited range of colors that does not reflect the dimensions of perceptual color space.&lt;ref&gt;
Conway BR. (2001).

neurons representing most (if not all) of perceptual color space and which the color
responses of neurons correspond to perception.&lt;ref name="Conway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway07"/&gt;

'''''History Painting''''' is an early painting by [[Rembrandt]] dating to 1626. The title is a generic reference to [[history painting]], as there is no consensus about the painting's subject matter. More than a dozen subjects have been proposed, ranging from Biblical themes to classical and modern history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=van de Wetering, Ernst |title=A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401791731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''I Am a Ukrainian'''"  is an Internet [[viral video]], first posted on [[YouTube]] in 2014 featuring a young Ukrainian woman supporting the protestors in the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]]. At the woman's request, British photographer Graham Mitchell filmed her speaking on the Maidan, and her friend, [[Ben Moses]], edited the material into video he posted on her behalf on YouTube.  By late March that year the video had been viewed over 8 million times.

==Background==
The woman in the video was initially not named&lt;ref name="pp"/&gt; in order to keep her safe,&lt;ref name=hp/&gt; but was eventually identified as [[Yulia Marushevska]], a Kyiv Ph.D. student of Ukrainian literature at [[Taras Shevchenko National University]].&lt;ref&gt;Denys Krasnikov, [https://www.kyivpost.com/special/yulia-marushevska-revolutionary-leader-embodies-hope-ukrainians-bright-corruption-free-future.html Yulia Marushevska: Revolutionary leader embodies hope of Ukrainians for bright corruption-free future], ''[[Kiev Post]]'', December 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marushevska conceived, wrote, and produced the video after the death of five people, three of whom died of gunshot wounds, on January 22.&lt;ref name="voanews"/&gt; Marushevska felt she needed to do more for the [[EuroMaidan]], and was frustrated with what she perceived to be the foreigners’ ignorance about why the protests were happening.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} She wanted to inform the viewers that the Ukrainians want to change their government due to concerns over alleged unchecked corruption within it.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; They ended up shooting a 2-minute, 4 second long video&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; where she speaks in English.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Popularity==
After only a few days on YouTube the video had about 3.5 million views.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The video has received mostly positive reception, with the majority of the tens of thousands of comments supportive.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=neo/&gt; By  February 21 the video had approximately 70,000 "likes" and 4,000 "dislikes".&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt; A minority of voices argued that it is too one-sided.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=neo/&gt; It has also been criticized for its professional production value, invoking a comparison to the controversial [[Kony 2012]] viral video, which misled viewers into thinking it was a purely amateur production.&lt;ref name=neo/&gt;&lt;ref name=thepatriot/&gt;

[[BBC News]] has described it as having the greatest impact of any video from the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Moses has now completed a feature-length documentary, ''Witness to a Revolution'', about Yulia's and Ukraine's progress in the year following her viral video.&lt;ref name="iamaukrainianmovie"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In July 2015 [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], Governor of [[Odessa]], announced that Yulia Marushevska accepted a job as Deputy Head of the Odessa Regional State Administration. According to [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] Yulia Marushevska had previously spent a year of training at Harvard and Stanford universities.&lt;ref name="saakashvili"/&gt;

'''Jacob's Pillow''' is a dance center, school and performance space located in [[Becket, Massachusetts]], in the [[Berkshires]]. The organization is known for the oldest internationally acclaimed Summer dance festival in the United States.   The facility also includes a professional school and extensive archives as well as year-round community programs.  The facility itself was listed as a [[National Historic Landmark District]] in 2003.

==Mission statement==
The Jacob's Pillow mission is to support dance creation, presentation, education, and preservation; and to engage and deepen public appreciation and support for dance.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacob's Pillow Dance Mission Statement|url=http://www.jacobspillow.org/about/pillowmission.php|publisher=Jacob's Pillow Dance|accessdate=15 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127065840/http://jacobspillow.org/about/pillowmission.php|archivedate=27 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site of Jacob's Pillow in [[Becket, Massachusetts]] was originally settled in 1790 by the Carter family.  Because of the zigzagging road leading to the hilltop property, it became known as "Jacob's Ladder", and a pillow-shaped rock on the property prompted the farm to acquire the name "Jacob's Pillow".

The farm was purchased in 1931 by modern dance pioneer [[Ted Shawn]] as a dance retreat.  Shawn and his wife, [[Ruth St. Denis]], led the highly regarded [[Denishawn Company]], which had popularized dance forms rooted in theater and cultural traditions outside European ballet.  They were influential in training a host of dance pioneers, including [[Martha Graham]], [[Charles Weidman]], [[Doris Humphrey]], and [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]].
[[File:Shawn on Pillow Rock.jpg|thumb|300px|Ted Shawn laying his head upon the Jacob's Pillow Rock.]]

Shawn's objective was to establish a dance organization for American men.  The early corps of his all-male company built many of the structures on the Jacob's Pillow campus.  This effort came to an end in 1940 with the advent of the [[Second World War]]; Shawn's company disbanded and most of its members joined the military.

Significant debt forced Shawn to consider sale of the property.  In 1940 he leased the property to dance teacher Mary Washington Ball, but her summer festival was also financially unsuccessful.  British ballet stars [[Alicia Markova]] and [[Anton Dolin]] learned of Shawn's financial difficulties, and decided to acquire the property.  With financial backing and fundraising support from millionaire Reginald Wright, $50,000 was raised to purchase the property and construct a theater building.  The summer dance festival was revived, and Shawn was retained as its director until his death in 1972.

In 2003, the Jacob's Pillow property was declared a [[National Historic Landmark District]] by the federal government as "an exceptional cultural venue that holds value for all Americans." It is the only dance entity in the U.S. to receive this honor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jacobspillow.org/exhibits-archives/history/&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Jacob's Pillow was named a recipient of the 2010 [[National Medal of Arts]], a national award of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Bolger, Toni. [http://www.jacobspillow.org/about/National%20Medal%20of%20Arts%20ReleaseFINAL.pdf "Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival Awarded National Medal of Arts"]. "Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival", March 1st 2011, accessed July 12th 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Festival==
The Pillow presents international dance in many forms, styles, and traditions, and approximately 200 free events each season, including performances, lectures, tours, films, exhibits, and talks with artists from all over the world, culminating in approximately 80,000 visitors annually.

[[File:InsideOutStage.jpg|thumb|300px|A performance on the Inside/Out Stage.]]

Pillow founder Ted Shawn was instrumental in beginning the careers of [[Martha Graham]] and [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]], and the Pillow has continued this mentoring role in the careers of artists such as [[Alvin Ailey]], [[José Limón]], and [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]]. Companies such as [[Dance Theatre of Harlem]], the [[Parsons Dance Company]], and [[Trey McIntyre Project]] made their debuts at the Pillow, and international groups such as The [[Royal Danish Ballet]], [[Nederlands Dans Theatre]], [[Black Grace]] and [[Hofesh Shechter|Hofesh Shechter Company]] have made their U.S. debuts here. World premieres have been commissioned from choreographers such as [[Merce Cunningham]] and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], and artists such as [[Margot Fonteyn]] and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] have been showcased in works.

Performances at Jacob's Pillow take place on three stages. The Ted Shawn Theatre has a capacity of 620 reserved seats. The Doris Duke Studio Theatre, built in 1990 as a flexible, experimental space, has 220 seats. Talks by Pillow Scholars-in-Residence take place before every performance in these two theaters. Additionally, Post-Show Talks happen in the Ted Shawn Theatre on Thursdays and in the Doris Duke Studio Theatre on Fridays, giving audiences an opportunity to engage with artists in moderated Q&amp;A sessions.

The third stage is Inside/Out, which presents free performances of established and emerging artists from all over the world in an informal, outdoor venue set against a panoramic vista of the Berkshire hills. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays feature emerging artists, and Saturdays showcase the dancers of The School at Jacob's Pillow. Each performance at Inside/Out concludes with a Q&amp;A session with the artists. Artist featured in Inside/Out include: [[Pilobolus (dance company)|Pilobolus Dance Theater]], [[Nadine Bommer]] Dance Company, Reggie "Regg Roc" Gray, [[Michelle Dorrance]] with Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, Dušan Týnek Dance Theatre, Abarukas, Manuel Vignoulle, and Laurie M. Taylor.

Another facet of Jacob's Pillow's ongoing educational efforts is the PillowTalk series, which covers the art of dance and artists performing each week through intimate panel discussions, interviews, film screenings, and book signings. Exhibits are free and open to the general public, as are The Archives, which offer the opportunity to view videos, read books, access the Pillow's computer catalog, or view The Pillow's permanent collections of programs and photographs. Free historical walking tours are available to the public weekly during the summer.

==The School at Jacob's Pillow==
[[File:Rep.MMattox.11.MvanSleen.jpg|thumb|300px|Students of The School at Jacob's Pillow in rehearsal.]]

The School at Jacob's Pillow's conservatory-style curriculum includes five programs: Ballet, Cultural Traditions, Contemporary Traditions, Jazz/Musical Theater, and Choreographers’ Lab. The dancers’ schedule includes six days each week with four professional-level studio classes each day, coaching sessions, weekly performances for the public, master classes with Festival artists, talks led by Scholars-in-Residence, study assignments in the Pillow's rare and extensive Archives, and attendance at all Festival performances and events.

The School at Jacob's Pillow is known for its faculty. Faculty of The School at Jacob's Pillow have included Susan Jaffe, Amanda McKerrow, Chet Walker, [[Nikolaj Hubbe]], Anna-Marie Holmes, Milton Myers, [[Katherine Dunham]], Rennie Harris, [[Matt Mattox]], Soledad Barrio, [[Tim Rushton]], Finis Jhung, Martin Santangelo, Mercedes Ellington, Stephanie Saland, Victor Plotnikov, Annie-B Parson, Paul Lazar, Aszure Barton, Helen Pickett, Banu Ogan, [[Mr. Wiggles]], Marjory Smarth, Dana Moore, and Ric Ryder.

Alumni of The School include [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Grant]]-winner [[Meredith Monk]], choreographer [[Mia Michaels]], former [[Alvin Ailey Dance Theater]] and [[Paul Taylor Dance Company]] principal [[Linda Kent]], artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet [[Nikolaj Hübbe]], recent winner of FOX's television show ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', [[Joshua Allen]], and Robert Swinston of [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]].

==Community programs==
Jacob's Pillow's Community Dance Programs annually reach more than 3,000 Berkshire children, students, educators, special needs groups, continuing education adult learners, and dancers of all ages and levels of experience. The programs take place at the Pillow, in schools and other settings, and are designed to connect a wide range of participants with the intellectual, emotional, inspirational, as well as physical, world of dance.

Each year, Berkshire County students and teachers choreograph dances to explore topics required for mastery in academic classes, including science, math, history, and communication.  The ''Jacob's Pillow Curriculum in Motion'' program, places Pillow artists in the classroom to develop and teach curricula that meet state and national arts and academic standards.

The Pillow partners with community organizations throughout Berkshire County to provide access to dance activities and learning from Festival artists and staff. A year-round partnership with the Railroad Street Youth Project promotes teen leadership and community involvement through the development of choreographic work. During the Festival, the Pillow partners with Berkshire Institute for Lifelong Learning; Elderhostel Programs; and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]'s Days In The Arts and Shakespeare &amp; Co. Arts for All programs. The Pillow provides these groups with dance classes, guided tours, performance and School observation opportunities, and access to artists and staff.

==The archives==
The core collections preserved in the archives at Jacob's Pillow were originally assembled by founder Ted Shawn. Materials have been continually added since the 1930s by volunteers from the Pillow Board and staff. In 1991, Jacob's Pillow created the position of Director of Preservation to direct the activities and maintenance of the Archives. The Archives at Jacob's Pillow has approximately 6,000 films and videos from 1894 to present, 45,000 historic dance photos and negatives, 313,000 pages of unique printed materials, 27 trunks of costumes dating from 1915, and 2,000 books. The Archives is one component of the Pillow's Preservation Program, which organizes exhibits exploring various aspects of dance, oversees issues concerning the National Historic Landmark site, and records the ongoing activities of the Festival.

The Archives is internationally recognized as a major repository of dance materials. Access to the research facility is open to the public year-round by appointment and is available during the summer season from noon until the end of each performance, six days a week. The Archives collection is electronically catalogued, and much of it is accessible through the Pillow's website.

Blake's Barn is an 18th-century structure that was relocated and reconfigured specifically for preservation activity. This facility was donated by stage and screen dancer/actress Marge Champion and is named in honor of her late son. In addition to a central area for exhibits and lectures, the building houses a reading room with video stations providing access to the moving image collection. The lower level contains temperature-controlled storage areas and video production equipment.

Jacob's Pillow remains at the forefront of the dance preservation field partly through its active participation in the Dance Heritage Coalition, an alliance of the country's eight major dance collections including the Library of Congress, Harvard Theatre Collection, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Coalition is currently chaired by Norton Owen, the Pillow's longtime Director of Preservation.

In 2008, the Pillow was invited by the Nonprofit Finance Fund, with support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, to participate in the five-year Leading for the Future: Innovative Support for Artistic Excellence Initiative. With this funding, the Archives’ resources can be used in ways that add context and deepen understanding about individual artists and dance traditions, and help audiences around the world understand new and evolving forms.

In 2011, Jacob's Pillow launched Jacob's Pillow Dance Interactive, an online resource of video clips curated from the Archives in Becket. The archive features performances that have taken place at the festival from 1937 to 2010, including footage rarely seen. This user-friendly free resource allows the user to browse dance footage by artist, genre, and era. The director of preservation, Norton Owen, curates the collection. Each entry includes a video clip, an informative paragraph describing the dancer/choreographer, and an artist portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Stephanie.

This style of greater simplicity surrounding maritime art, with the majority of the canvas displaying sea and sky, set the grounds for later works in this genre.

== Life ==

=== Early life and career ===
[[File:Målning. Fatyg i storm vid klippig kust. Jan Porcellis - Hallwylska museet - 86698.tif|thumb|400px|''Ships in a Storm on a Rocky Coast'' by Jan Porcellis. Oil on canvas,  1614-1618, [[Hallwyl Museum]].]]
Jan Porcellis was born at [[Ghent]], around 1580 or 1584.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though his birth date can't be exactly determined, it can't be after 1584, since in that year his parents joined  Protestants fleeing from Ghent, a city that had recently captured by Spaniards from the Northern Netherlands for a second time. He married in [[Rotterdam]] in 1605. His daughter was baptized in 1609 in [[Middelburg|Middleburg]], and was an extensive traveler. According to [[Arnold Houbraken]], Porcellis studied with [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom|Hendrick Vroom]] as a teacher, though this remains unproven.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh Jr.|first=John|date=Nov 1974|title=The Dutch Marine Painters Jan and Julius Porcellis 1: Jan's Early Career|url=|journal=The Burlington Magazine|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early paintings date from 1612. His style became recognizable because of the use of many different light hues, exemplified in paintings such as ''Storm at Sea,'' which includes light effects previously unseen. Also notable from this period is Porcellis' rendition of ''Sea Battle at Night'' which, as its name indicates, features a marine conflict in dim light, with enemy ships barely visible and a gradual recognition of the subjects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By 1615, Porcellis faced financial constraints: he acquired three children, declared bankruptcy in Rotterdam and moved to Antwerp. Most of the paintings made in this period were serialized and sold in open markets; since they are not signed by Porcellis, they're considered lost. Thus, only about ten pictures from these years can be identified. Up to 1620, only about 10 works can be surely attributed to Porcellis, most of which represent battles, storms and harbor views. Prior to leaving [[Antwerp]], the first wife of Porcellis died.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Later life and death ===
In 1622, Porcellis moved to [[Haarlem]] with his three children, where he married Janneke Flessiers, daughter of Balthasar Flessiers (painter and print publisher). Porcellis continued the tradition of marine painting, but the setting of his pictures was never clarified and left ambiguous; this contrasted the usual style of contemporary marine painters, such as Jan Brueghel or Vroom, who traditionally portrayed [[Port of Antwerp|Antwerp Harbour]] or the [[:nl:Spaarne (Haarlem)|Spaarne at Haarlem]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Porcellis' two years in Haarlem probably saw the beginning of his reputation and prosperity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh Jr.|first=John|date=December 1974|title=The Dutch Marine Painters Jan and Julius Porcellis-II: Jan's Maturity and 'de jonge Porcellis'|url=|journal=The Burlington Magazine|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained more popularity because of the detail in his paintings, particularly in portraying the Beach View of Haarlem, various of which were found scattered in other European places and palaces, such as [[Palazzo Venezia]] in Rome, or in the collection of the Emperor of Germany.  In these years Porcellis' series of twenty etchings, ''Verscheyden Stranden en Water Gesichten'', was published in Haarlem by Jan Pietersz.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Porcellis soon left Haarlem and in 1624 was living in [[Amsterdam]]; by 1626 he had moved to [[Voorburg]] near [[The Hague]]. Around this time, in 1627, a set of twelve prints after Porcellis's designs were published in Amsterdam by C. J. Visscher, the ''Icones Variarum navium hollandicarum'', the first 'iconography' of ship types since [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s in 1565.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

At some time between 1627 and 1629 he moved more or less permanently to [[Zoeterwoude]] in the environs of [[Leiden]]. His last years were spent in prosperity thanks to his wife's share of the estate of her stepmother, and thanks also to sales of his pictures. On 19 December 1631, Porcellis lay 'ziekelijk te bedde' in his house in Zoeterwoude, and made his will; on 29 January 1632 he died. His widow was legatee, with a provision that the third child and only son, Julius, would receive "all the paintings and works in the artist's possession at his death, to wit, those by the artist's hand and signed with his name, and no others".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Vessels in a Strong Wind 1630 Jan Porcellis.jpg|thumb|''Vessels in a Strong Wind'', 1630, by Jan Porcellis]]

== Style ==
Jan Porcellis developed in the tradition of Dutch [[Marine art|Marine Painting]]. Henrick Vroom, whom Houbraken claims was Porcellis' teacher, was skillful at ship-painting, covering subjects such as fish, fishermen and other boatmen. Porcellis' earliest paintings, of the period up till 1612, demonstrated that he had mastered Vroom's style which enjoyed much popularity at the time. ''The Storm at Sea'' by Porcellis'','' reflects many characteristics which were important in Vroom's era, both in terms of its theatrics and in its conventions of rendering.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For all the perils he portrays, Porcellis puts less emphasis on spectacular destruction. The fact that no big ship wrecks are directly portrayed proves this point. The audience are rather invited to make out what happens gradually. Porcellis' ships sit has a solid presence in water and the grey hazy atmosphere contrasts and blurs the horizon and the ships in the distance. The mottling of the sky is projected by the sun upon the brown land which turns green in the light. These effects were never attempted by Vroom or his contemporaries, and in fact they were very advanced for this early date, which will be continued in Porcellis' lifelong preoccupation with the subtleties of weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=John|date=1974-01-01|title=The Dutch Marine Painters Jan and Julius Porcellis-1 Jan's Early Career|jstor=877870|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=116|issue=860|pages=653–662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Storm at Sea'' was the only representation of battle at night in Dutch art. In Porcellis' era, the ship was considered a metaphor for the human soul and sea voyage a symbol for human life. In account of which, the marine themes such as storm at the sea or shipwreck remind the spectator of human frailty and divine power. Whether Porcellis' paintings have a moral message is uncertain, but the arrangement as seen in  ''Sea Battle by Night,'' where the fights go on the distance while fishing continues in the foreground, seems to inspire thinking on human mortality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Nine out of ten of Porcellis' works before 1620 portray vessels of the Dutch fleet, representing battles, storms, or harbour views. This was a familiar subject by earlier sea painters as well. However, the first dated work of 1620 marks a change in his style. The panel portrays small transport vessels sailing in a fresh breeze. This was the first Dutch painting to be set in an anonymous seascape, unidentifiable with the famous ports. The masterly arrangement and stylisation of the formal elements indicate that Porcellis had reached maturity of his work at the time this panel was painted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Jan Porcellis' Haarlem period, 1622-1624, was the beginning of his prosperous period where he produced paintings in the style of views of the beach, a local specialty. This period also saw him producing near monochrome works of sky, characterised by effective manipulations of light and shade. Porcellis' skies were groundbreaking in many respects such as setting, subtle changes in landscape, and shifting moods. Most of his mature works portray the sea as hospitable, if uncomfortable or dangerous. Porcellis' contribution to Dutch art also lies in his emphasis on the dramatic effects of light, while having a generally restrained composition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Jan Porcellis established an original manner of Marine painting focusing on tonal effects, fostering vivid atmospheres and seascapes in a monochromatic fashion. These stylistic elements were later seen among his contemporaries such as [[Jan van Goyen]], [[Pieter de Molijn]], and [[Salomon van Ruysdael]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sphinxfineart.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=45&amp;tabindex=44&amp;artistid=38722|title=Jan Porcellis|last=|first=|date=|website=Sphinx Fine Art|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seascapists, more often than not, followed Porcellis in his depictions of anonymous ships surrounded by vast expanses of sea and sky (Slive 217).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rather than being commissioned, these paintings were usually made to sell on the open market, which can be reflected by the fluidity in stylistic elements not traditionally characteristic of marine painting&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Slive, p.&amp;nbsp;217).

Porcellis was recognized as a remarkable painter, said to be far superior to fellow Marine painter Hendrick Vroom by [[Constantijn Huygens]], with many prominent artists such as [[Rembrandt]], [[Allaert van Everdingen|Allart van Everdingen]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and [[Jan van de Cappelle]] collecting his works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was celebrated by Samuel Hoogstraten as the ''great Raphael of marine painting'', and was even honored with a poem composed by the prominent [[Joachim Oudaan]] concerning his talents. His followers included his son Julius, as well as his wife's brother, [[Hendrick van Anthonissen|Henrick van Anthonissen]], and [[Simon de Vlieger]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Slive, p.&amp;nbsp;218).

His most famous works can be seen across the globe in not only the Netherlands, but also Russia, Germany, the UK, France, and North America.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His most famous seascape paintings can be seen at the Heritage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/porcellis_jan.html|title=Jan Porcellis|last=Maylon|first=John|date=1999|website=Artcyclopedia|publisher=John Maylon|access-date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}

'''Jewish views on evolution''' includes a continuum of views about the [[theory of evolution]], [[experimental evolution]], the [[origin of life]], [[age of the universe]], [[evolutionary creationism]], and  [[theistic evolution]]. Today, many Jews accept the theory of evolution and do not see it as incompatible with traditional Judaism, reflecting the emphasis of prominent rabbis such as the [[Vilna Gaon]]&lt;ref&gt;The Vilna Gaon, [[Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman Kremer]], studied secular sciences and adwised his friends and students to do as well, maintaining that Judaism could only gain by studying them. {{cite web|title=ELIJAH BEN SOLOMON (also called Elijah Wilna, Elijah Gaon, and Der Wilner Gaon)|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5673-elijah-ben-solomon|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Vilna Gaon contributed to secular sciences: ''Ayil Meshullash'', a treatise on trigonometry, geometry, and some principles of astronomy and algebra containing 400 rules, Wilna, 1834; ''Treatise on astronomy''; ''Treatises on the teḳufot and moladot"; ''Diḳduḳ Eliyahu'', a short Hebrew grammar, Wilna 1833; ''Ma'aseh Toreh'', a collection of notes on different subjects; ibd.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maimonides]]&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Moses ben Maimon (RaMBaM) frequently cited principles of sciences, such as mathematics and physics, astronomy and medicine, and contributed to them. Maimonides held that there is no contradiction between the revealed truths of God and the truths discovered and explored by the human [[mind]], a gift from God. {{cite web|title=MOSES BEN MAIMON (RaMBaM; usually called MAIMONIDES)|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11124-moses-ben-maimon|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the ethical rather than factual significance of scripture.

==Classical rabbinic teachings==
Many [[rabbi]]s believe that God completed the creation of the world close to 6,000 years ago. This view is based on a chronology developed in a [[midrash]], ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah|Seder Olam]]'', which was based on a literal reading of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It is attributed to the [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Yose ben Halafta]], and covers history from the creation of the universe to the construction of the Second [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Since there is no explicit discussion in the classical era, it is commonly presumed that they took Genesis 1 literally, making the beginning of the world six days earlier, but this is presumption in the absence of data.

Some modern rabbis&lt;ref&gt;See for example Slifkin, Nathan, ''The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science,Cosmology, and Evolution,'' ZooTorah/Lambda Press, Brooklyn, 2010, section two, "Cosmology," pp. 157-190 for a discussion of these beliefs&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the world is older. They believe such a view is needed to accept scientific theories, such as the [[theory of evolution]]. Rabbis who have this view base their conclusions on verses in the [[Talmud]] or in the [[midrash]]. For example:

* The [[Midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;רבה בראשית ט אות ב&lt;/ref&gt; says: God created many worlds but was not satisfied, and left the world he was satisfied with.
* Rabbi Moshe Ben Nachman (1194–1270) writes:&lt;ref&gt;בראשית א א&lt;/ref&gt; In the first day God created the energy (כח) "matter" (חומר) of all things, and then he was finished with the main creation. After that God created all other things from that energy.
* Some midrashim state that the "first week" of Creation lasted for extremely long periods of time. See Anafim on [[Bahya ben Asher|Rabbenu Bachya's]] Sefer Ikkarim 2:18; Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 9.

==Medieval rabbinic teachings==
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sculpture of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
In his commentary on the Torah, Rabbi [[Bahya ben Asher]] (11th century, Spain) concludes that there were many time systems occurring in the universe long before the spans of history that man is familiar with. Based on the Kabbalah he calculates that the Earth is billions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Ginzburg, ''The Age of the Earth from Judaic Traditional Literature'', Earth Sciences History, Vol. 3, No. 2 (1984), pp. 169-173. [http://earthscienceshistory.org/doi/abs/10.17704/eshi.3.2.ml66h618g202x677?journalCode=eshi Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medieval philosophical rationalists, such as [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Natan Slifkin|Slifkin, Rabbi Natan]]. ''The Challenge of Creation'', (New York: Yashar Books 2006) page 200.&lt;/ref&gt; held that not every statement in Genesis is meant literally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guide to the Perplexed]], 2:17&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, one was obligated to understand Torah in a way that was compatible with the findings of [[science]]. Indeed, [[Maimonides]], one of the great Rabbis of the [[Middle Ages]], wrote that if science and Torah were misaligned, it was either because science was not understood or the Torah was misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', 2:25&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides argued that if science proved a point that did not contradict any fundamentals of faith, then the finding should be accepted and scripture should be interpreted accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book II, chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in discussing [[Plato]]'s view that the universe has existed literally forever, he argued that there was no convincing rational proof one way or the other, so that he (Maimonides) was free to accept, and therefore did accept, the literal Biblical view that the universe came into being at a definite time; but that had Plato's Theory been convincing enough with sufficient scientific proof he would have been able to reinterpret Genesis accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book 2, Chapter 25. See [http://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_2.25.2?lang=bi http://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed] of M. Friedländer's translation, 1919 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Maimonides stated that "the account given in scripture is not, as is generally believed, intended to be in all its parts literal." Later in the same paragraph, he specifically states that this applies to the text from the beginning to the account of the sixth day of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book II, chapter 29.  See [https://books.google.com/books?id=a2dRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211 page 211] of M. Friedländer's translation, 1919 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nahmanides]], often critical of the rationalist views of Maimonides, pointed out (in his commentary to Genesis) several non-sequiturs stemming from a literal translation of the Bible's account of Creation, and stated that the account actually symbolically refers to spiritual concepts. He quoted the [[Mishnah]] in Tractate [[Hagigah]] which states that the actual meaning of the Creation account, mystical in nature, was traditionally transmitted from teachers to advanced scholars in a private setting. Many classic [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources mention ''Shmitot'' - cosmic cycles of creation, similar to the Indian concept of [[yugas]]. [[Nahmanides|Nahmanides']] disciple, [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Rabbi Isaac of Akko]], a prominent Kabbalist of 13th-century, held that the Universe is about 15 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Immortality, resurrection, and the age of the universe: a kabbalistic view |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cajobAjRh3IC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=Sefer+Ha+Temunah+forms+of+Hebrew+letters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=63uku8qBxt&amp;sig=vrE3UQjPFp9dXtFsi_AdoVRKSOA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y8s5TJa6AYn4sAP52NxR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sefer%20Ha%20Temunah%20forms%20of%20Hebrew%20letters&amp;f=false|publisher= Ktav Publishing House |date=January 1993 |first1= Aryeh |last1= Kaplan |authorlink1= Aryeh Kaplan |page= 9 |ISBN= 978-0-88125-345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition of ''Shmitot'', Genesis talks openly only about the current epoch, while the information about the previous cosmic cycles is hidden in the esoteric reading of the text.

A literal interpretation of the biblical Creation story among classic rabbinic commentators is uncommon. Thus Bible commentator Abraham Ibn Ezra (11th Century) wrote,

''If there appears something in the Torah which contradicts reason…then here one should seek for the solution in a figurative interpretation…the narrative of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for instance, can only be understood in a figurative sense.''

One of several notable exceptions may be the [[Tosafists|Tosafist]] commentary on [[Tractate Rosh Hashanah]], where there seems to be an allusion to the age of creation according to a literal reading of Genesis. The non-literal approach is accepted by many as a possible approach within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and some segments of [[Haredi Judaism]].

[[Rashi]], while his commentary on the verses describing the days of creation teaches them as literal days, brackets his discussion of Genesis ch. 1 with comments stating that the entire world was created at once, with no duration of existence before Adam being specified.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Genesis 1:1, sv "בראשית ברא"; and 2:2 sv "תולדות השמים"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, Rabbi [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]] made the insight that, since Sabbatical cycles existed before man was created, time before Adam and Eve must be measured in divine years, not human years. Psalm 90:4 says, "For a thousand years in thy sight are but like yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night." Rabbi Isaac of Akko - who held like Livnat Ha-Sapir, that we are in the seventh Sabbatical cycle - therefore took the above figure of 42,000 years and multiplied it by 365,250 (he was using a 365.25-day year) to get 15,340,500,000 years for the age of the universe when Adam was created.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cajobAjRh3IC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Rabbi+Isaac+of+Akko&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=65tcoamBDm&amp;sig=JwpywnRpPKUglv5pBrU189z8UJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8pLHqwYPMAhUEHKYKHaLzBpgQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Rabbi%20Isaac%20of%20Akko&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yashanet.com/library/missing_link.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views in reaction to Darwin==
With the advent of [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary theory, the Jewish community found itself engaged in a discussion of [[Jewish principles of faith]] and modern scientific findings.

===Post-1800 Kabbalistic views of compatibility===
Rabbi [[Elijah Benamozegh]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[kabbalah|Kabbalist]], wrote that were evolution to become a mainstay of scientific theory, it would not contradict the Torah as long as one understood it as having been guided by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Em LeMikra'' ([[Livorno]] 1863) commenting on [[Deuteronomy]] 22:10, page 87a-88b&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Israel Lipschitz]] of Danzig (19th century) gave a famous lecture on Torah and [[paleontology]], which is printed in the ''Yachin u-Boaz'' edition of the [[Mishnah]], after Massechet Sanhedrin. He writes that Kabbalistic texts teach that the world has gone through many cycles of history, each lasting for many tens of thousands of years. He links these teachings to findings about [[geology]] from European, American and Asian geologists, and from findings from paleontologists.  He discusses the wooly [[mammoth]] discovered in 1807 Siberia, Russia, and the remains of several then-famous [[dinosaur]] skeletons recently unearthed.  Finding no contradiction between this and Jewish teachings, he states "From all this, we can see that all the Kabbalists have told us for so many centuries about the fourfold destruction and renewal of the Earth has found its clearest possible confirmation in our time."

When [[scientists]] first developed the theory of evolution, this idea was seized upon by Rabbis such as [[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin]], known as the Netziv, who saw Kabbalah as a way to resolve the differences between traditional readings of the Bible and modern day scientific findings.  He proposed that the ancient fossils of dinosaurs were the remains of beings that perished in the previous "worlds" described in [[midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;מדרש רבה בראשית פרשה ט אות י&lt;/ref&gt; and in some Kabbalistic texts. This was the view held by Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] (1934–1983).

===Late 19th century Orthodox view of evolution===

[[File:Samson Raphael Hirsch (FL12173324).crop.jpg|thumb| Samson Raphael Hirsch]]
In the late 1880s, Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], an influential leader in the early opposition to non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, wrote that while he did not endorse the idea of [[common descent]] (that all life developed from one common [[organism]]), even if science ever did prove the factuality of Evolution, it would not pose a threat to Orthodox Judaism's beliefs. He posited that belief in [[Evolution]] could instead cause one to be more reverent of God by understanding His wonders (a master plan for the [[universe]]).
:This will never change, not even if the latest scientific notion that the genesis of all the multitudes of organic forms on earth can be traced back to one single, most primitive, primeval form of life should ever appear to be anything more than what it is today, a vague hypothesis still unsupported by fact. Even if this notion were ever to gain complete acceptance by the scientific world, Jewish thought, unlike the reasoning of the high priest of that notion, would nonetheless never summon us to revere a still extant representative of this primal form as the supposed ancestor of us all. Rather, Judaism in that case would call upon its adherents to give even greater reverence than ever before to the one, sole God Who, in His boundless creative wisdom and eternal omnipotence, needed to bring into existence no more than one single, amorphous nucleus and one single law of "adaptation and heredity" in order to bring forth, from what seemed chaos but was in fact a very definite order, the infinite variety of species we know today, each with its unique characteristics that sets it apart from all other creatures. (Collected Writings, vol. 7 pp. 263-264)

By the early to mid-1900s, the majority of [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] came to accept the existence of evolution as a scientific fact. They interpreted Genesis and related Jewish teachings in light of this fact.

===Modern-day Orthodox Jewish views===
The [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA) has "maintained that evolutionary theory, properly understood, is not incompatible with belief in a Divine Creator, nor with the first 2 chapters of Genesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creation, Evolution, and Intelligent Design |publisher=Rabbinical Council of America |year=2005 |url=http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100635}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent Orthodox rabbis who have affirmed that the world is older, and that life has evolved over time include Israel Lipschitz, [[Sholom Mordechai Schwadron]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} (the MaHaRSHaM) (1835–1911), [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]] (1805–1855) and [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (1865–1935). These rabbis proposed their own versions of [[theistic evolution]], in which the world is older, and that life does evolve over time in accord with natural law, painting natural law as the process by which God drives the world.

There is, in parallel, a discussion on this subject by scientists in the Orthodox Jewish community. One of the most prominent is [[Gerald Schroeder]], an [[MIT]] trained [[physicist]]. He has written a number of articles and popular books attempting to reconcile Jewish theology with modern scientific findings that the world is billions of years old and that life has evolved over time. His work has received approbations from a number of Orthodox rabbinic authorities. Other physicists writing on this topic include [[Alvin Radkowsky]], [[Nathan Aviezer]], [[Herman Branover]], [[Cyril Domb]], [[Aryeh Kaplan]] and [[Yehuda (Leo) Levi]].

Various popular works, citing an array of classical, Orthodox views, attempt to reconcile traditional Jewish texts with modern scientific findings concerning evolution, the age of the earth and the age of the Universe; these include:
*[[Nathan Aviezer]]: ''In the Beginning, Biblical Creation and Science''; ''Fossils and Faith: Understanding Torah and Science''
*[[Aryeh Carmell]] and [[Cyril Domb]], ed.: ''Challenge: Torah Views on Science and Its Problems''
*[[Daniel E. Friedmann]]: ''The Genesis One Code: Demonstrates a clear alignment between the times of key events described in the Genesis with those derived from scientific observation.'' and ''The Broken Gift: Harmonizing the Biblical and scientific accounts of human origins''
*[[Aryeh Kaplan]]: ''Immortality, Resurrection and the Age of the Universe: A Kabbalistic View''
*[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Yehuda Levi]]: ''Torah and Science - Their Interplay in the World Scheme''
*[[Jonathan Sacks]]: ''The Great Partnership: God, Science and the Search For Meaning''
*[[Gerald Schroeder]]: ''Genesis and the Big Bang: The Discovery of Harmony Between Modern Science and the Bible''; ''The Science of God''
*[[Natan Slifkin]]: ''[[The Challenge of Creation]]''

===Modern-day Conservative Jewish views===

[[Conservative Judaism]] embraces science as a way to learn about the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and, like Modern Orthodox and Reform Judaism, has not found the theory of evolution a challenge to traditional Jewish theology. The Conservative Jewish movement has not yet developed one official response to the subject, but a broad array of views has converged. Conservative Jews teach that God created the universe and is responsible for the creation of life within it, but proclaims no mandatory teachings about how this occurs.

Many Conservative Rabbis embrace the term [[theistic evolution]], and reject the term [[intelligent design]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Conservative rabbis who use the term ''intelligent design'' in their sermons often distinguish their views from the Christian use of the term. Like most in the scientific community, they understand "intelligent design" to be a technique by Christians to insert religion into public schools, as admitted in the [[Intelligent design movement]]'s "[[wedge strategy]]".

The Central Conference of American Rabbis is opposed to the teaching of creationism in public schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Central Conference of American Rabbis |title=Religion and the Public Schools |year=1987 |url=http://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/all/religion-and-the-public-schools-1987/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the Rabbinical Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Resolution on Intelligent Design and the Freedom of Scientific Inquiry|year= 2006|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/resolution-intelligent-design-and-freedom-scientific-inquiry?tp=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Judaism strongly supports the use of science as the proper way to learn about the physical world in which we live, and thus encourages its adherents to find a way to understand evolution in a way that does not contradict the findings of scientific research. The tension between accepting God's role in the world and the findings of science, however, is not resolved, and a wide array of views exists. Some mainstream examples of Conservative Jewish thought are as follows:

Professor [[Ismar Schorsch]], former chancellor of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], writes that:
:The Torah's story of creation is not intended as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in the very nature of things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.

Rabbi [[David J. Fine]], who has authorized official [[responsa]] for the Conservative movement's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], expresses a common Conservative Jewish view on the subject:

:Conservative Judaism has always been premised on the total embrace of critical inquiry and science. More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, I would say that it is a mitzvah to learn about the world and the way it works to the best of our abilities, since that is to marvel with awe at God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.
:
:But here's where the real question lies. Did God create the world, or not? Is it God's handiwork? Many of the people who accept evolution, even many scientists, believe in what is called "theistic evolution," that is, that behind the billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution, there is room for belief in a creator, God, who set everything into motion, and who stands outside the universe as the cause and reason for life. The difference between that and "intelligent design" is subtle yet significant. Believing scientists claim that belief in God is not incompatible with studying evolution since science looks only for the natural explanations for phenomena. The proponents of intelligent design, on the other hand, deny the ability to explain life on earth through solely natural explanations. That difference, while subtle, is determinative.
:David J. Fine, ''Intelligent Design''

Rabbi Michael Schwab writes:
:...the Jewish view on the first set of questions is much closer to the picture painted by adherents to intelligent design than to those who are strict Darwinians. Judaism, as a religion, and certainly Conservative Judaism, sees creation as a purposeful process directed by God, however each individual defines the Divine. This is clearly in consonance with the theory of Intelligent Design. What Darwin sees as random, we see as the miraculous and natural unfolding of God’s subtle and beautiful plan.
:...However, as unlikely as it may seem, this does not mean for one moment that Judaism’s view rejects wholesale the veracity of Darwin’s theory. In fact, I believe that it is easy to incorporate Darwin and Intelligent design into a meaningful conception of how we humans came into being...
:We have frameworks built into our system to integrate the findings of science into our religious and theological beliefs. That is because we believe that the natural world, and the way it works, was created by God and therefore its workings must be consistent with our religious beliefs.
:...One of the most well known ways our tradition has been able to hold onto both the scientific theory of evolution as well as the concept of a purposeful creation was by reading the creation story in Genesis in a more allegorical sense. One famous medieval commentary proclaims that the days of creation, as outlined in the book of Bereshit, could be seen as representative of the stages of creation and not literal 24 hour periods. Thus each Biblical day could have accounted for thousands or even millions of years. In that way the progression according to both evolution and the Torah remains essentially the same: first the elements were created, then the waters, the plants, the animals, and finally us. Therefore, Genesis and Darwin can both be right in a factual analysis even while we acknowledge that our attitudes towards these shared facts are shaped much more strongly by the Torah – we agree how the process unfolded but disagree that it was random.
:Parshat Noah -- November 4, 2005, ''How Did We Get Here?'' Michael Schwab

The claim that evolution is [[teleological|purposeful]] is in conflict with modern-day evolutionary theory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The precise way in which God inserts design is not specified by Schwab or other rabbis.

Rabbi [[Lawrence Troster]] is a critic of positions such as this. He holds that much of Judaism (and other religions) have not successfully created a theology which allows for the role of God in the world and yet is also fully compatible with modern-day evolutionary theory. Troster maintains that the solution to resolving the tension between classical theology and modern science can be found in [[process theology]], such as in the writings of [[Hans Jonas]], whose view of an evolving God within process philosophy contains no inherent contradictions between theism and scientific naturalism.
:Lecture ''God after Darwin: Evolution and the Order of Creation'' October 21, 2004, Lishmah, New York City, Larry Troster
In a paper on Judaism and [[environmentalism]], Troster writes:
:Jonas is the only Jewish philosopher who has fully integrated philosophy, science, theology and environmental ethics. He maintained that humans have a special place in Creation, manifest in the concept that humans are created in the image of God. His philosophy is very similar to that of Alfred North Whitehead, who believed that God is not static but dynamic, in a continual process of becoming as the universe evolves.
:''From Apologetics to New Spirituality: Trends in Jewish Environmental Theology'', Lawrence Troster

==Jewish opposition to Darwinian theory==

Whilst the Reform, Conservative and Modern Orthodox movements have stated that they feel there is not a conflict between evolutionary theory and the teachings of Judaism, some [[Haredi]] rabbis have remained staunchly opposed to certain teachings in [[evolution]]ary theory. In contrast with the literalist biblical interpretation of some Christian [[creationism|creationists]], they express an openness to multiple interpretations of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], through Jewish [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]] and [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]]. They have also expressed an openness to evolutionary theory in biology, except where they perceive that it is in conflict with the [[Torah]]'s account of creation.

Rabbi [[Avigdor Miller]], a highly revered American Haredi rabbi of the [[Litvish|Lithuanian Yeshivah Tradition]], who was also highly respected in Hasidic communities such as Satmar, was strongly opposed to the theory of evolution, and wrote strong polemics against evolution in several of his books, as well as speaking about this subject often in his popular lectures, taking a Creationist position. Several selections from his books on this subject were collected in a pamphlet he published in 1995 called "The Universe Testifies".

Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the Rebbe of the worldwide movement of Lubavitcher or [[Chabad]] [[Hasidism]], was avidly opposed to evolution opposed to evolution, and his following remains committed to that position.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112083/jewish/Theories-of-Evolution.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Avi Shafran]], a spokesman for [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]], writes a weekly column that is  widely syndicated in the Jewish press. As an opponent of Darwinian evolutionary theory, Shafran is careful to distinguish the Jewish perspective from that of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, "An unfortunate side-effect of our affirmation of purpose in creation at a time of controversy is the assumption made by some that we believing Jews share some other groups’ broader skepticism of science. But while Torah-faithful Jews reject the blind worship of science, we do not regard science as an enemy." Quite the contrary, Shafran remarks, Judaism seeks to learn as much as possible from God's creation.

Shafran also rejects the literalism of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, "Nor is 'Biblical literalism' a Jewish approach. Many are the ''p’sukim'' (verses) that do not mean what a simple reading would yield." To Shafran, the Jewish oral tradition is the key to the true meaning of the Torah's words. "There are multiple levels of deeper meanings inaccessible to most of us. The words of ''Breishis'' (Genesis, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) and the [[Midrash]]im thereon hide infinitely more than they reveal. It is clear that the Torah describes the creation of the universe as the willful act of ''HaKodosh Boruch Hu'' (the Holy One), and describes creation as having unfolded in stages. But details are hardly provided."&lt;ref name=Menken&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cross-Currents |date=December 22, 2005 |title=Rabbi Avi Shafran on Intelligent Design |last=Menken |first=Yaakov |url=http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/22/rabbi-avi-shafran-on-intelligent-design/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Some contemporary Orthodox Jews writers are concerned that if evolution is accepted as true, then it could lead to the Torah being deemed not only irrelevant but also false. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb has argued that for Jews accepting evolution is equivalent to accepting atheism. The Israeli microbiologist Morris Goldman has written that Darwinism is a problem for Judaism, since Darwinism makes god irrelevant. Other issues are that evolution can provide a non religious basis for the development of morality, and it removes the idea that humans are qualitatively different from other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Tradition and the Challenge of Darwinism, G. N. Cantor, Marc Swetlitz, University of Chicago Press, 15 Nov 2006, pg 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slifkin affair===

{{Main|Natan Slifkin}}
[[File:Slifkin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]]]]
In 2004-2005, three popular books by Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]] (sometimes pronounced ''Nosson'' Slifkin) were banned by a group of [[Haredi]] rabbinic authorities on the grounds that they were heretical. Known to his admirers as the "Zoo Rabbi," Nosson Slifkin was the author of ''The Torah Universe'', a series of books on science and religion that were widely read in Orthodox communities until they were suddenly banned. "The books written by Nosson Slifkin present a great [[stumbling block]] to the reader," the ban declared. "They are full of heresy, twist and misrepresent the words of our sages and ridicule the foundations of our ''emunah'' (faith)." The ban, which prohibited Jews from reading, owning, or distributing Slifkin's books, prompted a widespread backlash in the Orthodox Jewish community.

Jennie Rothenberg, reporting on this ban in the secular Jewish journal, ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', asserted that the incident represents a major breaking point within ultra-Orthodox society. Rothenberg interviewed several rabbis who wished to remain anonymous. According to one of them, "Over the past 15 years, the rabbis of [[Bnei Brak, Israel|Bnai Brak]] and the more open American ultra-Orthodox rabbis have been split on a number of important policy decisions. The Slifkin ban is a huge break. It’s a kind of power struggle, and those who didn’t sign the ban are outraged right now. I’m talking about rabbis with long white beards who are furious about it." Slifkin’s views, according to this rabbi, are shared by countless figures within the ultra-Orthodox community. "He’s saying out loud what a lot of people have been talking about quietly all along. To those people, he’s a kind of figurehead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Moment Magazine |title=The Heresy of Nosson Slifkin |last=Rothenberg |first=Jennie |date=October 2005 |url=http://momentmag.com/features/oct05/slifkin.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120174348/http://momentmag.com/features/oct05/slifkin.html |archivedate=November 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox scientists respond to Darwin==

Several Modern Orthodox Jewish scientists have interpreted creation in light of both modern scientific findings and rabbinical interpretations of Genesis. Each of these scientists have claimed that modern science actually confirms a literal interpretation of [[Torah]]. All of them accept the scientific evidence that the age of the [[Earth]] and the age of the universe are on a scale of billions of years, and all of them acknowledge that the diversity of species on Earth can be explained through an evolutionary framework. However, each of them interprets certain aspects of evolution or the emergence of modern humans as a divine process, rather than a natural one. Thus, each of them accepts an evolutionary paradigm, while rejecting some aspects of Darwinism. [[Shai Cherry]] writes, "While twentieth century Jewish theologians have tended to compartmentalize science and the Torah, our Modern Orthodox physicists synthesized them.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Nathan Aviezer]]''', a physicist who trained at the [[University of Chicago]], allows for divine guidance within an evolutionary paradigm in the transmutation of species over time, including the emergence of modern man from ''[[Homo erectus]]''. As a physicist, he interprets the six days of creation as broadly referring to large periods of time, an interpretation for which he cites rabbinic sources, including [[Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]]. For Aviezer, the evolutionary framework applies, except where the Hebrew verb ''bara'' (''create'') is used. To Aviezer, "It is particularly meaningful that Modern Man is intellectually and culturally so vastly superior to his closest relative, the extinct [[Neanderthal Man]], even though both species are very similar." He explains this through a literal interpretation of Genesis 1:27 &amp;mdash; "And God ''created'' Man in His image."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 169-172.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gerald Schroeder]]''', an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] trained physicist, believes that modern science contains nothing inimical to a literal reading of Genesis. Indeed, modern science allows one to understand the "true literal meaning of the Creation narrative." To Schroeder, it is Einstein's relativity, the "distortion of time facing backwards in a forward rushing cosmos," that accounts for the compression of time in a 15-billion year-old universe into six days of creation. To Schroeder, the emergence of modern man can be dated to the beginning of writing. Archeologists date the first writing, he notes, "at five or six thousand years ago, the exact period that the Bible tells us the soul of Adam, the ''[[Soul#Judaism|neshama]]'', was created." To Schroeder, who cites the [[Targum]] of [[Onkelos]], Adam was the first man who could write, and the creation of Adam from more primitive man was a divine ensoulment.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Judah Landa]]''', a physicist and teacher at, among other institutions, the [[Yeshiva of Flatbush]], takes a completely different approach. To Landa, [[genetic mutation]] is not a random process, but a divinely guided one that only appears random to humanity. "Evolution was designed and guided, just as the putting together of words and sentences into book forms is accomplished only by design and guidance. A book is designed by its author, evolution was (and continues to be) designed by the laws of nature (which in turn, were designed, we believe, by God).&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Landa differs from Darwin is in his rejection of the Darwinian notion that evolution has no purpose. Landa does not claim that there is proof of a final purpose for life; he merely asserts that science cannot rule one out. He writes, "God may very well have designed the laws of the universe and the earliest forms of matter and energy with particular life-forms as end-products in mind. Evolution and natural selection may be the vehicles he chose and designed to achieve His purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Aviezar and Schroeder, Landa reconciles science with the biblical account of Genesis, taken literally, but he does so through literary interpretation.

[[Shai Cherry]], Professor of Jewish Thought at [[Vanderbilt University]], remarks that these Modern Orthodox scientists have rejected the approach taken by Jewish theologians. Theologians have tended to use later writings, such as [[Midrash]] and [[Kabbalah]], to reconcile modern science with Genesis. The Orthodox scientists, by comparison, have largely ignored Jewish theology, in favor of a fundamentalist and literalist interpretation of Genesis. Yet in their writings, each of them seeks to reconcile science with Genesis. Cherry speculates, "They were targeting an American Jewish community that privileges science over Torah as a source of scientific knowledge. If Genesis could be shown to have anticipated Darwin or Einstein, then the Bible would regain an aura of truth that it had been losing since the advent of biblical criticism and modern science."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cherry, the books of Aviezar, Schroeder, and Landa have each sought to strengthen Orthodox Jewry in a time of mounting secularization. Aviezar and Schroeder sought to prove that Genesis anticipates the findings of modern science, and thus increase its status. By contrast, Landa sought to remove a barrier to Orthodox commitment, by proving to secular Jews that Orthodox Judaism and modern science are compatible. At the same time, he sought to persuade students in his own Orthodox community that the study of science is not incompatible with commitment to Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathan Robertson a researcher in Biophysics has also released a book titled "The First Six Days" which claims to reconcile the scientific theory of the beginnings of the universe and life with the biblical account of creation. Rabbinical sources are cited from Nachmanides (Ramban) and Rashi along with kabbalistic interpretations of Genesis. Nathan reconciles Darwinian evolution with the biblical account and states that at deeper levels of understanding of the biblical text and of scientific theory, the two worlds overlap. "As one studies science to deeper levels and also tries to study Bereshis [Genesis] to deeper levels, both principles begin to converge on each other."

==Jewish reactions to intelligent design==
{{Main|Jewish reactions to intelligent design}}

The movement for [[intelligent design]] claims that an intelligent creator is responsible for the [[origin of life]] and of humankind, and rejects evolution. Jewish theologians, organizations, and activists have maintained that intelligent design is not valid science but that it is a religious concept. Although some have expressed support for a theistic interpretation of evolution, they have generally rejected the tenets of the intelligent design movement. To Rabbi [[Brad Hirschfield]], President of the [[National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership]], intelligent design is "their attempt to confirm what they already believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirschfield |first=Brad |title=The Origins of Life: A Jewish Perspective |publisher=National Public Radio |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4761360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish organizations in the [[United States]] have been steadfast in their opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools, charging that to do so would violate the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''La Maison Cubiste''''' ('''''The Cubist House'''''), also called '''''Projet d'hôtel''''', was an architectural installation in the ''Art Décoratif'' section of the 1912 Paris ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' which presented a [[Cubist]] vision of architecture and design.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Blau, Nancy J.

''La Maison Cubiste'' had a 10 by 8 meter plaster facade with highly geometric trim,  behind which were two furnished rooms; a living room (''Salon Bourgeois'') and a bedroom.  Paintings by [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] were hung in the salon.&lt;ref name="The Sun" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/LiteraryDigest-1912nov30-01012?View=Search&amp;SearchView=PDFHits&amp;pages=1012 André Mare, ''Salon Bourgeois, Salon d'Automne'', The Literary Digest, ''Doom of the Antique'', New York City, November 30, 1912, p. 1012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.artnet.com"&gt;[https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/cubism-at-the-met-modern-art-that-looks-tragically-antique-157075 Ben Davis, ''"Cubism" at the Met: Modern Art That Looks Tragically Antique'', Exhibition: "Cubism: The Leonard A.

It was an early example of ''art décoratif'', a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Cubism now was recognized as significant to a broad range of applications, beyond the bounds of fine art. The movement opened the way toward new possibilities, a modern geometrical vision that could be adapted to architecture, interior design, graphic arts, fashion and industrial design; the basis of [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref name="news.artnet.com"/&gt;

[[File:La Maison Cubiste, Le Salon Bourgeois, Salon d'Automne, 1912, Paris.jpg|thumb|260px|''Le Salon Bourgeois'', designed by [[André Mare]] inside ''La Maison Cubiste'', in the decorative arts section of the Salon d'Automne, 1912, Paris. Metzinger's ''[[Femme à l'Éventail]]'' on the left wall]]
Mare called the living room in which Cubist paintings were hung the ''Salon Bourgeois''. Léger described this name as 'perfect'. In a letter to Mare prior to the exhibition Léger writes: "Your idea is absolutely splendid for us, really splendid. People will see Cubism in its domestic setting, which is very important."&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;

The facade of the house (''Façade architecturale''), designed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes, but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished in a bourgeois, colorful, and rather traditional manner, particularly compared with the paintings.  The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine ''Art et Décoration'':  "He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety.  He achieves it."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=52}} The Cubist element was provided by the paintings.  Despite its tameness, the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical, which helped make for its success.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=54}}  This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]], New York, Chicago and Boston.&lt;ref name="Goss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/frdc/hd_frdc.htm|title=French Art Deco|author=Goss, Jared|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt315s.html Kubistische werken op de Armory Show]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/detail-duchampvillons-faade-architecturale-14604 Raymond Duchamp-Villon, listed in catalog of the New York Armory Show exhibit as number 609, ''Facade architectural, plaster'', 1913, unidentified photographer.

Metzinger and Gleizes in ''Du "Cubisme"'', written during the assemblage of ''La Maison Cubiste'', described the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work was called the "antithesis of the picture". "The true picture" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, "bears its ''raison d'être'' within itself. It can be moved from a church to a [[drawing-room]], from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, excerpt from ''Du Cubisme'', 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;

"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye".&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;
For the occasion, an article entitled ''Au Salon d'Automne "Les Indépendants"'' was published in the French newspaper ''Excelsior'', 2 Octobre 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324.html Salon d'Automne 1912, page from ''Excelsior'' reproduced]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Excelsior (journal)|Excelsior]] was the first publication to privilege photographic illustrations in the treatment of news media; shooting photographs and publishing images in order to tell news stories. As such ''L'Excelsior'' was a pioneer of [[photojournalism]].

[[Walter Pach]], president of the landmark 1913 exhibition known as the Armory Show, wrote a pamphlet for the occasion, "A Sculptor’s Architecture", in which he discussed Duchamp–Villon’s ''La Maison Cubiste'' as exemplary of a new architectural style for the modern era.&lt;ref name="Cubist room" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pach"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/items/detail/sculptors-architecture-14573 Walter Pach, ''A sculptor's architecture'', 1913, Published by the Association of American Painters and Sculptors. Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, 1859-1984, bulk 1900-1949. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution]&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]his work of M. Duchamp-Villon's is an example of what possibilities are contained in a style like the present one whose philosophy is a base", writes Pach, "not a limitation." Continuing, Pach writes, "His work in architecture is by no means a turning aside from his sculpture, but a furthering of it. In the present facade he has simply a "subject" whose organization was to be developed from the forms suggested by a man or woman."&lt;ref name="Pach" /&gt;

When the art collector Michael Stein, brother of [[Gertrude Stein]], first introduced the work of Duchamp-Villon to Pach, he noted that it would be "admirably suited to the needs of building with concrete". Pach agreed. But speaking with the sculptor convinced Pach that this style had its first application to building with stone, and that it emerged from "an appreciation and solution of the new problem of steel and stone."&lt;ref name="Pach" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The final word I would speak about this architecture is its quality of response to the needs of America. We have yet enormous areas that will be built up into cities, we are going to tear down and rebuild most of the edifices, that already exist. With the freedom that this order gives to individual development and with its possibilities of expansion to make it suit the largest building as well as the smallest, it seems to clearly fix the type of our ideal. Before a photograph of the sky-scrapers of Manhattan Island, Raymond Duchamp-Villon said that he saw the possibilities of the modern cathedral. (Walter Pach, 1913)&lt;ref name="Pach" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chochol was one of three Czech architects (members of the [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts]]), with [[Pavel Janák]] and [[Josef Gočár]], influenced by Cubism]]
It is difficult to measure the influence of the Maison Cubiste.  No actual house following the same design was ever built, and later Deco and modernist residences followed very different models.   However, the house was a great success in emphasizing the role of Cubism as an alternative to traditional art and design.  Mare joined ranks with furniture designer [[Louis Süe]] to form the design company ''Atelier Français'', which became one of he most important furniture manufacturers in Paris, helping to develop the early [[Art Deco]] furniture style.  The scandal in the press caused by the paintings displayed there was a major contributor to the popularity of Cubist art. Thanks largely to the popularity of the exposition, the term "Cubist" began to be applied to anything modern, from women's haircuts to clothing to theater performances.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=54}}

[[Le Corbusier]] had reportedly been enthused by ''La Maison Cubiste'' during the 1912 exhibition. "He saw in it important solutions for the problem of building with cement." Le Corbusier subsequently exhibited his model for ''Maison Citrohan'' (a mass production prototype) at the Salon d'Automne of 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-WXuEAwKcSQC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=raymond+duchamp-villon,+%22cubist+house%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2hs3T3cDPAhXEUBQKHVFbBmYQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=raymond%20duchamp-villon%2C%20%22cubist%20house%22&amp;f=false Alice T.

No buildings like the Cubist House were built in France, but the model did have an impact in Czechoslovakia (now the [[Czech Republic]]) then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], where architects wanted to show their independence from the Viennese style.  In 1913 the Czech architect [[Pavel Janák]] was commissioned to reconstruct the facade of a large baroque house, the Fara House in the town of Pelhrimov in south Bohemia,   in the cubist style. Janák redid the baroque facade by adding angular geometric forms similar to those on the model of the cubist house in Paris.  Because of this quest for architectural independence from Austria,  many art deco houses, mostly in the later more typical Deco style, are found in Prague and other cities in the Czech Republic.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=191-192}}

Roof shapes differ greatly from region to region. The main factors which influence the shape of [[roof]]s are the climate and the materials available for roof structure and the outer covering. Roof terminology is also not rigidly defined. Usages vary slightly from region to region, or from one builder or architect to another.

Roof shapes vary from almost flat to steeply pitched. They can be arched or domed; a single flat sheet or a complex arrangement of slopes, gables and hips; or truncated (terraced, cut)&lt;ref&gt;Long, George. "Roof". ''The Penny cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge''. London: Charles Knight, 18331843. 143. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to minimize the overall height.

==Roof shapes==
* [[Flat roof|Flat]]: These are found in traditional buildings in regions with a low precipitation. Modern materials which are highly impermeable to water make possible the very large low-pitch roofs found on large commercial buildings. Although called flat they are generally gently pitched.
** [[Roof garden|Roof terrace (including roof garden)]]: the same with protections from falling such as a balustrade, parapet walls or surrounding raised plant beds used as a living or public dining space.
* Mono-pitched roofs (''Pitched'' here means a roof [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] rather than a slope and implies it is not a flat roof)
** [[Mono-pitched roof]] (shed, skillion, lean-to roof&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Henry J., and Peter R. Smith. "Shed roof" ''Dictionary of architectural and building technology''. London: Elsevier Applied Science Publishers ;, 1986. 272. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A roof with one slope, historically attached to a taller wall.
** [[Saw-tooth roof|Saw-tooth]]: A roof comprising a mono-pitched roof or for larger buildings, series of, mono-pitched roofs with vertical surfaces glazed and pitched upward in general terms away from the [[equator]], though other directions suit if direct sunlight is desired and where rooftop access may otherwise be impracticable. The roof tops are opaque, shielding traditionally workers and machinery from direct [[sunlight]]. This sort of roof commonly admits natural light into a [[factory]], and is also known as [[North light (architecture)|"Northlight"]] in the northern hemisphere implying a single such plane.&lt;ref&gt;"The Machine Shop and the Works. Modern Principles of Design", ''The Times: Engineering Supplement'', London, November 13, 1912, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pent roof (pentice, skirt roof if carried around the house&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M.. "Pent roof". ''Harris dictionary of architecture &amp; construction''. 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A roof appended, thus the name, to the wall of a building and by implication having further roofs or terraces above. (See gallery below)
* Multi-pitched roofs:
** [[Gable]] (ridged, dual-pitched, peaked, saddle, pack-saddle, saddleback,&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Honour, &amp; Pevsner, ''A Dictionary of Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt; span roof&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, Augustine C.. "Span Roof". ''Handbook of technical terms used in architecture and building and their allied trades and subjects'', . London: Scott, Greenwood, and Co.;, 1904. 325. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A simple roof design shaped like an inverted V.
*** Cross gabled: The result of joining two or more gabled roof sections together, forming a T or L shape for the simplest forms, or any number of more complex shapes.
***See also [[roof pitch]], [[Crow-stepped gable|crow-stepped, corbie stepped, stepped gable]]: A gable roof with its end parapet walls below extended slightly upwards and shaped to resemble steps.
** [[A-frame house|A-frame]]
** Half-hipped (clipped gable): A combination of a gable and a hip roof (pitched roof without changes to the walls) with the hipped part at the top and the gable section lower down.
** [[Gablet roof|Dutch gable, gablet]]: A hybrid of hipped and gable with the gable (wall) at the top and hipped lower down; i.e. the opposite arrangement to the ''half-hipped'' roof. Overhanging [[eaves]] forming shelter around the building are a consequence where the gable wall is in line with the other walls of the buildings that is unless the upper gable or gables is or are recessed.
** [[Saltbox]], catslide: A gable roof with one side longer than the other, and thus closer to the ground unless the pitch on one side is altered.
** Outshot or catslide: A pitched extension of a main roof similar to a lean-to but an extension of the upper roof.
** Bonnet roof: A reversed gambrel or Mansard roof with the lower portion at a lower pitch than the upper portion.
** Monitor roof: A roof with a [[Monitor (architecture)|monitor]]; 'a raised structure running part or all of the way along the ridge of a double-pitched roof, with its own roof running parallel with the main roof.'
** [[Butterfly roof]] (V-roof,&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, Augustine C.. "V Roof" ''Handbook of technical terms used in architecture and building and their allied trades and subjects'', . London: Scott, Greenwood, and Co.;, 1904. 362. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; London roof&lt;ref&gt;Coutts, John. ''Loft Conversions''. 2nd ed. New York: Wiley, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;): A V-shaped roof resembling an open book. A kink separates the roof into two parts running towards each other at an obtuse angle.
** [[Karahafu]]: A type of gable found in some traditional Japanese buildings.
** [[Hidden roof]]: A type of Japanese roof construction.
**[[Hip roof|Hip, hipped]]: A hipped roof is sloped in two pairs of directions (e.g. N-S and E-W) compared to the one pair of direction (e.g. N-S ''or'' E-W) for a gable roof.
** Half-hipped: A hybrid of a gable and a hipped roof. (See above.)
** Dutch gable, gablet: The reverse hybrid of a hipped and a gable roof. (See above.)
** Cross hipped: The result of joining two or more ''hip'' roof sections together, forming a T or L shape for the simplest forms, or any number of more complex shapes.
** Satari: A Swedish variant on the ''monitor roof''; a double hip roof with a short vertical wall usually with small windows, popular from the 17th century on formal buildings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (''Säteritak'' in Swedish.)
** [[Mansard roof|Mansard]] (French roof): A roof with the pitch divided into a shallow slope above a steeper slope. The steep slope may be curved. An element of the Second Empire architectural style (Mansard style) in the U.S.
** [[Gambrel|Gambrel, curb, kerb]]: A roof similar to a mansard but sloped in one direction rather than both.
** Bell-cast (sprocketed, flared): A roof with the shallow slope below the steeper slope at the eaves. Compare with [[bell roof]].
** [[East Asian hip-and-gable roof]]
** [[Mokoshi]]: A Japanese decorative pent roof
** Pyramidal
** Pyramid roof (pavilion roof): A hip roof on a square building.
** [[Pyatthat]]: A multi-tiered and spired roof commonly found in Burmese royal and Buddhist architecture.
** [[Tented roof|Tented]]:A type of polygonal hipped roof with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak
** Helm roof, [[Rhenish helm]]: A pyramidal roof with gable ends; often found on church towers.
** Twisted, an extreme display of craftsmanship found on some church towers in France, see gallery below.
** Arched roof
** [[Barrel roof|Barrel, barrel-arched]] (cradle, wagon): A round roof like a barrel (tunnel) vault.
** [[catenary arch|Catenary]]: An arched roof in the form of a catenary curve.
** Bow roof, rainbow,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Nikolas, and Erkki Jokiniemi. Dictionary of architecture and building construction. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Architectural Press, 2008.304&lt;/ref&gt; Gothic, Gothic arch, and ship's bottom roof. Historically also called a ''compass roof''.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/rainbow+roof|title=Rainbow roof &amp;#124; Article about rainbow roof by The Free Dictionary|website=encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Circular
** [[Bell roof]] (bell-shaped, '''ogee''', [[Philibert de l'Orme]] roof): A bell-shaped roof. Compare with ''bell-cast'' eaves. De l'Orme also used ''bow roofs'' (see below).
** [[Dome]]d
** [[Onion dome]] or rather an imperial roof
** [[Bochka roof]]
** [[Conical roof]] or cone roof
*Hyperbolic
** [[Saddleback roof|Saddleback]]

'''Marc Rosenberg''' is an American screenwriter and producer, with professional roots in Australia. Rosenberg currently splits his time between Los Angeles and Sydney,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112121/http://www.screenhub.com.au/news/shownewsarticleG.asp?newsID=35087 Interview with Marc Rosenberg in Screen Hub&lt;/ref&gt; having taught screenwriting and film production in the U.S., India, Norway, China and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;https://cce.sydney.edu.au/tutor/2906&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg has contributed to ''Film International Magazine'' and written a screenwriting guide, ''The Screenplay Tree: Story Structure Made Easy.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/SCREENPLAY-TREE-Structure-Annotated-Script-ebook/dp/B07D72MX3F/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527328000&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was raised in Houston, Texas, and graduated from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] with a degree in Government. Following graduation, he hitchhiked through Europe and Asia, settling for a brief time in London, where he worked as an estate agent. He later spent a year living on [[kibbutz]] in Israel, and then moved to Sydney, New South Wales, where he was accepted into the Writers-in-Residence program at the prestigious [[Australian Film Television and Radio School]]. There, he studied with fellow students such as [[Jane Campion]], [[Alex Proyas]], [[P.J. Hogan]] and Andrew Lesnie.

==Career==
After graduating, Rosenberg was invited by acclaimed director [[Phillip Noyce]] to collaborate on the screenplay ''[[Heatwave (film)|Heatwave]]'', which starred [[Judy Davis]]. Rosenberg went on to write screenplays for such feature films as ''[[Dingo (film)|Dingo]]'' (starring Miles Davis), ''[[The Nesting (film)|The Nesting]]'' (aka ''The Serpent's Lair''), ''Incident at Raven's Gate, Australie'' (starring Jeremy Irons) and ''[[December Boys]]'' (starring Daniel Radcliffe). Rosenberg was nominated for an [[Australian Film Institute]] (AFI) Best Picture award for ''Dingo'', for which he also received a prestigious AWGIE award from the [[Australian Writers' Guild]], as well as the New South Wales State Literary Award. He also received an AWGIE for Best Feature Film Adaptation in 2007 for ''December Boys''.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20081209153337/http://wip.warnerbros.com/decemberboys/content/docs/DecemberBoys_prodnotes.pdf Production notes distributed by Warner Brothers for the film ''December Boys''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg finished shooting the suspense-thriller ''Elevator'', which he wrote and produced. The film, which is about people trapped in a New York elevator with a terrorist, features actors [[John Getz]], [[Shirley Knight]], [[Joey Slotnick]], [[Devin Ratray]], [[Waleed Zuaiter]], [[Anita Briem]], [[Tehmina Sunny]], [[Christopher Backus]], [[Michael Mercurio]], Amanda Pace and Rachel Pace. It is Rosenberg's second film to be shot in the U.S. It was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://movies.broadwayworld.com/article/Shirley_Knight_Begins_Production_for_ELEVATOR_20100930 TalkMoviesWorld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''medieval art''' of the [[Western world]] covers a vast scope of time and place, over 1000 years of art in [[Western art history|Europe]], and at times the Middle East and North Africa. It includes major art movements and periods, national and regional art, genres, revivals, the artists' crafts, and the artists themselves.

Art historians attempt to classify medieval art into major periods and styles, often with some difficulty.  A generally accepted scheme includes the later phases of [[Early Christian art]], [[Migration Period art]], [[Byzantine art]], [[Insular art]], [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], [[Romanesque art]], and [[Gothic art]], as well as many other periods within these central styles. In addition each region, mostly during the period in the process of becoming  [[nation]]s or cultures, had its own distinct artistic style, such as [[Anglo-Saxon art]] or [[Norse art]].

Medieval art was produced in many media, and works survive in large numbers in [[sculpture]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s, [[stained glass]], [[metalwork]] and [[mosaic]]s, all of which have had a higher survival rate than other media such as [[fresco]] wall-paintings, work in precious metals or [[History of clothing and textiles#Medieval clothing and textiles|textile]]s, including [[tapestry]].  Especially in the early part of the period, works in the so-called "minor arts" or [[decorative arts]], such as metalwork, ivory carving, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[embroidery]] using precious metals, were probably more highly valued than paintings or [[monumental sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;Heslop traces the beginning of the change to "around the twelfth century", quoted, 54; Zarnecki, 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval art in Europe grew out of the artistic heritage of the [[Roman art|Roman Empire]] and the [[Christian iconography|iconographic traditions]] of the [[early Christian church]]. These sources were mixed with the vigorous "barbarian" artistic culture of Northern Europe to produce a remarkable artistic legacy. Indeed, the history of medieval art can be seen as the history of the interplay between the elements of [[classical art|classical]], early Christian and "barbarian" art.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger (throughout), Hinks (especially Part 1) and Henderson (Chapters 1, 2 &amp; 4) in particular are concerned with this perennial theme. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDNobJFWygcC&amp;pg=PA407&amp;lpg=PA407&amp;dq=Medieval+art+classical+barbarian+Gardner's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AUZrn-wyQw&amp;sig=y2nS9GdW5mslQ8b5r7aRRr4119s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m5KBStT8HIy5jAfaocSKCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the formal aspects of classicism, there was a continuous tradition of realistic depiction of objects that survived in Byzantine art throughout the period, while in the West it appears intermittently, combining and sometimes competing with new expressionist possibilities developed in Western Europe and the Northern legacy of energetic decorative elements.  The period ended with the self-perceived [[Renaissance]] recovery of the skills and values of classical art, and the artistic legacy of the [[Middle Ages]] was then [[Dark Ages (historiography)|disparaged]] for some centuries.  Since a revival of interest and understanding in the 19th century it has been seen as a period of enormous achievement that underlies the development of later Western art.

==Overview==

[[File:Lorenzetti amb.effect2.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail of ''The Effects of Good Government'', a [[fresco]] in the [[Palazzo Pubblico|City Hall of Siena]] by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], 1338.]]

The [[Middle Ages]] in Europe saw a decrease in prosperity, stability, and population in the first centuries of the period—to about 800 AD, and then a fairly steady and general increase until the massive setback of the [[Black Death]] around 1350, which is estimated to have killed at least a third of the overall population in Europe, with generally higher rates in the south and lower in the north.  Many regions did not regain their former population levels until the 17th century.  The [[Medieval demographics|population of Europe]] is estimated to have reached a low point of about 18 million in 650, to have doubled around the year 1000, and to have reached over 70 million by 1340, just before the Black Death. In 1450 it was still only 50 million. To these figures, Northern Europe, especially Britain, contributed a lower proportion than today, and Southern Europe, including France, a higher one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html Fordham University] Josiah Russell's figures - all estimates are of course very imprecise.  See [[Consequences of the Black Death]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in prosperity, for those who survived, was much less affected by the Black Death. Until about the 11th century most of Europe was short of agricultural labour, with large amounts of unused land, and the [[Medieval Warm Period]] benefited agriculture until about 1315.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2002AGUFMPP71C..09L | title=Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Periods in Eastern China as Read from the Speleothem Records | journal=AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts | year=2002 | authors=Li, H.; Ku, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval period eventually saw the falling away of the invasions and incursions from outside the area that characterized the first millennium.  The [[Islamic conquests]] of the 6th and 7th century suddenly and permanently removed all of North Africa from the Western world, and over the rest of the period Islamic peoples gradually took over the [[Byzantine Empire]], until the end of the Middle Ages when Catholic Europe, having regained the Iberian peninsula in the southwest, was once again under Muslim threat from the southeast.

At the start of the medieval period most significant works of art were very rare and costly objects associated with secular elites, monasteries or major churches and, if religious, largely produced by monks.  By the end of the Middle Ages works of considerable artistic interest could be found in small villages and significant numbers of [[bourgeois]] homes in towns, and their production was in many places an important local industry, with artists from the [[clergy]] now the exception.  However the [[Rule of St Benedict]] permitted the sale of works of art by monasteries, and it is clear that throughout the period monks might produce art, including secular works, commercially for a lay market, and monasteries would equally hire lay specialists where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23, and Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

The impression may be left by the surviving works that almost all medieval art was religious.  This is far from the case; though the church became very wealthy over the Middle Ages and was prepared at times to spend lavishly on art, there was also much secular art of equivalent quality which has suffered from a far higher rate of wear and tear, loss and destruction.  The Middle Ages generally lacked the concept of preserving older works for their artistic merit, as opposed to their association with a saint or founder figure, and the following periods of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] tended to disparage medieval art.  Most luxury illuminated manuscripts of the Early Middle Ages had lavish [[treasure binding]] book-covers in precious metal, ivory and jewels; the re-bound pages and ivory [[relief]]s for the covers have survived in far greater numbers than complete covers, which have mostly been stripped off for their valuable materials at some point.
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Treasure binding|jewelled cover]] of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], c. 870, a Carolingian [[Gospel book]].]]

Most churches have been rebuilt, often several times, but medieval palaces and large houses have been lost at a far greater rate, which is also true of their fittings and decoration. In England, churches survive largely intact from every century since the 7th, and in considerable numbers for the later ones—the city of [[Norwich]] alone has 40 medieval churches—but of the dozens of royal palaces none survive from earlier than the 11th century, and only a handful of remnants from the rest of the period.&lt;ref&gt;The [[White Tower (Tower of London)]] was started in 1078, and some later royal apartments in the [[Tower of London]] survive, as do the hall and parts of [[Eltham Palace]], the most significant medieval remains from an unfortified royal palace. Royal apartments survive in some castles.&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation is similar in most of Europe, though the 14th century [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] survives largely intact.  Many of the longest running scholarly disputes over the date and origin of individual works relate to secular pieces, because they are so much rarer - the Anglo-Saxon [[Fuller Brooch]] was refused by the [[British Museum]] as an implausible fake, and small free-standing secular bronze sculptures are so rare that the date, origin and even authenticity of both of the two best examples has been argued over for decades.&lt;ref&gt;the small Carolingian(?) ''Equestrian Statue of an Emperor'' in the [[Carnavalet Museum]] in Paris, Hinks, 125-7; and the 12th(?)-century bronze of a man wrestling with a lion, variously considered English, German or [[Sicily|Sicilian]] in origin, discussed by Henderson (1977), 135–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of valuable materials is a constant in medieval art; until the end of the period, far more was typically spent on buying them than on paying the artists, even if these were not monks performing their duties.  [[Gold]] was used for objects for churches and palaces, personal jewellery and the fittings of clothes, and—fixed to the back of glass [[tesserae]]—as a solid background for [[mosaic]]s, or applied as [[gold leaf]] to miniatures in manuscripts and panel paintings.  Many objects using precious metals were made in the knowledge that their bullion value might be realized at a future point—only near the end of the period could money be invested other than in [[real estate]], except at great risk or by committing [[usury]].
[[File:Wilton diptych.jpg|thumb|360px|The small private [[Wilton Diptych]] for [[Richard II of England]], c. 1400, with stamped gold backgrounds and much [[ultramarine]].]]

The even more expensive [[pigment]] [[ultramarine]], made from ground [[lapis lazuli]] obtainable only from [[Afghanistan]], was used lavishly in the Gothic period, more often for the traditional blue outer mantle of the [[Virgin Mary]] than for skies.  [[Ivory]], often painted, was an important material until the very end of the period, well illustrating the shift in luxury art to secular works; at the beginning of the period most uses were shifting from [[consular diptych]]s to religious objects such as book-covers, [[reliquaries]] and [[crozier]]s, but in the Gothic period secular mirror-cases, caskets and decorated combs become common among the well-off.  As thin ivory panels carved in [[relief]] could rarely be recycled for another work, the number of survivals is relatively high—the same is true of manuscript pages, although these were often re-cycled by scraping, whereupon they become [[palimpsest]]s.

Even these basic materials were costly: when the Anglo-Saxon [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] planned to create three copies of the bible in 692—of which one survives as the [[Codex Amiatinus]]—the first step necessary was to plan to breed the cattle to supply the 1,600 [[calf (animal)|calves]] to give the skin for the [[vellum]] required.&lt;ref&gt;Grocock, Chris has some calculations in [http://www.mayoalive.com/Mag1096/AbbyTalk.htm ''Mayo of the Saxons and Anglican Jarrow'', Evidence for a Monastic Economy], according to which sheep required only one third as much land per page as calves.  1,600 calves seems to be the standard estimate, see {{citation |last=John |first=Eric |title=Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England |year=1996 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0-7190-5053-7 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7ju8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paper]] became available in the last centuries of the period, but was also extremely expensive by today's standards; [[woodcut]]s sold to ordinary pilgrims at shrines were often [[matchbook]] size or smaller.  Modern [[dendrochronology]] has revealed that most of the [[oak]] for panels used in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of the 15th century was felled in the [[Vistula]] basin in Poland, from where it was shipped down the river and across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]]s to [[Flanders|Flemish]] ports, before being seasoned for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 29 – the following pages describe gold, pigments and other materials.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art in the Middle Ages is a broad subject and art historians traditionally divide it in several large-scale phases, styles or periods.  The period of the Middle Ages neither begins nor ends neatly at any particular date, nor at the same time in all regions, and the same is true for the major phases of art within the period.&lt;ref&gt;Dates are discussed in Calkins (1979), xix-xx, Kitzinger (1955), 1, Beckwith (1964), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The major phases are covered in the following sections.

==Early Christian and Late Antique art==
{{Main|Early Christian art}}
[[File:Arco di Costantino (Roma) - tondo lato settentrionale destro.jpg|thumb|[[Arch of Constantine]], Rome, completed 315: The lower long [[relief]], with squat figures of size varying with status, is of that date, while the [[roundels]] are taken from a monument of nearly 200 years earlier, which maintains a classical style.]]

Early Christian art, more generally described as [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] art, covers the period from about 200 (before which no distinct Christian art survives), until the onset of a fully [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] in about 500.  There continue to be different views as to when the medieval period begins during this time, both in terms of general history and specifically art history, but it is most often placed late in the period.  In the course of the 4th century Christianity went from being a persecuted popular sect to the official religion of the Empire, adapting existing Roman styles and often [[iconography]], from both popular and Imperial art.  From the start of the period the main survivals of Christian art are the tomb-paintings in popular styles of the [[catacombs of Rome]], but by the end there were a number of lavish mosaics in churches built under Imperial patronage.

Over this period imperial Late [[Roman art]] went through a strikingly "baroque" phase, and then largely abandoned classical style and Greek realism in favour of a more mystical and hieratic style—a process that was well underway before Christianity became a major influence on imperial art.  Influences from Eastern parts of the Empire—[[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and beyond, and also a robust "Italic" vernacular tradition, contributed to this process. Figures are mostly seen frontally staring out at the viewer, where classical art tended to show a profile view - the change was eventually seen even on coins. The individuality of portraits, a great strength of Roman art, declines sharply, and the anatomy and drapery of figures is shown with much less realism. The models from which medieval Northern Europe in particular formed its idea of "Roman" style were nearly all portable Late Antique works, and the Late Antique carved [[sarcophagi]] found all over the former Roman Empire;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1977), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; the determination to find earlier "purer" classical models, was a key element in the art ''all'antica'' of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, chapters 1 &amp; 2, and Kitzinger, 1955, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine art==
{{Main|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol1v.jpg|thumb|left|[[King David]] plays the [[harp]] in the 10th century [[Paris Psalter]], a classicising work of the Macedonian period.]]

Byzantine art is the art of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire formed after the division of the Roman Empire between Eastern and Western halves, and sometimes of parts of Italy under Byzantine rule.  It emerges from Late Antiquity in about 500 CE and soon formed a tradition distinct from that of Catholic Europe but with great influence over it.  In the early medieval period the best Byzantine art, often from the large Imperial workshops, represented an ideal of sophistication and technique which European patrons tried to emulate.  During the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] in 730-843 the vast majority of [[icon]]s (sacred images usually painted on wood) were destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding, and most remaining works are in Italy (Rome and [[Ravenna]] etc.), or Egypt at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].

Byzantine art was extremely conservative, for religious and cultural reasons, but retained a continuous tradition of Greek realism, which contended with a strong anti-realist and hieratic impulse.   After the resumption of icon production in 843 until 1453 the Byzantine art tradition continued with relatively few changes, despite, or because of, the slow decline of the Empire.  There was a notable [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|revival of classical style]] in works of 10th century court art like the [[Paris Psalter]], and throughout the period manuscript illumination shows parallel styles, often used by the same artist, for iconic figures in framed miniatures and more informal small scenes or figures added unframed in the margins of the text in a much more realist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|pp=57–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monumental sculpture]] with figures remained a taboo in Byzantine art; hardly any exceptions are known.  But small ivory reliefs, almost all in the iconic mode (the [[Harbaville Triptych]] is of similar date to the Paris Psalter, but very different in style), were a speciality, as was relief decoration on bowls and other metal objects.

The Byzantine Empire produced much of the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with court production centred on [[Constantinople]], although some art historians have questioned the assumption, still commonly made, that all work of the best quality with no indication as to origin was produced in the capital. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental [[fresco]]s and [[mosaic]]s inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to [[mosques]].
[[File:L'abbé Ména et le Christ 01.JPG|thumb|6th or 7th century [[Coptic art|Coptic]] [[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|icon of Jesus and an abbot]] shares in more homely form the anti-realist style of Byzantine iconic art.]]

Byzantine art exercised a continuous trickle of influence on Western European art, and the splendours of the Byzantine court and monasteries, even at the end of the Empire, provided a model for Western rulers and secular and clerical patrons.  For example, [[Byzantine silk]] textiles, often woven or embroidered with designs of both animal and human figures, the former often reflecting traditions originating much further east, were unexcelled in the Christian world until almost the end of the Empire.  These were produced, but probably not entirely so, in Imperial workshops in Constantinople, about whose operations we know next to nothing—similar workshops are often conjectured for other arts, with even less evidence.  Some other decorative arts were less developed; Byzantine [[ceramic art|ceramics]] rarely rise above the level of attractive [[folk art]], despite the [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek heritage]] and the impressive future in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period of [[İznik pottery|İznik wares]] and other types of pottery.

The [[Coptic art]] of Egypt took a different path; after the [[Coptic Church]] separated in the mid-5th century it was never again supported by the state, and native Egyptian influences dominated to produce a completely non-realist and somewhat naive style of large-eyed figures floating in blank space.  This was capable of great expressiveness, and took the "Eastern" component of Byzantine art to its logical conclusions.  Coptic decoration used intricate geometric designs, often anticipating Islamic art.  Because of the exceptionally good preservation of Egyptian burials, we know more about the textiles used by the less well-off in Egypt than anywhere else.  These were often elaborately decorated with figurative and patterned designs.  Other local traditions in [[Armenia]], [[Syria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and elsewhere showed generally less sophistication, but often more vigour than the art of [[Constantinople]], and sometimes, especially in [[architecture]], seem to have had influence even in Western Europe.  For example, figurative monumental sculpture on the outside of churches appears here some centuries before it is seen in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Atroshenko and Judith Collins cover the Eastern influences on Romanesque art in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration Period through Christianization==
{{Main|Migration Period art}}
[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder-clasp from [[Sutton Hoo]], Anglo-Saxon, c. 620. Interlaced biting snakes and confronted [[boar]]s (end sections) are depicted entirely schematically.]]

Migration Period art describes the art of the "[[barbarian]]" Germanic and Eastern-European peoples who were on the move, and then settling within the former Roman Empire, during the [[Völkerwanderung|Migration Period]] from about 300-700; the blanket term covers a wide range of ethnic or regional styles including early [[Anglo-Saxon art]], [[Visigothic art]], [[Norse art]], and [[Merovingian art]], all of which made use of the [[animal style]] as well as geometric motifs derived from classical art.  By this period the animal style had reached a much more abstracted form than in earlier [[Scythian art]] or [[La Tène style]].  Most artworks were small and portable and those surviving are mostly jewellery and metalwork, with the art expressed in geometric or schematic designs, often beautifully conceived and made, with few human figures and no attempt at realism.  The early Anglo-Saxon [[grave good]]s from [[Sutton Hoo]] are among the best examples.

As the "barbarian" peoples were [[Christianization|Christianized]], these influences interacted with the post-classical Mediterranean Christian artistic tradition, and new forms like the [[illuminated manuscript]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 8 &amp; 9}}; {{Harvnb|Wilson|1984|pp=16–27}} on early Anglo-Saxon art.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed [[coin]]s, which attempted to emulate [[Roman provincial coins]] and [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine]] types.  Early coinage like the [[sceat]] shows designers completely unused to depicting a head in profile grappling with the problem in a variety of different ways.

As for larger works, there are references to Anglo-Saxon wooden pagan statues, all now lost, and in Norse art the tradition of carved [[runestone]]s was maintained after their conversion to Christianity. The Celtic [[Picts]] of Scotland also [[Pictish stones|carved stones]] before and after conversion, and the distinctive Anglo-Saxon and Irish tradition of [[High cross|large outdoor carved crosses]] may reflect earlier pagan works.  [[Viking art]] from later centuries in [[Scandinavia]] and parts of the British Isles includes work from both pagan and Christian backgrounds, and was one of the last flowerings of this broad group of styles.

==Insular art==
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|[[Book of Lindisfarne]], [[Northumbria]], c. 715; decoration invades the text of the beginning of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]:"Liber generationis Jesu Christi filii David, filii Abraham".]]

Insular art refers to the distinct style found in Ireland and Britain from about the 7th century, to about the 10th century, lasting later in Ireland, and parts of Scotland.  The style saw a fusion between the traditions of [[Celtic art]], the Germanic [[Migration period art]] of the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxons]] and the Christian forms of the book, [[high cross]]es and liturgical metalwork.

Extremely detailed geometric, [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]], and stylised animal decoration, with forms derived from secular metalwork like [[brooch]]es, spread boldly across manuscripts, usually [[gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], with whole [[carpet page]]s devoted to such designs, and the development of the large decorated and [[historiated initial]].  There were very few human figures—most often these were [[Evangelist portrait]]s—and these were crude, even when closely following Late Antique models.

The insular manuscript style was transmitted to the continent by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]], and its anti-classical energy was extremely important in the formation of later medieval styles.  In most Late Antique manuscripts text and decoration were kept clearly apart, though some initials began to be enlarged and elaborated, but major insular manuscripts sometimes take a whole page for a single initial or the first few words (see illustration) at beginnings of gospels or other sections in a book.  Allowing decoration a "right to roam" was to be very influential on Romanesque and Gothic art in all media.

The buildings of the monasteries for which the insular gospel books were made were then small and could fairly be called primitive, especially in Ireland.  There increasingly were other decorations to churches, where possible in precious metals, and a handful of these survive, like the [[Ardagh Chalice]], together with a larger number of extremely ornate and finely made pieces of secular high-status jewellery, the [[Celtic brooch]]es probably worn mainly by men, of which the [[Tara Brooch]] is the most spectacular.

"Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The "most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles", it continued until as late as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodwell|1993|pp=74(quote)–75}}, and see index.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of Islamic art==

{{main|Islamic influences on Western art}}
[[Islamic art]] during the Middle Ages falls outside the scope of this article, but it was widely imported and admired by European elites, and its influence needs mention.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 324; Mack, Chapter 1, and passim throughout; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sumay/hd_sumay.htm The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1031), Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline] Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen.  [[Islamic glass|Glass production]], for example, remained a [[Jewish]] speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in [[Coptic art|Coptic Egypt]] continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe.  There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards.  Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=256–262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted [[tile]]s, from as early as 862-3 (at the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] of [[Kairouan]] in modern [[Tunisia]]), which also spread to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[John Ruskin]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]] contains "three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world.&amp;nbsp;... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, paras 25 and 29]; discussed pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56 here [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzI3Pf0TSn4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Ruskin+Orientalism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TF5qlcqm2M&amp;sig=PwSUx7Ghq5kozj-Y7AIWLOxPlk8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3AqjTfWYOpG4hAfP2tDWCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruskin%20Orientalism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Islamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the [[Balkans]], all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian [[Crusade]]rs equally ruled Islamic populations. [[Crusader art]] is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the [[Mozarabic art]] of Christians in [[Al Andaluz]] seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at [[Moissac]] in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the [[lintel]] above, and also in having ''Christ in Majesty'' surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their [[Divan (furniture)|diwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=206–209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calligraphy]], ornament and the [[decorative arts]] generally were more important than in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dalu &amp; Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 9, 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pre-Romanesque'' is a term for architecture and to some extent pictorial and portable art found initially in Southern Europe (Spain, Italy and Southern France) between the Late Antique period to the start of the Romanesque period in the 11th century.  Northern European art gradually forms part of the movement after [[Christianization]] as it assimilates post-classical styles.  The [[Carolingian art]] of the [[Frankish Empire]], especially modern France and Germany, from roughly 780-900 takes its name from [[Charlemagne]] and is an art of the court circle and a few monastic centres under Imperial patronage, that consciously sought to revive "Roman" styles and standards as befitted the new [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire of the West]].  Some centres of Carolingian production also pioneered expressive styles in works like the [[Utrecht Psalter]] and [[Ebbo Gospels]].  Christian [[monumental sculpture]] is recorded for the first time, and depiction of the human figure in narrative scenes became confident for the first time in Northern art.  [[Carolingian architecture]] produced larger buildings than had been seen since Roman times, and the [[westwork]] and other innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinks|1974|loc=Parts II &amp; III}}; {{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 11 &amp; 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the dynasty there was a hiatus before a new dynasty brought a revival in Germany with [[Ottonian art]], again centred on the court and monasteries, with art that moved towards great expressiveness through simple forms that achieve monumentality even in small works like [[ivory]] [[relief]]s and [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|manuscript miniatures]], above all those of the [[Reichenau School]], such as the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] (1002–1012).  Later [[Anglo-Saxon art]] in England, from about 900, was expressive in a very different way, with agitated figures and even drapery perhaps best shown in the many pen drawings in manuscripts.  The [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] of Christian Spain had strong Islamic influence, and a complete lack of interest in realism in its brilliantly coloured miniatures, where figures are presented as entirely flat patterns.  Both of these were to influence the formation in France of the Romanesque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=75–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanesque art==
{{Main|Romanesque art}}
[[File:Saint-Julien 03.jpg|thumb|[[Tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]] at [[Saint-Julien-de-Jonzy]], mid-12th century. ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' above, the ''[[Last Supper in Christian art|Last Supper]]'' below.]]

Romanesque art developed in the period between about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century, in conjunction with the rise of monasticism in Western Europe. The style developed initially in France, but spread to Christian Spain, England, Flanders, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere to become the first medieval style found all over Europe, though with regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;A complicated subject, covered in Dodwell (1993), 175, 223, 258 among many other passages.&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of the style coincided with a great increase in church-building, and in the size of [[cathedral]]s and larger churches; many of these were rebuilt in subsequent periods, but often reached roughly their present size in the Romanesque period.  [[Romanesque architecture]] is dominated by thick walls, massive structures conceived as a single organic form, with [[vault (architecture)|vault]]ed roofs and round-headed windows and arches.

Figurative sculpture, originally colourfully painted, plays an integral and important part in these buildings, in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns, as well as around impressive [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], usually centred on a [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the main doors, as at [[Vézelay Abbey]] and [[Autun Cathedral]].  Reliefs are much more common than free-standing statues in stone, but Romanesque relief became much higher, with some elements fully detached from the wall behind.  Large carvings also became important, especially painted wooden [[crucifix]]es like the [[Gero Cross]] from the very start of the period, and figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].  Royalty and the higher clergy began to commission life-size effigies for [[tomb monument]]s.   Some churches had massive pairs of [[bronze]] doors decorated with narrative relief panels, like the [[Gniezno Doors]] or those at [[Hildesheim]], "the first decorated bronze doors cast in one piece in the West since Roman times", and arguably the finest before the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=145–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most churches were extensively frescoed; a typical scheme had ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' at the east (altar) end, a ''[[Last Judgement]]'' at the west end over the doors, and scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' facing [[typology (theology)|typologically]] matching [[Old Testament]] scenes on the [[nave]] walls.  The "greatest surviving monument of Romanesque wall painting", much reduced from what was originally there, is in the [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]] near [[Poitiers]], where the rounded [[barrel vault]] of the [[nave]], the [[crypt]], [[portico]] and other areas retain most of their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|pp=190(quote)–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent cycle in [[Sant'Angelo in Formis]] at [[Capua]] in southern Italy by Italian painters trained by Greeks illustrates the continuing predominance of Byzantine style in much of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 167-169&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer.jpg|thumb|left|French [[historiated initial]] with men slaying a monster, from a theological manuscript.  1110–1115]]

Romanesque sculpture and painting is often extremely vigorous and expressive, and very inventive in terms of [[iconography]]—the subjects chosen and their treatment.  Though many features absorbed from classical art form part of the Romanesque style, Romanesque artists rarely intended to achieve any sort of classical effect, except perhaps in [[Mosan art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=277 &amp; 284–288}}. {{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|p=149}}, says the bronze column at Hildesheim of c. 1020 "cannot be said to be Romanesque&amp;nbsp;... It stands apart as a curious Ottonian pastiche of a Roman monument&amp;nbsp;... never to be repeated"&lt;/ref&gt;  As art became seen by a wider section of the population, and because of challenges from new [[heresies]], art became more didactic, and the local church the "[[Poor Man's Bible]]".  At the same time grotesque beasts and monsters, and fights with or between them, were popular themes, to which religious meanings might be loosely attached, although this did not impress St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who famously denounced such distractions in monasteries:&lt;blockquote&gt;But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness?  Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  He might well have known the miniature at left, which was produced at [[Cîteaux Abbey]] before the young Bernard was transferred from there in 1115.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 212–214. The MS is the [[Dijon]] ''[[Moralia in Job]]'' of [[Gregory the Great]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period [[typology (theology)|typology]] became the dominant approach in theological literature and art to interpreting the bible, with [[Old Testament]] incidents seen as pre-figurations of aspects of the life of Christ, and shown paired with their corresponding New Testament episode.  Often the iconography of the New Testament scene was based on traditions and models originating in Late Antiquity, but the iconography of the Old Testament episode had to be invented in this period, for lack of precedents.  New themes such as the [[Tree of Jesse]] were devised, and representations of [[God the Father]] became more acceptable.  The vast majority of surviving art is religious. [[Mosan art]] was an especially refined regional style, with much superb metalwork surviving, often combined with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and elements of classicism rare in Romanesque art, as in the [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]], or the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] at [[Cologne]], one of a number of surviving works by [[Nicholas of Verdun]], whose services were sought across north-western Europe.

[[Stained glass]] became a significant art-form in the period, though little Romanesque glass survives.  In illuminated manuscripts the bible became a new focus of intensive decoration, with the [[psalter]] also remaining important.  The strong emphasis on the suffering of Christ and other sacred figures entered Western art in this period, a feature that strongly distinguishes it from both Byzantine and classical art for the remainder of the Middle Ages and beyond.  The Gero Cross of 965-970, at the cusp of Ottonian and Romanesque art, has been called the first work to exhibit this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the Romanesque period saw the start of the greatly increased emphasis on the [[Virgin Mary]] in theology, literature and so also art that was to reach its full extent in the Gothic period.

==Gothic art==
{{Main|Gothic art}}
[[File:Chartres cathedral 023 martyrs S TTaylor.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chartres cathedral]] c. 1220; the best High Gothic sculpture had largely rediscovered the art of naturalistic figure representation.]]
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with the [[Gothic architecture]] which developed in France from about 1137 with the rebuilding of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey Church of St Denis]].  As with Romanesque architecture, this included [[Gothic sculpture|sculpture]] as an integral part of the style, with even larger [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] and other figures on the [[facade]]s of churches the location of the most important sculpture, until the late period, when large carved [[altarpiece]]s and [[reredos]], usually in painted and gilded wood, became an important focus in many churches.  [[Gothic painting]] did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style.  A [[Gothic sculpture|Gothic style in sculpture]] originates in France around 1144  and spread throughout Europe, becoming by the 13th century the international style, replacing Romanesque, though in sculpture and painting the transition was not as sharp as in architecture.

The majority of Romanesque cathedrals and large churches were replaced by Gothic buildings, at least in those places benefiting from the economic growth of the period—Romanesque architecture is now best seen in areas that were subsequently relatively depressed, like many  southern regions of France and Italy, or northern Spain.  The new architecture allowed for much larger windows, and stained glass of a quality never excelled is perhaps the type of art most associated in the popular mind with the Gothic, although churches with nearly all their original glass, like the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, are extremely rare anywhere, and unknown in Britain.

Most Gothic wall-paintings have also disappeared; these remained very common, though in parish churches often rather crudely executed.  Secular buildings also often had wall-paintings, although royalty preferred the much more expensive tapestries, which were carried along as they travelled between their many palaces and castles, or taken with them on military campaigns—the finest collection of late-medieval textile art comes from the Swiss booty at the [[Battle of Nancy]], when they defeated and killed [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], and captured all his baggage train.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Historical Museum of Bern]] has many of the best pieces, and these and others were shown in an exhibition on Philip in Bern, Bruges and Vienna in 2008-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duccio maesta1021.jpg|thumb|The central panel of [[Duccio]]'s huge [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]] [[altarpiece]] for [[Siena Cathedral]].]]
As mentioned in the previous section, the Gothic period coincided with a greatly increased emphasis on the Virgin Mary, and it was in this period that the [[Virgin and Child]] became such a hallmark of Catholic art.  Saints were also portrayed far more often, and many of the range of [[Saint symbolism|attributes]] developed to identify them visually for a still largely illiterate public first appeared.

During this period [[panel painting]] for altarpieces, often [[polyptych]]es and smaller works became newly important.  Previously [[icon]]s on panels had been much more common in Byzantine art than in the West, although many now lost panel paintings made in the West are documented from much earlier periods, and initially Western painters on panel were very largely under the sway of Byzantine models, especially in Italy, from where most early Western panel paintings come.  The process of establishing a distinct Western style was begun by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio]], and completed by [[Giotto]], who is traditionally regarded as the starting point for the development of Renaissance painting.  Most panel painting remained more conservative than miniature painting however, partly because it was seen by a wide public.

[[International Gothic]] describes courtly Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art begins to merge into the [[Renaissance art]] that had begun to form itself in Italy during the [[Trecento]], with a return to classical principles of composition and realism, with the sculptor [[Nicola Pisano]] and the painter [[Giotto]] as especially formative figures.  The [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] is one of the best known works of International Gothic.  The transition to the Renaissance occurred at different times in different places - [[Early Netherlandish painting]] is poised between the two, as is the Italian painter [[Pisanello]]. Outside Italy Renaissance styles appeared in some works in courts and some wealthy cities while other works, and all work beyond these centres of innovation, continued late Gothic styles for a period of some decades.  The [[Protestant Reformation]] often provided an end point for the Gothic tradition in areas that went Protestant, as it was associated with Catholicism.

The invention of a comprehensive mathematically based system of [[linear perspective]] is a defining achievement of the early-15th-century [[Italian Renaissance]] in [[Florence]], but Gothic painting had already made great progress in the naturalistic depiction of distance and volume, though it did not usually regard them as essential features of a work if other aims conflicted with them, and late Gothic sculpture was increasingly naturalistic. In the mid-15th century Burgundian miniature (right) the artist seems keen to show his skill at representing buildings and blocks of stone obliquely, and managing scenes at different distances.  But his general attempt to reduce the size of more distant elements is unsystematic. Sections of the composition are at a similar scale, with relative distance shown by overlapping, [[foreshortening]], and further objects being higher than nearer ones, though the workmen at left do show finer adjustment of size. But this is abandoned on the right where the most important figure is much larger than the mason.
[[File:Totentanz blockbook q.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Death comes for the Cardinal'', from a printed [[blockbook]] with hand colour, c. 1455–58, an early example of the [[Dance of Death]].]]

The end of the period includes new media such as [[old master print|prints]]; along with small panel paintings these were frequently used for the emotive [[andachtsbilder]] ("devotional images") influenced by new religious trends of the period.  These were images of moments detached from the narrative of the [[Passion of Christ]] designed for meditation on his sufferings, or those of the Virgin: the [[Man of Sorrows]], [[Pietà]], [[Veil of Veronica]] or [[Arma Christi]]. The trauma of the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century was at least partly responsible for the popularity of themes such as the ''[[Dance of Death]]'' and ''[[Memento mori]]''.  In the cheap [[blockbook]]s with text (often in the [[vernacular]]) and images cut in a single [[woodcut]], works such as that illustrated (left), the ''[[Ars Moriendi]]'' (''Art of Dying'') and typological verse summaries of the bible like the ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' (''Mirror of Human Salvation'') were the most popular.

[[Renaissance Humanism]] and the rise of a wealthy urban middle class, led by merchants, began to transform the old social context of art, with the revival of realistic portraiture and the appearance of printmaking and the [[self-portrait]], together with the decline of forms like stained glass and the illuminated manuscript.  [[Donor portrait]]s, in the Early Medieval period largely the preserve of popes, kings and abbots, now showed businessmen and their families, and churches were becoming crowded with the [[tomb monument]]s of the well-off.

The typical exuberantly decorated margins descend from [[insular art]], and are unlike anything in the Byzantine tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plummer|1964|loc=plates 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[book of hours]], a type of manuscript normally owned by laymen, or even more often, laywomen, became the type of manuscript most often heavily illustrated from the 14th century onwards, and also by this period, the lead in producing miniatures had passed to lay artists, also very often women.  In the most important centres of illumination, Paris and in the 15th century the cities of [[Flanders]], there were large workshops, exporting to other parts of Europe.  Other forms of art, such as small ivory reliefs, stained glass, tapestries and [[Nottingham alabaster]]s (cheap carved panels for altarpieces) were produced in similar conditions, and artists and craftsmen in cities were usually covered by the [[guild]] system—the [[goldsmith]]'s guild was typically among the richest in a city, and painters were members of a special [[Guild of St Luke]] in many places.

Secular works, often using subjects concerned with [[courtly love]] or [[chivalry|knightly heroism]], were produced as illuminated manuscripts, carved ivory mirror-cases, tapestries and elaborate gold table centrepieces like [[Nef (metalwork)|nefs]].  It begins to be possible to distinguish much greater numbers of individual artists, some of whom had international reputations.  Art collectors begin to appear, of manuscripts among the great nobles, like [[John, Duke of Berry]] (1340–1416) and of prints and other works among those with moderate wealth.  In the wealthier areas tiny cheap religious [[woodcut]]s brought art in an approximation of the latest style even into the homes of peasants by the late 15th century.

==Subsequent reputation==
[[File:Siege castle love Louvre OA6933.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Assault on the Castle of Love'', attacked by [[knight]]s and defended by ladies, was a popular subject for Gothic ivory mirror-cases. Paris, 14th century.]]

Medieval art had little sense of its own art history, and this disinterest was continued in later periods.  The Renaissance generally dismissed it as a "barbarous" product of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", and the [[Gothic architecture#The term "Gothic"|term "Gothic"]] was invented as a deliberately pejorative one, first used by the painter [[Raphael]] in a letter of 1519 to characterise all that had come between the demise of Classical art and its supposed 'rebirth' in the [[Renaissance]]. The term was subsequently adopted and popularised in the mid 16th century by the Florentine artist and historian, [[Giorgio Vasari]], who used it to denigrate northern European architecture generally. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be collected by [[antiquarian]]s, or sit unregarded in monastic or royal libraries, but paintings were mostly of interest if they had historical associations with royalty or others.  The long period of mistreatment of the [[Westminster Retable]] by [[Westminster Abbey]] is an example; until the 19th century it was only regarded as a useful piece of timber.  But their large portrait of [[Richard II of England]] was well looked after, like another portrait of Richard, the [[Wilton Diptych]] (illustrated above).  As in the Middle Ages themselves, other objects have often survived mainly because they were considered to be [[relic]]s.

There was no equivalent for pictorial art of the "[[Gothic survival]]" found in architecture, once the style had finally died off in Germany, England and [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Gothic Revival]] long focused on [[Gothic Architecture]] rather than art.  The understanding of the succession of styles was still very weak, as suggested by the title of [[Thomas Rickman]]'s pioneering book on English architecture: ''An Attempt to discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' (1817).  This began to change with a vengeance by the mid-19th century, as appreciation of medieval sculpture and its painting, known as Italian or Flemish "Primitives", became fashionable under the influence of writers including [[John Ruskin]], [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], and [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]], as well as the romantic [[medievalism]] of literary works like Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1819) and [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1831).  Early collectors of the "Primitives", then still relatively cheap, included [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].
[[File:Design for the Summer Smoking Room at Cardiff Castle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William Burges]]' design for the Summer Smoking Room at [[Cardiff Castle]], 1860s.]]

Among artists the German [[Nazarene movement]] from 1809 and English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] from 1848 both rejected the values of at least the later Renaissance, but in practice, and despite sometimes depicting medieval scenes, their work draws its influences mostly from the [[Early Renaissance]] rather than the Gothic or earlier periods - the early graphic work of [[John Millais]] being something of an exception.&lt;ref&gt;In works like [http://www.preraphaelites.org/the-collection/1906P646/the-death-of-romeo-and-juliet-compositional-study/ this], stylistically very different from the finished painting.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Morris]], also a discriminating collector of medieval art, absorbed medieval style more thoroughly into his work, as did [[William Burges]].[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Joseph's Dream'' from the Byzantinesque [[fresco]]s at [[Castelseprio]], the subject of much controversy since their discovery in 1944, and now generally dated to the 10th century.]]By the later 19th century many book-illustrators and producers of decorative art of various kinds had learned to use medieval styles successfully from the new museums like the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] set up for this purpose.  At the same time the new academic field of [[art history]], dominated by Germany and France, concentrated heavily on medieval art and was soon very productive in cataloguing and dating the surviving works, and analysing the development of medieval styles and iconography; though the Late Antique and pre-Carolingian period remained a less explored "no-man's land" until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=1(quote)–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Theodor Kugler]] was the first to name and describe Carolingian art in 1837; like many art historians of the period he sought to find and promote the national spirit of his own nation in art history, a search begun by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century.  Kugler's pupil, the great Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], though he could not be called a specialist in medieval art, was an important figure in developing the understanding of it.  Medieval art was now heavily collected, both by museums and private collectors like [[George Salting]], the [[Rothschild family]] and [[John Pierpont Morgan]].

After the decline of the [[Gothic Revival]], and the [[Celtic Revival]] use of Insular styles, the anti-realist and expressive elements of medieval art have still proved an inspiration for many modern artists.

German-speaking art historians continued to dominate medieval art history, despite figures like [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954) and [[Henri Focillon]] (1881–1943), until the Nazi period, when a large number of important figures emigrated, mostly to Britain or America, where the academic study of art history was still developing.  These included the elderly [[Adolph Goldschmidt]] and younger figures including [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], [[Ernst Kitzinger]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Kurt Weitzmann]], [[Richard Krautheimer]] and many others.  [[Meyer Schapiro]] had immigrated as a child in 1907.

== Prejudice ==
During the Middle Ages some Christian art was used as a way to express prejudices and commonly held negative views that were held against other religions and groups of people.

=== Jewish portrayals in medieval Christian art ===
[[File:Ecclesia et synagoga.jpg|thumb|Ecclesia and Sinagoga at the&amp;nbsp;Notre Dame Cathedral]]

In Medieval Europe between the 5th and 15th century many Christians viewed Jews as enemies and outsiders due to a variety of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jewm/hd_jewm.htm|title=Jews and the Arts in Medieval Europe|last=Holcomb|first=Barbara Drake|last2=Holcomb|first2=Melanie|date=June 2008|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tended to hate them for being both culturally and religiously different as well as because of religious teachings that held negative views of Jewish people such as portrayals of the Antichrist as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdtSQ9v9T3IC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;lpg=PA383&amp;dq=Lipton+%22jewish+hat%22+enemies+of+Christ&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EqtM2kWlYN&amp;sig=2O0Qt5N7Wf9Ka_216Mh4F93xodc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hpal5t_XAhVGqlQKHYCABtMQ6AEIQjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lipton%20%22jewish%20hat%22%20enemies%20of%20Christ&amp;f=false|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous|last=Mittman|first=Asa Simon|last2=Dendle|first2=Peter J.|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472418012|location=|pages=383|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Jewish people's economic position as moneylenders, coupled with royal protections that were given to them,{{Example needed|date=June 2018}} created a strained relationship between Jews and Christians. This strain manifested itself in several ways, one of which was through the creation of [[Medieval antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Anti-Judaism in early Christianity|anti-Judaism]] art and propaganda that served the purpose of discrediting both Jews and their religious beliefs as well as spreading these beliefs even further into society.  Late medieval images of [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]] represented the Christian doctrine of [[Supersessionism|supercessionism]], whereby the Christian [[New Covenant]] had replaced the Jewish [[Mosaic covenant]]&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christine, "The Jewish Mother-in-law; Synagoga and the ''Man of Law's Tale''", pp. 8-11, in Delany, Sheila (ed), ''Chaucer and the Jews : Sources, Contexts, Meanings'', 2002, Routledge, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T6YMJAuDAdEC&amp;pg=PA8 google books], {{ISBN|0-415-93882-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sara Lipton has argued that some portrayals, such as depictions of Jewish blindness in the presence of Jesus, were meant to serve as a form of self-reflection rather than be explicitly anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9f6gBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq|title=Dark Mirror: The Medieval Origins of Anti-Jewish Iconography|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2014-11-04|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780805079104|location=|pages=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2013 book ''Saracens, Demons, and Jews'', Debra Higgs Strickland argues that negative portrayals of Jews in medieval art can be divided into three categories: art that focused on physical descriptions, art that featured signs of damnation, and images that depicted Jews as monsters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Physical depictions of Jewish people in medieval Christian art were often men with pointed [[Jewish hat]]s and long beards, which was done as a derogatory symbol and to separate Jews from Christians in a clear manner. This portrayal would grow more virulent over time, however Jewish women lacked similar distinctive physical descriptions in high medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2008|title=Where Are the Gothic Jewish Women?

'''''Metropolis Symphony''''' for Orchestra (1988–93) by American composer [[Michael Daugherty]] is a five-movement [[symphony]] inspired by [[Superman]] comics. The entire piece was created over the span of five years with separate commissions for each movement. Individual movements may be performed separately; however, it is preferred that the 41 minute symphony be performed in its entirety. [[Metropolis (comics)|''Metropolis'']] ''Symphony'' was premiered by the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], [[David Zinman]] conducting, in January 1994, at the [[Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall|Meyerhoff Concert Hall]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peermusicclassical.com/catalog/catalog_detail.cfm?catalog_id=974&amp;composer_ID=8&amp;ensemble_type_id=&amp;title=&amp;ensemble_ID=999&amp;ensemble_detail_ID=&amp;Theme_id=&amp;position=10&amp;totalcount=21 Metropolis Symphony at Peermusic Classical]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new recording conducted by [[Giancarlo Guerrero]] and performed by the [[Nashville Symphony Orchestra]] was nominated in six categories for [[Grammy Awards of 2011]]. It won in the [[Best Orchestral Performance]], [[Best Engineered Album, Classical]] and [[Best Classical Contemporary Composition]] categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/ Grammy Award Nominees and Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

POBA is a non-profit, online arts community, launched in July, 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodprogressive.com/poba-virtual-cultural-arts-center/ |title=POBA Virtual Cultural Arts Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; by The James Kirk Bernard Foundation (named after a young artist who died in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/independentpress/index.ssf/2010/02/obituary_james_kirk_bernard_di.html |title=Obituaries: James Kirk Bernard dies at 22, lived his first 15 years in Summit|work=NJ.com| date=February 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
POBA's mission is to preserve, display, and provide resources for research, archiving, and appraising the creative legacies of 20th and 21st century artists who either died without their legacy being fully recognized, were not recognized for a specific medium, or whose work is not readily accessible elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/your-money/the-weighty-responsibility-of-inheriting-a-collection.html|title=The Weighty Responsibility of Inheriting a Collection, The New York Times (September 2014)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Minsky, Digital Life after Death, "Provincetown Banner" (Thursday, Nov. 6, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

POBA offers membership to anyone who owns the rights to a deceased artist's legacy. Members can create portfolios on behalf of that artist to show the works in the appropriate digital format, for public display and private storage.

The name "POBA" derives from the Hindi word "[[phowa]]", which means the transformation of consciousness at death.

==Partners==

POBA has partnered with such leading institutions and galleries as the [[American Ballet Theatre]] and The Berta Walker Gallery, and has partnerships with the [[Provincetown Art Association and Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/72371/Online-exhibitions-spotlight-groundbreaking-artists-from-America-s-oldest-active-arts-colony |title=Online exhibitions spotlight groundbreaking artists from America's oldest active arts colony (January 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paddle8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanphotomag.com/photo-gallery/2014/12/newly-unearthed-collection-photos-20th-century-masters-to-be-auctioned-online?page=2 |title=Auction is the first in a new series launched by Paddle8 in partnership with POBA (December, 2014)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, POBA launched Art Lives, an online project to digitize, curate, and display the work of artists of all genres lost to [[AIDS]] in the 1970s and 1980s, partnering with DIFFA (Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS), LifeBeat (Music Fights AIDS) and Visual AIDS for the initial portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-incredible-artists-who-lost-their-lives-to-hiv_us_565caea7e4b079b2818b45e2 |title=7 Incredible Artists Who Lost Their Lives To HIV (December, 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured artists include [[Sylvester (singer)]], [[Mel Cheren]], artist and creator of [[West End Records]], and [[Patrick Kelly (fashion designer)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/12/01/poba_s_art_lives_preserves_the_work_of_artists_lost_to_hiv_aids.html |title=The Work of Artists Lost to AIDS Lives On (December, 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre-Antoine Poiteau''' (23 March 1766 [[Âmbleny]] – 27 February 1854) was a French [[botanist]], [[gardener]] and botanical artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://ctgpublishing.com/pierre-antoine-poiteau-biography/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

He was born in [[Ambleny]], [[France]].  After having worked in kitchen gardens and for the Parisian market gardeners, he was appointed by [[André Thouin]] (1746-1824) ''garçon jardinier'' in 1790 at the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]] of [[Paris]].  There he studied the [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' ''Systema vegetabilium'' and the art of painting with the artist of the museum [[Gérard van Spaendonck]] (1746-1822) but his main influence is [[Redouté]] (1759-1840). Thouin named him, two years later, head of the Botanical school of Paris, but in 1793, Daubenton chose him to establish a botanic school and garden in Bergerac. This project failed and in 1796 Thouin offered Poiteau to go to [[Santo Domingo]]. He was arrested as soon as he landed because he did not have official papers to justify his presence. Soon afterwards he was in [[Haiti]], at the head of the new botanical garden of Cape. Receiving no wages, he had to join the administration as an assistant to Hédouville and Roume, the governors of the island. In 1802, he brought back to France six hundred packets of seeds and 1,200 species, all named and classified by him. Among them were 97 species of mushrooms and 30 species of lichens. He published, in Paris in 1808 with [[Pierre Jean François Turpin]] (1775-1840) whom he met in Haiti, ''Flora Parisiensis secundum systema sexuale deposita et plantarum circa Lutetiam sponte nascentium descriptiones, icones....''

After some years of free literary activities, he was appointed in 1815 head of the Royal tree nursery of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. In 1816, he published a description of the plants cultivated in the botanical garden of the School of medicine of Paris. Two years later, with [[Antoine Risso]] (1777-1845), he published ''Histoire naturelle des orangers'' (Natural history of the orange trees).

In 1818, Poiteau went to [[French Guiana]] where he supervised the cultures of the plantations of the royal houses. Back in France in 1822, he was appointed head gardener of the castle of [[Fontainebleau]]. From 1829 to 1851 he directed the ''Revue horticole'' (Horticultural review). In 1835, with Pierre-Jean-François Turpin, he published a new edition of the ''Traité des arbres fruitiers'' (Treatise of the fruit trees) by [[Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] (1700-1782) and, in 1846, ''Pomologie française. Recueil des plus beaux fruits cultivés en France...'' (French pomology). In 1848 and 1853 the two volumes of his ''Cours d'horticulture'' (Lessons of horticulture) were published. A member of many scientific societies, Poiteau later became head of the museum of natural history, to which he offered all the animals and plants he had brought back from Guiana. Poiteau discovered numerous species of plants and animals, he even created some families (''cyclanthae'', for example). As a gardener and a pomologist, he much contributed to the amelioration of the edible fruits. As an artist, he is appreciated and his colored lithographs are sought-after by amateurs. On this ground, he is often compared to [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]].
He died in [[Paris]].

[[Image:Hurt Report cover page.png|220px|thumb|Example of a front page of a report]]
A '''report''' or '''account''' is an [[Information technology|informational]] work, such as writing, speech, television or film, made with the intention of relaying information or recounting events in a presentable form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/report|title=Report - definition of report by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report is made with the specific intention of relaying information or recounting certain events in a way that is concise, factual and relevant to the audience at hand. Reports may be conveyed through a written medium, speech, television, or film. In professional spheres, reports are a common and  vital communication tool. Additionally, reports may be official or unofficial, and can be listed publicly or only available privately depending on the specific scenario. The audience for a report can vary dramatically, from an elementary school classroom to a boardroom on [[Wall Street]].

== Usage ==
Reports fill a vast array of informational needs for a spectrum of audiences. They may be used to keep track of information, evaluate a strategy, or make decisions. Written reports are documents which present focused and salient content, generally to a specific audience. A type of an official report would be a police report, which could have legally binding consequences. Other types of reports, such as ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', inform the public about the quality of products available on the market. Reports are used in government, business, education, science, and other fields, often to display the results of an experiment, investigation or inquiry.

== Attributes ==
One of the most common formats for presenting reports is [[IMRAD]]—introduction, methods, results, and discussion. This structure, standard for the genre, mirrors traditional publication of scientific research and summons the ethos and credibility of that discipline. Reports are not required to follow this pattern and may use alternative methods such as the problem-solution format, wherein the author first lists an issue and then details what must be done to fix the problem. Transparency and a focus on quality are keys to writing a useful report. Accuracy is also important. Faulty numbers in a financial report could lead to disastrous consequences.

== Standard Elements ==
Reports use features such as tables, graphics, images, voice, or specialized vocabulary in order to persuade a specific audience to undertake an action or inform the reader of the subject at hand. Some common elements of written reports include headings to indicate topics and help the reader locate relevant information quickly, and visual elements such as charts, tables and figures, which are useful for breaking up large sections of text and making complex issues more accessible. Lengthy written reports will almost always contain a table of contents, appendices, footnotes, and references. A bibliography or list of references will appear at the end of any credible report and citations are often included within the text itself. Complex terms are explained within the body of the report or listed as footnotes in order to make the report easier to follow. A short summary of the report's contents, called an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], may appear in the beginning so that the audience knows what the report will cover. Online reports often contain hyperlinks to internal or external sources as well.

Verbal reports differ from written reports in the minutiae of their format, but they still educate or advocate for a course of action. Quality reports will be well researched and the speaker will list their sources if at all possible.

== Types ==
Some examples of reports are:

A '''serdab''' ({{lang-fa|سرداب|d=Sardāb}}), literally meaning "cold water", which became a loanword in Arabic for 'cellar') is an [[ancient Egyptian tomb]] structure that served as a chamber for the [[Ka statue]] of a deceased individual. Used during the [[Old Kingdom]], the serdab was a sealed chamber with a small slit or hole to allow the soul of the deceased to move about freely. These holes  also let in the smells of the offerings presented to the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard | first = KA | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | location = NY, NY | year = 1999|isbn=0-415-18589-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word serdab is also used for a type of undecorated chamber found in many pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Billing, Egyptens pyramider, 2009. Page 236&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of inscriptions, it has been impossible to determine the ritual function of this chamber, but many egyptologists view it as a storage space, akin with the underground storehouses in private and royal tombs of the second dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Ägypten Die Welt der Pharaonen, 1998. Pages 68&lt;/ref&gt; It is easiest recognized by its position in the east end of the pyramid's internal chamber system and the three niches in its outer wall.
The earliest serdab of this type is found in the [[pyramid of Menkaure]], but it was during the reign of [[Djedkare Isesi]] that it became a part of the standard pyramid layout. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Silver-gilt''' or '''gilded/gilt silver''', sometimes known in American English by the French term '''vermeil''', is [[silver]] (either pure or [[sterling silver|sterling]]) which has been [[gilding|gilded]] with [[gold]]. Most large objects made in [[goldsmithing]] that appear to be gold are actually silver-gilt; for example most sporting trophies (including medals such as the [[gold medal]]s awarded in all [[Olympic Games]] after 1912&lt;ref&gt;[http://olympic-museum.de/w_medals/wmed1912.htm German Olympic museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514075025/http://olympic-museum.de/w_medals/wmed1912.htm |date=2009-05-14 }} and [http://images.beijing2008.cn/69/81/Img211998169.pdf Beijing 2008 Appendix 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612081248/http://images.beijing2008.cn/69/81/Img211998169.pdf |date=2009-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and many crown jewels are silver-gilt objects.  Apart from the raw materials being much less expensive to acquire than solid gold of any [[Fineness#Karat|karat]], large silver-gilt objects are also noticeably lighter if lifted, as well as more durable (gold is about as heavy as [[lead]] and is highly malleable and easily scratched). Compared to objects made of ungilded sterling silver which have intricate detail like [[monstrance]]s, gilding, which limits oxidation of the underlying metals, greatly reduces the need for cleaning and polishing, and so reduces the risk of damage to them.  The "gold" threads used in [[Goldwork (embroidery)|embroidered goldwork]] are normally also silver-gilt.

Silver-gilt objects have been made since ancient times across [[Eurasia]], using a variety of gilding techniques, and a distinctive [[depletion gilding]] technique was developed by the [[Inca]]s in [[Pre-Columbian South America]].  "Overlaying" or folding or hammering on gold foil or [[gold leaf]] is mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] (Bk vi, 232),&lt;ref&gt;"And as when a man overlays silver with gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders" from [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136;query=card%3D%2368;layout=;loc=6.162 this translation]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fire-gilding]] with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] dates to at least the 4th century BC, and was the most common method until the [[Early Modern period]] at least, though dangerous for the workers&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 11&lt;/ref&gt; and often caused blindness among French artisans who refined the technique in the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Today [[electroplating]] is the most commonly used method: it involves no mercury and is therefore much safer.  [[Keum-boo]] is a special [[Koreans|Korean]] technique of silver-gilding, using depletion gilding.  In China [[gilt-bronze]], also known as ormolu, was more common.

Vermeil ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɜr|m|ɪ|l}} or {{IPAc-en|v|ər|ˈ|m|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|vɛʁˈmɛj|lang}}) is an alternative for the usual term silver-gilt.   It is a French word which came into use in the English language, mostly in America, in the 19th century, and is rare in [[British English]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd. Edition (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/23/5 16 CFR 23.5 - Misuse of the word "vermeil"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare for example the online collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], which describes over 800 objects as "silver-gilt" against a handful of pieces of jewellery incorporating "vermeil" [https://archive.is/20120804101147/http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?coll_keywords=Silver+gilt&amp;submit.x=9&amp;submit.y=9 Accessed July 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Vermeil" can also refer to gilt [[bronze]], an even less costly alternative construction material than silver.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Code of Federal Regulations 16, Part 23.5 defines ''vermeil'' thus: "An industry product may be described or marked as 'vermeil' if it consists of a base of sterling silver coated or plated on all significant surfaces with gold or gold alloy of not less than 10-[[Fineness#Karat|karat]] fineness, that is of substantial thickness and a minimum thickness throughout equivalent to two and one half ({{frac|2|1|2}}) [[micrometre|microns]] (or approximately {{frac|1|10000}} of an inch) of fine gold."&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=114709233647+1+1+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve US Code of Federal Regulations, 16CFR23.5, Revised January 1, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations in use==
[[File:Sassanid shield-boss by Nickmard Khoey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sassanid]] silver-gilt shield-boss, 7th century]]

Silver objects could be gilded at any point, not just when first made, and items regularly handled, such as [[toilet service]] sets for [[dressing-table]]s or tableware, often needed regilding after a few years, as the gold began to wear off.  In 18th century London two different silversmiths charged 3 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] per [[ounce]] of silver for an initial gilding, and 1 shilling and 9 [[penny|pence]] per ounce for regilding.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, 187&lt;/ref&gt; Often only the interior of cups was gilded, perhaps from concern at the chemical compounds used to clean tarnish from silver.  This is called [[parcel-gilt]].

Fully silver-gilt items are visually indistinguishable from gold, and were no doubt often thought to be solid gold.  When the [[English Commonwealth]] sold the [[Crown Jewels of England]] after the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] they were disappointed in the medieval "Queen Edith's Crowne, formerly thought to be of massy gold, but upon trial found to be of silver gilt", which was valued at only £16, compared to £1,110 for the "imperial crowne".&lt;ref&gt;Inventory&lt;/ref&gt;  The English [[Gothic Revival]] architect, Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] was concerned by the morality of this. Gilding of the interior only he accepted, but with all-over gilding "we ... reach the actual boundary of truth and falsehood; and I am convinced that if we adopt this custom we overstep it.... why make our gift look more costly than it is?  We increase its beauty, but it is at the sacrifice of truth."&lt;ref&gt;Scott, 249&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some Early Medieval silver-gilt [[Celtic brooch]]es had compartments, apparently for small lead weights to aid such deception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/silver_ring_brooch.aspx British Museum], mentioning two examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Singer-songwriters''' are [[musician]]s who [[Lyricist|write]], [[composer|compose]], and perform their own musical material, including [[lyrics]] and [[melody|melodies]].

The genre began with the [[folk music|folk]]-acoustic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkmusic.about.com/od/toptens/tp/Top10_SS.htm|title=Essential Folk Music Singer-Songwriters|work=[[The About Group]]|first=Kim|last=Ruehl|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer-songwriters often provide the sole [[accompaniment]] to an entire [[Musical composition|composition]] or song, typically using a guitar or piano.

== Definition and usage ==
"Singer-songwriter" is used to define [[popular music]] artists who write and perform their own material, which is often self-accompanied generally on acoustic guitar or piano.&lt;ref name="Shepherd" /&gt; Such an artist performs the roles of [[composer]], [[lyricist]], vocalist, sometimes instrumentalist, and often self-manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=vi|last=Rodgers|first=Jeffrey Pepper|title=The Complete Singer-Songwriter:A Troubadour's Guide to Writing, Performing, Recording &amp; Business|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|year=2003|isbn=0-87930-769-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[AllMusic]], singer-songwriters' lyrics are often personal but veiled by elaborate metaphors and vague imagery, and their creative concern is to place emphasis on the song rather than their performance of it. Most records by such artists have a similarly straightforward and spare sound that placed emphasis on the song itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/singer-songwriter-ma0000002855|title=singer-songwriter|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used to describe songwriters in the [[rock music|rock]], [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], and [[pop music]] genres including [[Henry Russell (musician)|Henry Russell]], [[Aristide Bruant]], [[Hank Williams]], and [[Buddy Holly]]. It came into popular usage in the 1960s onwards to describe songwriters who followed particular stylistic and thematic conventions, particularly lyrical introspection, confessional songwriting, mild musical arrangements, and an understated performing style.&lt;ref name="Shepherd"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJvzEzjahkQC&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor-last=Shepherd|editor-first=John|page=198|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume 11: Performance and Production|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]]|year=2003|isbn=0-8264-6322-3|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer Larry David Smith, because it merged the roles of composer, writer, and singer, the popularity of the singer-songwriter reintroduced the Medieval [[troubadour]] tradition of "songs with public personalities" after the [[Tin Pan Alley]] era in American popular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brackett|first=David|page=47|title=Dark Mirror: The Pathology of the Singer-Songwriter|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2008|isbn=0-275-99898-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Song topics include [[political protest]], as in the case of the [[Almanac Singers]], [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Woody Guthrie]].

== History ==
[[File:HankWilliams1951concert.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hank Williams]], 1951]]
The concept of a singer-songwriter can be traced to ancient [[bardic poetry|bardic]] oral tradition, which has existed in various forms throughout the world. Poems would be performed as chant or song, sometimes accompanied by a harp or other similar instrument. After the invention of printing, songs would be written and performed by ballad sellers. Usually these would be versions of existing tunes and lyrics, which were constantly evolving. This developed into the singer-songwriting traditions of folk culture.

Traveling performers existed throughout Europe. Thus, the folklorist [[Anatole Le Braz]] gives a detailed account of one ballad singer, Yann Ar Minouz, who wrote and performed songs traveling through Brittany in the late nineteenth century and selling printed versions.&lt;ref&gt;Anatole Le Braz, "The Pardon of the Singers", ''The Land of Pardons'', London, Methuen, 1926, pp. 45–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In large towns it was possible to make a living performing in public venues, and with the invention of phonographic recording, early singer-songwriters like [[Théodore Botrel]], [[George M. Cohan]] and [[Hank Williams]] became celebrities; radio further added to their public recognition and appeal.

During the period from the 1940s through the 1960s, sparked by the [[American folk music revival]], young performers inspired by traditional folk music and groups like the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[the Weavers]] began writing and performing their own original material and creating their own musical arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Ronald D.

The term "singer-songwriter" in North America can be traced back to singers who developed works in the blues and folk music style. Early to mid-20th century American singer-songwriters include [[Lead Belly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leadbelly.org/re-homepage.html |title=Leadbelly Foundation |publisher=Leadbelly.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123193411/http://www.leadbelly.org/re-homepage.html |archivedate=23 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/39/jimmie-rodgers-the-father-of-country-music |title=Jimmie Rodgers: The Father of Country Music &amp;#124; Mississippi History Now |publisher=Mshistory.k12.ms.us |date=1933-05-26 |accessdate=2010-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007161643/http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/39/jimmie-rodgers-the-father-of-country-music |archivedate=7 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;Dicaire, David.

The tradition of writing topical songs (songs regarding specific issues of the day, such as Lead Belly's "Jim Crow Blues" or Guthrie's "[[Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)]]") was established by this group of musicians. Singers like Seeger and Guthrie would attend rallies for labor unions, and so wrote many songs concerning the life of the working classes, and social protest; as did other folksingers like [[Josh White]], [[Cisco Houston]], [[Malvina Reynolds]], [[Earl Robinson]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[John Jacob Niles]], and [[Doc Watson]], while blues singers like Johnson and Hopkins wrote songs about their personal life experiences. This focus on social issues has greatly influenced the singer-songwriter genre. Additionally in the 1930s through the 1950s several jazz and blues singer-songwriters emerged like [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Harry Gibson]], and [[Nina Simone]], as well as in the [[rock n' roll]] genre from which emerged influential singer-songwriters [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ritchie Valens]], and [[Paul Anka]]. In the [[country music]] field, singer-songwriters like [[Hank Williams]], [[Patsy Cline]], [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[George Jones]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Billy Edd Wheeler]], and others emerged from the 1940s through the 1960s, often writing compelling songs about love relationships and other subjects.
[[File:James taylor publicity photo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Taylor]] in the early 1970s]]

The first popular recognition of the singer-songwriter in English-speaking North America and the United Kingdom occurred in the 1960s and early 1970s when a series of blues, folk and [[country music|country]]-influenced musicians rose to prominence and popularity. These singer-songwriters included [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[John Lennon]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Leonard Cohen]], and [[Joni Mitchell]]. Artists who had been primarily songwriters, notably [[Carole King]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], and [[Neil Diamond]], also began releasing work as performers. In contrast to the storytelling approach of most prior country and folk music, these performers typically wrote songs from a highly personal (often first-person), introspective point of view. The adjectives "confessional" and "sensitive" were often used (sometimes derisively) singer-songwriter style.

[[File:David Crosby in 1976.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Crosby]], (of [[the Byrds]] and [[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]]) is one of the singer-songwriters who crossed over into mainstream rock, seen here in 1976 backstage of the Frost Amphitheater, Stanford University.]]

In the [[rock band]] era, members were not technically singer-songwriters as solo acts. However, many were singer-songwriters who created songs with other band members. Examples include [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]], [[Elton John]] (with [[Bernie Taupin]]), [[Justin Hayward]], [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]], [[Robbie Robertson]], [[Ian Anderson]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[Peter Frampton]]; [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[Country Joe McDonald]], [[Barry Melton]]. Many others like [[Eric Clapton]] found success as singer-songwriters in their later careers.

The scene that had developed out of the [[American folk music revival]], pioneered by  [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Pete Seeger]] had grown to a major movement in the early 1960s, popularized by [[Joan Baez]] and her protégée, [[Bob Dylan]], who had started reaching a mainstream audience with his hit,  [[Blowin' in the Wind]]" (1963) bringing "[[protest song]]s" to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Perone, ''Music of the Counterculture Era American History Through Music'' (Westwood, CT: Greenwood, 2004), {{ISBN|0-313-32689-4}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; There were hints of cross-pollination, but rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres, often with different audiences.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002FolkRock&gt;{{harvnb |Bogdanov |Woodstra |Erlewine |2002 |pp=1308–09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early attempt at fusing elements of folk and rock was highlighted in the Animals "[[House of the Rising Sun]]" (1964), a folk song, recorded with rock and roll instrumentation.&lt;ref name="marsh1001"&gt;[[Dave Marsh]], [http://www.lexjansen.com/cgi-bin/marsh_xml.php?fn=87 ''The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made'', NAL, 1989. Entry #91.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s [[Bob Dylan]] took the lead in merging folk and rock, and in July 1965, released "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]", with a revolutionary rock sound, steeped in tawdry urban imagery, followed by an electric performance later that month at the Newport Folk Festival. Dylan plugged an entire generation into the milieu of the singer-songwriter. Often writing from an urban point of view, with poetry punctuated by rock rhythms and electric power, Dylan's fusing of folk and rock freed up emerging singer-songwriters to use elements of both traditions to tell their stories. In the mid- to late 1960s, bands and singer-songwriters began to proliferate the underground New York art/music scene. The release of ''[[The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico]]'' in 1967, featuring singer-songwriter [[Lou Reed]] and German singer and collaborator [[Nico]] was described as the "most prophetic rock album ever made" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174|title=News|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6597640/13_the_velvet_underground|title=News|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late '60s a New Wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, using the urban landscape as their canvass for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like [[Anne Sexton]] and [[Sylvia Plath]].  These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 1969, "The Girls: Letting Go: 'What is common to them – to [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Lotti Golden]], to [[Laura Nyro]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery, brimming with keen observation and startling in the impact of their poetry."&lt;ref&gt;JoniMitchell.com Library: THE GIRLS—LETTING GO: Newsweek, July 14, 1969 [http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2664&amp;from=search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JoniMitchell.com Library: THE GIRLS—LETTING GO: Newsweek, July 14, 1969, Original Article pdf [http://jonimitchell.com/library/originals/jmOriginal_2664.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the original wave of singer-songwriters had largely been absorbed into a more general pop or [[soft rock]] format, but some new artists in the singer-songwriter tradition (including [[Billy Joel]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Mark Heard]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Victoria Williams]], [[John Mellencamp]] and [[Warren Zevon]]) continued to emerge, and in other cases rock and even [[punk rock]] artists such as [[Peter Case]], [[Paul Collins (musician)|Paul Collins]] and [[Paul Westerberg]] transitioned to careers as solo singer-songwriters. [[Kate Bush]] remained distinctive throughout with her idiosyncratic style.
[[File:Tracy Chapman at TED conference 2007 by jurvetson.jpg|thumb|[[Tracy Chapman]] began singing about social issues in American society in the 1980s]]

In the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with [[Suzanne Vega]] whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Lisa Loeb]], [[Joan Osborne]], and [[Tori Amos]], who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market. In the early 1990s, female artists also began to emerge in new styles, including [[Courtney Love]] and [[PJ Harvey]]. Later in the mid-1990s, the term was revived again with the success of Canada's [[Alanis Morissette]] and her breakthrough album ''[[Jagged Little Pill]].''

Also in the 1980s and 1990s, artists such as [[Bono]], [[the Edge]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Richard Barone]], [[Duncan Sheik]] and [[Elliott Smith]] borrowed from the singer-songwriter tradition to create new acoustic-based rock styles. In the 2000s, a quieter style emerged, with largely impressionistic lyrics, from artists such as [[Norah Jones]], [[Conor Oberst]], [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[David Bazan]], [[South San Gabriel (band)|South San Gabriel]], [[Iron &amp; Wine]], [[David Gray (musician)|David Gray]], [[Ray LaMontagne]], [[Meg Hutchinson]], [[Darden Smith]], [[Josh Rouse]], Steve Millar, [[Jolie Holland]], [[Patrick Duff]], [[Richard Buckner (musician)|Richard Buckner]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Jack Savoretti]], [[Richard Shindell]], and [[John Gorka]]. Some started to branch out in new genres such as [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Noel Gallagher]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Eddie Vedder]], and [[Pete Yorn]]. Others used [[Recreational drug use|drugs]] as a mind-altering way to boost creativity; for example, Emil Amos of [[Holy Sons (band)|Holy Sons]] took drugs daily from age sixteen on, wrote over 1,000 songs, and landed a record contract with an [[indie music|indie label]].&lt;ref name=twsAprZB11&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris|last=Martins |title=Sober People Scare the Shit Out of Me |work=LA Weekly |date=March 10, 2011|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2011-03-10/music/sober-people-scare-the-shit-out-of-me/ |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording on the professional-grade systems became affordable for individuals in the late 1990s. This created opportunities for people to independently record and sell their music.  Such artists are known as "indies" because they release their records on independent, often self-owned record labels, or no label at all. Additionally the Internet has provided a means for indies to get their music heard by a wider audience.

=== Chanson, the French tradition ===
[[File:Radio Libertaire 10 ans Léo Ferré 3.jpg|thumb|left|French anarchist [[Léo Ferré]], in 1991]]
French "[[chanson]]" comes from an old tradition, since the [[Middle Ages]]. It is driven by the rhythms of the French language and has a generally higher standard of lyrics than in the English-speaking world. It can be distinguished from the rest of French "pop" music or [[soft rock]] format that began to spread in [[France]] during the 1960s until today, under the cultural influence of Anglo-American rock music and the rock band era.

The first modern French singer-songwriter was [[Charles Trénet]], who began his solo career in 1938. He was the first to use jazz rhythms in chanson. He would remain an isolated act until the creative blooming of a new generation during the [[Post-war|post-World War II era]] (mid-1940s and 1950s), where such artists as [[Léo Ferré]], [[Georges Brassens]], [[Félix Leclerc]] (from [[Quebec]]), [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Jacques Brel]] (from [[Belgium]]), [[Henri Salvador]], [[Charles Aznavour]] and [[Barbara (singer)|Barbara]] appeared, with contrasted and rich imagination. Most of them are recognized as great masters by younger generations of French artists, especially Ferré (for the richness of his lyrics, his melodic genius, his critical density on social issues and his body of work's profoundness) and Gainsbourg (for the bright and tasteful adaptation of pop or rock music with French language-driven rhythms).

During the 1960s and 1970s, the most prominent singer-songwriters included [[Claude Nougaro]], [[Jean Ferrat]], [[Boby Lapointe]], [[Michel Polnareff]], [[Nino Ferrer]], [[Christophe (singer)|Christophe]], [[Albert Marcœur]], [[Bernard Lavilliers]], [[ Frédérik Mey]] and [[Jacques Higelin]], amongst others.

=== Cantautori, the Italian tradition ===
[[File:Sanremo 1969 Lucio Battisti.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucio Battisti]]]]
''Cantautori'' (Italian plural; the singular is ''cantautore'') is the Italian expression corresponding to singer-songwriters in English. The word is a [[portmanteau]] of ''cantante'' (singer) and ''autore'' (writer).

The first internationally renowned ''cantautore'' was [[Domenico Modugno]] with his song "[[Volare (song)|Volare (Nel blu dipinto di blu)]]", a [[best-selling singles worldwide#15 million copies or more|huge best seller]] in 1958; 
other early ''cantautori'', who begun their career in the late 50s, are [[Gino Paoli]], [[Luigi Tenco]], [[Umberto Bindi]], [[Giorgio Gaber]] and [[Enzo Jannacci]].

[[Fabrizio De André]], [[Lucio Battisti]] and [[Francesco Guccini]] began their career in the 60s, while [[Edoardo Bennato]], [[Lucio Dalla]], [[Francesco De Gregori]], [[Franco Battiato]], [[Rino Gaetano]], [[Ivano Fossati]], [[Antonello Venditti]], [[Pino Daniele]], [[Roberto Vecchioni]], [[Angelo Branduardi]] and [[Eugenio Finardi]] all appeared in the 70s.
Their songs are still popular today, often telling stories of marginalized (De André, Guccini, Dalla) and rebellious people (Finardi, De Gregori, Venditti), or having a political background (Venditti, Guccini).

Branduardi was instead much more influenced by Medieval and Baroque musical styles, while his lyrics are usually inspired by ancient fables. Battiato started as a [[progressive rock]] and [[contemporary classical music|cultivated music]] artist in the 1970s, shifting to an original blend of pop, electronic, new wave, and world music in the 1980s.

The Neapolitan ''cantautore'' [[Pino Daniele]] has often fused genres as diverse as R&amp;B, fusion, blues, pop, jazz, and [[tarantella]] to produce a sound uniquely his own, with lyrics variously in Italian, Neapolitan, or English. Similarly [[Paolo Conte]] was often tagged as a ''cantautore'', but was more into the jazz tradition.

In the 1980s [[Vasco Rossi]] was renowned for his blend of blues-tinged rock music mixed with Italian melodies.
He was nicknamed the "only Italian rock star" (''l'unica rock n'roll-star italiana'') by his fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vascorossi.net/vrwf.asp?Idnotizia=807 |title=Sito ufficiale e Fan Club |publisher=Vasco Rossi |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a mixture between international sounds and Italian lyrics, in the 2000s [[Bugo]] become the "fantautore", a neologism conied for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/11/30/arriva-il-lunatico-bugo-fantautore-da-sorprese.html |title=Arriva il lunatico Bugo 'fantautore' da sorprese – la Repubblica.it |language=it |publisher=Ricerca.repubblica.it |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not having achieved great fame, he is considered the pioneer of the renewal of Italian songwriting, far from the politicized of the 70s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leggo.it/news/roma/bugo_domenica_na_cosetta_live_acustico_me_un_ritorno_alle_origini-2381099.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last 25 years the genre has been mainly represented by [[Samuele Bersani]], [[Caparezza]], and the so-called ''2nd Roman school of cantautori'' ([[Max Gazzè]], [[Niccolò Fabi]], [[Daniele Silvestri]]).

The word has been borrowed into other languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''cantautor'', French ''chantauteur'', [[Maltese language|Maltese]] ''kantawtur'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''cantautor'', and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''kantavtor''.

=== Iberian-Latin American traditions ===

Beginning in the 1960s and following the Italian ''cantautori'' style of the 1950s (like the one of Domenico Modugno), many Latin American countries developed singer-songwriter traditions that adopted elements from various popular styles. The first such tradition was the mid-1960s invention of [[nueva canción]], which took hold in Andean countries like [[Chile]], [[Peru]], Argentina and [[Bolivia]].

[[File:Caetano Veloso.jpg|thumb|left|[[Caetano Veloso]]]]

At around the same time, the Brazilian popular style [[bossa nova]] was evolving into a politically charged singer-songwriter tradition called [[Tropicalismo]]. Two performers, [[Gilberto Gil]] and [[Caetano Veloso]] became two of the most famous people in all of Brazil through their work in Tropicalismo.

After World War II it was developed in Italy a very prolific singer-songwriter (in Italian ''cantautore'') tradition, initially connected with the French school of the ''chansonniers'', and lately developed very heterogeneously. Although the term ''cantautore'' normally implies consistent sociopolitical content in lyrics, noteworthy performers in a more inclusive singer-songwriter categorization are: [[Domenico Modugno]], [[Luigi Tenco]], [[Gino Paoli]], [[Sergio Endrigo]], [[Fabrizio De André]], [[Francesco De Gregori]], [[Antonello Venditti]], [[Roberto Vecchioni]], [[Ivano Fossati]], [[Lucio Dalla]], [[Francesco Guccini]] and [[Franco Battiato]].

In neighbouring Malta, the main singer-songwriters are [[Walter Micallef]], Manwel Mifsud and Vince Fabri. They all perform in Maltese.

Spain and Portugal have also had singer-songwriter traditions, which are sometimes said to have drawn on Latin elements. Spain is known for the [[Nova Cançó]] tradition — exemplified by [[Joan Manuel Serrat]] and [[Lluis Llach]]; the Portuguese folk/protest singer and songwriter [[José Afonso]] helped lead a revival of Portuguese folk culture, including a modernized, more socially aware form of [[fado]] called nova canção. Following Portugal's [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, nova canção became more politicized and was known as canto livre. Another important Spain singer-songwriters are [[Joaquín Sabina]], [[José Luis Perales]] and [[Luis Eduardo Aute]].

In the latter part of the 1960s and into the 1970s, socially and politically aware singer-songwriters like [[Silvio Rodríguez]] and [[Pablo Milanés]] emerged in [[Cuba]], birthing a genre known as [[nueva trova]]. Trova as a genre has had broad influence across Latin America. In [[Mexico]], for example, canción yucateca on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and trova serrana in the [[Sierra Juárez, Oaxaca]] are both regional adaptations of trova. Today, Guatemalan [[Ricardo Arjona]] qualifies as Latin America's most commercially successful singer-songwriter. Although sociopolitical engagement is uneven in his oeuvre, some see Arjona's more engaged works as placing him in the tradition of the Italian ''cantautori''.

In the mid-1970s, a singer-songwriter tradition called canto popular emerged in [[Uruguay]].

With the influence of [[Tropicalismo]], Traditional [[Samba]] and [[Bossa Nova]], MPB ([[Música popular brasileira]]), or Brazilian Popular Music, became highly singer-songwriter based.  For years solo artists would dominate Brazilian popular music with romantic cynicism alla [[Jobim]] or subliminal anti-government messages alla [[Chico Buarque]].  After the end of the [[military dictatorship in Brazil]], Brazilian music became less politically and socially conscious.  The censored [[Raul Seixas]] or the humorous spiritualist [[Jorge Ben]] were slowly obscured by [[funk carioca]], [[axé music]] and [[disco|Brazilian disco]].  In recent years, however, a new stock of socially conscious Brazilian singer-songwriters is beginning to break the almost strictly dance-music momentum that has reigned since the 1980s (see the 'Brazilian folk/folk-rock sub-article in [[Brazilian Music]]).

=== Soviet Union and Russia ===
{{Main|Bard (Soviet Union)}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R1202-0019, Berlin, Palast der Republik, Bulat Okudshawa cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Soviet and Russian bard [[Bulat Okudzhava]]]]

Since the 1960s, those singers who wrote songs outside the Soviet establishment have been known as "bards". The first songs traditionally referred to as bard songs are thought to be written in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and the very existence of the genre is traditionally originated from the amateur activities of the Soviet intelligentsia, namely mass backpacking movement and the students' song movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Many bards performed their songs in small groups of people using a [[Russian guitar]], rarely if ever would they be accompanied by other musicians or singers. Though, bards using piano or accordion are also known. Those who became popular held modest concerts. The first nationwide-famous bards (starting their career in the 1950s) are traditionally referred to as the First Five: Mikhail Ancharov, [[Alexander Gorodnitsky]], [[Novella Matveyeva]], [[Bulat Okudzhava]], [[Yuri Vizbor]]. In the 1960s, they were joined by [[Vladimir Vysotsky]], [[Victor Berkovsky]], [[Yuliy Kim]], and many others.

In the course of the 1970s, the shift to the classical 6-string guitar took place, and now, a Russian guitar is a rare bird with the bards. In the same period, the movement of KSP (Kluby Samodeyatelnoy Pesni – amateur song fan clubs) emerged, providing the bards with highly educated audience, and up to the end of the 1980s being their key promotion engine.  Bards were rarely permitted to record their music, partly given the political nature of many songs, partly due to their vague status in the strictly organised state-supported show business establishment of the USSR. As a result, bard tunes usually made their way around as folk lore, from mouth to mouth, or via the copying of amateur recordings (sometimes referred as [[magnitizdat]]) made at concerts, particularly those songs that were of political nature. Bard poetry differs from other poetry mainly in the fact that it is sung along with a simple guitar melody as opposed to being spoken. Another difference is that this form of poetry focuses less on style and more on meaning. This means that fewer stylistic devices are used, and the [[poetry]] often takes the form of narrative. What separates bard poetry from other songs is the fact that the music is far less important than the lyrics; [[chord progression]]s are often very simple and tend to repeat from one bard song to another. On the other hand, in the USSR the chief bard supporter was the state Union of Composers, and the main bard hater was the state Union of Writers. A far more obvious difference was the commerce-free nature of the genre: songs were written to be sung and not to be sold. The similar genre dominated by singers-songwriters is known as [[sung poetry]] in other Post-Soviet countries.

=== Bulgaria ===

Singer-songwriters are popular in Bulgaria under the name "bards", or "poets with guitars". Their tradition is a mixture of traditional folk motifs, city folklore from the early 20th century, and modern influences. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the Communist regime in the country started to tolerate the Bulgarian "bards", promoting the so-called "political songs", performed usually by one-man bands. A national festival tradition was established, under the title "Alen Mak" (Red Poppy), a symbol with strong Communist meaning in Bulgaria. At the same time, there were some prominent underground figures which were against the official Communist Party line, such as Angel "Jendema" Angelov, Yavor "Yavkata" Rilov, and Velizar "Valdes" Vankov.

After the collapse of Communism in 1989, the singer-songwriters' tradition was re-established. Currently, the Bulgarian "bards" enjoy several festivals (local and international) per year, namely the PoKi Festival (Poets with Guitars, Poetic Strings) in the town of Harmanli, the Bardfest in Lovech, the Sofia Evenings of Singer-Songwriters, and others. Major figures in the Bulgarian tradition are Dimitar Taralezhkov, Angel "Jendema" Angelov, Yavor "Yavkata" Rilov, Velizar "Valdes" Vankov, Dimitar Dobrev, Andro Stubel, Branimir "Bunny" Stoykov, Dorothea Tabakova, Mihail Belchev, Assen Maslarski, Grisha Trifonov, Plamen Stavrev, Vladimir Levkov, Margarita Drumeva, Maria Batchvarova, Plamen Sivov, and Krasimir Parvanov.

=== Romania ===

Despite the [[communism|communist]] isolation, the tradition of the singer-songwriter in [[Romania]] flourished beginning with the end of the 1960s and it was put in the context of [[folk music]], with its three main styles in Romania: ethno folk, American-style folk and lyrical (cult) folk. The framework for many of these initiatives came under the form of [[Cenaclul Flacăra]], a series of mass cultural events with an inevitable ideological touch. Still, with the merit of supporting great opening initiatives: the appropriation of Western artists like [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]] and others from the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] generation, the public performance of gospel-like music, the opening to big international issues (pop culture, accountability of the leadership, tension surging during the Cold War-with surprisingly neutral positions etc.).
Overall, the Romanian folk, in general, could be marked as an underground cultural movement, somewhere between non-aligned and protest music.

=== Liedermacher, the German tradition ===

Rooted in the European Bänkelsang (“bench-singing”) and Moritat traditions while also taking immediate inspiration from the French chanson scene and the [[American folk music revival]], the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of a whole generation of German-language singer-songwriters called Liedermacher (“songmakers”), among them [[Hannes Wader]], [[Franz Josef Degenhardt]], [[Reinhard Mey]] and [[Konstantin Wecker]] from [[West Germany]], [[Wolf Biermann]] from [[East Germany]] as well as [[Ludwig Hirsch]] and [[Georg Danzer]] from [[Austria]]. With regards to content and style, the Liedermacher spectrum ranges from political balladeering to rather observational storytelling and love songs. The lyrics often deal with topics such as [[social injustice]], [[militarism]], [[consumerism]], [[environmental issue|environmental issues]] or the repercussions of the [[Nazism|German Nazi past]], often expressing technoskepticism and [[anti-establishment]] views.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Hartmut: ''Liedermacher'', (1980), Munich: Heyne; Henke, Matthias: ''Die großen Chansonniers und Liedermacher'' (1987), Düsseldorf: Econ.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===

In the mid-1960s, [[Sweden]] witnessed the renaissance of the „trubadur“, the Swedish version of the singer-songwriter. [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]] and [[Fred Åkerström]] were particularly influential in their efforts to blend the heritage of the [[Swedish ballad tradition|“visa”]] (a specific way to render simple stanzaic poems or songs, given distinction by artists such as [[Carl Michael Bellman]] and [[Evert Taube]]) with modern approaches to balladeering.&lt;ref&gt;Alf Björnberg, Thomas Bossius, eds., ''Made in Sweden: Studies in Popular Music'', (2016), New York: Routledge, pp. 53-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===

[[Ede Staal]] ([[Warffum]]) (1941–1986), was a Dutch singer-songwriter from the Northern province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] who sang mainly in the Groninger dialect of Dutch.

[[File:Sir Squire Bancroft.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Squire Bancroft]]
'''Sir Squire Bancroft''' (14 May 1841 &amp;ndash; 19 April 1926), born '''Squire White Butterfield''', was an English [[actor-manager]]. He and his wife [[Effie Bancroft]] are considered to have instigated a new form of drama known as 'drawing-room comedy' or 'cup and saucer drama', owing to the realism of their stage sets.

==Early life and career==
Bancroft was born in [[Rotherhithe]], London. His first appearance on the stage was in 1861 at [[Birmingham]], and he played in the provinces with success for several years. His first London appearance was in 1865 as Jack Crawley in J. P. Wooler's ''A Winning Hazard'' at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]] off [[Tottenham Court Road]]. This theatre was managed by [[Henry James Byron|Henry Byron]] and [[Effie Bancroft|Effie Marie Wilton]], whom Bancroft married in December 1867. After their marriage the couple became joint managers of the theatre.

Mr and Mrs Bancroft produced and starred in all the [[Thomas William Robertson]] comedies beginning in 1865: ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'' (1865), ''Ours'' (1866), ''[[Caste (play)|Caste]]'' (1867), ''Play'' (1868), ''School'' (1869) and ''M.P.'' (1870), and, after Robertson's death, in revivals of the old comedies, for which they surrounded themselves with an admired company.  Together, Robertson and the Bancrofts are considered to have instigated a new form of drama known as "drawing-room comedy" or "cup and saucer drama".  The Bancrofts gave Robertson an unprecedented amount of directorial control over his plays, which was a key step to institutionalizing the power that directors wield in the theatre today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Vorder Bruegge, Andrew "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy" (Associate Professor, Department Chair, Department of Theatre and Dance, Winthrop University).  Professor Vorder Bruegge presented this paper at the Victorian Interdisciplinary Studies Association of the Western United States annual conference in October 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=3 May 2011 }}, accessed 26 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bancroft management at the Prince of Wales's Theatre constituted a new era in the development of the English stage and had the effect of reviving the London interest in modern drama.  They were also responsible for making fashionable the "box set", which [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris]] had first used at the [[Olympic Theatre]] in the 1830s – this consisted of rooms on stage which were dressed with sofas, curtains, chairs, and carpets on the stage floor.  They also provided their actors with salaries and wardrobes.  Also, the Bancrofts redesigned their theatre to suit the increasingly upscale audience: "The cheap benches near the stage, where the rowdiest elements of the audience used to sit were replaced by comfortable padded seats, carpets were laid in the aisles, and the pit was renamed the stalls."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/cup.php Information about Cup and Saucer realism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416042300/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/cup.php |date=16 April 2007 }} (PeoplePlay UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plays they premiered or produced there were [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''Allow Me To Explain'' (1867) and his romantic comedy tribute to Robertson, ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874), as well as ''Tame Cats'' (1868), [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lytton's]] ''Money'' (1872), ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' (1874), [[Dion Boucicault|Boucicault's]] ''London Assurance'' (1877), and ''Diplomacy'' (1878), an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]]'s ''Dora'' by [[Clement Scott]] and [[B. C. Stephenson]].

In the 1870s and 1880s, in addition to his management responsibilities, Bancroft continued to play leading roles in numerous contemporary plays, as well as in works by Shakespeare and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s and other classic plays, often opposite his wife.&lt;ref name=NYPL&gt;[http://archives.nypl.org/the/21493 "Squire Bancroft letter book, 1836-1922"], Billy Rose Theatre Division, [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]], accessed 8 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, the Bancrofts moved to the [[Haymarket Theatre]], where they produced or starred in a revival of ''Money'', and in Sardou's ''Odette'' (for which they engaged Madame [[Helena Modjeska]]), ''Fedora'', and Pinero's ''Lords and Commons'', with revivals of previous successes.

Having made a considerable fortune, they retired from management in 1885, but Bancroft continued to act until 1918.&lt;ref name=NYPL/&gt;  Bancroft was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1897. Between 1917, and his death in 1926, Bancroft maintained rooms at the fashionable [[Albany (London)|Albany]], in [[Piccadilly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41481 ''Albany'', Survey of London: volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2 (1963), pp. 367-389] accessed: 5 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both he and his wife are buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|12407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Bancroft wrote two books, and in collaboration with his wife, he wrote two volumes of reminiscences called ''Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft On and Off the Stage, Written by Themselves'' (London, 1888) and ''The Bancrofts: Recollections of Sixty Years'' (London: Dutton and Co., 1909).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10819">[[Aaron Copland]] wrote the '''Symphony for Organ and Orchestra''' in 1924.&lt;ref name=Copland /&gt; It represents a major work in the composer's [[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]], as it was his first fully realized orchestral work, his first work for organ, and the first piece whose [[orchestration]] he heard. In 1928, Copland re-orchestrated the work without organ as his '''Symphony No. 1''', rewriting the organ part in the brass and adding saxophone.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

==History==
Copland studied [[Musical composition#Composing music|composition]] in Paris from 1921 to 1924 under famed pedagogue [[Nadia Boulanger]]. He was especially appreciative of the confidence she displayed in her young American students, and she arranged for him to write a major symphonic work for organ and orchestra to be premiered by herself on organ and the [[New York Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Walter Damrosch]] followed by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] (BSO) under [[Serge Koussevitzky]]. He had come to be known around Paris as "that talented young American composer," and at a meeting at Koussevitzky's house with [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and Boulanger, the conductor remarked "''You'' vill [sic] write an organ concerto, Mademoiselle Boulanger vill [sic] ''play'' it and ''I'' vill [sic] conduct it!"&lt;ref name=Copland /&gt; Despite his apprehensiveness about his preparedness to write such a large work — Copland had never heard his own orchestration — Boulanger reassured him that he possessed the skills and talent.

The Symphony for Organ and Orchestra was premiered in New York on January 11, 1925 at [[Aeolian Hall (Manhattan)|Aeolian Hall]], also Boulanger's American debut.&lt;ref name=Copland /&gt; The Boston premiere took place later that year. The premiere of the re-orchestrated First Symphony did not take place until 1931, when the [[Berliner Symphoniker|Berlin Symphony Orchestra]] performed it under [[Ernest Ansermet]]'s baton.

==Instrumentation==
The Symphony for Organ and Orchestra is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}}, [[bass clarinet]] in B{{music|flat}}, two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s in C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Orchestral percussion|percussion]], two [[harp]]s, [[celesta]], [[Violin family|string]]s, and [[Organ (music)|organ]].&lt;ref name="score: with organ" /&gt;

The First Symphony (the non-organ version) is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets in B{{music|flat}}, bass clarinet in B{{music|flat}}, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, [[alto saxophone]] in E{{music|flat}}, eight horns, five trumpets, three trombones, timpani, percussion, [[piano]], two harps, and strings.&lt;ref name="score: no organ" /&gt;

==Form==
The Organ Symphony contains three movements: a contemplative prelude, a driving scherzo with a "bluesy" trio section, and a moderate tempo finale ranging in character from mournful to unrelenting.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; The work is unusual for a "symphony" in that it only contains three movements and the movements increase in length from start to finish. [[Howard Pollack]], a historian of American composers, states that the work is much more like a [[concerto]], and that its progressive elongation of movements makes the last in particular seem to drag on in spots, but that "such flaws are more than compensated from by the music's vitality, brilliance, and individuality." Pollack further notes:
{{quote|The prelude, more wistful than sad, features that bittersweet, pastoral mood so characteristic of its composer. The scherzo reveals an equally familiar hallmark in its evocation of modern urban life—here propulsive, mechanical, jazzy, with an ironically robotized quotation of the French tune "Au Claire de la Lune," an homage, surely, to Boulanger... The Finale, alternatively dirgelike and urgent (the composer's prophetic voice already making itself heard), ends triumphantly, as his music often does.}}

The tonal material of the prelude can be found in its first four measures, based on the half-step/whole-step [[octatonic scale]] beginning on G{{music|sharp}} (G{{music|sharp}}-A-B-C-D-D{{music|sharp}}-F-F{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}).&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt; The use of octatonic scales features prominently in the symphony and serve as a means of changing between tonal centers. This unites the prelude in a ternary form characteristic of Copland, moving the tonal center by a [[tritone]] in the B section.

&lt;!--- The grace note in this example should have a stroke through it; however, using
  the \acciaccatura command instead of the \grace command adds an extra, undesirable slur ---&gt;

Throughout the work, Copland employs a three-note [[Motive (music)|motive]] based on the [[minor triad]].&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; The motive is first heard prominently in the trumpet's first entrance, although it is at the pianissimo [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic]] level and muted. Used through all three movements, it appears near the end of the work in triple forte (fortessissimo), unifying the Symphony and lending weight to its conclusion.

&lt;score&gt;
\relative c'' {

&lt;/score&gt;

The scherzo movement features a [[polyrhythm]]ic ostinato present through 80% of the movement, based on two 'eighth note, eighth note, eighth rest' figures one eighth-note out of phase. The interlocking rhythms gives a ''[[perpetuum mobile]]'' feel to the movement, whose thematic material derives from it as well.&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt; Copland stated that the bluesy rhythms found in the scherzo's trio section would not have been there had he not been raised in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=Copland /&gt;

  \bar "||"
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The Finale is cast in a modified [[sonata form]], possibly because it was originally intended to open the symphony.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt; Copland described the sonata form as comprising a first theme in the violas based on the minor triad motive, a second theme in the strings over a [[Bassline#Walking bass|bass line]] ostinato based on the motive, a development section initiated by the organ including a "vivacious" theme for solo violin, and a short recapitulation that combines these main elements. Pollack contends that sonata form is difficult to grasp in this movement, even for an experienced listener, and likens it to a [[passacaglia]], with "its open unison theme, its [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] exposition, its repetitive bass lines, its lack of clear thematic contrast, and, perhaps above all, its tonal stasis."

==Legacy==
The Symphony for Organ and Orchestra established Copland as a serious modern composer. Musicologist Gayle Murchison posits that his use of the octatonic and whole-tone scales, polyrhythmic ostinato figures, and dissonant counterpoint proves his mastery of  the modernist harmonic, rhythmic, and melodic techniques of the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt; The work shows much influence of Copland's hero [[Igor Stravinsky]] such as its nervous, driving rhythms and some of its harmonic language, but it also draws significantly and consciously from jazz - Copland's birthright - as in its playful interpretation of triple meter in the scherzo movement.&lt;ref name=Key /&gt; For a decade Copland would continue to draw from jazz in his quest to evoke an essentially "American" sound. His interaction with Maestro Koussevitzky would lead to the latter to conduct 12 of Copland's orchestra pieces as head of the BSO, including several he commissioned and premiered.&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt;

The audience at the New York premiere was taken aback by its "radical departure from [[Common practice period|common practice]] conventions.&lt;ref name=Murchison /&gt;" From the stage, Maestro Damrosch famously remarked, "if a gifted young man can write a symphony like that at age twenty-three, within five years he will be ready to commit murder," which was in Copland's words a joke meant to "smooth the ruffled feathers of his conservative Sunday afternoon ladies faced with modern music.&lt;ref name=Tischler /&gt;" Just as contemporary critics rejected Copland's work for being too jazzy and too modern, receptive conductors and audiences were excited to hear his developing style. Copland himself came to see the work as too "European" and consciously sought to evoke an American idiom in his future work before eventually accepting it as a reflection of his natural idiom.&lt;ref name=Pollack /&gt;

'''''The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore''''' is a 1908 painting by [[Claude Monet]]. It is currently in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="MMA"&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437129|title=The Doge's Palace Seen from San Giorgio Maggiore|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=3 October 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
Monet created this work during his visit to Venice in late 1908. He returned to his home in France with many paintings incomplete, and he took a few years to prepare twenty-nine works for exhibition. In 1912 he held a successful show ''Claude Monet Venise'' at the gallery [[Bernheim-Jeune]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt;

Six of these paintings were created in order to capture the different light effects created throughout the day. Monet often made multiple copies of the same work of art; this process is better known as series painting. His series paintings originated in his early career when he and other impressionists became interested in ''[[en plein air]]'' and were inspired by the effects of changing light.

''The Doge's Palace'' was done later in his career after he had already established his artistic style, however this work is considered less successful because of the little time he spent in Venice and that he had to finish the series by memory later in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|date=1970|title=The Monets in the Metropolitan Museum|url=|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|volume=3|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and interpretation==
''The Doge's Palace'' is made with oil on canvas and its dimensions are 25 3/4 x 36 1/2 inches. 

This work depicts the [[Doge's Palace]], an iconic landmark of Venice and the historic seat of government of the [[Republic of Venice]], along with buildings of the [[Riva degli Schiavoni]] waterfront. The scene is viewed from the island of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]].

==Later history and influence==
Despite spending little time in Venice, works by Monet that were started in Venice, such as ''The Doge's Palace'', are some of his most highly-regarded artworks. These paintings capture his signature style and influence from the effervescent Venetian sunset. After this painting was exhibited in Paris in 1912 it went on to travel the world, and has now made a permanent home at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, NY.

'''''The Fight Between Carnival and Lent''''' is an [[oil painting|oil-on-panel]] work painted by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] in 1559. This painting depicts a common festival of the period, as celebrated in the [[Southern Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham and Grell (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; It presents the contrast between two sides of contemporary life, as can be seen by the appearance of the inn on the left side—for enjoyment, and the church on the right side—for religious observance.  

The busy scene depicts well-behaved children near the church and a beer drinking scene near the inn. At the centre is a [[Water well|well]], showing the coming together of different parts of the community, and other scenes show a fish stall and two competing [[Float (parade)|floats]].



==Symbolism==
A battle enacted between the figures [[Carnival]] and [[Lent]] was an important event in community life in early modern Europe, representing the transition between two different seasonal cuisines: livestock that was not to be wintered was slaughtered, and meat was in good supply.&lt;ref&gt;The dominating interpretation revolves around the conflict between [[Protestant]] (Carnival) and [[Catholic]] (Lent) churches. In fact, the [[Netherlands]] were in a state of constant religious conflict between [[Calvinism]] and [[Catholic reform]]. Moreover, scholars associated the Carnival with popular tradition and Lent with the clergy that was trying to suppress many popular festivities.&lt;/ref&gt; As the period of Lent commenced, with its enforced abstinence and the concomitant spiritual purification in preparation for [[Easter]], the butcher shops closed and the butchers traveled into the countryside to purchase cattle for the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Elizabeth Howard, Marion F. O'Connor, ''Shakespeare Reproduced: The Text in History and Ideology'' Routledge 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-35312-2}}, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;  

Bruegel's painting is rich in allegories and symbolisms that have been long studied. It is often read as the triumph of Lent, since the figure of Carnival seems to bid farewell with his left hand and his eyes lifted to the sky. A more generalised meaning may be the illustration of Bruegel's belief that human activities are motivated by folly and self-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;Certain motifs frequently recur in Bruegel's work: the group of cripples and beggars on Carnival's side of the square, ignored by the revellers, can be seen again (with some variations) in his ''[[The Beggars (Bruegel)|The Beggars]]'' of 1568, one of the artist's last paintings.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2013}}

=== Detail ===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel II-Combat de Carnaval et Careme IMG 1463.JPG|thumb|The figure of Carnival (detail).]]

The painting defies any linear narrative, but one may divide it into two sections: the popular and the religious. The scene is set in a town's market square (a traditional setting for the Carnival), with the figure of Carnival personified by a fat man who led a procession through the town and presided over a large feast.&lt;ref&gt;Mack P. Holt, ''Alcohol: A Social and Cultural History'', Berg 2006, {{ISBN|1-84520-166-3}}, pages 28 &amp;ndash; 29&lt;/ref&gt; In some traditions an [[effigy]] of the Carnival figure was burned at the end of the celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Fudge, work cited page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Bruegel's painting the figure is a large man riding a beer barrel with a pork chop attached to its front end. He is wearing a huge meat pie as a headdress; he is wielding a long [[Rotisserie|spit]], complete with a pig's head, as a weapon for the fight. The pouch of knives at his belt indicates that he is a butcher—the guild of butchers traditionally provided the meat for the carnival feast so his place at the procession's heart is apt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/130 In The Picture, The Sunday Telegraph, 2 March 2003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223163303/http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/130 |date=23 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The man behind the barrel is dressed in yellow&lt;!-- but in the image shown is dressed in white? --&gt;, which is connected with deceit, and he is followed by a female figure who is carrying on her head a table with bread and waffles on it. In one hand she holds a tumbler and in the other a candle, again allegorical symbols for deceit.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Beside her is a lute-player, which was a frequent symbol of [[Lutheranism]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013|reason=It's a guitar, not a lute}} The Lutherans had abolished [[Lent]] but still celebrated the Carnival.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} A tavern filled with drinkers and onlookers watch the performance of a popular farce known as ''The Dirty Bride''. At the street crossing  a group of cripples  have come out to beg, while behind them, led by a [[Doedelzak|bagpiper]],  a procession of [[leper]]s walks past.&lt;ref&gt;In The Picture, The Sunday Telegraph, 2 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent's half of the picture is dominated by abstinence and piety, with people drawing water from the well, giving [[alms]] to the poor and the sick, and going to church. The church itself is the dominant building from which queues of black figures emerge from their prayers. Lady Lent in the foreground, garbed like a nun, is sitting on a cart drawn by a monk and a nun, and looks gaunt and thin, with her followers feeding on bread and biscuits. Lady Lent's wagon contains traditional Lenten foods, [[pretzel]]s, [[waffle]]s, and [[mussel]]s. Just inside the entrance to the church a veiled statue is visible—it was customary in Roman Catholic churches to cover up all works of art at Lent until [[Easter Sunday]] when the carved and painted figures of saints would be unveiled once more, "brought back to life like the Saviour himself." In Bruegel's time, when the [[Protestant Reformation]] was surging, many of the old customs were under threat. The Roman Catholic attachment to Lenten rites was heavily criticised by the Protestant reformers and the spirit of carnival was viewed with suspicion on both sides of the religious divide.&lt;ref&gt;In The Picture, The Sunday Telegraph, 2 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The background is dominated by people working, primarily with food: women preparing Lenten fish, men carrying wine from the inn and a woman making waffles. At the very back of the picture, other festivities are going on with a bonfire, dancing figures and [[The Beggars (Bruegel)|beggars]] spread across the whole scenery. Bruegel produced this painting from a bird's eye view, as if he wished to stay out of any polemic of the time, but he was in the habit of placing a symbolic detail in the middle of the picture, and in this case it is a married couple with their backs to the viewer, guided by a fool with a burning torch. Many critics have identified this couple as a symbol for the [[Commoner|common masses]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''int. al.'', K. Roberts, ''Bruegel'', (rev. ed.) Phaidon (1982)&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The man carries a strange bulge under his clothes, giving the impression of a hunchback or a hidden sack. This is associated with the allegorical figure of [[Egotism]], who was usually represented as carrying a sack on his back, this meaning to express man's own faults and weaknesses. It is often read as how the masses caused intolerance towards dissenters because of their inability to think objectively.&lt;ref&gt;F. Grossmann, ''Pieter Bruegel: Complete Edition of the Paintings'' (3rd ed.), Phaidon (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman's main characteristic is the unlit lantern hanging by her belt. She is guided by a fool, and not by reason. The burning torch the latter carries is also symbolic of dispute and destruction. Beside the trio is a rooting{{clarify|date=March 2013}} pig, also connoting damage and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;F. Grossmann, ''Pieter Bruegel: Complete Edition of the Paintings'' (3rd ed.), Phaidon (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hundred Tales of Wisdom''''' is a translation from the Persian by [[Idries Shah]] of the "Life, Teachings and Miracles of Jalaludin [[Rumi]]" from [[Aflaki]]’s ''[[Munaqib]]'', together with certain important stories from Rumi’s own works, traditionally known by that title. It was published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1978.

==Summary==
The tales, anecdotes and narratives in this collection are used in [[Sufi]] schools for the development of insights beyond ordinary perceptions. Although the number 100 is used in the title, in Idries Shah’s presentation there are 159 tales beginning with a brief description of Rumi’s childhood and youth.

==Reception==
The author [[Doris Lessing]] wrote in ''Books and Bookmen'':&lt;ref&gt;''Books and Bookmen'', May 1979&lt;/ref&gt; “The Hundred Tales is traditional hagiography, a classic studied for seven hundred years by students of the [[Sufi]] Way as part of the ‘curriculum’ – and that means [[Christians]] and [[Jews]] as well as [[Muslims]]. It concerns Rumi, the saint whose funeral was attended by members of these and other faiths, all saying he was their teacher. What has been needed is a simple and clear version ... and here it is."

'''''The Skywhale''''' is a [[hot air balloon]] designed by the sculptor [[Patricia Piccinini]] as part of a commission to mark the centenary of the city of [[Canberra]]. It was built by [[Cameron Balloons]] in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]], and first flew in [[Australia]] in 2013. The balloon's design received a mixed response after it was publicly unveiled in May 2013.

==Development==

Ahead of the centenary of the Australian national capital city of [[Canberra]] in 2013, the creative director of the centenary celebrations, [[Robyn Archer]], commissioned the sculptor [[Patricia Piccinini]] in 2010 to develop a balloon.&lt;ref name="whale of a commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sculpture as hot-air balloon - a whale of a commission|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/open_government/inform/act_government_media_releases/cmcd/2013/sculpture-as-hot-air-balloon-a-whale-of-a-commission|work=Media release|publisher=ACT Chief Minister and Cabinet Directorate|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blowing in the wind" /&gt; Piccinini grew up in Canberra and completed a degree in economics at the [[Australian National University]] before becoming a successful sculptor.&lt;ref name="Skywhale takes off"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Larissa|title=Skywhale takes off|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/skywhale-takes-off-20130511-2jejt.html|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=12 May 2013|author2=Kretowicz, Ewa }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roslyn_Oxley9_bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patricia Piccinini|url=http://www.roslynoxley9.com.au/artists/31/Patricia_Piccinini/profile/|publisher=Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has received praise for creating highly realistic sculptures of human-like living creatures, and her work has been exhibited worldwide.&lt;ref name=Roslyn_Oxley9_bio /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afternoon delight" /&gt; Archer selected Piccinini for the project in recognition of the sculptor's connections to Canberra; other prominent former Canberrans have also been asked to participate in the centenary celebrations.&lt;ref name="blowing in the wind" /&gt; Piccinini had not previously designed a balloon.&lt;ref name="Afternoon delight" /&gt;

Piccinini's intention when designing the balloon was to fashion it as sculpture of a living creature rather than a "balloon that looked like something".&lt;ref name="The process"&gt;{{cite web|title=The process|url=http://www.theskywhale.com/process.html|work=The Skywhale official website|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inspired by the [[planned city|planned]] nature of Canberra, and has described the work as:
{{quote|"My question is what if evolution went a different way and instead of going back into the sea, from which they came originally, they went into the air and we evolved a nature that could fly instead of swim. In fact coming from a place like Canberra where it's a planned city that's really tried to integrate and blend in with the natural environment, it makes a lot of sense to make this sort of huge, gigantic, but artificial and natural-looking creature".&lt;ref name="Skywhale price tag"&gt;{{cite news|title=Skywhale price tag could hit $300k|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-10/skywhale-could-cost-up-to-300k/4681892|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The official website of ''The Skywhale'' describes Piccinini's design as follows:
{{quote|Wings didn't make sense to Patricia; the creature was too big and the technical limitations of balloon design wouldn't allow them anyway. So she took a cue from the balloon itself, and imagined that the creature might somehow secrete a lighter than air gas. In the place of wings she imagined huge udders that might contain the gas, as well as a huge bulbous body. She imagined the creature with a slightly more human face, with a calm benign expression that would inspire empathy rather than fear. Her aim was to create a being that was massive and wondrous and that exists somewhere between the impossible and the unlikely.&lt;ref name="The process" /&gt;}}

==Construction==

After developing her design, Piccinini and her studio developed a 3D model of the balloon using [[computer-aided design]] software. This process was used to address the technical issues involved with developing a balloon which was safe to fly, as well as to fine-tune the appearance of the design.&lt;ref name="The process" /&gt; The Australian Capital Territory's government invited five specialist balloon manufacturers to submit proposals to construct ''The Skywhale'', but the [[Bristol]]-based company [[Cameron Balloons]] was the only one to provide a bid.&lt;ref name="Skywhale flown to UK" /&gt;

Once the initial design was complete it was passed to Cameron Balloons which further developed the plans in consultation with Piccinini.&lt;ref name="The process" /&gt; The final design was for a {{convert|34|m|ft}} high and {{convert|23|m|ft}} long balloon capable of a carrying a pilot and two passengers to a maximum altitude of {{convert|3000|ft|m}}. The balloon weighs half a tonne and includes more than 3,500 square metres of fabric. It took a team of six workers seven months to complete the balloon.&lt;ref name="whale of a commission" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The process" /&gt; Due to its large size, ''The Skywhale'' is slower to ascend and descend than traditional balloons.&lt;ref name="Skywhale will grow on you" /&gt; The total construction cost was $A172,000 and the balloon has a lifespan of about 100 flights.&lt;ref name="Skywhale tale grows" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skywhale price tag" /&gt;

The owner and operator of ''The Skywhale'', Kiff Saunders, has commented that the balloon's design posed some issues during landing, stating the "Skywhale's length and her pendulous breasts make her more difficult to land." &lt;ref name="Giant soccer ball flies over Canberra"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walmsley|first=Hannah|title=Asian Cup: Giant soccer ball flies over Canberra in celebration of sporting event|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-22/asian-cup-hot-air-balloon-takes-to-skies-of-canberra/6034008|accessdate=21 January 2015|newspaper=ABC News|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Skywhale'' arrived in Australia in early 2013, and made its initial test flight near [[Mount Arapiles]] in Victoria during April that year. Piccinini was a passenger on this flight, an experience she described as "awe inspiring". However, as the balloon's basket is small and has low walls she also reported feeling at danger of falling out of it during the flight.&lt;ref name="Afternoon delight"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cuthbertson|first=Debbie|title=Afternoon delight|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/afternoon-delight-20130509-2jaha.html|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the balloon's stitching came loose during this flight, and it was air freighted back to Bristol at the expense of Cameron Balloons to be repaired.&lt;ref name="Skywhale flown to UK"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jean|first=Peter |author2=Towell, Noel |author3=McIlroy, Tom|title=Skywhale flown to UK for emergency surgery|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/skywhale-flown-to-uk-for-emergency-surgery-20130513-2jimr.html|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piccinini was paid $8,800 for designing ''The Skywhale''. She has stated that this is much less than an artist would typically receive for a project of this scale, and she agreed to the reduced fee as she was impressed with Robyn Archer's plans for the centenary celebrations and believed that developing the balloon would be a "unique and extraordinary opportunity".&lt;ref name="artist cut fee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jean|first=Peter|author2=Mcdonald, Emma |title=Drawn to Archer vision, artist cut fee|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-centenary/drawn-to-archer-vision-artist-cut-fee-20130516-2joa3.html|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also believes that ''The Skywhale'' is likely to win greater support once Canberrans see it in person.&lt;ref name="blowing in the wind" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Is it a bird" /&gt;

The cost of the balloon and the arrangements under which it was funded also attracted criticism. The executive director of culture for the ACT Chief Minister’s directorate informed the media on 9 May that the balloon and its supporting website cost about $170,000. Documents released the next day showed that the total cost to the government of commissioning and operating ''The Skywhale'' over its lifespan will be $300,000, and the philanthropic [[Aranday Foundation]] will provide a further $50,000. Moreover, the balloon will remain the property of the Melbourne-based company [[Global Ballooning]] and only one flight was scheduled for Canberra at the time.&lt;ref name="Skywhale tale grows" /&gt; In response, Jeremy Hanson stated that "this $300,000 extravagance again shows out of touch the ACT Government is with Canberrans' priorities".&lt;ref name="Skywhale price tag" /&gt; Katy Gallagher has stated that the Government considered retaining ownership of the balloon during its development, but decided against this option as it would have also involved funding all of ''The Skywhale''{{'}}s operating costs.&lt;ref name="Libs fuming"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jean|first=Peter|title=Libs fuming over 'Hindenboob disaster'|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/libs-fuming-over-hindenboob-disaster-20130514-2jk1s.html|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robyn Archer defended the project, arguing that the balloon's cost was relatively low, and represented "a bargain for public art".&lt;ref name="Skywhale tale grows" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skywhale under fire" /&gt; Piccinini has also said that "it's an aeronautical machine.

==Flights and displays==

''The Skywhale''{{'}}s first flight in Canberra took place on 11 May 2013, with the balloon flying from the grounds of the [[National Gallery of Australia]] to the [[National Museum of Australia]] on the other side of [[Lake Burley Griffin]]. Hundreds of Canberrans were present to watch the flight.&lt;ref name="Canberrans flock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="maiden flight over Canberra"&gt;{{cite news|title=Skywhale makes maiden flight over Canberra|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-11/skywhale-makes-maiden-flight-over-canberra/4683382|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further flights and appearances were scheduled for Hobart and Melbourne at this time, and there were plans to also exhibit the balloon in other parts of Australia and overseas where it will be acknowledged as having been commissioned to mark the centenary of Canberra.&lt;ref name="whale of a commission" /&gt; Piccinini has described ''The Skywhale'' as being one of the highlights of her career.&lt;ref name="Skywhale under fire" /&gt;

The '''Cathedral of St. Lawrence''' ({{lang-hr|Katedrala Sv. Lovre}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] triple-naved [[basilica]] constructed in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in [[Trogir]], [[Croatia]]. Since its construction lasted several centuries, it illustrates all the styles that succeeded one another in [[Dalmatia]]. It serves now as the most imposing monument in the city of Trogir.

==History==
It was built on the foundations of an [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] cathedral destroyed in the 12th century during the sack of the town by the [[Saracens]] in 1123. The building of the cathedral began in 1213 and finished during the 17th century. Like the older one, it is also dedicated to St. Lawrence (Sveti Lovro) but it is better known as St. John's Cathedral (Sveti Ivan) after [[John of Trogir|bishop John]], who died in 1111 and stood out for his saintly lifestyle at a time when the Hungarian King Koloman had taken over Dalmatia and Croatia. Most of the work in the construction of the cathedral took place in the 13th century, being largely completed in 1251. That means the building is mainly in Romanesque style, whilst the vault inside is gothic as it was built during the 15th century, in [[Mannerist]] style.

Work on the bell tower began at the end of the 14th century, but it was not completed until the end of the 16th century. The first floor is in Gothic style and was built by Masters Stejpan and Matej. After it had been demolished by the Venetians in 1420, it was restored by Matija Gojković.&lt;ref&gt;Naklada Naprijed, ''The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide'', pg. 224, Zagreb (1999), {{ISBN|953-178-097-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second floor is in low Gothic style and was probably the work of Venetian masters, as it is reminiscent of the windows of the famous Venetian [[Ca' d'Oro|Palazzo Ca d'Oro]]. The final floor was built by Trifun Bokanić (1575–1609). On top of the bell tower there  are four statues, the work of Venetian sculptor Alessandro Vittoria (1525–1608). In the centre of the facade, within a small round opening, there is the carved coat of arms of the most powerful King, Ludvic of Angevin dynasty.

==Description==
Trogir cathedral is the most archaic example in the construction of interior arcades in Dalmatia with heavy elongated piers separating the two Gothic-ribbed aisles from the nave, vaulted later also in Gothic style in the 15th century,&lt;ref name="Delalle"&gt;Ivo Delalle, Mirko Slade – Šilovič, Stanko Geič, ''Trogir: Small Touristic Monograph'', pg. 27, Studio HRG, Zagreb (1999), {{ISBN|953-97699-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; three semi-circular apses and a vaulted interior above which rises the Campanile. Unfortunately, only one of the two planned towers (the southern), was raised. The cross vaults and the earlier terraces above the aisles are of Apulian influence. 

A large '''vestibule''' was added in the 15th century and the artistically well-executed Gothic [[Rosette (window)|rosette]] on the western facade is from the same period. At the far end of the entrance hall there is a Gothic and Romanesque '''baptistery''' which was added to the cathedral in about 1467 by Andrija Aleši (1430–1504), a sculptor of Albanian origins and a pupil of Juraj Dalmatinac. The Gothic '''sacristy''' was added to the cathedral in the 15th century. The outside thick wall is divided by pilasters and pierced with arched opens.

===Romanesque portal===
The local architect and sculptor Master [[Radovan (master)|Radovan]] worked on the cathedral's gateway (main west portal) early in its construction. Most of the portal was carved by the master himself but some other hands are distinguishable, those of his pupils and followers. Finished and signed in 1240, it is a monumental and perhaps unique work of this great Croatian artist, of whom the inscription on the base of the lunette says: ''"the best of all in this artisanship"''.&lt;ref name="Delalle"/&gt; 

In terms of its thematic concept, the portal is divided into two parts: upper and lower. The upper part shows scenes from the Gospels, that is, the life of Christ. On the lunette there is the scene of the Nativity, and inside the arch above the lunette there are angels looking adoringly at the scene. The lunette and this arch are the work of Master Radovan. Over them there is another arch which also shows scenes from the life of Christ. On the interior of the doorposts there are pictures showing the various works done during the different seasons of the year. Radovan also worked on the two small columns covered in reliefs. On the exterior doorpost the saints and apostles are represented; the interior of the same posts are decorated with figures of exotic animals and fantastic creatures like centaurs and mermaids. Human forms dominate the portal. Both the internal and external doorposts rest on the back of bearers bent over, who are also the work of Radovan himself. Beside the portal, standing on the backs of two lions, stand the figures of Adam and Eve.

Other significant artisans who worked on the building were Matija Gojković, [[Ivan Budislavić]], Grgur Vidov, and Petar Pozdanić in the 15th century.

The cathedral is part of the historic core of Trogir, which is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/810/ UNESCO World Heritage Site: Trogir]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two Crabs''''' is an 1889 [[oil painting]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is a [[still life]] of two crabs, one on its back and one upright, with a green background.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-two-crabs|title=Vincent van Gogh {{!}} Two Crabs {{!}} L995 {{!}} National Gallery, London|last=London|first=The National Gallery,|website=www.nationalgallery.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is [[oil paint|oil]] on [[canvas]] of {{convert|47|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Van Gogh is thought to have painted this work after his hospital release in January 1889. It was possibly inspired by a Japanese print of a crab by [[Hokusai]] that he had seen in the magazine ''[[Le Japon Artistique]]'', that his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] had sent him in September 1888.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The painting is held by the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]], on loan from a private collector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''VroniPlag Wiki''' is a [[wiki]] started 28 March 2011 at [[Wikia]] that examines and documents the extent of [[plagiarism]] in German doctoral [[theses]].

== History ==
Following the [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg#Doctorate plagiarism|revocation of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg's doctoral degree]], the VroniPlag Wiki adopted the idea of the [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg#Effect of Guttenplag|GuttenPlag Wiki]]. VroniPlag is named after the first thesis documented in it, the thesis submitted by Veronica Saß, daughter of German politician [[Edmund Stoiber]]. "Vroni" is a nickname in German for "Veronica".

== Modus operandi ==
Publication of a thesis consists of an overview that contains a "bar code" visualizing the amount of plagiarism, the exact bibliographic information of the theses (and if online, a link) and then a page overview that links to the fragments of plagiarism found on the page. Each fragment is classified as to the kind of plagiarism and must be verified by a second person before it is acceptable. Interesting parts are linked to separately and there is a final report published when the group feels the work is done.

[[File:Mm plag graphic.png|thumb|Visualization of the findings proved to be a key factor for the reception &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimme-institut.de/html/index.php?id=1122#c8529|title=GuttenPlag Wiki Grimme Online Award 2011|work=jury statement (in German)|accessdate=2012-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625105629/http://www.grimme-institut.de/html/index.php?id=1122#c8529|archive-date=2011-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

VroniPlag Wiki only publishes text parallel documentation openly with names of the authors on theses that have been found to contain serious plagiarism. Before publication, the office of academic integrity at the university in question is formally notified, as any revocation of title must be done by the university.

In addition to looking at dissertations, the text parallels in one habilitation and one book how to write scientifically.

== Current cases ==
As of February 2016, 152 dissertations, 8 habilitations, 1 master's thesis, and 1 book on scientific writing have been examined in detail on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VroniPlag overview|url=http://de.vroniplag.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%9Cbersicht|accessdate=2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first seven were:

Most of the plagiarism allegations made by VroniPlag led to investigations by the responsible universities, and some have resulted in the revocation of the [[Academic degree|degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VroniPlag Wiki – Overview of degree revocations|url=http://de.vroniplag.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%9Cbersicht|accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these revocations have held up in court. However, some universities disagreed with VroniPlag finding, even in cases of blatant plagiarism (between 40 and 70% of pages affected with plagiarism). The correct methods for dealing with plagiarism—and its prevention—remains an ongoing discussion in Germany.
[[File:Zedler-Preis 2012-4718.jpg|thumb|Awarding of the "Zedler-Preis für freies Wissen 2012" by [[Wikimedia Germany]] on July 1, 2012]]

Prominent cases of plagiarism continue to surface in Germany. At the University of Münster, a text book on scientific writing for lawyers was found to contain massive plagiarism. Ironically, even the chapter on plagiarism was plagiarized. While the book told students not to use Wikipedia, the book itself contained 18 text fragments from the German Wikipedia. The dissertations of two of the book's authors, who received their doctorates at Münster University, were found to show extreme text parallels.

VroniPlag was the first [[Crowdsourcing|crowd sourcing]] phenomenon of its kind in Germany that has been referred to as an authoritative source in all major media channels in Germany. The plagiarism investigation project has triggered an extensive nationwide discussion about plagiarism and what represents appropriate consequences for plagiarists and universities. The project was awarded the Zedler Prize for Free Knowledge in the category External Knowledge Project of the year 2011 by the German Wikimedia on July 1, 2012.

Since September 2015, Minister of Defence [[Ursula von der Leyen]]'s thesis is under formal investigation by her university after the wiki alleged plagiarism on more than 40% of its pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ursula von der Leyen als Exempel?|url=http://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/ursula-von-der-leyen-als-exempel-1.18625015|website=NZZ|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Victor "Bill" Gropper''' (December 3, 1897{{spaced ndash}}January 3, 1977), was a [[United States|U.S.]] [[cartoonist]], [[Painting|painter]], [[lithographer]], and [[muralist]]. A committed [[Political radicalism|radical]], Gropper is best known for the political work which he contributed to such [[left wing]] publications as ''[[Revolutionary Age|The Revolutionary Age]],'' ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]],'' ''[[The New Masses]],'' ''[[Daily Worker|The Worker]],'' and ''[[Morgen Freiheit|The Morning Freiheit]].''

==Life and career==
William "Bill" Gropper was born to Harry and Jenny Gropper in [[New York City]], the eldest of 6 children. His parents were [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eteichertfineprints.com/searchartist.php?inartist=William%20Gropper William Gropper profile on eteichertfineprints.com]&lt;/ref&gt; who were both employed in the city's garment industry, living in poverty on New York's [[Lower East Side]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Anthony Gahn, [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collectionsonline/gropwill/container205340.htm ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist.''] PhD Dissertation, Syracuse University, 1966. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother worked hard sewing piecework at home.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763518,00.html "20 Years of Gropper,"] ''Time'' magazine, Feb. 19, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Gropper, Bill's father, was university-educated and fluent in 8 languages, but was unable to find employment in America in a field for which he was suited.&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist,'' page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This failure of [[economy of the United States|the American economic system]] to make proper use of his father's talents doubtlessly contributed to William Gropper's lifelong antipathy to capitalism.

Gropper's alienation was accentuated when on March 24, 1911 he lost a favorite aunt in the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]], a disaster which resulted from locked doors and non-existent exits in a New York sweatshop.&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist'' pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 146 workers burned or jumped to their deaths on that day in what was New York's greatest human catastrophe prior to the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001]].

Young Bill's interest in art began at a young age. As a child of 6 young William took chalk to the sidewalks, decorating the concrete with elaborate picture stories of cowboys and Indians that extended around the block.&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child on the way to school, Bill used to lug bundles of his mother's piecework sewing to the [[sweatshop]]s by which she was employed.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

At age 13, Bill took his first art instruction at the radical [[Ferrer School]], where he studied under [[George Bellows]] and [[Robert Henri]].&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist,'' pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gropper-cartoon-1920.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Cartoon from the June 1920 issue of ''The Liberator.'']]
In 1913, Bill graduated from public school, earning a medal in art and a scholarship to the National Academy of Design. The strong-willed Gropper refused to conform at the academy, however, and was subsequently expelled.&lt;ref name="Gahn, pg. 21"&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist,'' pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to attend High School that fall, but finances prevented his attendance and he was forced to seek work to help support his family.&lt;ref name="Gahn, pg. 21"/&gt; He worked as an assistant in a clothing store, earning $5 a week.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

In 1915, Bill showed a portfolio of his work to [[Frank Alvah Parsons|Frank Parsons]], the head of the [[New York School of Fine and Applied Arts]]. The work so impressed Parsons that Gropper was offered a scholarship to the school. Gropper continued to work reduced hours for reduced wages in the clothing store while he continued his artistic education.&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist'' pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent two years, Bill gained recognition and awards for his work.

In 1917, Gropper was offered a position on the staff of the ''[[New York Tribune]],'' where over the next several years he earned a steady income doing drawings for the paper's special Sunday feature articles. At this time, the politically radical Gropper was brought into the orbit of original and innovative artists around the left wing New York monthly, ''[[The Masses]].'' After ''The Masses'' was banned from the US Mail in 1917, due to its unflinching [[anti-militarism]], Gropper joined artists like [[Robert Minor]], [[Maurice Becker]], [[Art Young]], [[Lydia Gibson]], [[Hugo Gellert]], and [[Boardman Robinson]] in contributing to its successor, ''The Liberator.''

Gropper also contributed his art to ''The Revolutionary Age,'' a revolutionary socialist weekly edited by [[Louis C. Fraina]] and (in later issues) [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], a publication which narrowly predated the establishment of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], as well as to ''The Rebel Worker,'' a magazine of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], an [[anarcho-syndicalist]] union.

===Gropper as radical artist===

In 1920, Gropper went to [[Cuba]] briefly as an oiler on a United Fruit Company freight boat. He left the ship in Cuba and spent some time there observing life and working as a supervisor on a railroad construction detail. He was forced to return home sooner than expected, however, owing to the terminal illness of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist,'' pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1921, editor [[Max Eastman]] formally made Bill a special contributor and member of the staff of ''The Liberator.''&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist,'' pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; His time at the publication was not harmonious however, as many of the unpaid and underpaid artists and writers greatly resented Eastman, who collected a relatively opulent paycheck of $75 a week for, as Gropper later recalled, "lying on a couch and composing poetry and reading books."&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist,'' pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; A little coup was short-circuited in the end by Eastman's own determination to give up his post so as to visit Soviet Russia in 1922, a decision no doubt accelerated by the magazine's growing financial woes. [[Floyd Dell]] took over the editorial helm for the next year or so, with the publication soon coming under the financial and editorial umbrella of the Communist Party in a friendly takeover towards the end of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Material by Executive Secretary [[C.E. Ruthenberg]] and other leading members of the [[Workers Party of America]] began appearing in November of 1922, providing an approximate date of the transition.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1921, Bill Gropper married Gladys Oaks, herself a contributor to ''The Liberator.'' The marriage proved to be short and turbulent, marked by the couple's collaboration to produce a book of verse and drawings called ''Chinese White,'' published in 1922. (According to [[Whittaker Chambers]], ''China White'' aced out his own submission during a national poetry contest in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;

During the early 1920s, Gropper was a freelance contributor of work to such mainstream magazines as ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' (for which he drew caricatures of authors), the liberal magazine ''[[The Dial]],'' and [[Frank Harris|Frank Harris']] ''New Pearson's Magazine.''&lt;ref&gt;Gahn, ''The America of William Gropper, Radical Cartoonist,'' pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1924 Bill Gropper married his second wife, bacteriologist Sophie Frankle. Together, the two of them built a nine-room stone house in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]], where they raised their family.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; Shortly after their marriage, the couple spent a year in the [[Soviet Union]], where Bill was employed briefly on the staff of the newspaper of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party]], ''[[Pravda]].''&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

Despite his contributions to a vast array of communist publications, Gropper was never formally a member of the [[Communist Party USA]].&lt;ref name="Buhle"&gt;Cécile Whiting, "William Gropper (1897-1977)," in [[Mari Jo Buhle]], [[Paul Buhle]], and [[Dan Georgakas]] (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of the American Left.'' First Edition. New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; pg. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Gropper went on a tour of Soviet Russia along with the novelists [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Theodore Dreiser]] in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].

During the second half of the 1930s, Gropper dedicated his art to the efforts to raise popular opposition to [[fascism]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="Buhle" /&gt;

The lobby of the [[United States Post Office (Freeport, New York)|Freeport New York Post Office]] features two murals by Gropper installed in 1938 and titled ''Air Mail'' and ''Suburban Post in Winter''.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=4499|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Freeport Post Office|date=November 1986|accessdate=2010-10-01 | first = Larry E. | last = Gobrecht |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are included in the listing of the property on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals were commissioned under the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]'s [[Treasury Relief Art Project]], which commissioned art for existing Federal buildings.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Connor |first=Francis V. |date=Autumn 1969 |title=The New Deal Art Projects in New York  |journal=The American Art Journal |publisher=Kennedy Galleries, Inc. |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=58–79 |jstor=1593876  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|62, 72}} Gropper was also a [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Big, Beautiful Midcentury Map Celebrating American Folklore|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/08/21/william_gropper_his_mid_century_map_of_american_folklore.html|website=Slate|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his involvement with radical politics in the 1920s and 1930s, Gropper was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="Buhle" /&gt; The experience provided inspirational fodder for a series of fifty [[lithograph]]s entitled the ''Caprichos.''&lt;ref name="Buhle" /&gt;

Following [[World War II]], Gropper traveled to [[Poland]] to attend the [[World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace]] of 1948 in [[Wrocław]].&lt;ref name="Buhle" /&gt; Afterwards, he decided to pay tribute to the Jews who died in the [[Holocaust]] by painting one picture on the theme of Jewish life each year.&lt;ref name="Buhle" /&gt;

===Later years===

In 1974, he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate Academician. Gropper died from a [[myocardial infarction]] at [[Manhasset, New York]], at the age of 79.
