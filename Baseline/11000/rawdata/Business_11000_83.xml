'''Fouad "Alfred" Schakron''' ({{lang-ar|فؤاد شكرون}}; 6 June 1961 – 24 October 2012) was a [[Belize]]an businessman and the ex-husband of [[People's United Party]] political hopeful [[Yolanda Schakron]]. He was murdered in broad daylight outside a [[Belize City]] gym, leaving police mystified as to the motive or the identity of the killers.&lt;ref name="Amandala20121025"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://amandala.com.bz/news/death-waited-coney-drive/|first=Albert J.|last=Ciego|title=Death waited on Coney Drive|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2012-10-26|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="News520080425"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/4979|title=Former Area Rep and his driver charged with Theft|work=News 5 Belize|date=2008-04-25|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Shakroun was born and raised in [[Sidon District]], [[Lebanon]]. He came from a large family of nine people, among whom he was one of six who chose to emigrate from Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/58210/report-lebanese-nationals-murdered-overseas-under|title=Lebanese nationals murdered overseas under mysterious conditions|work=LBC International|date=2012-10-31|accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to Belize in the mid-1990s, and had lived there for 16 years by the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Amandala20121025"/&gt; He was involved in a variety of businesses. He owned J.E.C. Pawnshop, and was also co-owner along with Joseph Marinan of Belize's MegaBingo.&lt;ref name="News520080425"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News520110325"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/51542|title=Aunt of former game show host says sexual harassment is real|work=News 5 Belize|date=2011-03-25|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was astute at business and achieved financial success, enabling him to live in a three-storey mansion in Buttonwood Bay with two maids.&lt;ref name="News520080425"/&gt;

In 2007, Schakron was involved in a land deal gone bad, in which he apparently paid BZ$575,000 to [[Jose Coye]] in order to purchase land at Newtown Barrack Road. Allegedly, the government of Belize sold the land to Coye for BZ$20,000, while Coye pocketed the difference. Schakron alleged that Coye's driver later returned BZ$300,000 to Schakron, but that the balance of BZ$275,000 was not returned. Schakron made a complaint to police about the matter, which led to both Coye and his driver being charged with theft and [[obtaining property by deception]].&lt;ref name="News520080425"/&gt; The charges against the two were dismissed in July 2008.&lt;ref name="Amandala20100305"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://amandala.com.bz/news/i-dont-believe-joe-justice-legall/|first=Adele|last=Ramos|title='I don't believe {{bracket|Joe}}': Justice Legall|work=[[Amandala]]|date=2010-03-05|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coye later retained lawyers [[Elson Kaseke]] and [[Anthony Sylvestre]] and filed suit against Schakron for [[malicious prosecution]] in relation to the incident. Schakron was defended by [[Rodwell Williams]]. The matter came before Justice [[Oswell Legall]], who in 2010 ruled against Coye and ordered him to pay Schakron's legal costs.&lt;ref name="Amandala20100305"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=http://www.belizelaw.org/supreme_court/judgements/Legall/COYE%20V.%20%20SCHAKRON.pdf|litigants=Jose Coye v Alfred Schakron|court=[[Supreme Court of Belize]]|date=2010-03-10|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legall stated that he did not believe Coye's statements and was furthermore concerned about the [[chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] the case might have on private citizens reporting potentially unlawful activity to the police.&lt;ref name="Amandala20100305"/&gt;

In 2011, a relative of Schakron's who worked at MegaBingo made allegations of [[sexual harassment]], leading to the departure from Belize of Schakron's business partner Joseph Marinan; Schakron indicated in media comments that the views Marinan had expressed about the incident were his own and did not represent the company's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/51775|title=Mega Bingo is still the game|work=News 5 Belize|date=2011-03-30|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/51736|title=Where did you go Mega Bingo Joe?|work=News 5 Belize|date=2011-03-29|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schakron was formerly married to [[Yolanda Schakron]], with whom he had two children, but then divorced.&lt;ref name="News520110325"/&gt; He later remarried.&lt;ref name="Amandala20121025"/&gt;

==Death==
On the morning of 24 October 2012, Schakron went to the Body 2000 Gym on Coney Drive in Belize City for a morning workout.&lt;ref name="Amandala20121025"/&gt; According to witnesses, at 9:30 as Schakron exited the gym, a black [[Ford Escape]] turned the corner from Princess Margaret Drive at high speed and stopped in front of him.&lt;ref name="Amandala20121025"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News720121025"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=23756|title=Police Have No Leads, No Motive In Schakron Murder|work=7 News Belize|date=2012-10-25|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gunman alighted and had a conversation or argument with Schakron in a foreign language, possibly [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Amandala20121025"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News720121025"/&gt; He then shot Schakron four times in the neck, chest, and left side, wounding him fatally, and returned to his vehicle which sped off down Coney Drive. Three men came along in another vehicle, inspected Schakron's body, and then drove away as well. Schakron was taken to [[Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital]] across the street, but was declared [[dead on arrival]].&lt;ref name="Amandala20121025"/&gt; His body was buried in the town of [[Irkay]] in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Nov-01/193452-three-lebanese-men-killed-in-mexico.ashx|title=Three Lebanese men killed in Mexico|work=The Daily Star|date=2012-11-01|accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schakron was the second man of Lebanese extraction to be murdered in Belize City in the space of less than a day, a fact made all the more remarkable because there are only 240 Lebanese people residing in Belize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=23746|title=Aziz Dib Was Shot Five Times|work=7 News Belize|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police had no immediate leads or motive for the murder.&lt;ref name="News720121025"/&gt; Minister of National Security [[John Saldivar (politician)|John Saldivar]] stated that Schakron's killing did not seem to fit into the general pattern of the ongoing crime wave in Belize, and suggested that both Schakron and Dib might have been targeted specifically.&lt;ref name="News720121025"/&gt;

With no partners or experienced personnel immediately available to take over management duties, Schakron's businesses went into temporary shutdowns so that his family could have time to mourn. Mega Bingo first announced a temporary hiatus and then stated in an advertisement that it would close "until further notice"; J.E.C. Pawn Shop also stated that it would be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/77492|title=Megabingo will not air on Wednesday in memoriam of owner’s murder|work=News 5 Belize|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=23846|title=Schakron's Businesses in Disarray|work=7 News Belize|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11047">Although an '''antique tool''' might be said to be one that is more than a hundred years old, the term is often used to describe any old tool of quality that might be deemed collectable.

The use of tools is one of the primary means by which humans are distinguished from other animals. Tools are the parents of all other antiques. Most man-made objects were made and great effort goes into the creation of newer and better tools to solve the production problems of today. The study of antique tools provides a glimpse of human development and cultural preferences history.

The creation of a tool often makes possible the creation of more advanced tools. Advanced tools made possible the manufacture of internal-combustion engines, automobiles, and computers. Among those who like to collect, some may do so as part of a rigorous study program - they want to catalog all types of a specific tool, for example. Some collectors may wish to preserve some of the past for future generations, others fall under the spell of the beauty of some antique tools.

== Tool-collecting categories ==
Categories of tools range from the broad - planes, rules, braces, hammers, etc. to the specific - planes made by the Gage Company of Vineland, New Jersey, for example. People who are new to the hobby should know that there are many good modern reference books that will guide you in your search, as well as many reprints of the catalogs in which these tools were originally offered. Often tools will exhibit differences contrasting the different locations of their makers, or different features contrasting different time periods.

The following are some ways people collect tools: 
* Tools of a specific company or maker - for example, [[Leonard Bailey (inventor)|L. Bailey]] Victor tools, Seneca Falls Tool Company tools, Miller's Falls tools, Disston Saws, Chelor planes, etc. 
* Tools of a specific type - hammers, braces, axes, saws, patented planes, transitional planes, treadle-powered machines, etc. 
* Tools of a specific period - tools from 1850 to 1900, post-World War II era tools, etc. 
* Tools from a specific place - Scottish tools, tools from Massachusetts makers, etc. 
* Tools of a specific occupation - cooper's tools, machinist tools, watchmaker's tools, garden tools. 
* A combination of one or more of the above categories — for example, one each of a specific type of Stanley tool, i.e. all Stanley saws, all Stanley marking gauges, all Stanley planes, etc.
* A "type study" of one specific model, for example, a type study of Stanley #6 jointer planes or [[T. Norris &amp; Son|Norris]] A5 smooth planes.
* Tools that show how a specific idea progressed over time, for example tools tracing the development of the plane's adjusting mechanisms, or tools showing how an early patent was bought out and developed by another company. 
* Tool advertising and catalogs.

&lt;!--=== Sickles and scythes ===
The American history of hay cutting tools begins with the reaping hook.  Its slender, ultra sharp, half circle blade was employed in cutting grass for hay and it took some skill to use successfully.  By the late 1800s the less artful sickle became the hay cutting tool of choice.  The blade of the sickle was serrated and less circular than the reaping hook.  The employment of this tool took less finesse and more of a slashing technique.  It was used in conjunction with a wooden grass crook with which one held the standing grass steady, while swinging the sickle blade through the shank.  Sickles found today will seem to have smooth blades to the modern viewer, as the serrations are usually worn away over time.

Scythes are grass cutting tools with long handles for mowing large amounts of hay. The graceful shape of the scythes of the late 18th and early 19th centuries hinted at the grace and art required for using the tool properly.  The blade was straighter than the sickle's, with an almost straight blade side and a gently curved blunt side.  The handle, called a ''snath'', would ordinarily be of a hardwood indigenous to the area of manufacture with small handholds, strategically placed, termed ''nibs''.  The earliest scythes had no nibs.  Later scythes had two nibs.  Used by an experienced hand, the scythe was an efficient tool, slicing through acres of green hay with methodic precision.  Scythes were the prized possession of early Americans and, carefully protected from abuse and weather, they could last for centuries.--&gt;

{{Insolvency}}
'''Bankruptcy''' is a legal status of a person or [[legal person|other entity]] who cannot repay debts to [[creditor]]s. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a [[court order]], often initiated by the [[debtor]].

Bankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person may have, and the term ''bankruptcy'' is therefore not a synonym for [[insolvency]]. In some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], bankruptcy is limited to individuals; other forms of insolvency proceedings (such as [[liquidation]] and [[Administration (law)|administration]]) are applied to companies. In the [[United States]], ''bankruptcy'' is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings. In France, the cognate French word ''banqueroute'' is used solely for cases of fraudulent bankruptcy, whereas the term ''faillite'' (cognate of "failure") is used for bankruptcy in accordance with the law.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) Dictionnaire Le Petit Larousse 2013, p 104 &amp; 446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''bankruptcy'' is derived from Italian ''banca rotta'', meaning "broken bank", which may stem from a widespread custom in the [[Republic of Genoa]] of breaking a moneychanger's bench or counter to signify his insolvency, or which may be only a figure of speech.&lt;ref name="Loveland1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Olds Loveland|title=A treatise on the law and proceedings in bankruptcy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqE9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=1912|publisher=The W.

==History==
{{Main|History of bankruptcy law}}
[[File:John Law cartoon (1720).png|thumb|upright=0.8|Failure of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s [[Mississippi Company]] led to French national bankruptcy in 1720.]]

In [[Ancient Greece]], bankruptcy did not exist. If a man owed and he could not pay, he and his wife, children or servants were forced into "[[debt slavery]]", until the creditor recouped losses through their [[Manual labour|physical labour]]. Many [[Polis|city-states]]  in ancient Greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years; debt slaves had protection of life and limb, which regular slaves did not enjoy. However, servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that [[Time limit|deadline]] by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime, usually under significantly harsher conditions. An exception to this rule was [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], which by the [[Solonian Constitution|laws]] of [[Solon]] forbade enslavement for debt; as a consequence, most Athenian slaves were foreigners (Greek or otherwise).

The [[Statute of Bankrupts Act 1542|Statute of Bankrupts]] of 1542 was the first statute under [[English law]] dealing with bankruptcy or [[insolvency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bankruptcy |first=Edward William Donoghue |last=Manson |volume=3 |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankruptcy is also documented in [[East Asia]]. According to [[al-Maqrizi]], the [[Yassa]] of [[Genghis Khan]] contained a provision that mandated the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for anyone who became bankrupt three times.

A failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] had to declare four [[sovereign default|state bankruptcies]] in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. According to Kenneth S. Rogoff, "Although the development of international capital markets was quite limited prior to 1800, we nevertheless catalog the various defaults of [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Prussia]], [[Spain]], and the early Italian city-states. At the edge of Europe, Egypt, Russia, and Turkey have histories of chronic default as well."&lt;ref&gt;Carmen M. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff (2009). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ak5fLB24ircC&amp;pg=&amp;dq=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly]''". Princeton University Press. p.30. {{ISBN|0-691-14216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern law and debt restructuring==
The principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business [[debt restructuring]] practices no longer rests on the elimination of insolvent entities, but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing [[financial distress]] so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of the business.

For private households, some argue that it is insufficient to merely dismiss debts after a certain period {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. It is important to assess the underlying problems and to minimize the risk of financial distress to re-occur. It has been stressed that debt advice, a supervised rehabilitation period, financial education and social help to find sources of income and to improve the management of household expenditures must be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation (Refiner ''et al.'', 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). In most EU Member States, debt discharge is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtor's behavior. In the United States (US), discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent. The spectrum is broad in the EU, with the UK coming closest to the US system (Reifner et al., 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). The Other Member States do not provide the option of a debt discharge. Spain, for example, passed a bankruptcy law (''ley concurs'') in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt (maximally half of the amount) or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years (Gerhardt, 2009), but it does not foresee debt discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois &amp; Anderson (2010) Managing household debts: Social service provision in the EU. Working paper. Dublin: European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. [http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialprotection/householdebts.htm euro found.europa.eu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107145903/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialprotection/householdebts.htm |date=2013-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, it is very difficult to discharge federal or federally guaranteed student loan debt by filing bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferral|first1=Katelyn|title=Narrow bankruptcy laws make it nearly impossible to discharge student debt|url=http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/narrow-bankruptcy-laws-make-it-nearly-impossible-to-discharge-student/article_927360b1-48c0-5f4c-978b-fcffe910f490.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=The Cap Times|publisher=Madison.com|date=28 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214310/http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/narrow-bankruptcy-laws-make-it-nearly-impossible-to-discharge-student/article_927360b1-48c0-5f4c-978b-fcffe910f490.html|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other debts, those student loans may be discharged only if the person seeking discharge establishes specific grounds for discharge under the ''Brunner'' test,&lt;ref name=brunner&gt;{{cite web|last1=Treff|first1=Leslie|title="Undue Hardship" Under Section 523(a)(8): Can the Debtor's Student Loans Be Discharged?|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/bankruptcy/b/bankruptcy-law-blog/archive/2012/08/30/quot-undue-hardship-quot-under-section-523-a-8-can-the-debtor-s-student-loans-be-discharged.aspx|website=LexisNexis Legal Newsroom|accessdate=13 March 2018|date=29 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314042415/https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/bankruptcy/b/bankruptcy-law-blog/archive/2012/08/30/quot-undue-hardship-quot-under-section-523-a-8-can-the-debtor-s-student-loans-be-discharged.aspx|archivedate=14 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under which the court evaluates three factors:
* If required to repay the loan, the borrower cannot maintain a minimal standard of living;
* The borrower's financial situation is likely to continue for most or all of the repayment period; and
* The borrower has made a good faith effort to repay the student loans.&lt;ref name=brunner/&gt;
Even if a debtor proves all three elements, a court may permit only a partial discharge of the student loan. Student loan borrowers may benefit from restructuring their payments through a [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] bankruptcy repayment plan, but few qualify for discharge of part or all of their student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerson|first1=Seth J.|title=Separate Classification of Student Loans in Chapter 13|journal=Washington University Law Quarterly|date=January 1995|volume=73|issue=1|page=269|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol73/iss1/5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223001445/http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol73/iss1/5/|archivedate=2017-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==
Bankruptcy [[fraud]] is a [[white-collar crime]]. While difficult to generalize across jurisdictions, common criminal acts under bankruptcy statutes typically involve concealment of assets, concealment or destruction of documents, conflicts of interest, fraudulent claims, false statements or declarations, and [[Fee fixing scandal|fee fixing]] or redistribution arrangements. Falsifications on bankruptcy forms often constitute [[perjury]]. Multiple filings are not in and of themselves criminal, but they may violate provisions of bankruptcy law. In the U.S., bankruptcy fraud statutes are particularly focused on the [[Mens rea|mental state]] of particular actions.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 140 Cong. Rec. S14, 461 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 18 U.S.C. sec 152. [http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18USC152.html trac.syr.edu.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725123135/http://www.trac.syr.edu/laws/18USC152.html |date=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankruptcy fraud is a [[federal crime]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 157|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap9-sec157.htm|website=GPO|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507212528/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap9-sec157.htm|archivedate=7 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bankruptcy fraud should be distinguished from ''[[strategic bankruptcy]]'', which is not a [[crime|criminal]] act since it creates a real (not a fake) bankruptcy state. However, it may still work against the filer.

All assets must be disclosed in bankruptcy schedules whether or not the debtor believes the asset has a [[net value]]. This is because once a bankruptcy petition is filed, it is for the creditors, not the debtor, to decide whether a particular asset has value. The future ramifications of omitting assets from schedules can be quite serious for the offending debtor. In the United States, a closed bankruptcy may be reopened by motion of a creditor or the U.S. trustee if a debtor attempts to later assert ownership of such an "unscheduled asset" after being discharged of all debt in the bankruptcy. The trustee may then seize the asset and liquidate it for the benefit of the (formerly discharged) creditors. Whether or not a concealment of such an asset should also be considered for prosecution as fraud or [[perjury]] would then be at the discretion of the judge or U.S. Trustee.

To declare bankruptcy or for a creditor to lodge a petition, the debt must be at least $5,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

All bankrupts must lodge a Statement of Affairs document with AFSA, which includes important information about their assets and liabilities. A bankruptcy cannot be annulled until this document has been lodged.

Ordinarily, a bankruptcy lasts three years from the filing of the Statement of Affairs with AFSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s149.html|title=BANKRUPTCY ACT 1966 - SECT 149 Automatic discharge|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191832/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s149.html|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bankruptcy Trustee (in most cases, the Official Receiver) is appointed to deal with all matters regarding the administration of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee's job includes notifying creditors of the estate and dealing with creditor inquiries; ensuring that the bankrupt complies with their obligations under the Bankruptcy Act; investigating the bankrupt's financial affairs; realising funds to which the estate is entitled under the Bankruptcy Act and distributing dividends to creditors if sufficient funds become available.

For the duration of their bankruptcy, all bankrupts have certain restrictions placed upon them. For example, a bankrupt must obtain the permission of their trustee to travel overseas. Failure to do so may result in the bankrupt being stopped at the airport by the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, a bankrupt is required to provide their trustee with details of income and assets. If the bankrupt does not comply with the Trustee's request to provide details of income, the trustee may have grounds to lodge an Objection to Discharge, which has the effect of extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.

The realisation of funds usually comes from two main sources: the bankrupt's assets and the bankrupt's wages. There are certain assets that are protected, referred to as ''protected assets''. These include household furniture and appliances, tools of the trade and vehicles up to a certain value. All other assets of value are sold. If a house or car is above a certain value, the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate in order to keep the asset. If the bankrupt does not do this, the interest vests in the estate and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it.

The bankrupt must pay income contributions if their income is above a certain threshold. If the bankrupt fails to pay, the trustee can issue a notice to garnishee the bankrupt's wages. If that is not possible, the Trustee may seek to extend the bankruptcy for a further five years.

Bankruptcies can be annulled prior to the expiration of the normal three-year period if all debts are paid out in full. Sometimes a bankrupt may be able to raise enough funds to make an Offer of Composition to creditors, which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed. If the creditors accept the offer, the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received.

After the bankruptcy is annulled or the bankrupt has been automatically discharged, the bankrupt's credit report status is shown as "discharged bankrupt" for some years. The maximum number of years this information can be held is subject to the retention limits under the Privacy Act.  How long such information is on a credit report may be shorter, depending on the issuing company, but the report must cease to record that information based on the criteria in the Privacy Act.

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], the Bankruptcy Law (11.101/05) governs court-ordered or out-of-court receivership and bankruptcy and only applies to public companies (publicly traded companies) with the exception of financial institutions, credit cooperatives, consortia, supplementary scheme entities, companies administering health care plans, equity companies and a few other legal entities. It does not apply to state-run companies.

Current law covers three legal proceedings. The first one is bankruptcy itself ("Falência"). Bankruptcy is a court-ordered liquidation procedure for an insolvent business. The final goal of bankruptcy is to liquidate company assets and pay its creditors.

The second one is Court-ordered Restructuring (''Recuperação Judicial''). The goal is to overcome the business crisis situation of the debtor in order to allow the continuation of the producer, the employment of workers and the interests of creditors, leading, thus, to preserving company, its corporate function and develop economic activity. It's a court procedure required by the debtor which has been in business for more than two years and requires approval by a judge.

The Extrajudicial Restructuring (''Recuperação Extrajudicial'') is a private negotiation that involves creditors and debtors and, as with court-ordered restructuring, also must be approved by courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2004-2006/2005/Lei/L11101.htm |title=Brazil.

===Canada===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Canada}}
Bankruptcy, also referred to as insolvency in Canada, is governed by the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]] and is applicable to businesses and individuals, for example, [[Target Canada]], the Canadian subsidiary of the [[Target Corporation]], the second-largest [[Discount store|discount retailer]] in the United States filed for bankruptcy in January 15, 2015, and closed all of its stores by April 12. The office of the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]], a [[federal government of Canada|federal agency]], is responsible for overseeing that bankruptcies are administered in a fair and orderly manner by all licensed Trustees in Canada.

Trustees in bankruptcy, 1041 individuals licensed to administer insolvencies, bankruptcy and proposal estates and are governed by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act of Canada.

Bankruptcy is filed when a person or a company becomes insolvent and cannot pay their debts as they become due and if they have at least $1,000 in debt.

In 2011, the Superintendent of bankruptcy reported that trustees in Canada filed 127,774 insolvent estates. Consumer estates were the vast majority, with 122 999 estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02805.html |title=Insolvency Statistics in Canada—2011 (Table 2) - Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629074911/http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02805.html |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer portion of the 2011 volume is divided into 77,993 bankruptcies and 45,006 consumer proposals. This represented a reduction of 8.9% from 2010. Commercial estates filed by Canadian trustees in 2011 4,775 estates, 3,643 bankruptcies and 1,132 Division 1 proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02808.html |title=Insolvency Statistics in Canada—2011 (Table 3) - Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629065408/https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02808.html |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a reduction of 8.6% over 2010.

;Duties of trustees:
Some of the duties of the trustee in bankruptcy are to:
* Review the file for any fraudulent preferences or reviewable transactions
* Chair meetings of creditors
* Sell any non-exempt assets
* Object to the bankrupt's discharge
* Distribute funds to creditors

;Creditors' meetings:
Creditors become involved by attending creditors' meetings. The [[trustee]] calls the first meeting of creditors for the following purposes:
* To consider the affairs of the bankrupt
* To affirm the appointment of the trustee or substitute another in place thereof
* To appoint inspectors
* To give such directions to the trustee as the creditors may see fit with reference to the administration of the estate.

;Consumer proposals:
{{Main|Consumer bankruptcy in Canada}}
In Canada, a person can file a consumer proposal as an alternative to bankruptcy. A consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors.

A typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthly payments for a maximum of five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors. Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases, the creditors accept the deal—because if they do not, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, in which the creditors get even less money. The creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal. Once the proposal is accepted by both the creditors and the Court, the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month (or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal), and the general creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action. If the proposal is rejected, the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy.

A consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts to a maximum of $250,000 (not including the mortgage on their principal residence). If debts are greater than $250,000, the proposal must be filed under Division 1 of Part III of the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada)|Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]. An Administrator is required in the Consumer Proposal, and a Trustee in the Division I Proposal (these are virtually the same although the terms are not interchangeable). A Proposal Administrator is almost always a licensed [[trustee]] in bankruptcy, although the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]] may appoint other people to serve as administrators.

In 2006, there were 98,450 personal insolvency filings in Canada: 79,218 bankruptcies and 19,232 consumer proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html "Insolvency in Canada in 2006"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329033435/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html |date=March 29, 2007 }}: Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy ([[Industry Canada]]).

===China===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in China}}
The People's Republic of China legalized bankruptcy in 1986, and a revised law that was more expansive and complete was enacted in 2007.

===Ireland===
[[Bankruptcy in the Republic of Ireland|Bankruptcy in Ireland]] applies only to [[natural person]]s. Other insolvency processes including [[liquidation]] and [[examinership]] are used to deal with corporate insolvency.

Irish bankruptcy law has been the subject of significant comment, from both government sources and the media, as being in need of reform. Part 7 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011&lt;ref name=ACTOF2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0023/sec0030.html#part7|title=Part 7 of the Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2011|accessdate=21 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119020212/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0023/sec0030.html#part7|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has started this process and the government has committed to further reform.

===India===
{{update|section|date=December 2016}}
{{Main|Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code}}
The [[Parliament of India]] in the first week of May 2016 passed [[Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code]] 2016 (New Code). Earlier a clear law on corporate bankruptcy did not exist, even though individual bankruptcy laws have been in existence since 1874. The earlier law in force was enacted in 1920 called the Provincial Insolvency Act.

The legal definitions of the terms bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation and dissolution are contested in the Indian legal system. There is no regulation or statute legislated upon bankruptcy which denotes a condition of inability to meet a demand of a creditor as is common in many other jurisdictions.

Winding up of companies was in the jurisdiction of the courts which can take a decade even after the company has actually been declared insolvent. On the other hand, supervisory restructuring at the behest of the [[Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction]] is generally undertaken using receivership by a public entity.

===The Netherlands===
Dutch bankruptcy law is governed by the Dutch Bankruptcy Code (''Faillissementswet''). The code covers three separate legal proceedings. 
* The first is the bankruptcy (''faillissement''). The goal of the bankruptcy is the liquidation of the assets of the company. The bankruptcy applies to individuals and companies. 
* The second legal proceeding in the ''Faillissementswet'' is the ''surseance van betaling''. The ''surseance van betaling'' only applies to companies. Its goal is to reach an agreement with the creditors of the company. Its is comparable to filing for protection against creditors. 
* The third proceeding is the ''schuldsanering''. This proceeding is designed for individuals only and is the result of a court ruling. The judge appoints a monitor. The monitor is an independent third party who monitors the individual's ongoing business and decides about financial matters during the period of the ''schuldsanering''. The individual can travel out of the country freely after the judge's decision on the case.

=== Russia ===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Russia}}
Federal Law No. 127-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 26 October 2002 (as amended) (the "Bankruptcy Act"), replacing the previous law in 1998, to better address the above problems and a broader failure of the action.
Russian insolvency law is intended for a wide range of borrowers: individuals and companies of all sizes, with the exception of state-owned enterprises, government agencies, political parties and religious organizations. There are also special rules for insurance companies, professional participants of the securities market, agricultural organizations and other special laws for financial institutions and companies in the [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] in the energy industry.
Federal Law No. 40-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 25 February 1999 (as amended) (the "Insolvency Law of Credit Institutions") contains special provisions in relation to the opening of insolvency proceedings in relation to the credit company. Insolvency Provisions Act, credit organizations used in conjunction with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.

Bankruptcy law provides for the following stages of insolvency proceedings:
• Monitoring procedure or Supervision (nablyudeniye);
• The economic recovery (finansovoe ozdorovleniye);
• External control (vneshneye upravleniye);
• Liquidation (konkursnoye proizvodstvo) and
• Amicable Agreement (mirovoye soglasheniye).

The main face of the bankruptcy process is the [http://arbir.ru/contact-insolvency-officer-cheskidov-roman.htm insolvency officer (trustee in bankruptcy, bankruptcy manager)]. At various stages of bankruptcy, he must be determined: the temporary officer in Monitoring procedure, external manager in External control, the receiver or administrative officer in The economic recovery, the liquidator. During the bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy (insolvency officer) has a decisive influence on the movement of assets (property) of the debtor - the debtor and has a key influence on the economic and legal aspects of its operations.

===South Africa===
{{Main|South African insolvency law}}

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, bankruptcy can be a consequence of [[insolvency]]. It is a court-ordered form of debt enforcement proceedings that applies, in general, to registered commercial entities only. In a bankruptcy, all assets of the debtor are liquidated under the administration of the creditors, although the law provides for debt restructuring options similar to those under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, bankruptcy (Swedish: konkurs) is a formal process that may involve a company or individual. It is not the same as [[insolvency]], which is inability to pay debts that should have been paid. A creditor or the company itself can apply for bankruptcy. An external bankruptcy manager takes over the company or the assets of the person, and tries to sell as much as possible. A person or a company in bankruptcy can not access its assets (with some exceptions).

The formal bankruptcy process is rarely carried out for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html |title=Konkurs&amp;nbsp;– Vad är konkurs? |language=sv |publisher=Skatteverket.se |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809022942/http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creditors can claim money through the [[Enforcement Administration (Sweden)|Enforcement Administration]] anyway, and creditors do not usually benefit from the bankruptcy of individuals because there are costs of a [[Trustee in bankruptcy|bankruptcy manager]] which has priority. Unpaid debts remain after bankruptcy for individuals. People who are deeply in debt can obtain a debt arrangement procedure (Swedish: skuldsanering). On application, they obtain a payment plan under which they pay as much as they can for five years, and then all remaining debts are cancelled. Debts that derive from a ban on business operations (issued by court, commonly for tax fraud or fraudulent business practices) or owed to a crime victim as compensation for damages, are exempted from this—and, as before this process was introduced in 2006, remain lifelong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 |title=Evighetsgäldenärer, synpunkter från Skatteverket 2004 Skatteverkets skrivelse 041229 |language=sv |publisher=Fattiga.se |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314232824/http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debts that have not been claimed during a 3-10 year period are cancelled. Often crime victims stop their claims after a few years since criminals often do not have job incomes and might be hard to locate, while banks make sure their claims are not cancelled. The most common reasons for personal insolvency in Sweden are illness, unemployment, divorce or company bankruptcy.

For companies, formal bankruptcy is a normal effect of insolvency, even if there is a reconstruction mechanism where the company can be given time to solve its situation, e.g. by finding an investor. The formal bankruptcy involves contracting a bankruptcy manager, who makes certain that assets are sold and money divided by the priority the law claims, and no other way. Banks have such a priority. After a finished bankruptcy for a company, it is terminated. The activities might continue in a new company which has bought important assets from the bankrupted company.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|UK insolvency law|Liquidation|Administration (insolvency)}}
[[Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom]] (in a strict legal sense) relates only to individuals (including [[Sole Trader Insolvency|sole proprietors]]) and [[partnership]]s. Companies and other [[corporation]]s enter into differently named legal insolvency procedures: [[liquidation]] and [[administration (law)|administration]] ([[administration order]] and [[administrative receivership]]). However, the term 'bankruptcy' is often used when referring to companies in the media and in general conversation. Bankruptcy in Scotland is referred to as [[sequestration (law)|sequestration]]. To apply for bankruptcy in Scotland, an individual must have more than £1,500 of debt.

A [[trustee in bankruptcy]] must be either an [[Official Receiver]] (a civil servant) or a licensed [[insolvency practitioner]]. Current law in England and Wales derives in large part from the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]. Following the introduction of the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], a UK bankruptcy now normally last no longer than 12 months, and may be less if the Official Receiver files in court a certificate that investigations are complete. It was expected that the UK Government's liberalisation of the UK bankruptcy regime would increase the number of bankruptcy cases; initially, cases increased, as the Insolvency Service statistics appear to bear out. Since 2009, the introduction of the [[Debt Relief Order]] has resulted in a dramatic fall in bankruptcies, the latest estimates for year 2014/15 being significantly less than 30,000 cases.

;Pensions:
The UK bankruptcy law was changed in May 2000, effective May 29, 2000.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-bankruptcy/guide-to-bankruptcy|title=Guide to Bankruptcy|author=|date=|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217083152/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-bankruptcy/guide-to-bankruptcy|archivedate=17 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debtors may now retain occupational [[pensions]] while in bankruptcy, except in rare cases.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;

;Proposed reform:
The Government have updated legislation (2016) to streamline the application process for UK bankruptcy. UK residents now need to apply online for bankruptcy - there is an upfront fee of £655. The process for residents of Northern Ireland differs - applicants must follow the older process of applying through the courts.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"/&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in the United States}}
[[File:Detroit, USA Taken From Windsor, Canada.jpg|thumb|right|In 2013, Detroit filed the [[Detroit bankruptcy|largest municipal bankruptcy case]] in U.S. history.]]
Bankruptcy in the United States is a matter placed under [[Law of the United States|federal jurisdiction]] by the [[United States Constitution]] (in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4), which empowers [[United States Congress|Congress]] to enact "uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States". Congress has enacted [[statutory law|statutes]] governing bankruptcy, primarily in the form of the Bankruptcy Code, located at Title 11 of the [[United States Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Code: Title 11 - Bankruptcy|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923215631/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11|archivedate=23 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A debtor declares bankruptcy to obtain relief from debt, and this is normally accomplished either through a discharge of the debt or through a restructuring of the debt. When a debtor files a voluntary petition, their bankruptcy case commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 301 - Voluntary cases|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/301|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221326/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/301|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debts and exemptions====
While bankruptcy cases are always filed in [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] (an adjunct to the [[U.S. District Courts]]), bankruptcy cases, particularly with respect to the validity of claims and exemptions, are often dependent upon State law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 522 - Exemptions|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809225102/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bankruptcy Exemption defines the property a debtor may retain and preserve through bankruptcy. Certain real and personal property can be exempted on "Schedule C"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/BK_Forms_Official_2010/B_006C_0410.pdf |title=Schedule C- Property Claimed as Exempt |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610221416/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/BK_Forms_Official_2010/B_006C_0410.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a debtor's bankruptcy forms, and effectively be taken outside the debtor's bankruptcy estate. Bankruptcy exemptions are available only to individuals filing bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Glossary.aspx |title=Bankruptcy Exemptions Available to Individuals |publisher=Uscourts.gov |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310230239/http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Glossary.aspx |archivedate=2014-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two alternative systems that can be used to "exempt" property from a bankruptcy estate, federal exemptions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522 |title=Federal Bankruptcy Exemptions: 11 USC § 522 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226000317/http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522 |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (available in some states but not all), and state exemptions (which vary widely between states). For example, Maryland and Virginia, which are adjoining states, have different personal exemption amounts that cannot be seized for payment of debts. This amount is the first $6,000 in property or cash in Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Maryland, Sec. 11–504|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcj&amp;section=11-504&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2018RS&amp;tab=subject5|website=General Assembly of Maryland|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220929/http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcj&amp;section=11-504&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2018RS&amp;tab=subject5|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but normally only the first $5,000 in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Virginia, Sec. 34-4.

After a bankruptcy petition is filed, the court schedules a hearing called a ''341 meeting'' or ''meeting of creditors'', at which the bankruptcy trustee and creditors review the petitioner's petition and supporting schedules, question the petitioner, and can challenge exemptions they believe are improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a 341(a) Meeting of Creditors?|url=http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/faq/general-bankruptcy/what-341a-meeting-creditors|website=United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of California|publisher=United States Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611070109/http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/faq/general-bankruptcy/what-341a-meeting-creditors|archivedate=11 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chapters====
There are six types of bankruptcy under the [[Title 11 of the United States Code|Bankruptcy Code]], located at Title 11 of the [[United States Code]]:
* [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]]: basic liquidation for individuals and businesses; also known as straight bankruptcy; it is the simplest and quickest form of bankruptcy available
* [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9]]: municipal bankruptcy; a federal mechanism for the resolution of municipal debts
* [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]]: rehabilitation or reorganization, used primarily by business debtors, but sometimes by individuals with substantial debts and assets; known as corporate bankruptcy, it is a form of corporate financial reorganisation which typically allows companies to continue to function while they follow debt repayment plans
* [[Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 12]]: rehabilitation for family farmers and fishermen;
* [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]]: rehabilitation with a payment plan for individuals with a regular source of income; enables individuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their debts; also known as Wage Earner Bankruptcy
* [[Chapter 15, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 15]]: ancillary and other international cases; provides a mechanism for dealing with bankruptcy debtors and helps foreign debtors to clear debts.

An important feature applicable to all types of bankruptcy filings is the [[automatic stay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 362 - Automatic stay|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827104847/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automatic stay means that the mere request for bankruptcy protection automatically halts most lawsuits, repossessions, foreclosures, evictions, garnishments, attachments, utility shut-offs, and debt collection activity.

The most common types of [[personal bankruptcy]] for individuals are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Chapter 7, known as a "straight bankruptcy" involves the discharge of certain debts without repayment. Chapter 13, involves a plan of repayment of debts over a period of years. Whether a person qualifies for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 is in part determined by income.&lt;ref name="C7Basics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629140922/http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics|archivedate=29 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 Means Test Calculation|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/form_b_122a-2.pdf|website=United States Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501105632/http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/form_b_122a-2.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 65% of all U.S. consumer bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7 cases.

Before a consumer may obtain bankruptcy relief under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, the debtor is to undertake [[credit counselling]] with approved counseling agencies prior to filing a bankruptcy petition and to undertake education in personal financial management from approved agencies prior to being granted a discharge of debts under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Some studies of the operation of the credit counseling requirement suggest that it provides little benefit to debtors who receive the counseling because the only realistic option for many is to seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Yvonne D. (2007). "Bankruptcy Reform: Value of Credit Counseling Requirement Is Not Clear (GAO-07-203)". Washington, D.C.: Government Accountability Office. p. (Highlights). {{LCCN|2007414394}}. {{OCLC|156274430}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations and other business forms normally file under Chapters 7 or 11.

=====Chapter 7=====
{{main|Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code}}
Often called "straight bankruptcy" or "simple bankruptcy," a Chapter 7 bankruptcy potentially allows debtors to eliminate most or all of their debts over a period of as little as three or four months. In a typical consumer bankruptcy, the only debts that survive a Chapter 7 are [[student loan]]s, [[child support]] obligations, some tax bills and criminal fines. Credit cards, pay day loans, personal loans, medical bills, and just about all other bills are discharged.

In Chapter 7, a debtor surrenders non-exempt property to a bankruptcy trustee, who then liquidates the property and distributes the proceeds to the debtor's unsecured creditors. In exchange, the debtor is entitled to a discharge of some debt. However, the debtor is not granted a discharge if guilty of certain types of inappropriate behavior (e.g., concealing records relating to financial condition) and certain debts (e.g., spousal and child support and most student loans). Some taxes are not discharged even though the debtor is generally discharged from debt. Many individuals in financial distress own only exempt property (e.g., clothes, household goods, an older car, or the tools of their trade or profession) and do not have to surrender any property to the trustee.&lt;ref name="C7Basics"/&gt; The amount of property that a debtor may exempt varies from state to state (as noted above, Virginia and Maryland have a $1,000 difference.) Chapter 7 relief is available only once in any eight-year period. Generally, the rights of secured creditors to their collateral continues, even though their debt is discharged. For example, absent some arrangement by a debtor to surrender a car or "reaffirm" a debt, the creditor with a [[security interest]] in the debtor's car may repossess the car even if the debt to the creditor is discharged.

Ninety-one percent of U.S. individuals who petition for relief under Chapter 7 hire an attorney to file their petitions.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215234421/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical cost of an attorney is $1,170.00.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"/&gt; Alternatives to filing with an attorney are: filing pro se,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|title=Bankruptcy Forms|author=|date=|website=uscourts.gov|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505070637/http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hiring a non-lawyer petition preparer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preparing Petitions: It Irks the Lawyers, But Is It Lawyering?|author=Adam Liptak|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624170126/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|archivedate=June 24, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or using online software to generate the petition.

To be eligible to file a consumer bankruptcy under Chapter 7, a debtor must qualify under a statutory "means test".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pewlaw.com/bankruptcy/arizona-bankruptcy-means-test/|title=Arizona Bankruptcy Means Test - Pew Law Center|newspaper=Pew Law Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108190251/http://pewlaw.com/bankruptcy/arizona-bankruptcy-means-test/|archivedate=2017-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The means test was intended to make it more difficult for a significant number of financially distressed individual debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts to qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The "means test" is employed in cases where an individual with primarily consumer debts has more than the average annual income for a household of equivalent size, computed over a 180-day period prior to filing. If the individual must "take" the "means test", their average monthly income over this 180-day period is reduced by a series of allowances for living expenses and secured debt payments in a very complex calculation that may or may not accurately reflect that individual's actual monthly budget. If the results of the means test show no disposable income (or in some cases a very small amount) then the individual qualifies for Chapter 7 relief. An individual who fails the means test will have their Chapter 7 case dismissed, or may have to convert the case to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

If a debtor does not qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, either because of the Means Test or because Chapter 7 does not provide a permanent solution to delinquent payments for secured debts, such as mortgages or vehicle loans, the debtor may still seek relief under Chapter 13 of the Code. A Chapter 13 plan often does not require repayment to general unsecured debts, such as credit cards or medical bills.

Generally, a trustee sells most of the debtor's assets to pay off creditors. However, certain debtor assets will be protected to some extent by bankruptcy exemptions. These include Social Security payments, unemployment compensation, limited equity in a home, car, or truck, household goods and appliances, trade tools, and books. However, these exemptions vary from state to state.

=====Chapter 11=====
{{main|Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code}}
In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets and is re-termed a [[debtor in possession]] (DIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 1101 - Definitions for this chapter|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1101|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221324/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1101|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debtor in possession runs the day-to-day operations of the business while creditors and the debtor work with the Bankruptcy Court in order to negotiate and complete a plan. Upon meeting certain requirements (e.g., fairness among creditors, priority of certain creditors) creditors are permitted to vote on the proposed plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 1126 - Acceptance of plan|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1126|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220225/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1126|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a plan is confirmed, the debtor continues to operate and pay debts under the terms of the confirmed plan. If a specified majority of creditors do not vote to confirm a plan, additional requirements may be imposed by the court in order to confirm the plan. Debtors filing for Chapter 11 protection a second time are known informally as "Chapter 22" filers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204124204577151211961572458|title=Twinkies Maker Preparing for Chapter 11 Filing|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 10, 2012|first=Mike|last=Spector|first2=Julie|last2=Jargon|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709060131/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204124204577151211961572458|archivedate=July 9, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chapter 13=====
{{main|Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code}}
In Chapter 13, debtors retain ownership and possession of all their assets, but must devote some portion of future income to repaying creditors, generally over three to five years.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Chapter 13 Bankruptcy|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/chapter_13_bankruptcy.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=15 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220135/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/chapter_13_bankruptcy.html|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of payment and period of the repayment plan depend upon a variety of factors, including the value of the debtor's property and the amount of a debtor's income and expenses.&lt;ref name="bbasics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 13 - Bankruptcy Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020210719/http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this chapter, the debtor can propose a repayment plan in which to pay creditors over three to five years. If the monthly income is less than the state's median income, the plan is for three years, unless the court finds "just cause" to extend the plan for a longer period. If the debtor's monthly income is greater than the median income for individuals in the debtor's state, the plan must generally be for five years. A plan cannot exceed the five-year limit.&lt;ref name="bbasics"/&gt;

Relief under Chapter 13 is available only to individuals with regular income whose debts do not exceed prescribed limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 109 - Who may be a debtor|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220224/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the debtor is an individual or a sole proprietor, the debtor is allowed to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay all or part of the debts. Secured creditors may be entitled to greater payment than unsecured creditors.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

In contrast to Chapter 7, the debtor in Chapter 13 may keep all property, whether or not exempt. If the plan appears feasible and if the debtor complies with all the other requirements, the bankruptcy court typically confirms the plan and the debtor and creditors are bound by its terms. Creditors have no say in the formulation of the plan, other than to object to it, if appropriate, on the grounds that it does not comply with one of the Code's statutory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rule 3015.

When the debtor completes payments pursuant to the terms of the plan, the court formally grant the debtor a discharge of the debts provided for in the plan.&lt;ref name="bbasics"/&gt; However, if the debtor fails to make the agreed upon payments or fails to seek or gain court approval of a modified plan, a bankruptcy court will normally dismiss the case on the motion of the trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rule 1017.

===Europe===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}
In 2004, the number of insolvencies reached record highs in many European countries. In [[France]], company insolvencies rose by more than 4%, in [[Austria]] by more than 10%, and in [[Greece]] by more than 20%. The increase in the number of insolvencies, however, does not indicate the total financial impact of insolvencies in each country because there is no indication of the size of each case. An increase in the number of bankruptcy cases does not necessarily entail an increase in bad debt write-off rates for the economy as a whole.

Bankruptcy statistics are also a trailing indicator. There is a time delay between financial difficulties and bankruptcy. In most cases, several months or even years pass between the financial problems and the start of bankruptcy proceedings. Legal, tax, and cultural issues may further distort bankruptcy figures, especially when comparing on an international basis. Two examples:
* In [[Austria]], more than half of all potential bankruptcy proceedings in 2004 were not opened, due to insufficient funding.
* In [[Spain]], it is not economically profitable to open insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings against certain types of businesses, and therefore the number of insolvencies is quite low. For comparison: In [[France]], more than 40,000 insolvency proceedings were opened in 2004, but under 600 were opened in Spain. At the same time the average bad debt write-off rate in France was 1.3% compared to Spain with 2.6%.

The insolvency numbers for private individuals also do not show the whole picture. Only a fraction of heavily indebted households file for insolvency. Two of the main reasons for this are the stigma of declaring themselves insolvent and the potential business disadvantage.

Following the soar in insolvencies in the last decade, a number of European countries, such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, began to revamp their bankruptcy laws in 2013. They modelled these new laws after the image of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Currently, the majority of insolvency cases have ended in liquidation in Europe rather than the businesses surviving the crisis. These new law models are meant to change this; lawmakers are hoping to turn bankruptcy into a chance for restructuring rather than a death sentence for the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578398612178796882|title=Europe Builds Own Chapter 11|last=Ball|first=Deborah|date=2013-04-05|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122222544/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578398612178796882|archivedate=2016-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective sovereign bankruptcy==
Technically, states do not collapse directly due to a [[sovereign default]] event itself.  However, the tumultuous events that follow may bring down the state, so in common language we do describe states as being bankrupted.

Some examples of this are when a Korean state bankrupted Imperial China causing its destruction, or more specifically, when [[Chang'an]]'s ([[Sui Dynasty]]) war with [[Pyongyang]] ([[Goguryeo]]) in 614 A.D. ended in the former's disintegration within 4 years, although the latter also seemingly entered into decline and fell some 56 years later.&lt;ref&gt;"Koguryo". Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved October 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is when the United States, with heavy financial backing from its allies (creditors), bankrupted the [[Soviet Union]] which led to the latter's demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm|title=The Collapse of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan|author=|date=|website=wais.stanford.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322191321/http://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2251">'''Benchmark price''' (BP) is the price per unit of quantity of a [[commodity]] traded in the international marketplace, set by the country or producers' organization that consistently exports the largest quantity or volume of the commodity or in a marketplace such as the [[London Metal Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lme.com/pricing-and-data/pricing/official-price/|title=LME Official Price|publisher=London Metal Exchange|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/petrol-diesel-and-lpg/about-fuel-prices|title=About fuel prices|publisher=Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This price is set periodically, usually monthly and serves as a guideline for international trade in the commodity.

The term "benchmark" can be applied to many aspects of public concern, such as quality, services, attitudes and others, denoting the highest standards achieved in such spheres. For example, a school or university could be cited as setting the benchmark for education. A hotel could be cited as setting the benchmark for quality of service. The phrase "international benchmark price", however, is synonymous with prices of commodities in international trade.

Benchmark prices apply to all [[commodities]]. An example is the benchmark prices that apply to crude oil in the international marketplace.

It is not mandatory for exporting countries or importing countries to use the benchmark price as [[international trade]] is based on favourable prices. Traders use the benchmark price as a guide for [[spot trading]] and trading in [[commodity futures]].

The benchmark price is often the most important consideration when determining export prices.

A commodity will sell for more or less than the benchmark price depending on how it compares to the benchmark commodity (percentage of undesirable components such as sulfur, for example) and where it is to be delivered, if other than the benchmark price's [[pdelivery point]].

A '''blowmolding machine''' is widely used in commercial beverage production. A blowmolding machine creates a [[plastic bottle]] according to a recipe, for example specifying the capacity of the bottle to be made. The machine consists of molds, a [[programmable logic controller]], and mechanical and electronic instruments.

For more information about the process, refer to [[Blow molding]].

'''Elias Elia''' is a [[Greek Cypriot]] businessman whose profile made headlines after multiple airlines across Europe collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aangirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/airline-goes-bust-mysterious-elias-elia.html|work=Analysis|accessdate=6 September 2012|title=Mysterious Elias Elia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the owner of [[E-Clear]], a $ billion company that handled payments mostly for the travel industry.

==Background==
Elias was successful in the travel payment industry. In an interview he said, "We're here today to expand on the collaborations with airlines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elias Elia, CEO, eClear|url=http://www.terrapinn.com/story.aspx?id=51|publisher=Terrapinn|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He tried to prop up another company after buying [[E-Clear]] back from its administrators. A report claimed that Elia bought a brand-new £135,000 Ferrari in the spring of 2008 and a £155,000 Rolls-Royce Phantom, in May of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/elias-eliarsquos-buyback-of-bits-of-collapsed-eclear-investigated-1986709.html|publisher=Independent|title=Elias Elia buys back bits of collapsed EClear | location=London|first=Simon|last=Evans|date=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Companies==
Links were found from Elias to Elian properties and the Allbury Travel Group, both of which also went into administration soon after E-Clear's demise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23776">The '''envelope theorem''' is a result about the   differentiability properties of the objective function of a parameterized optimization problem. As we change parameters of the objective, the envelope theorem shows that, in a certain sense, changes in the optimizer of the objective do not contribute to the change in the objective function. The envelope theorem is an important tool for [[comparative statics]] of [[optimization]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Carter |title=Foundations of Mathematical Economics |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-262-53192-5 |pages=603–609 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KysvrGGfzq0C&amp;pg=PA603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;f(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{j}(x,\alpha), j = 1,2, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; be real-valued continuously [[differentiable function]]s on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+l}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; are choice variables and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^{l}&lt;/math&gt; are parameters, and consider the problem of choosing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, for a given &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so as to:
:&lt;math&gt; \max_{x} f(x, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;g_{j}(x,\alpha) \geq 0, j = 1,2, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
The Lagrangian expression of this problem is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} (x, \lambda, \alpha) = f(x, \alpha) + \lambda \cdot g(x, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{m}&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrange multipliers. Now let &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\ast}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; together be the solution that maximizes the objective function ''f'' subject to the constraints (and hence are [[saddle point]]s of the Lagrangian),
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^{\ast} (\alpha) \equiv f(x^{\ast}(\alpha), \alpha) + \lambda^{\ast}(\alpha) \cdot g(x^{\ast}(\alpha), \alpha),&lt;/math&gt;
and define the value function
:&lt;math&gt;V(\alpha) \equiv f(x^{\ast}(\alpha), \alpha).&lt;/math&gt;
Then we have the following theorem.&lt;ref name="Afriat, 1971"&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. N. |last=Afriat |year=1971 |title=Theory of Maxima and the Method of Lagrange |journal=[[SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics]] |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=343–357 |doi=10.1137/0120037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Akira |last=Takayama |title=Mathematical Economics |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=Second |year=1985 |isbn=0-521-31498-4 |pages=137–138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6PLOBFotPQC&amp;pg=PA137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem:''' ''Assume that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; are continuously differentiable. Then''
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial V(\alpha)}{\partial \alpha_{k}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^{\ast} (\alpha)}{\partial \alpha_{k}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L} (x^{\ast} (\alpha), \lambda^{\ast} (\alpha), \alpha)}{\partial \alpha_{k}}, k = 1, 2, \ldots, l&lt;/math&gt;
''where &lt;math&gt;\partial \mathcal{L} / \partial \alpha_{k} = \partial f / \partial \alpha_{k} + \lambda \cdot \partial g / \partial \alpha_{k}&lt;/math&gt;''.

==For arbitrary choice sets==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denote the choice set and let the relevant parameter be &lt;math&gt;t\in \lbrack 0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Letting &lt;math&gt;f:X\times \lbrack 0,1]\rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; denote the parameterized objective function, the value function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and the optimal choice correspondence (set-valued function) &lt;math&gt;X^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; are given by:

:&lt;math&gt; V(t) =\sup_{x\in X}f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; (1)
:&lt;math&gt; X^{\ast }(t) =\{x\in X:f(x,t)=V(t)\}&lt;/math&gt; (2)

"Envelope theorems" describe sufficient conditions for the value function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be differentiable in the parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and describe its derivative as

:&lt;math&gt; V^{\prime }\left( t\right) =f_{t}\left( x,t\right) \text{ for each }x\in X^{\ast }\left( t\right),&lt;/math&gt; (3)

where &lt;math&gt;f_{t}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Namely, the derivative of the value function with respect to the parameter equals the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; holding the maximizer fixed at its optimal level. (The term derives from describing the graph of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as the "upper envelope" of the graphs of the parameterized family of functions &lt;math&gt;\left\{ f\left( x,\cdot \right) \right\} _{x\in X}&lt;/math&gt;.)

Traditional envelope theorem derivations use the first-order condition for (1), which requires that the choice set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have the convex and topological structure, and the objective function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be differentiable in the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. (The argument is that changes in the maximizer have only a "second-order effect" at the optimum and so can be ignored.) However, in many applications such as the analysis of incentive constraints in contract theory and game theory, nonconvex production problems, and "monotone" or "robust" comparative statics, the choice sets and objective functions generally lack the topological and convexity properties required by the traditional envelope theorems.

[[Paul Milgrom]] and Segal (2002) observe that the traditional envelope formula holds for optimization problems with arbitrary choice sets at any differentiability point of the value function,&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002" /&gt; provided that the objective function is differentiable in the parameter:

'''Theorem 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;t\in \left( 0,1\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in X^{\ast }\left(t\right) &lt;/math&gt;. If both &lt;math&gt;V^{\prime }\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{t}\left(x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt; exist, the envelope formula (3) holds.

'''Proof:''' (1) implies that for &lt;math&gt;x\in X^{\ast }\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \max_{s\in \left[ 0,1\right] }\left[ f\left( x,s\right) -V\left( s\right)\right] =f\left( x,t\right) -V\left( t\right) =0. &lt;/math&gt;

Under the assumptions, the objective function of the displayed maximization problem is differentiable at &lt;math&gt;s=t&lt;/math&gt;, and the first-order condition for this maximization is exactly (3). Q.E.D.

While differentiability of the value function in general requires strong assumptions, in many applications weaker conditions such as absolute continuity, differentiability almost everywhere, or left- and right-differentiability, suffice. In particular, Milgrom and Segal 's (2002) Theorem 2 offers a sufficient condition for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be absolutely continuous,&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002" /&gt; which means that it is differentiable almost everywhere and can be represented as an integral of its derivative:

'''Theorem 2:''' Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot )&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose also that there exists an integrable function &lt;math&gt;b:[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{+}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f_{t}(x,t)|\leq b(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and almost all &lt;math&gt;t\in \lbrack 0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous. Suppose, in addition, that &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot )&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;X^{\ast }(t)\neq \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere on &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any selection &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }(t)\in X^{\ast }(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; V(t)=V(0)+\int_{0}^{t}f_{t}(x^{\ast }(s),s)ds. &lt;/math&gt; (4)

'''Proof:''' Using (1), observe that for any &lt;math&gt;t^{\prime},t^{\prime \prime }\in \lbrack 0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t^{\prime }&lt;t^{\prime \prime }&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; |V(t^{\prime \prime })-V(t^{\prime })| \leq \sup_{x\in X}|f(x,t^{\prime\prime })-f(x,t^{\prime })| =\sup_{x\in X}\left\vert \int_{t^{\prime }}^{t^{\prime \prime }}f_{t}(x,t)dt\right\vert \leq \int_{t^{\prime }}^{t^{\prime \prime
}}\sup_{x\in X}|f_{t}(x,t)|dt\leq \int_{t^{\prime }}^{t^{\prime \prime }}b(t)dt.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable almost everywhere, and using (3) yields (4). Q.E.D.

This result dispels the common misconception that nice behavior of the value function requires correspondingly nice behavior of the maximizer. Theorem 2 ensures the [[absolute continuity]] of the value function even though the maximizer may be discontinuous. In a similar vein, Milgrom and Segal's (2002) Theorem 3 implies that the value function must be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;t=t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and hence satisfy the envelope formula (3) when the family &lt;math&gt;\left\{ f\left( x,\cdot \right) \right\} _{x\in X}&lt;/math&gt; is equi-differentiable at &lt;math&gt;t_{0}\in \left( 0,1\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{t}\left(X^{\ast }\left( t\right) ,t_{0}\right) &lt;/math&gt; is single-valued and continuous at &lt;math&gt;t=t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, even if the maximizer is not differentiable at &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; (e.g., if &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt; is described by a set of inequality constraints and the set of binding constraints changes at &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Applications to producer theory===
Theorem 1 implies [[Hotelling's lemma]] at any differentiability point of the profit function, and Theorem 2 implies the [[producer surplus]] formula. Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\pi \left( p\right) &lt;/math&gt; denote the profit function of a price-taking firm with production set &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{L}&lt;/math&gt; facing prices &lt;math&gt;p\in \mathbb{R}^{L}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }\left( p\right) &lt;/math&gt; denote the firm's supply function, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \pi (p)=\max_{x\in X}p\cdot x=p\cdot x^{\ast }\left( p\right) \text{.} &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;t=p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; (the price of good &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;) and fix the other goods' prices at &lt;math&gt;p_{-i}\in \mathbb{R}^{L-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Applying Theorem 1 to &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)=tx_{i}+p_{-i}\cdot x_{-i}&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \pi (p)}{\partial p_{i}}=x_{i}^{\ast }(p)&lt;/math&gt; (the firm's optimal supply of good &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;). Applying Theorem 2 (whose assumptions are verified when &lt;math&gt;p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is restricted to a bounded interval) yields

:&lt;math&gt;\pi (t,p_{-i})-\pi (0,p_{-i})=\int_{0}^{p_{i}}x_{i}^{\ast }(s,p_{-i})ds, &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the producer surplus &lt;math&gt;\pi (t,p_{-i})-\pi (0,p_{-i})&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by integrating under the firm's supply curve for good &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications to mechanism design and auction theory===
Consider an agent whose utility function &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; over outcomes &lt;math&gt;x\in \bar{X}&lt;/math&gt; depends on his type &lt;math&gt;t\in \lbrack 0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \bar{X}&lt;/math&gt; represent the "menu" of possible outcomes the agent could obtain in the mechanism by sending different messages. The agent's equilibrium utility &lt;math&gt;V(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the mechanism is then given by (1), and the set &lt;math&gt;X^{\ast }(t)&lt;/math&gt; of the mechanism's equilibrium outcomes is given by (2). Any selection &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }(t)\in X^{\ast }(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a choice rule implemented by the mechanism. Suppose that the agent's utility function &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable and absolutely continuous in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in Y&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in \bar{X}}|f_{t}(x,t)|&lt;/math&gt; is integrable on &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then Theorem 2 implies that the agent's equilibrium utility &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in any mechanism implementing a given choice rule &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the integral condition (4).

The integral condition (4) is a key step in the analysis of mechanism design problems with continuous type spaces. In particular, in Myerson's (1981) analysis of single-item auctions, the outcome from the viewpoint of one bidder can be described as &lt;math&gt;x=\left( y,z\right) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the bidder's probability of receiving the object and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is his expected payment, and the bidder's expected utility takes the form &lt;math&gt;f\left( \left( y,z\right) ,t\right) =ty-z&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, letting &lt;math&gt;\underline{t}&lt;/math&gt; denote the bidder's lowest possible type, the integral condition (4) for the bidder's equilibrium expected utility &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; takes the form

:&lt;math&gt; V(t)-V(\underline{t})=\int_{0}^{t}y^{\ast }(s)ds. &lt;/math&gt;

(This equation can be interpreted as the producer surplus formula for the firm whose production technology for converting numeraire &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; into probability &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of winning the object is defined by the auction and which resells the object at a fixed price &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;). This condition in turn yields Myerson's (1981) celebrated [[Revenue equivalence|revenue equivalence theorem]]: the expected revenue generated in an auction in which bidders have independent private values is fully determined by the bidders' probabilities &lt;math&gt;y^{\ast }\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; of getting the object for all types &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as well as by the expected payoffs &lt;math&gt;V(\underline{t})&lt;/math&gt; of the bidders' lowest types. Finally, this condition is a key step in Myerson's (1981) of optimal auctions.&lt;ref name="Myerson, 1981" /&gt;

(One example is the class of trading problems with linear utility described in chapter 6.5 of Myerson (1991).&lt;ref name="Myerson, 1991"&gt;{{cite book | author= Myerson, Roger |title=Game Theory| year=1991 | publisher = Cambridge, Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Note that the integral condition (3) still holds in this setting and implies such important results as Holmstrom's lemma (Holmstrom, 1979),&lt;ref name="Holmstrom, 1979" /&gt; Myerson's lemma (Myerson, 1981),&lt;ref name="Myerson, 1981"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Myerson, Roger | title= Optimal Auction Design| journal=Mathematics of Operations Research | year=1981| volume=6 | pages=58–73 | doi=10.1287/moor.6.1.58}}&lt;/ref&gt; the revenue equivalence theorem (for auctions), the Green–Laffont–Holmstrom theorem (Green and Laffont, 1979; Holmstrom, 1979),&lt;ref name="Green and Laffont, 1979"&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=J. |last2=Laffont |first2=J.

===Applications to multidimensional parameter spaces===
For a multidimensional parameter space &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{K}&lt;/math&gt;, Theorem
1 can be applied to partial and directional derivatives of the value
function. If both the objective function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the value function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are
(totally) differentiable in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, Theorem 1 implies the envelope formula for
their gradients: &lt;math&gt;\nabla V\left( t\right) =\nabla _{t}f\left( x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt;
for each &lt;math&gt;x\in X^{\ast }\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt;. While total differentiability of
the value function may not be easy to ensure, Theorem 2 can be still applied
along any smooth path connecting two parameter values &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
Namely, suppose that functions &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot )&lt;/math&gt; are differentiable for all &lt;math&gt;
x\in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\nabla _{t}f(x,t)|\leq B&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;t\in T&lt;/math&gt;. A
smooth path from &lt;math&gt;t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is described by a differentiable mapping &lt;math&gt;
\gamma :\left[ 0,1\right] \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; with a bounded derivative, such
that &lt;math&gt;\gamma \left( 0\right) =t_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma \left( 1\right) =t&lt;/math&gt;.
Theorem 2 implies that for any such smooth path, the change of the value
function can be expressed as the [[line integral|path integral]] of the partial gradient &lt;math&gt;
\nabla _{t}f(x^{\ast }(t),t)&lt;/math&gt; of the objective function along the path:

:&lt;math&gt; V(t)-V(t_{0})=\int_{\gamma }\nabla _{t}f(x^{\ast }(s),s)\cdot ds. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for &lt;math&gt;t=t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, this establishes that cyclic path integrals
along any smooth path &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt; must be zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \nabla _{t}f(x^{\ast }(s),s)\cdot ds=0. &lt;/math&gt;

This "integrability condition" plays an important role in mechanism design with multidimensional types, constraining what kind of choice rules &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; can be sustained by mechanism-induced menus &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \bar{X}&lt;/math&gt;. In application to producer theory, with &lt;math&gt;x\in X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{L}&lt;/math&gt; being the firm's production vector and &lt;math&gt;t\in \mathbb{R}^{L}&lt;/math&gt; being the price vector, &lt;math&gt;f\left( x,t\right) =t\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, and the integrability condition says that any rationalizable supply function &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; \int x^{\ast }(s)\cdot ds=0. &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast }&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable, this integrability condition is equivalent to the symmetry of the [[substitution matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\partial x_{i}^{\ast }\left( t\right) /\partial t_{j}\right) _{i,j=1}^{L}&lt;/math&gt;. (In [[consumer theory]], the same argument applied to the expenditure minimization problem yields symmetry of the [[Slutsky matrix]].)

===Applications to parameterized constraints===
Suppose now that the feasible set &lt;math&gt;X\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; depends on the parameter, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; V(t) =\sup_{x\in X\left( t\right) }f(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; X^{\ast }(t) =\{x\in X\left( t\right) :f(x,t)=V(t)\}\text{, } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; X\left( t\right) =\left\{ x\in X:g\left( x,t\right) \geq 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; g:X\times \left[ 0,1\right] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{K}. &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a convex set, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are concave in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g\left( \hat{x},t\right) &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t\in \left[ 0,1\right] &lt;/math&gt;. Under these assumptions, it is well known that the above constrained optimization program can be represented as a [[Saddle point|saddle-point problem]] for the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;L\left( x,\lambda,t\right) =f(x,t)+\lambda\cdot g\left( x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s chosen by the adversary to minimize the Lagrangian.&lt;ref name="Luenberger, 1969"&gt;{{cite book | author= Luenberger, D. G. |title= Optimization by Vector Space Methods| year=1969 | publisher = New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref name="Rockafellar, 1970" /&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}} This allows the application of Milgrom and Segal's (2002, Theorem 4) envelope theorem for saddle-point problems,&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Milgrom, Paul  |author2=Ilya Segal | title= Envelope Theorems for Arbitrary Choice Sets| journal=Econometrica| year=2002| volume=70 | pages=583–601 | issue=2 | doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00296}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the additional assumptions that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact set in a normed linear space, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are continuous in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f_{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{t}&lt;/math&gt; are continuous in &lt;math&gt;\left( x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, letting &lt;math&gt;\left( x^{\ast}(t),\lambda^{\ast }\left( t\right) \right) &lt;/math&gt; denote the Lagrangian's saddle point for parameter value &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem implies that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely continuous and satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; V(t)=V(0)+\int_{0}^{t}L_{t}(x^{\ast }(s),\lambda^{\ast }\left( s\right) ,s)ds. &lt;/math&gt;

For the special case in which &lt;math&gt;f\left( x,t\right) &lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K=1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;g\left( x,t\right) =h\left( x\right) +t&lt;/math&gt;, the formula implies that &lt;math&gt;V^{\prime }(t)=L_{t}(x^{\ast }(t),\lambda^{\ast }\left( t\right) ,t)=\lambda^{\ast}\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; for a.e. &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the Lagrange multiplier &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\ast}\left( t\right) &lt;/math&gt; on the constraint is its "[[shadow price]]" in the optimization program.&lt;ref name="Rockafellar, 1970"&gt;{{cite book | author= Rockafellar, R. T. |title= Convex Analysis| year=1970 | publisher = Princeton: Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}

===Other applications===
Milgrom and Segal (2002) demonstrate that the generalized version of the envelope theorems can also be applied to convex programming, continuous optimization problems, saddle-point problems, and optimal stopping problems.&lt;ref name="Milgrom and Segal, 2002" /&gt;

'''FINSIA – Financial Services Institute of Australasia''' ('''FINSIA''') is a not-for-profit membership association for financial services professionals in Australia and New Zealand. FINSIA is the only professional membership body that represents the entire financial services industry across Australasia. Members include CEOs of the major banks, executives from over half the ASX 200 and today's leading fintech entrepreneurs. The institution's goal is to raise standards of professionalism in the financial services industry and provide resources for its members to network, build thought leadership and accelerate their careers.

==History==
FINSIA was established in 2005 after a merger of two Australian financial organisations: the Australian Institute of Banking and Finance (AIBF) and the Securities Institute of Australia (SIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finsia.com/about|title=About Finsia|website=www.finsia.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''The Australian Institute of Banking and Finance'''
The Australian Institute of Banking and Finance was founded in 1886 by Henry Gyles Turner, general manager of the Commercial Bank of Australia. The institution was established when more than 250 bankers met to promote professional knowledge and sound banking practice. In its founding days, the institute was known as the Banker's Institute of Australasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2011|title=Formation of the Banker's Institute of Australasia|url=http://finsia.com/docs/default-source/INFINANCE/infinance-125-anniversary-edition6280f7c81c51635eb99cff000050ab05.pdf?sfvrsn=0|journal=InFinance|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated purpose of the institute was the “dissemination of knowledge on the theory and practice of banking, finance and other subjects ... the promotion of the professional status of those employed in the industry ... [and] ... the encouragement of good feeling and fellowship amongst members.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2011|title=The birth of the Securities Institute of Australia|url=http://finsia.com/docs/default-source/INFINANCE/infinance-125-anniversary-edition6280f7c81c51635eb99cff000050ab05.pdf?sfvrsn=0|journal=InFinance|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Securities Institute of Australia'''
The Securities Institute of Australia was founded in 1966 by Alastair Urquhart, a former chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange. 

The establishment of the SIA in 1966 was similarly driven by the need to build professionalism within the stockbroking industry. The institute’s main purpose was to bestow a qualification on employees of stock brokers and to give the public confidence in those who had studied and were members of the institute.

==Structure==
FINSIA is governed by a Board of Directors, which is responsible for the overall corporate governance of FINSIA, including its corporate planning.

Appointed in May 2015, David Gall serves as the current board president, and Victoria Weekes serves as the current Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://finsia.com/about/finsia-board|title=Finsia Board and CEO|website=finsia.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Whitehead is the CEO and Managing Director of FINSIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finsia.com/about/finsia-board|title=Finsia Board and CEO|website=www.finsia.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Directors is supported by several committees including the Audit, Finance, Risk Management, Compliance, and the Nominations and Remuneration Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finsia.com/about/finsia-board|title=Finsia Board and CEO|website=www.finsia.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And is it David Dein's ego vs Arsenal's interest?]''. BBC UK. Retrieved 11 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Moshiri was born in Iran, and his parents left just before the revolution in 1979.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Andy Hunter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/28/everton-majority-shareholder-farhad-moshiri-increase-stake-bill-kenwright |title=Everton's new majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri likely to increase stake &amp;#124; Football |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moshiri has said that his father was "an [[Imperial Iranian Army|army]] doctor who trained as a pathologist and later became a senior military judge", and his mother "came from Iran's leading publishing house, ''[[Kayhan]]''."&lt;ref name="Liverpool Echo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Everton takeover – Farhad Moshiri who is he?|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-takeover-farhad-moshiri-who-10959138|accessdate=2 March 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[University College London]], and trained in the UK as a [[chartered certified accountant]].&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt;

==Career==
Moshiri worked for [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[PKF International|PKF]] and [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu|Deloitte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metinvest.com/eng/metalloinvest/rykovodstvo/Board_of_directors/Moshiri_F/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131150526/http://www.metinvest.com/eng/metalloinvest/rykovodstvo/Board_of_directors/Moshiri_F/ |date=31 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshiri and longstanding business partner [[Alisher Usmanov]] were co-owners of Red &amp; White Holdings, which bought 14.65% of the shares in [[Arsenal F.C.]] from former club vice-chairman [[David Dein]] in August 2007.  On 18 September 2007, Red and White Holdings increased their stake in Arsenal to 21%, and on 28 September 2007 to 23%, a week after Moshiri announced that he wanted at least a 25% holding in the football club.

The '''Games Convention''', sometimes called the '''Leipzig Games Convention''' and abbreviated as '''GC''',  was an annual [[video game]] event held in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], first held in 2002. Besides video games, the event also covers [[Infotainment]], Hardware, and [[Edutainment]]. Its concept was created by the ''Leipziger Messe'' (Leipzig Fair) in cooperation with ''Bundesverband für Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware'' (German Federal Association for Entertainment Software) amongst others.  The 2010 Gamescon was held August 18 to August 22.

With 183,000 visitors, 2,600 journalists, and 368 exhibitors from 25 countries in 2006, the Games Convention was the second biggest gaming event in the world, together with the [[Tokyo Game Show]], later only superseded by [[Gamescom]], which is also held in [[Cologne|Germany]]. By comparison, both the Leipzig and [[Tokyo]] shows, where gamers of all ages could visit the show floor, are three times the size of the trade-only 2006 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] show in [[Los Angeles]]. The Business Centre at Leipzig was reserved for professional visitors. In 2008, the Games Convention had a record of 203,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19964 Gamasutra: Attendance Up For Leipzig’s Games Convention 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The conference took place in a sprawling modern complex of exhibition halls in Leipzig.

To help identify younger visitors, coloured bracelets were handed out to attendees, indicating their age: "12 years and older" (green), "16 years and older" (blue), and "18 years and older" (red). These colours corresponded to the age indicators used by the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]], the German version of [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] or [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].

In April 2011, it was announced that GCO 2011 would not take place.

== History ==
[[Image:Leipzig Neue Messe.jpg|thumb|256px|The western wings and central hall of the new ''Leipziger Messe'' Fairgrounds. The east wings and business centre are off-camera to the right. The central hall alone has been described as being large enough to enclose a World Cup football pitch.]]
The Leipzig Games Convention was first held in 2002. In 2005, the convention achieved visitor numbers of 134,000, which had risen to 185,000 by 2007.

The Games Convention was usually held in the last week of August. The Games Convention 2007 took place from 23 August to 26 August 2007. It started one day earlier for press members, exhibitors, and professionals.

In 2008, the Industry consortium BIU announced not to back a Games Convention in 2009 in Leipzig, preferring a newly to be established convention held in [[Cologne]] under the name of [[Gamescom]]. [[Sony]], [[Nintendo]], and [[Microsoft]] are members of the BIU, representing 12 companies.

On 29 January 2009, the ''Leipziger Messe'' (Leipzig Fair) announced that in 2009 there would be no Games Convention as in 2008, but a new fair called "Games Convention Online" from 31 July to 2 August 2009. It featured mainly browser games and other online and casual games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/spielzeug/0,1518,604284,00.html Spiegel.de: Games Convention Online in 2009 (german)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asian expansion ===
An [[Asia]]n edition of the Games Convention, called [[Games Convention Asia]] was first held in 2007. It was a yearly convention held in [[Singapore]], starting on 6 September 2007. However, it has since become defunct as of 2010 when it was officially announced that the convention would no longer be held.

== International ''Games Convention Developers Conference'' ==
The ''Games Convention Developers Conference'' (GCDC) was the largest game design and development conference in Europe, with 950 attendees in 2008.[https://web.archive.org/web/20061025064311/http://www.leipziger-messe.de/LeMMon/PRESSE.NSF/messewebeng_gc/CEDF72E7B7422CA7C12571D7004CC4A9?OpenDocument&amp;lang=en&amp;style=gc]{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}}

The GCDC was held in a building in the same complex in Leipzig where the GC took place, typically just before the opening of the main show. During the conference attendees gained ideas and inspiration from the presentation of new tools and methods, and from a variety of sessions discussing both the craft and the business of game design and development. The conference was open to both game professionals, students and press.

As the major European conference, GCDC drew top speakers from all over the world. Presenters in recent years included [[Bob Bates]], [[Louis Castle]], [[Don Daglow]], [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Bill Roper (video game producer)|Bill Roper]], [[Bruce Shelley]], [[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]] and [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]].

The '''internal rate of return''' ('''IRR''') is a measure of an [[investment]]’s [[rate of return]]. The term ''internal'' refers to the fact 
that the internal rate excludes external factors, such as [[inflation]], the [[cost of capital]], or various [[financial risk]]s.

It is also called the [[discounted cash flow]] [[rate of return]] (DCFROR).&lt;ref name=main269&gt;Project Economics and Decision Analysis, Volume I: Deterministic Models, M.A.Main, Page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of savings and loans, the IRR is also called the [[effective interest rate]].

==Definition==

The '''internal rate of return''' on an investment or project is the "annualized effective compounded return rate" or [[rate of return]] that sets the [[net present value]] of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment equal to zero. Equivalently, it is the [[interest rate|discount rate]] at which the net present value of future cash flows is equal to the initial investment, and it is also the discount rate at which the total [[present value]] of costs (negative cash flows) equals the total present value of the benefits (positive cash flows).

Speaking intuitively, IRR is designed to account for the [[time preference]] of money and investments. A given return on investment received at a given time is worth more than the same return received at a later time, so the latter would yield a lower IRR than the former, if all other factors are equal. A [[fixed income investment]] in which money is deposited once, [[interest]] on this deposit is paid to the investor at a specified [[interest rate]] every time period, and the original deposit neither increases nor decreases, would have an IRR equal to the specified interest rate.  An investment which has the same total returns as the preceding investment, but delays returns for one or more time periods, would have a lower IRR.

Corporations use IRR in [[capital budgeting]] to compare the [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] of [[investment|capital projects]] in terms of the [[rate of return]]. For example, a corporation will compare an investment in a new plant versus an extension of an existing plant based on the IRR of each project. To maximize [[rate of return|returns]], the higher a project's IRR, the more desirable it is to undertake the project. If all projects require the same amount of up-front investment, the project with the highest IRR would be considered the best and undertaken first.

===Maximizing net present value===
The internal rate of return is an indicator of the [[Profit (economics)|profitability]], efficiency, quality, or [[Yield (finance)|yield]] of an investment. This is in contrast with the [[net present value]], which is an indicator of the net [[Value (economics)|value]] or [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] added by making an investment.

Applying the internal rate of return method to maximize the [[Value (economics)|value]] of the firm, any investment would be accepted, if its profitability, as measured by the internal rate of return, is greater than a [[minimum acceptable rate of return]]. The appropriate minimum rate to maximize the [[net present value|value]] added to the firm is the [[cost of capital]], i.e. the internal rate of return of a new capital project needs to be higher than the company's cost of capital. This is because an investment with an internal rate of return which exceeds the [[cost of capital]] has a positive [[net present value]].

However, the selection of investments may be subject to budget constraints, or they may be [[mutual exclusivity|mutually exclusive]] competing projects, such as a choice between or the capacity or ability to manage more projects may be practically limited. In the example cited above, of a corporation comparing an investment in a new plant versus an extension of an existing plant, there may be reasons the company would not engage in both projects.

===Fixed income===
IRR is also used to calculate [[yield to maturity]] and [[yield (finance)|yield to call]].

===Liabilities===
Both the internal rate of return and the net present value can be applied to liabilities as well as investments. For a liability, a lower internal rate of return is preferable to a higher one.

===Capital management===
Corporations use internal rate of return to evaluate share issues and [[share repurchase|stock buyback]] programs. A share repurchase proceeds if returning capital to shareholders has a higher internal rate of return than candidate capital investment projects or acquisition projects at current market prices. Funding new projects by raising new debt may also involve measuring the cost of the new debt in terms of the [[yield to maturity]] (internal rate of return).

===Private equity===
IRR is also used for [[private equity]], from the limited partners' perspective, as a measure of the general partner's performance as investment manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Investment Performance Standards|url=http://www.gipsstandards.org/standards/pages/currentedition.aspx|publisher=CFA Institute|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because it is the general partner who controls the cash flows, including the limited partners' draw-downs of [[Capital commitment|committed capital]].

==Calculation==

Given a collection of pairs ([[time]], [[cash flow]]) involved in a project, the internal rate of return follows from the [[net present value]] as a function of the [[rate of return]]. A rate of return for which this function being zero is the internal rate of return.

Given the (period, cash flow) pairs (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt;) where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative integer, the total number of periods &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}&lt;/math&gt;, ([[net present value]]); the [[Internal rate of return#Uses of IRR|IRR]] is given by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; in:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV} = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{C_n}{(1+r)^{n}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this formula, &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; (≤0) is the initial investment at the start of the project. The period &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is usually given in years, but the calculation may be made simpler if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is calculated using the period in which the majority of the problem is defined (e.g., using months if most of the cash flows occur at monthly intervals) and converted to a yearly period thereafter.

Any fixed time can be used in place of the present (e.g., the end of one interval of an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]]); the value obtained is zero if and only if the NPV is zero.

In the case that the cash flows are [[random variable]]s, such as in the case of a [[life annuity]], the [[expected value]]s are put into the above formula.

Often, the value of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the above equation cannot be found [[analytical solution|analytically]]. In this case, [[numerical analysis|numerical methods]] or [[plot (graphics)|graphical methods]] must be used.

===Example===

If an investment may be given by the sequence of cash flows

{| class="wikitable" align="left"
|-
! Year (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;)
! Cash flow (&lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt;)
|- align="center"
| 0
| -123400
|- align="center"
| 1
| 36200
|- align="center"
| 2
| 54800
|- align="center"
| 3
| 48100
|- align="center"
|}
{{-}}

then the IRR &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV} = -123400+\frac{36200}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{54800}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{48100}{(1+r)^3} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the answer is 5.96%  (in the calculation, that is, r = .0596).

====Numerical solution====
Since the above is a manifestation of the general problem of finding the [[root of a function|roots]] of the equation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}(r)=0&lt;/math&gt;, there are many [[root-finding algorithm|numerical methods]] that can be used to estimate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. For example, using the [[secant method]], &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{n+1} = r_n-\mathrm{NPV}_n  \cdot \left(\frac{r_n-r_{n-1}}{\mathrm{NPV}_n-\mathrm{NPV}_{n-1}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_n&lt;/math&gt; is considered the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; approximation of the IRR.

This &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; can be found to an arbitrary degree of [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]]. Different accounting packages may provide functions for different accuracy levels.

The convergence behaviour of by the following:
*If the function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}(i)&lt;/math&gt; has a single [[real number|real]] root &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, then the sequence converges reproducibly towards &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*If the function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}(i)&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; real roots &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r_1,r_2,\dots,r_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the sequence converges to one of the roots, and changing the values of the initial pairs may change the root to which it converges.
*If function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}(i)&lt;/math&gt; has no real roots, then the sequence tends towards [[Extended real number line|+∞]].

Having &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{r_1 &gt; r_0}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{r_1 &lt; r_0}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}_0&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; may speed up convergence of &lt;math&gt;r_n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

====Numerical solution for single outflow and multiple inflows====
Of particular interest is the case where the stream of payments consists of a single outflow, followed by multiple inflows occurring at equal periods. In the above notation, this corresponds to:

: &lt;math&gt; C_0&lt;0,\quad C_n\ge 0\text{ for }n\ge 1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

In this case the NPV of the payment stream is a [[convex function|convex]], [[Monotonic function|strictly decreasing]] function of interest rate. There is always a single unique solution for IRR.

Given two estimates &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; for IRR, the secant method equation (see above) with &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; always produces an improved estimate &lt;math&gt;r_3&lt;/math&gt;. This is sometimes referred to as the Hit and Trial (or Trial and Error) method.  More accurate interpolation formulas can also be obtained: for instance the secant formula with correction
 
: &lt;math&gt;r_{n+1} = r_n-\mathrm{NPV}_n\left(\frac{r_n-r_{n-1}}{\mathrm{NPV}_n-\mathrm{NPV}_{n-1}}\right)\left(1 - 1.4 \frac{\mathrm{NPV}_{n-1}}{\mathrm{NPV}_{n-1} - 3\mathrm{NPV}_n + 2C_0} \right)&lt;/math&gt;,

(which is most accurate when &lt;math&gt; 0 &gt; \mathrm{NPV}_{n} &gt; \mathrm{NPV}_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;) has been shown to be almost 10 times more accurate than the secant formula for a wide range of interest rates and initial guesses.  For example, using the stream of payments {&amp;minus;4000, 1200, 1410, 1875, 1050} and initial guesses &lt;math&gt;r_1 = 0.25&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2 = 0.2&lt;/math&gt; the secant formula with correction gives an IRR estimate of 14.2% (0.7% error) as compared to IRR = 13.2% (7% error) from the secant method.

If applied iteratively, either the secant method or the improved formula always converges to the correct solution.

Both the secant method and the improved formula rely on initial guesses for IRR. The following initial guesses may be used:

::&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \left( A / |C_0| \right) ^{2/(N+1)} - 1 \, &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;r_2 = (1 + r_{1})^p - 1 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt; A = \text{ sum of inflows } = C_1 + \cdots + C_N  \, &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{\log(\mathrm{A} / |C_0|)}{\log(\mathrm{A} / \mathrm{NPV}_{1,in})}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NPV}_{1,in}&lt;/math&gt; refers to the NPV of the inflows only (that is, set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C_0 = 0}&lt;/math&gt; and compute NPV).

===Exact dates of cash flows===
A cash flow &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; may occur at any time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; years after the beginning of the project. &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; may not be a whole number. The cash flow should still be discounted by a factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Problems with using internal rate of return==
As a tool applied to making an [[investment]] decision, to decide whether a project adds value or not, comparing the IRR of a single project with the required rate of return, in isolation from any other projects, is equivalent to the NPV method. If the appropriate IRR (if such can be found correctly) is greater than the required rate of return, then using the required rate of return to discount cash flows to their present value, the NPV of that project will be positive, and vice versa. However, using IRR to sort projects in order of preference does not result in the same order as using NPV.

===Maximizing net present value===
One possible investment objective is to maximize the total net present value of projects.

When the objective is to maximize total value, the calculated IRR should not be used to choose between mutually exclusive projects. [[Image:exclusive investments.png|thumb|231px|NPV vs discount rate comparison for two mutually exclusive projects. Project 'A' has a higher NPV (for certain discount rates), even though its IRR (=&amp;nbsp;''x''-axis intercept) is lower than for project 'B' (click to enlarge)]]In cases where one project has a higher initial investment than a second mutually exclusive project, the first project may have a lower IRR (expected return), but a higher NPV (increase in shareholders' wealth) and should thus be accepted over the second project (assuming no capital constraints).

When the objective is to maximize total value, IRR should not be used to compare projects of different duration. For example, the net present value added by a project with longer duration but lower IRR could be greater than that of a project of similar size, in terms of total net cash flows, but with shorter duration and higher IRR.

===Practitioner preference for IRR over NPV===
Despite a strong academic preference for NPV, surveys indicate that executives prefer IRR over NPV.&lt;ref&gt;Pogue, M.(2004).  Investment Appraisal: A New Approach. Managerial Auditing Journal.Vol. 19 No. 4, 2004.  pp. 565–570&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, managers find it easier to compare investments of different sizes in terms of percentage rates of return than by dollars of NPV.  However, NPV remains the "more accurate" reflection of value to the business. IRR, as a measure of investment efficiency may give better insights in capital constrained situations. However, when comparing mutually exclusive projects, NPV is the appropriate measure.

===Maximizing long-term return===
Maximizing total value is not the only conceivable possible investment objective. An alternative objective would for example be to maximize long-term return. Such an objective would rationally lead to accepting first those new projects within the capital budget which have the highest IRR, because adding such projects would tend to maximize overall long-term return.

====Example====
To see this, consider two investors, Max Value and Max Return. Max Value wishes her net worth to grow as large as possible, and will invest every last cent available to achieve this, whereas Max Return wants to maximize his rate of return over the long term, and would prefer to choose projects with smaller capital outlay but higher returns. Max Value and Max Return can each raise ''up to'' 100,000 US dollars from their bank at an annual interest rate of 10 percent paid at the end of the year.

Investors Max Value and Max Return are presented with two possible projects to invest in, called Big-Is-Best and Small-Is-Beautiful. Big-Is-Best requires a capital investment of 100,000 US dollars today, and the lucky investor will be repaid 132,000 US dollars in a year's time. Small-Is-Beautiful only requires 10,000 US dollars capital to be invested today, and will repay the investor 13,750 US dollars in a year's time.

=====Solution=====
The cost of capital for both investors is 10 percent.

Both Big-Is-Best and Small-Is-Beautiful have positive NPVs:
:&lt;math&gt;NPV(\text{Big-Is-Best}) = \frac{132,000}{1.1} - 100,000 = 20,000&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;NPV(\text{Small-Is-Beautiful}) = \frac{13,750}{1.1} - 10,000 = 2,500&lt;/math&gt;
and the IRR of each is (of course) greater than the cost of capital:
:&lt;math&gt;NPV(\text{Big-Is-Best}) = \frac{132,000}{1.32} - 100,000 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
so the IRR of Big-Is-Best is 32 percent, and
:&lt;math&gt;NPV(\text{Small-Is-Beautiful}) = \frac{13,750}{1.375} - 10,000 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
so the IRR of Small-Is-Beautiful is 37.5 percent.

Both investments would be acceptable to both investors, but the twist in the tale is that these are mutually exclusive projects for both investors, because their capital budget is limited to 100,000 US dollars. How will the investors choose rationally between the two?

The happy outcome is that Max Value chooses Big-Is-Best, which has the higher NPV of 20,000 US dollars, over Small-Is-Beautiful, which only has a modest NPV of 2,500, whereas Max Return chooses Small-Is-Beautiful, for its superior 37.5 percent return, over the attractive (but not as attractive) return of 32 percent offered on Big-Is-Best. So there is no squabbling of who gets which project, they are each happy to choose different projects.

How can this be rational for both investors? The answer lies in the fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.

===Multiple IRRs===
When the sign of the cash flows changes more than once, for example when positive cash flows are followed by negative ones and then by positive ones (+ + − − − +), the IRR may have multiple real values. In a series of cash flows like (&amp;minus;10, 21, &amp;minus;11), one initially invests money, so a high rate of return is best, but then receives more than one possesses, so then one owes money, so now a low rate of return is best. In this case, it is not even clear whether a high or a low IRR is better.

There may even be multiple real IRRs for a single project, like in the example 0% as well as 10%. Examples of this type of project are [[strip mine]]s and [[nuclear power]] plants, where there is usually a large cash outflow at the end of the project.

The IRR satisfies a polynomial equation. [[Sturm's theorem]] can be used to determine if that equation has a unique real solution. In general the IRR equation cannot be solved analytically but only by iteration.

With multiple internal rates of return, the IRR approach can still be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the present value approach if the underlying investment stream is correctly identified as net investment or net borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, G. B., "A new perspective on multiple internal rates of return," ''The Engineering Economist'' 48(2), 2003, 31–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

See &lt;ref&gt;Hartman, J. C., and Schafrick, I. C., "The relevant internal rate of return," ''The Engineering Economist'' 49(2), 2004, 139–158.&lt;/ref&gt; for a way of identifying the relevant IRR from a set of multiple IRR solutions.

===Modified internal rate of return (MIRR)===
[[Modified Internal Rate of Return]] (MIRR) considers [[cost of capital]], and is intended to provide a better indication of a project's probable return. It applies a discount rate for borrowing cash, and the IRR is calculated for the investment cash flows. This applies in real life for example when a customer makes a deposit before a specific machine is built.

When a project has multiple IRRs it may be more convenient to compute the IRR of the project with the benefits reinvested.&lt;ref name=cautionary&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3304945 Internal Rate of Return: A Cautionary Tale]&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, MIRR is used, which has an assumed reinvestment rate, usually equal to the project's cost of capital.

===Average internal rate of return (AIRR)===
Magni (2010) introduced a new approach, named AIRR approach, based on the intuitive notion of mean, that solves the problems of the IRR.&lt;ref&gt;Magni, C.A. (2010) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00137911003791856?needAccess=true "Average Internal Rate of Return and investment decisions: a new perspective"]. The Engineering Economist, 55(2), 150‒181.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the above-mentioned difficulties are only some of the many flaws incurred by the IRR. Magni (2013) provided a detailed list of 18 flaws of the IRR and showed how the AIRR approach does not incur the IRR problems.
&lt;ref&gt;Magni, C.A. (2013) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0013791X.2012.745916 "The Internal-Rate-of-Return approach and the AIRR paradigm: A refutation and a corroboration"] The Engineering Economist, 58(2), 73‒111.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doesn't account for all variables ===
Traditional IRR calculations only consider the financial aspects of a decision but does not  not fully "capture the short- or long-term importance, value, or risks associated with natural and social capital"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrated Management: How Sustainability Creates Value for Any Business|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|publisher=Emerald Publishing|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it does not account for the environmental, social and governance performance of an organization. Without a metric for measuring the short and long term environmental, social and governance performance of a firm, decision makers are planning for the future without considering the extent of the impacts associated with their decisions.

==Mathematics==
Mathematically, the value of the investment is assumed to undergo exponential growth or decay according to some [[rate of return]] (any value greater than &amp;minus;100%), with discontinuities for cash flows, and the IRR of a series of cash flows is defined as any rate of return that results in a [[net present value]] of zero (or equivalently, a rate of return that results in the correct value of zero after the last cash flow).

Thus, internal rate(s) of return follow from the net present value as a function of the rate of return. This function is [[Continuous function|continuous]]. Towards a rate of return of &amp;minus;100% the net present value approaches infinity with the sign of the last cash flow, and towards a rate of return of positive infinity the net present value approaches the first cash flow (the one at the present). Therefore, if the first and last cash flow have a different sign there exists an internal rate of return. Examples of time series without an IRR:

* Only negative cash flows — the NPV is negative for every rate of return.
* (&amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1), rather small positive cash flow between two negative cash flows; the NPV is a quadratic function of 1/(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''), where ''r'' is the rate of return, or put differently, a quadratic function of the [[Annual effective discount rate|discount rate]] ''r''/(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''); the highest NPV is &amp;minus;0.75, for ''r'' = 100%.

In the case of a series of exclusively negative cash flows followed by a series of exclusively positive ones, the resulting function of the rate of return is continuous and monotonically decreasing from positive infinity (when the rate of return approaches -100%) to the value of the first cash flow (when the rate of return approaches infinity), so there is a unique rate of return for which it is zero. Hence, the IRR is also unique (and equal). Although the NPV-function itself is not necessarily monotonically decreasing on its whole domain, it ''is'' at the IRR.

Similarly, in the case of a series of exclusively positive cash flows followed by a series of exclusively negative ones the IRR is also unique.

Finally, by [[Descartes' rule of signs]], the number of internal rates of return can never be more than the number of changes in sign of cash flow.

==The reinvestment debate==
It is often stated that IRR assumes reinvestment of all cash flows until the very end of the project. This assertion has been a matter of debate in the literature.

Sources stating that there is such a hidden assumption include those cited below.&lt;ref name="cautionary"/&gt;&lt;ref name=measuring&gt;[http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/ovhds/ch5.pdf#page=43] Measuring Investment Returns&lt;/ref&gt; Sources arguing that there is no IRR reinvestment assumption include&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, C.L., “A note on reinvestment assumptions in choosing between net present value and internal rate of return.” ''Journal of Finance'' 27(4), 1972, 907–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keane, S.M., “The internal rate of return and the reinvestment fallacy.” ''Abacus'' 15(1), 1979, 48–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, J.R., “The IRR, NPV and the fallacy of the reinvestment rate assumptions”. ''The Engineering Economist'' 33(4), 1988, 303–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keef, S.P., and M.L. Roush, “Discounted cash flow methods and the fallacious reinvestment assumptions: a review of recent texts.” ''Accounting Education'' 10(1), 2001, 105-116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rich, S.P., and J.T. Rose, “Re-examining an Old Question: Does the IRR Method Implicitly Assume a Reinvestment Rate?” ''Journal of Financial Education'' 10(1), 2014, 105-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRR method measures return in the presence of external cash flows. The assumptions of users of the method are independent of the IRR method itself. When comparing investments, making a naive implicit assumption that cash flows are reinvested at the same IRR, would tend to lead to false conclusions. If cash flows received are not reinvested at the same rate as the IRR, a project with a relatively short duration and a high IRR does not necessarily add more value over a longer time span than another project with a longer duration and a lower IRR.  The [[Modified Internal Rate of Return]] (MIRR) addresses this issue by including a second investment at a potentially different rate of return, to calculate a portfolio return without external cash flows over the life of the project.  However, for capital budgeting, when the objective is to maximize value, finance theory holds that NPV using the firm's cost of capital is a superior metric.

==The internal rate of return in personal finance==
The IRR can be used to measure the money-weighted performance of financial investments such as an
individual investor's brokerage account. For this scenario, an 
equivalent,&lt;ref name="gtz_freqmath"&gt;[http://www.greaterthanzero.com/freqmath The Mathematics of the Fixed Rate Equivalent], a GreaterThanZero White Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; 
more intuitive definition of the IRR is, "The IRR is the annual interest rate of the fixed rate account (like a somewhat idealized savings account)
which, when subjected to the same deposits and withdrawals as the actual investment, has the same ending balance as the actual investment." 
This fixed rate account is also called the ''replicating fixed rate account'' for the investment. There are examples where 
the replicating fixed rate account encounters negative balances despite the fact that the actual investment did not.&lt;ref name="gtz_freqmath"/&gt; 
In those cases, the IRR calculation assumes that the same interest rate that is paid on positive balances is charged on 
negative balances. It has been shown that this way of charging interest is the root cause of the IRR's multiple solutions 
problem.&lt;ref name="teichrow_et_al_1"&gt;Teichroew, D., Robicheck, A., and Montalbano, M., Mathematical analysis of rates of return under certainty, 
Management Science Vol. 11 Nr. 3, January 1965, 395&amp;ndash;403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teichrow_et_al_2"&gt;Teichroew, D., Robicheck, A., and Montalbano, M., 
An analysis of criteria for investment and financing decisions under certainty, Management Science Vol. 12 Nr. 3, 
November 1965, 151&amp;ndash;179.&lt;/ref&gt; If the model is modified so that, as is the case in real life, an externally supplied cost of borrowing 
(possibly varying over time) is charged on negative balances, the multiple solutions issue 
disappears.&lt;ref name="teichrow_et_al_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teichrow_et_al_2"/&gt; The resulting rate is 
called the ''fixed rate equivalent'' (''FREQ'').&lt;ref name="gtz_freqmath"/&gt;

==Unannualized internal rate of return==
In the context of investment performance measurement, there is sometimes ambiguity in terminology between the periodic [[rate of return]], such as the internal rate of return as defined above, and a holding period return. The term ''internal rate of return'' or ''IRR'' or ''Since Inception Internal Rate of Return (SI-IRR)'' is in some contexts used to refer to the unannualized return over the period, particularly for periods of less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/ccb.v2010.n5.1#page=49] Global Investment Performance Standards&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrated rate of return (IntRR) ==
To address the lack of integration of the short and long term importance, value and risks associated with natural and social capital into the traditional IRR calculation, companies are valuing their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance through an [[Integrated management|Integrated Management]] approach to reporting that expands IRR to Integrated Rate of Return.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This allows companies to value their investments not just for their financial return but also the long term environmental and social return of their investments. By highlighting environmental, social and governance performance in reporting, decision makers have the opportunity to identify new areas for value creation that are not revealed through traditional financial reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Report: Integrated Reporting for a Sustainable Strategy|last=Eccles|first=Robert|last2=Krzus|first2=Michael|publisher=Wiley|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social cost of carbon]] is one value that can be incorporated into Integrated Rate of Return calculations to encompass the damage to society from greenhouse gas emissions that result from an investment. This is an integrated approach to reporting that supports Integrated Bottom Line (IBL) decision making, which takes [[triple bottom line]](TBL) a step further and combines financial, environmental and social performance reporting into one balance sheet. This approach provides decision makers with the insight to identify opportunities for value creation that promote growth and change within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sroufe|first=Robert|date=July 2017|title=Integration and Organizational Change Towards Sustainability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318126290_Integration_and_Organizational_Change_Towards_Sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=162|pages=315-329|via=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isyaku Rabiu''' (October 9, 1925 – May 7, 2018) was a Nigerian businessman and Islamic scholar who founded a major holding company in [[Kano State]]. He was a supporter of [[Ibrahim Niass|Ibrahim Niasse]]'s [[Tijaniyyah]] brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Loimeier, Islamic Reform and Political Change in Northern Nigeria, (Series in Islam and Society in Africa). Northwestern University Press (February 2, 1996). P. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Rabiu was born to the family of Muhammadu Rabiu Dan Tinki, a Quranic preacher from the Bichi area of Kano State who led his own Quranic school. From 1936 to 1942, Rabiu attended his father's school learning the Quran and Arabic.&lt;ref name="NN"&gt;{{cite news |last=Anyamikegh |first=Raymond |date=February 22, 1979 |title=Focus on Isiyaku Rabiu and Sons |url= |newspaper=New Nigerian |location=Kaduna |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to [[Maiduguri]], Borno for further Islamic education. After spending four years in Maiduguri, he returned to Kano prepared to be an Islamic scholar. In 1949, Rabiu was an independent teacher of Arabic and the [[Quran]] who had among his audience [[Ibrahim Musa Gashash]]. 

In the early 1950s while still a teacher, Rabiu began to engage in private enterprise and established Isyaku Rabiu &amp; Sons in 1952. Originally the firm acted as an agent of [[United Africa Company|UAC]] and was trading in sewing machines, religious books and bicycles. In 1958, the firm had a breakthrough when Kaduna Textile Limited was established and it became one of the early distributors. 

Rabiu emerged as the leading distributor of the company in Northern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="NN"/&gt; In 1963, he joined a consortium of businessmen from Kano who came together to form the Kano Merchants Trading Company.&lt;ref name="forrest"&gt;{{cite book |last=Forrest |first=Tom |date= |title= The Advance of African Capital: The Growth of Nigerian Private Enterprise |url= |location= |publisher=University of Virginia Press |pages=32, 209-210 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The establishments continued to survive withstanding competition from foreign products. In 1970, he established a suit and packing factory.

Rabiu was a supporter of the [[National Party of Nigeria]] and likely benefited from state patronage as a result.&lt;ref name="Gunillat"&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrae|first=Gunilla|date= |title= Union Power in the Nigerian Textile Industry: Labour Regime and Adjustment |url= |location= |publisher=Transaction Publishers|pages=123-124 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isyaku Rabiu &amp; Sons group===
Isyaku Rabiu &amp; Sons, founded by Rabiu, is a family operated holding company with a history of investment in manufacturing, insurance, banking and real estate.&lt;ref name="Gunillat"/&gt; In the 1970s, the group invested in manufacturing with its first investment being the Kano Suit and Packing Cases company, a factory producing suit cases and handbags. The firm was a joint venture with Lebanese investors.&lt;ref name="forrest"/&gt; 

In 1972, he formed the Bagauda Textile Mill, manufacturing woven cloths for uniforms.&lt;ref name="Gunillat"/&gt; 

Rabiu then established a series of ventures in different segments of the economy including frozen food service, real estate, sugar and a motor vehicle and parts distribution company specialized in [[Daihatsu]] products. However, unfavorable exchange rates and economic conditions forced the company to scale back on manufacturing and returning to its trading roots.

[[File:Jari Sarasvuo 2.jpg|thumb|Jari Sarasvuo in 2013]]
'''Jari Sarasvuo''' (born ''Jari Heinonen''; 12 June 1965 in [[Turku]]) is the founder, chief owner and CEO of [[Trainers' House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/Jari%20Sarasvuo%20T%C3%A4m%C3%A4%20on%20ty%C3%B6el%C3%A4m%C3%A4ni%20surullisin%20p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4/art-1288334782018.html|title=Jari Sarasvuo: "Tämä on työelämäni surullisin päivä" - Ilta-Sanomat|last=Pimiä|first=Katarina|date=25 February 2009|work=[[Ilta-Sanomat]]|language=Finnish|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Finland|Finnish]] company that arranges training and lectures particularly for marketing topics.

Sarasvuo has worked as an [[editing|editor]] and [[chief editor]] in several [[magazine]]s and also in [[Helsinki]]'s [[Radio City (Finland)|Radio City]]. His first publicity was as a host in a talk show on the Finnish channel [[MTV3]] in the 1990s. After leaving jobs in television, he has worked as a lecturer and as a motivational coach, also publishing six books on the same topic. One of his famous concepts is the "inner hero" (''sisäinen sankari''), and he has also coined the term ''huomiotalous'' ("attention economy"), describing the central role of publicity in the today's economy.

Sarasvuo studied business administration, but has not finished the degree. In his conscript duty, he was an editor of the army newspaper ''[[Ruotuväki]]'', and was promoted to Second Lieutenant (''[[vänrikki]]'') in reserve.

Sarasvuo was the host in ''[[Diili]]'', a localized version of ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]''. Sarasvuo has often appeared in publicity and his company hosted [[Bill Clinton]]'s lecture in [[Tampere]]. Sarasvuo owns about a third of Trainer's House, and if evaluated, the stock is valued at some 34 million [[euro]]s (January 2008). He has also contributed to charity in the form of providing [[microcredit]] and taking part in a project to support [[Bangladesh]]i women to become [[entrepreneur]]s.

Sarasvuo has been married to former cross-country skier [[Virpi Sarasvuo]] (née Kuitunen) since 2010. They have one child, a daughter born in 2011. Sarasvuo also has two children from a previous relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/viihde/2011032713444135_vi.shtml |title=Virpi ja Jari Sarasvuo saivat tytön |date=March 27, 2011 |website=Iltalehti.fi |language=fi |access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Jens Henrik Beer''' (1731 – 7 August 1808) was a Norwegian businessperson.

He was born in [[Flekkefjord]] as a son of merchant and sawmill owner Nils Henriksen Beer (1690–1746) and his wife Anna M. C. Eide.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Beer, Jens Henrik|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=Bull, Edvard |editor-link=Edvard Bull Sr. |editor2=Krogvig, Anders |editor2-link=Anders Krogvig |editor3=Gran, Gerhard |editor3-link=Gerhard Gran|edition=1st|first=Wollert|last=Keilhau|authorlink=Wollert Keilhau|year=1923|volume=1|pages=407–408|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father acquired burghership in 1736, and was probably a part of the first generation of the family to be born in Norway—Jens Henrik Beer's grandfather probably immigrated from Germany or the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ringard|first=Morten|authorlink=Morten Ringard|title=Flekkefjords historie|publisher=Flekkefjord Municipality|location=Flekkefjord|year=1942|page=131|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer was married twice; first to Elisabeth K.

He attended school in the [[Netherlands]], and also spent time at sea. He is notable for being one of the leading merchants between Norway and [[Scotland]] at his time. His ships exported timber to Scotland, and [[malt]] and [[flour]] in return to Norway. During the [[Seven Years' War]] he saved Scottish cargo by sailing under a Danish flag, and even sold it in France. He was declared an [[honorary citizen]] of Montrose in 1772. In Norway, to which he gradually retreated, he was a ship-owner and owned sawmills at Tjørsvaag, [[Fjellsæ|Fjeldså]] and [[Sirnes]] in the Flekkefjord district, at [[Haughom|Haukom]] in [[Sirdal|Siredalen]] and at [[Feda]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5607">'''Lars-Erik Gadde''' (born 1945) is a Swedish [[organizational theorist]] and Professor of Technology Management and Economics at [[Chalmers University of Technology]] in Gothenburg, Sweden. He is known for his work on [[business networks]], professional purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Injazz J., and Antony Paulraj. "[http://mail.imb.usu.ru/docs/Bank%20English_Transleted%20Articles/English/Management/Towards%20a%20theory%20of%20supply%20chain%20management.pdf Towards a theory of supply chain management: the constructs and measurements]."

Sage publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Gadde obtained his PhD at the [[University of Gothenburg]] in 1978 with the thesis, entitled "Efterfrågevariationer i vertikala marknadssystem" (Demand variations in vertical marketing systems). 

After his graduation Gadde spend his academic career at the Institute for Management of Innovation and Technology, Gothenburg, which became [[Chalmers University of Technology]] in 1994. In the 1983 article "Research on Producer Goods Distribution in Sweden" gave his view on the state of the art of on his field of research, the [[industrial marketing]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Swedish interest in research on channels of distribution for industrial goods has been limited historically. The same is true in other countries as well, as has been reported, for example, by [[David Ford (marketing scientist)|Ford]]. In fact, this is tree for the field of [[industrial marketing]] in general. It is a little surprising that industrial markets have been so neglected. If economic values are considered, producer markets are dominant over [[consumer market]]s. According to Flodhammar and Nielsen, the turnover of the Swedish producer market is four times that of the consumer market. One reason for the slight research interest is that up to the 1970s many industries could be characterised as operating in a '[[seller's market]].' Demand exceeded supply. No kind of modern marketing existed; it was only a question of selling.&lt;ref&gt;Gadde, Lars-Erik. "Research on Producer Goods Distribution in Sweden." ''International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Materials Management'' 13.5/6 (1983): 14-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His cooperation with [[Håkan Håkansson]] originates from when they did research in the Swedish automotive industry, particularly looking at "automotive component supply strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Bruce, and Lars-Erik Gadde. ''Automotive component supply strategies.'' Chalmers University of Technology, Institute for Management of Innovation and Technology, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a paper with [[Philippe A. Naert]] on marketing research in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mattsson, Lars-Gunnar]], and [[Philippe A. Naert]]. "Research in marketing in Europe: Some reflections on its setting, accomplishments and challenges." ''International Journal of Research in Marketing'' 2.1 (1985): 3-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after he joined the [[Industrial Marketing and Purchasing Group]], and much of his research and publications has been under their wings. In the 1990s he also published some works on [[case study research]] in cooperation with [[Anna Dubois]] of the Chalmers University of Technology.

Gadde's research interest has remained in the field of "exchange processes among companies in [[business network]]s. These processes are analysed from two perspectives. The first concerns [[purchasing]] behaviour and purchasing strategies on the buying side, while the second deals with distribution strategies and distribution system dynamics on the selling side."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/lars-erik-gadde.aspx Lars-Erik Gadde profile] at ''chalmers.se.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7371">A '''limiting factor''' is a variable of a system that, if subject to a small change, causes a non-negligible change in an output or other measure of the system. A factor not limiting over a certain [[Domain of a function|domain]] of starting conditions may yet be limiting over another domain of starting conditions, including that of the factor.

==Overview==
The identification of a factor as limiting only in distinction to one or more other factors that are non-limiting. Disciplines differ in their use of the term as to whether they allow the simultaneous existence of more than one limiting factor (which may then be called "co-limiting"), but they all require the existence of at least one non-limiting factor when the terms are used.  There are several different possible scenarios of limitation when more than one factor is present.  The first scenario, called ''single limitation'' occurs when only one factor, the one with maximum demand, limits the system.  ''Serial co-limitation'' is when one factor has no direct limiting effects on the system, but must be present to increase the limitation of a second factor. A third scenario, ''independent limitation,'' occurs when two factors both have limiting effects on the system but work through different mechanisms.  Another scenario, ''synergistic limitation,'' occurs when both factors contribute to the same limitation mechanism, but in different ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ecology==
In ''ecology'', common limiting factor [[Resource (biology)|resources]] are environmental conditions that limit the growth, abundance, or distribution of an organism or a population of organisms in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=TMS&gt;Thomas M. Smith., Robert Leo Smith. 2009. Or simply,  Limiting factors are things that prevent a population from growing any large. ''Elements of Ecology''. Pearson International Edition. 7th Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|G-11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Limiting_factor|title=Limiting factor - Biology-Online Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of limiting factors is based on ''[[Liebig's Law]] of the Minimum,'' which states that growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource. In other words, a factor is limiting if a change in the factor produces increased growth, abundance, or distribution of an organism, when other factors necessary to the organisms life do not. Limiting factors may be physical or biological.&lt;ref name=TMS/&gt;{{rp|417,8}}

Limiting factors are not limited to the condition of the species. Some factors may be increased or reduced based on circumstances. An example of a limiting factor is [[sunlight]] in the [[rain forest]], where growth is limited to all plants on the [[forest floor]] unless more light becomes available. This decreases a number of potential factors that could influence a biological process, but only one is in effect at any one place and time. This recognition that there is always a ''single'' limiting factor is vital in [[ecology]]; and the concept has parallels in numerous other processes. The limiting factor also causes [[competition]] between individuals of a species population. For example, [[space]] is a limiting factor. Many predators and prey need a certain amount of space for survival: food, water, and other biological needs. If the population of a species is too high, they start competing for those needs. Thus the limiting factors hold down population in an area by causing some individuals to seek better prospects elsewhere and others to stay and starve. Some other limiting factors in biology include [[temperature]] and other [[weather]] related factors. Species can also be limited by the availability of macro- and micronutrients.  There has even been evidence of co-limitation in prairie ecosystems.  A study published in 2017 showed that sodium (a micronutrient) had no effect on its own, but when in combination with nitrogen and phosphorus (macronutrients), it did show positive effects, which is evidence of serial co-limitation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspari|first=Michael|last2=Roeder|first2=Karl A.|last3=Benson|first3=Brittany|last4=Weiser|first4=Michael D.|last5=Sanders|first5=Nathan J.|date=2017-02-01|title=Sodium co-limits and catalyzes macronutrients in a prairie food web|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=98|issue=2|pages=315–320|doi=10.1002/ecy.1677|pmid=27936500|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and technology==
AllBusiness.com defines a limiting (constraining) factor as an "item that restricts or limits production or sale of a given product". The examples provided include: "limited machine hours and labor-hours and shortage of materials and skilled labor. Other limiting factors may be cubic feet of display or warehouse space, or working capital."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=AllBusiness Business Glossary|title=Business definition for: Limiting (constraining) factor|accessdate=April 28, 2013|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/constraining-limiting-factor/4949815-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also frequently used in technology literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Sheriff, A., Bouchlaghem, D., El-Hamalawi, A., and Yeomans, S. |year=2012|title=Information Management in UK-Based Architecture and Engineering Organizations: Drivers, Constraining Factors, and Barriers|journal=Journal of Management Engineering|volume =28 |issue =2|pages= 170–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Institutional Factors in Information Technology Innovation|authors=

The analysis of limiting business factors is part of the [[program evaluation and review technique]], [[critical path analysis]], and [[theory of constraints]] as presented in the novel ''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]''.

In the design of [[chemical reaction]]s to produce a chemical product, one of the reagents may be consumed by the reaction before the others. The amount of product is limited by the supply of this reagent. This [[limiting reagent]] determines the theoretical [[Yield (chemistry)|yield]] of the reaction.

'''Lotus Marketplace''' was a [[database]] [[computer program|program]] developed jointly by [[Lotus Development Corporation]] (as the [[software developer]]) and [[Equifax]] (as the information provider), announced on April 10, 1990, but cancelled shortly after on January 23, 1991, mainly due to massive protests and [[lawsuit]] threats, citing [[invasion of privacy]]. This program was rather large (even by today's standards), as it was supposed to be released on several [[CD-ROM]]s.

''Lotus Marketplace'' was to be released in two editions, ''Lotus Marketplace: Business'' (containing information about businesses) and ''Lotus Marketplace: Households'' (containing information about peoples and households).

The ''Business'' edition of this program contained information about 7 million [[business]]es in the [[United States]], just like [[Yellow Pages]], but could quickly and flexibly be searched. Unlike the ''Households'' edition, this edition was not so controversial and was released in October 1990, but was cancelled along with the ''Households'' edition; concerns about profitability were cited.

The ''Households'' edition of this program became infamous and the object of considerable opprobrium because it was supposed to contain [[privacy|private]] information about 120 million people and 80 million [[household]]s in the United States. Information such as names, addresses, [[telephone number]]s, [[demographic]] information, and prior purchasing behavior were contained in the program and could be searched quickly and flexibly. This program was strongly protested by many, who cited [[customer privacy]] issues (because using this program [[telemarketing|telemarketers]] could get hundreds of names and addresses, and [[Distribution list|mass mail]] those addresses without addressees' discretion). The backlash online was particularly intense, with a new [[Usenet newsgroup]] formed to discuss it. Information was circulated online about how to contact Lotus and request the removal of one's information from the database; more than 30,000 people would eventually so contact Lotus. The decision to not release it was seen as a victory for [[internet activism|online activism]].&lt;ref&gt;"In the end, many acknowledged the role of online action in stopping the release of MarketPlace. Some subsequently called it a "victory for computer populism" (Winner 1991)." from "The promise and the peril of social action in cyberspace: ethos, delivery, and the protests over MarketPlace and the Clipper chip", Laura J. Gurak; as published in ''Communities in Cyberspace'', edited by Marc A. Smith and Peter Kollock; {{ISBN|0-415-19140-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lycourgos Kyprianou''' (born 1954/1955) is a Cypriot businessman, and the former chairman of GlobalSoft and AremisSoft Corp. Together with his business partner, [[Roys Poyiadjis]], he has been charged with defrauding investors of $565 million. He fled to Cyprus, where he remains, and in 2018, the Cyprus justice ministry confirmed that no Cypriot has been extradited to the US.

==Fraud charges==
In 2002, Kyprianou was charged with securities fraud and money laundering by the US authorities.&lt;ref name="upi.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Rich-fugitives-assets-frozen-worldwide/87881122038011/|title=Rich fugitive's assets frozen worldwide|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraud was uncovered in 2001, after which Kyprianou and Poyiadjis fled to Cyprus.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt; 

In July 2005, a Nicosia court ordered a global freeze on Kyprianou's assets following an alleged US$565 million perpetrated by Kyprianou and Poyiadjis on the shareholders of [[AremisSoft]].&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt; The previous month, Poyiadjis agreed to repay $200 million to investors.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt; Kyprianou has denied all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/cyprus/cmnews/2002/02-10-25.cmnews.html|title=Cyprus Mail: News Articles in English, 02-10-25|website=www.hri.org|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Stephen Hotchin''' (born 25 December 1958)&lt;ref name=taylor-201102/&gt; is a former [[New Zealand]] property developer and financier. He was a director of the failed [[Hanover Group]] which owned a number of finance companies including [[Hanover Finance]], United Finance, Nationwide Finance and FAI Finance.

With Eric Watson he bought 30 per cent of Elders Finance in 1999 and in December that year bought it outright. Elders Finance became the core of what would become Hanover Finance. Two years on, their other finance and investment assets (Nationwide Finance, Leasing Solutions, Elders Home Loans and Hanover Securities) were rolled in to create Hanover Group with reported assets of $650m.&lt;ref name=taylor-201102&gt;{{Cite news

The flow on effects of the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] and nervous reaction of investors lowered overall confidence in the market and saw over 50 finance companies in New Zealand fail by 2010.  Hanover applied to the trustee for a repayment freeze or moratorium rather than a receivership.&lt;ref name=Hanover_plan_too_optimistic&gt;{{Cite news
| title = Hanover plan too optimistic – experts
| work = The Dominion Post
| date = 21 November 2011
| url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/727550}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the repayment freeze Hanover prepared a debt repayment plan, offering to repay investors over a 5-year period. As part of the plan, Hotchin and Watson pledged $96 million of assets.&lt;ref name=Hanover_plan_too_optimistic/&gt; These assets fell in value as property prices declined.&lt;ref name="Better_Deal"/&gt;

Hotchin arranged for Allied Farmers to take over the failing business, but the losses overwhelmed the new owner and the business was put into liquidation in 2010.  In December 2011 the [[Financial Markets Authority (New Zealand)|Financial Markets Authority]] (FMA) announced that it proposed to file civil proceedings against Hotchin and the other directors and promoters of Hanover.&lt;ref name=fma1&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.fma.govt.nz/keep-updated/newsroom/media-releases/2011/fma-to-file-civil-proceedings-against-directors-and-promoters-of-the-hanover-group/ |title= FMA to file civil proceedings against directors and promoters of the Hanover group |publisher= Financial Markets Authority |date= 15 December 2011 |accessdate= 28 April 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130208043100/https://www.fma.govt.nz/keep-updated/newsroom/media-releases/2011/fma-to-file-civil-proceedings-against-directors-and-promoters-of-the-hanover-group/ |archivedate= 8 February 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and business==
Mark Hotchin was born in [[Auckland]], and attended Roman Catholic schools, St Joseph's Primary School in [[Onehunga]], [[Marcellin College, Auckland|Marcellin College]] and [[St. Paul's College, Auckland|St Paul's College]].&lt;ref name="taylor-201102"/&gt; His father owned a joinery factory, and was also involved with property development.&lt;ref name="herald-2008"&gt;{{Cite news

When Mark Hotchin left school he worked in his father's factory. His first business was a sports goods store, which got into financial trouble and was rescued by his father.&lt;ref name=taylor-201102/&gt; 

Hotchin first bought and subdivided a house for profit in 1982 when he was 23 years old. He then did an increasing number of such subdivisions. In the 1990s, he bought Regency Court in the Auckland suburb of [[Saint Heliers]] for $6 million, selling it later for $10 million.&lt;ref name=taylor-201102/&gt; He bought the successful taxi company Corporate Cabs, expanded it and sold it in 1999 to former [[Skellerup|Skellerup Group]] boss Murray Bolton.&lt;ref name="cab"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bought [[Matarangi|Matarangi Beach Estates]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=taylor-201102/&gt;

==Finance companies==
Hotchin's property development work depended on borrowing from finance companies and banks. Hotchin saw an opportunity to lend to developers like himself and bridge the gap between bank funding and equity funding. This coincided with a boom in the housing and construction market in NZ throughout the early part of the 2000s.

===Hanover group===
{{main|Hanover Group}}

Hotchin and business partner [[Eric Watson (businessman)|Eric Watson]] bought Elders Finance in 1999. Elders, and a number of other finance companies, were brought together to create Hanover Group.&lt;ref name=taylor-201102/&gt; With $650 million in assets,&lt;ref name=taylor-201102/&gt; this was New Zealand's third largest finance company at the time. In 2007, Forbes listed Hotchin and Watson as the 33rd and 34th richest people in New Zealand and Australia.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotchin's interests ranged outside the traditional finance company model. In 2003 Hotchin through the Hanover Group bought a 10% stake in Tower,&lt;ref name="Tower_Stake"&gt;{{cite web
| work = ShareChat.co.nz
| title = Hanover increases Tower stake and ante

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a large fund management and insurance business. Hanover wanted a better deal for investors and forced Tower and owners GPG to review the capital raising and underwrite deal they had agreed.

In 2007 Hanover Group made an after tax profit of $105m. Controversially Hanover Finance paid NZ$45.5 million in dividends to Hotchin and Watson in the year ending 30 June 2008.&lt;ref name=fran_aug2010&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of these dividends were then reinvested back into the company to reduce related party transactions, which at the time were around 14% of the loan book.

As a result of the FMA's announcement former Hanover Finance's chairman Greg Muir issued a media statement saying that "the FMA investigators were given a substantial amount of evidence demonstrating that the directors conducted themselves responsibly, with appropriate rigour, and made judgments they believed were in the best interests of the company and its investors on the information available to them at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Amongst the most controversial of his New Zealand assets is a still unfinished house on the upmarket Paretai Drive, in the Auckland suburb of Orakei. This house has been the target of much of the public's ill-feeling towards Hotchin.

The '''marketing supply chain''' is the chain of suppliers that an organization relies on to produce marketing materials (print, [[promotional products]] and [[point of sale]]) to market their products and services.

The marketing [[supply chain]] is often made up of partners inside and outside of the organization – such as brand managers, marketing services, agencies, direct sales teams, buyers, printers, fulfillment houses and many others.

From product brochures and promotional flyers to point-of-sale systems and store signage, each of these supplies must be acquired, managed and distributed to customers, sales teams, branch offices, retail outlets, dealers, distributors and other key audiences around the world.

==Flow==
Similar to manufacturing environments, marketing supply chains are primarily governed by a process or "flow" that typically involves:
* Creation – identifying and developing marketing materials to meet customer need and/or to support sales initiatives,
* Production – getting materials in their final form either through sourcing, printing or [[Web development]],
* Warehousing – technology, storage strategy, planning,
* Fulfillment – order management, service standards, shipping and tracking use/consumption – how materials are used and displayed in the field and stored based on seasonality or product/service availability,
* Feedback – collecting information for continuous refinement; from inventory reporting, management metrics, field/customer feedback.

==Technology==
The technology field for meeting the needs to the entire marketing supply chain is still a bit disconnected. A new breed of comprehensive [http://www.propago.com Marketing Management Platforms] are on their way to the market. These platforms enable marketers to give access to their marketing materials to anyone that is responsible for promoting the brand. This could include sales teams, employees, vendors, partners, affiliates or anyone else the marketer determines needs the access. In general these platforms are tasked with the following features:
* Protect the brand, protect the budget and protect the inventory: As marketers open up the access for people to pull marketing materials through automated methods there must be controls in place to ensure they are being used in compliance with the corporate directives.
* Promote the brand; Physically, Digitally and Socially: The platforms must be able to support a number of different mediums to be able to truly handle the entire marketing supply chain.
* Propagate the materials; Quickly, Easily and Efficiently: With complex supply chains these technologies must be able to connect to multiple vendors/manufacturers and ensure they have the ability to quickly produce, procure and fulfill the materials to the targeted destination.


Over time, most supply chains can grow cumbersome and unwieldy as new partners, new products and new technologies are added, resulting in increased cost, decreased service levels and an overall loss of control. Some of the world’s largest consulting firms estimate that up to 60% of marketing costs are related to non-product ancillary areas (distribution, people, freight, storage, obsolescence, technology, [[Inventory|inventory management]], etc.).

Companies have tackled cost reduction from a "largest spend first" philosophy. As a result, some very substantial cost savings opportunities are often overlooked, such as indirect materials and supplies – those products and services that are not a core or direct part of the company’s finished product.

By taking a complete marketing supply chain approach, identifying inefficiencies and developing best business practices, companies can improve their marketing supply chain process. Outsourcing the process can help manage total marketing supply chain cost, and can provide an opportunity for measurement in marketing, one of the major challenges in the profession.

The '''National Black Chamber of Commerce''' ('''NBCC''') was incorporated as ''The National Black Chamber of Commerce, Inc.'', in 1993.  It is a [[nonprofit]], [[nonpartisan]], [[nonsectarian]] [[organization]] dedicated to the economic [[empowerment]] of [[African American]] communities.  Additionally, the organization indicates that it represents the views of its members regarding economic and political policy issues; domestically and internationally.  It is organized as a [[501(c)]] corporation and has at least 190 chapters within the United States.  The NBCC also has international chapters in the [[Bahamas]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ghana]] and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  As with all [[Chamber of Commerce|Chambers of Commerce]], affiliate branches are committed to carrying out the goals of the main Chamber within their areas.

However, the organization is largely funded by non-African American businesses on behalf of whose interests it often lobbies, such as the [[Fossil fuel industry|fossil fuel]], [[telecommunications]],&lt;ref name="Davies2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Ken|title=National Black Chamber of Commerce: Fossil Funders Revealed|url=http://www.climateinvestigations.org/national-black-chamber-of-commerce-fossil-funders-revealed|website=Climate Investigations Center|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kushnick2007"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kushnick|first1=Bruce|title=Verizon, AT&amp;T and the manipulation of public opinion|url=http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=background.view&amp;backgroundid=167|website=Nieman Watchdog|publisher=Nieman Foundation at Harvard University|accessdate=27 March 2017|date=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dampier2009"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dampier|first1=Philip|title=Special Report — Astroturf Overload – Broadband for America = One Giant Industry Front Group|url=http://stopthecap.com/2009/10/02/special-report-astroturf-overload-broadband-for-america-one-giant-industry-front-group/|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tobacco industry|tobacco industries]],&lt;ref name="Lorber2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lorber|first1=Janie|title=Some Question Black Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/Black-Chamber-of-Commerce-Questions-205755-1.html|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=[[Roll Call]]|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YergerMalone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yerger VB, Malone RE|title=African American leadership groups: smoking with the enemy|journal=Tobacco Control|date=December 2002|volume=11|issue=4|pages=336–45|pmid=12432159|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/4/336.long|doi=10.1136/tc.11.4.336|pmc=1747674}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sometimes been accused of being a [[front group]].&lt;ref name="Dampier2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alvarado2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alvarado|first1=Francisco|title=National Black Chamber of Commerce, Solar Energy Critic, Rakes in Cash From Polluters|url=http://fcir.org/2015/08/13/national-black-chamber-of-commerce-solar-energy-critic-rakes-in-cash-from-polluters/|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=Florida Center for Investigative Reporting|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The NBCC is a very young national organization when compared to others such as the [[NAACP]] and the [[Congress on Racial Equality]] (CORE). NBCC was founded in 1993 by Harry C. Alford and his wife Kay DeBow.&lt;ref name=fcir20150813/&gt; Alford, who serves as the first President and CEO, is also a Board member of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview reported in ''[[Human Events]]'', Mr. Alford identifies with the [[Booker T. Washington]] approach to African American self empowerment and sees the approach of [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] and the [[NAACP]] (whom he calls ''enemies of Washington'') as primarily political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Mission and strategic goals==
The stated mission of the NBCC is to "economically empower and sustain African American communities through entrepreneurship and capitalistic activity within the United States and via interaction with the Black [[Diaspora]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claims to be the first major African American organization to focus on economic empowerment.

The NBCC works to fulfill its mission by implementing the following goals:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
*Increase [[business development]] and [[economic growth]] within the African American community via [[procurement]], access to [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[international trade]].
*Secure [[sponsorship]] for the [[funding]] and guidance of NBCC programs.
*Educate and train members of the African American community regarding business development and their purpose to benefit society.
*Provide [[technical support]] to affiliate chapters.

===Business development===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
The NBCC reaches 100,000 Black owned businesses. There are 1 million Black owned businesses in the United States. Black businesses account for over $100 billion in annual sales. African Americans have over $800 billion in expendable income each year according to the US Bureau of Census.

===Funding===

The NBCC "is funded primarily by fossil fuel energy companies, including [[Koch Industries]] and ExxonMobil," according to a 2015 analysis by the [[Florida Center for Investigative Reporting]].&lt;ref name=fcir20150813&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Florida Center for Investigative Reporting]] |title=National Black Chamber of Commerce, Solar Energy Critic, Rakes in Cash From Polluters |date=August 13, 2015 |first=Francisco |last=Alvarado |url=http://fcir.org/2015/08/13/national-black-chamber-of-commerce-solar-energy-critic-rakes-in-cash-from-polluters/ |accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exxon Mobil]] includes the NBCC on its 2004 list of contributions and community investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

==Positions==

The NBCC takes positions on federal and state legislation and issues that may affect its goals.

The NBCC "has been a staunch ally of utility and fossil fuel companies for nearly a quarter century," according to the [[Florida Center for Investigative Reporting]].&lt;ref name=fcir20150813/&gt;

* In testimony submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] regarding Senate Bill S.625, the NBCC stated that it opposes increased the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulation of tobacco.  The reason for its opposition is that the regulation would impose fees affecting small tobacco retailing and distribution businesses in the U.S., many of which are owned by [[Black American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{main|North African Campaign (World War I)}}

Infantry Machine-Gun [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Nuri Efendi was sent to [[Ottoman Libya|Libya]] on an illegal Greek ship with [[Major]] [[Jafar al-Askari|Jafar al-Askari Bey]] and 10,000 gold. His mission was to organize and coordinate operations of [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)|Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa]] forces with local forces against Italian and British forces. They landed on the shore between [[Tobruk]] and [[Sallum]] on February 21, 1915 and then  went to [[Ahmed Sharif es Senussi]] in Sallum.&lt;ref name="Hamit"&gt;Hamit Pehlivanlı, [http://www.atam.gov.tr/index.php?Page=DergiIcerik&amp;IcerikNo=295 "Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa Kuzey Afrika'da (1914-1918)"], ''Atatürk Araştırma Merkezi Dergisi'', Sayı 47, Cilt: XVI, Temmuz 2000. {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, in an attempt to organize the efforts which was dispersed by the British, the Ottoman General Staff established the “Africa Groups Command” (''Afrika Grupları Komutanlığı''), of which the primary objective was the coastal regions of Libya. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Nuri Bey was appointed its first commander. And his chief of Staff was Staff [[Major]] [[Nafiz Gürman|Abdurrahman Nafiz Bey (Gürman)]].&lt;ref name="Hamit"/&gt;

=== Caucasus ===
{{main|Caucasus Campaign}}

Nuri Bey's elder brother [[Enver Pasha]], commander of the Ottoman Army, who saw an opportunity in Caucuses after the Russian Revolution took Russia out of Word War I, called back Nuri Bey from Libya. He was promoted to [[Mirliva]] Fahri (honorary) [[Ferik (rank)|Ferik]] and gave the mission to form and command the [[Army of Islam (Ottoman Empire)|Army of Islam]]. Nuri Bey came to Yelizavetpol (present day: [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]) on May 25, 1918 and began to organize his forces.&lt;ref&gt;Ajun Kurter, ''Türk Hava Kuvvetleri Tarihi'', Cilt: IV, 3rd edition, Türk Hava Kuvvetleri Komutanlığı, 2009, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The Army of Islam was formed officially on July 10, 1918&lt;ref name="Erickson189"&gt;Edward J.

At the end of the war, Nuri was arrested by British troops and held in detention in [[Batum]], awaiting trial for wartime crimes. In August 1919, his supporters ambushed guards escorting him and helped him escape to [[Erzurum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==

The precursor to Odournet, Project Research Amsterdam, was founded in 1980 by Anton Philip "Ton" van Harreveld.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The [[sole proprietorship]] sought to more efficiently characterize and abate odors in environmental settings.&lt;ref name="Ando"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amiando.com/WGYGFMG.html?page=958097 |title=How R&amp;D improves Sustainability and Quality of Life in Smart Cities |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.amiando.com |publisher=[[Amiando]]|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first computerized olfactometer was developed by VanHarreveld's then unipersonal company Project Research Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; This company was incorporated as a limited, Project Research Amsterdam BV in 1989, adding environmental consultant Frans Vossen as co-founder. The company became known as Odournet in 1993, and they opened their first international office in [[Bradford on Avon]], [[England]] the following year.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizdb.co.uk/company/Odournet-uk-ltd-02900894/|title=Odournet Uk Ltd |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.bizdb.co.uk |publisher=BizDB|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Odournet merged with Ecoma and OLFAtec, two similar odor management consultancy companies based in Germany. Ecoma and OLFAtec were absorbed into Odournet under the terms of the merger.&lt;ref name="OloresMerger"/&gt; Founder Ton van Harreveld served as Odournet's [[CEO]] until 2014. He stepped down from the position, allowing Simon Rützel-Grünberg to take over. Van Harreveld remains a board member and the [[chief innovation officer]] at the company.&lt;ref name="CEO"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Environmental group, Odournet, appoints Simon Rützel-Grünberg as new CEO | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Future Enviro | date =1 October 2014 | url =http://futurenviro.es/en/simon-rutzel-grunberg-nuevo-director-gerente-del-grupo-environmental-Odournet/| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Odournet GmbH (Kiel) and Odournet BV (Amsterdam) left the Odournet group and became Olfasense.

==Services==

Odournet provides odor management consultancy and odor assessments. Its services can be categorized into four areas: environmental odor management; product and material testing; odour measurement equipment; and calibration and proficiency testing for other odor labs. A large portion of the company's revenue derives from environmental odor management as many companies in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] must adhere to odor emissions guidelines.&lt;ref name="BSOpp"&gt;{{cite news | last=Rao| first=Rakesh| title =Dutch firm Odournet smells big opportunity in odour management in India| newspaper =[[Business Standard]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =22 May 2015 | url =http://www.business-standard.com/content/b2b-chemicals/dutch-firm-Odournet-smells-big-opportunity-in-odour-management-in-india-115052201179_1.html| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company uses olfactometers, [[Chromatography|gas chromatographs]], and [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]] to isolate and identify the prevalence of odors in a given environment.

'''Peter Adalbert Robert George Fritz''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (born 4 January 1943)&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in Business in Australia, January – June 2005, 
Volume I – Biographies, Page 261&lt;/ref&gt; is an Australian businessman and philanthropist.  He was born in [[Arad, Romania]] and migrated to Australia in 1962.  He has been Group Managing Director of the TCG Group of Companies since 1971 and Chairman of institute for active policy Global Access Partners&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalaccesspartners.org/contact.html&lt;/ref&gt; since 1997.
  
Peter is a co-founder of well over 100 companies and several business accelerators. TCG® is a group of innovative businesses which over the last 46 years have been at the forefront of Australian innovation. They produced many breakthrough discoveries in computer and communication technologies, data transmission, management structures and the food industry, including VOIP telephony (1998); design and manufacturing of plastic note sorting machines (1995); lottery ticket validation terminal (1988); mirror microwave communication technology and CT3 technology, first in the world (1986); BOW Memory unit for cash registers (1985); credit card validation system (pioneer technology in secure transmission) and MOX memory unit for building security (1984); low-cost fossil fuel power station simulator (1983); the first echo-free, hands-free telephone handset (1978); and online stock control system - the first real-time system in commercial use (1972).

Peter established and chaired the National Incubator Companies Board (ATP) between 1992 and 1997 and co-founded the Joint Technology Partners incubator – a significant investor in Australian technology start-ups.

In 1993, some of the 65 companies in the TCG Group were publicly floated on the Australian Stock Exchange as TechComm Group Limited, later renamed Utility Computer Services ([[UXC]]). In 2016, UXC was acquired by CSC for $430 million. Another former TCG company floated on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1997 for US$600m (AU$1 billion), making it the largest technology company to be established in Australia until that time. Today the TCG companies, and entities with TCG roots, employ well over 6000 people with a turnover in excess of $1.5 billion annually.

Peter's innovative management style and corporate structuring has led to the creation of a business model which is being copied by many successful entrepreneurs, and has become part of university undergraduate and masters programs in business management in Australia and around the world.

Peter holds six degrees or professional qualifications, is an adjunct professor at the [[University of Technology Sydney]] and an honorary member  of the Hungarian Academy of Engineering 1998. He is a fellow of the Australian Computer Society, the Institute of Engineers Australia, and the Australian Society of Accountants.  His many awards include The [[Order of Australia]] in 1993 and the UTS Alumni Award for Excellence 2010.  His books include 'The Possible Dream' (Penguin 1988),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2080318&lt;/ref&gt; 'Beyond "Yes"' (Harper Collins 1998),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3291620&lt;/ref&gt; "The Profit Principle" co-authored by  Jeanne-Vida Douglas (John Wiley and Sons 2010)&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4925431&lt;/ref&gt; and "Managing for Change" co-authored by Brad Howarth (TCG Publications 2014).&lt;ref&gt;https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/6541219&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter chairs the Australian Government Consultative Committee on Knowledge Capital&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/news/Management-Focus/Accounting-for-the-uncountable/2005/02/14/1108229910079.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finance.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/annualreport04-05/chapter06_05.html&lt;/ref&gt; and serves on a number of private enterprise boards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nblf.com.au/about-nblf/forum-steering-committee/&lt;/ref&gt; He represented Australia on the [[OECD]] Small Medium Size Enterprise committee and in other OECD forums.&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kYLqigUA60UJ:www.insme.org/documenti/mm-Malmo-Final-25-Feb-04.ppt+OECD+peter+fritz&amp;cd=8&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;client=firefox-a&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Fritz is a Member of the Board of the Global Panel Foundation - Australasia - a respected non-government organisation (with offices and satellites in Berlin, Copenhagen, New York, Prague, Sydney and Toronto) that works behind the scenes in crisis areas around the world. The current Australasia Chair is the Rt. Hon. Don McKinnon, former Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Commonwealth Secretary General, and the Vice Chair is Hon. Philip Ruddock.

Peter co-chaired the government-commissioned Working Group on Education and Training in Philanthropy and Social Investment (2007–2008) which led to the establishment of the Centre for Social Impact (CSI) in 2008, a national centre for philanthropy and social investment, with an Australian Government endowment of $12.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Enterprise Annual Report 2007, http://www.swinburne.edu.au/business/documents/faculty/FBEAnnualReport2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The CSI is a joint collaboration between the business schools of the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Melbourne Business School]], [[Swinburne University of Technology]] and the [[University of Western Australia]] and provides managerial education, executive support and research for the not-for-profit sector.

Peter was instrumental in the establishment of the OECD Working Group on SMEs (1993), Society for Knowledge Economics (2005), Australian Society for Progress and Wellbeing (2014), National Small Business Centre (1992), International Institute for Negotiation and Conflict Management (1996), and many others.

Peter is a regular blogger on the issues of [[innovation]] and [[entrepreneurship]] on [[Open Forum (Australia)]].[15] He is currently collaborating with privacy expert Malcolm Crompton and author Brad Howarth on a new book “A Vision for an Innovative Australia” based on interviews with eminent Australian and international thought leaders. The book explores what Australia’s core competencies are and is relevant for any government long-term planning.

'''The primary/secondary quality distinction''' is a conceptual distinction in [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]], concerning the nature of [[reality]].  It is most explicitly articulated by [[John Locke]] in his ''[[Essay concerning Human Understanding]]'', but earlier thinkers such as [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]] made similar distinctions.

'''Primary qualities''' are thought to be [[properties]] of objects that are independent of any observer, such as [[solid]]ity, [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]], [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[number]] and [[shape|figure]]. These characteristics convey facts. They exist in the thing itself, can be determined with certainty, and do not rely on subjective judgments. For example, if an object is spherical, no one can reasonably argue that it is triangular.

'''Secondary qualities''' are thought to be properties that produce [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s in observers, such as [[color]], [[taste]], [[olfaction|smell]], and [[sound]]. They can be described as the effect things have on certain people. [[Knowledge]] that comes from secondary qualities does not provide objective facts about things.

Primary qualities are measurable aspects of physical reality. Secondary qualities are subjective.

==History==

* "By convention there are sweet and bitter, hot and cold, by convention there is color; but in truth there are atoms and the void"
:—Democritus, Fragment 9.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Sextus Empiricus, ''Adversus Mathematicos'' vii 135&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we locate them are concerned, and that they reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated"
:—Galileo Galilei, ''The Assayer'' (published 1623).&lt;ref&gt;As reprinted in (Drake, 1957, p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[I]t must certainly be concluded regarding those things which, in external objects, we call by the names of light, color, odor, taste, sound, heat, cold, and of other tactile qualities, [...]; that we are not aware of their being anything other than various arrangements of the size, figure, and motions of the parts of these objects which make it possible for our nerves to move in various ways, and to excite in our soul all the various feelings which they produce there."
:—René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' (published 1644/1647).&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René.  ''Principles of Philosophy''.  1644/1647.  Trans. Valentine Rodger Miller and Reese P. Miller.  D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1984.  Page 282.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For the rays, to speak properly, are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir up a sensation of this or that colour."
:—Isaac Newton, ''Optics'' (3rd ed. 1721, original in 1704).&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in (Newton, 1953, ed. Chris Jamieson, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Leibniz===

[[Leibniz]] was an early critic of the distinction, writing in his 1686 ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'' that "[i]t is even possible to demonstrate that the ideas of size, figure and motion are not so distinctive as is imagined, and that they stand for something imaginary relative to our perceptions as do, although to a greater extent, the ideas of color, heat, and the other similar qualities in regard to which we may doubt whether they are actually to be found in the nature of the things outside of us."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G. W.  ''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XII.  1686.  Trans. George R. Montgomery.  The Open Court Publishing Company, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berkeley===

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

[[George Berkeley]] wrote his famous critique of this distinction in his book [[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]. Berkeley maintained that the ideas created by sensations are all that people can know for sure. As a result, what is perceived as real consists only of ideas in the mind. The crux of Berkeley's argument is that once an object is stripped of all its secondary qualities, it becomes very problematic to assign any acceptable meaning to the idea that ''there is'' some object.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Georges Dicker, ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, Part III, paragraph 8: "Berkeley's Attack on the Theory of Primary and Secondary Qualities"&lt;/ref&gt; Not that one cannot picture to oneself (in one's mind) that some object could exist apart from any perceiver — one clearly can do this — but rather, that one cannot give any ''content'' to this idea. Suppose that someone says that a particular mind-independent object (meaning, an object free of all secondary qualities) exists at some particular spatio-temporal location (in Newtonian terms, in some particular place and at some particular time). Now, none of this particularly means anything if one cannot specify a place and time. In that case it's still a purely imaginary, empty idea. This is not generally thought to be a problem because realists imagine that they can, in fact, specify a place and time for a 'mind-independent' object.  What is overlooked is that they can only specify a place and time in place and time ''as we experience them''. Berkeley did not doubt that one can do this, but that it is objective. One has simply related ideas to experiences (the idea of an ''object'' to our ''experiences of space and time''). In this case there is no space and time, and therefore no objectivity. Space and time as we experience them are always piecemeal (even when the piece of space is big, as in some astronomical photos), it is only in imagination that they are total and all-encompassing, which is how we definitely imagine (!) 'real' space and time as being. This is why Berkeley argued that the materialist has merely an ''idea'' of an unperceived object: because people typically do take our imagining or picturing, as guaranteeing an objective reality to the 'existence' of 'something'. In no adequate way has it been specified nor given any acceptable meaning. As such Berkeley comes to his conclusion that having a compelling image in the mind, one which connects to no specifiable thing external to us, does not guarantee an objective existence.

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science]]'', claimed that primary, as well as secondary, qualities are subjective. They are both mere appearances that are located in the mind of a knowing observer. In  § 13, Remark II, he wrote: "Long before Locke's time, but assuredly since him, it has been generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external things, that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in themselves, but to their appearances, and to have no proper existence outside our representation. Heat, color, and taste, for instance, are of this kind. Now, if I go farther, and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of bodies also, which are called primary, such as extension, place, and in general space, with all that which belongs to it (impenetrability or materiality, space, etc.)—no one in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible."

'''Sebastiano Montelupi''' ({{lang-pl|Sebastian Montelupi}}, name occasionally Polonized as ''Wilczogórski'', 1516 – 18 August 1600),&lt;ref name="Jagiełło"/&gt; was an Italian-born merchant and banker in [[Kraków]], Poland, and [[Postmaster]] General of the Polish royal postal service under [[Sigismund II Augustus]], [[Henry III of Poland]], [[Anna Jagiellon]], [[Stephen Báthory]] and [[Sigismund III Vasa]].

==Life==
Montelupi left Italy in 1536, settling in the [[Kingdom of Poland (Jagiellonian)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1557. He worked for the merchants and bankers Carlo and Bernardo Soderini until establishing himself independently in partnership with his younger brother Carlo.&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt;
[[File:Dom Włoski.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Montelupi House (now a hostel) on the main square in Kraków]]In 1567 he married the teenaged Urszula, daughter of doctor of medicine [[Wojciech Baza]] (died 1569),&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; physician to the court.&lt;ref name="Lisowski"/&gt; The year after the wedding the couple moved into a ''[[Kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]]'' residence in the centre of Kraków, rebuilt in the Renaissance style. This building, known as the [[Italian House]] or Montelupi House, also served as the central post office. Urszula was to die without surviving issue on 12 July 1586, aged 35, after 19 years of marriage.&lt;ref name="Starowolski"/&gt; At one point [[Francesco Pucci]] had consulted [[John Dee]] on Montelupi's behalf, to determine whether their childlessness could be due to witchcraft.&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt;

==Career==
As a merchant, Montelupi traded with Italy, Germany, England, Austria and Russia. As a banker, his clients included the [[Apostolic Nuncio to Poland|papal nuncios at the Polish court]].&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; In 1574, the city reimbursed Montelupi a little over ''[[Polish złoty#First z.C5.82oty|fl]]''.1,827 for his contributions to the ceremony of receiving and performing hommage to the new king, Henry III; these contributions included a yard and a half of red Chinese cloth for the dish holding the keys to the city, and a number of [[vermeil]] vessels and a large silver vase that were presented to the king.&lt;ref name="Fournier"/&gt; In 1581 Montelupi advanced ''fl''.3,000 to King Stephen Báthory to help finance that year's [[Siege of Pskov|campaign against Muscovy]].&lt;ref name="Fournier"/&gt; Towards the end of his life he became court banker to King Sigismund III, and consul of the Italian community in the capital.&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; In the 1580s he funded the publication of work by the Franciscan writer [[Annibale Rosselli]].&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; He died in Kraków on 18 August 1600, aged 84,&lt;ref name="Starowolski"/&gt; leaving an estate valued at ''fl''.150,000.&lt;ref name="goldthwaite"/&gt; He was succeeded by his nephew and adopted heir, [[Valerio Tamburini Montelupi]] (Walerian Montelupi, 1548–1613), who thus became the richest citizen in Kraków.&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt;

===Master of the Royal Post===
From 1568 Montelupi was postmaster general of the [[Polish Royal Post]] (succeeding [[Pietro Maffon]]), running one public service to [[Vilnius]] (in three weeks) and another to Vienna and Venice (in ten days).&lt;ref name="Ronchi De Michelis"/&gt; These services were suspended in 1572 and when resumed in 1574 were reserved for the carriage of royal messages. In 1583 he was confirmed as royal postmaster general by the new king, Stephen Báthory, on condition he maintain public deliveries between the major cities of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and an international service to and from Venice at least twice each month. His position enabled Montelupi to provide high-level information services for correspondents including the [[Medici]] in Florence and the [[Fugger]] in Augsburg.&lt;ref name="nachrichtenverkehr"/&gt;

At Sebastiano's death the postmastership also passed to his nephew Valerio, and in time to Valerio's descendants, the last postmaster of the dynasty being [[Carlo Montelupi de Mari]] (Karol Montelupi, died 1662).&lt;ref name="Montelupi"/&gt; Another Italian, [[Angelo Maria Bandinelli]], then became royal postmaster general.&lt;ref name="Bandinelli, Roberto"/&gt;

==Commemoration==
A magnificent monument to Sebastiano Montelupi and his wife Urszula was erected in [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków]]. The work has been attributed to the workshop of Italian-Polish architect and sculptor [[Santi Gucci]].&lt;ref name="Rudzinski"/&gt;

A street in Kraków is named after his family, as is his [[kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]], and [[Montelupi Palace|a palace]] built by his descendants.&lt;ref name="pudlowski"/&gt;

In 2008 a commemorative stamp set celebrating the 450th anniversary of the Polish postal service was issued, featuring portraits of [[Prosper Provano]] and Sebastiano Montelupi.&lt;ref name="Joystamps"/&gt; The portrait of Montelupi was based on the effigy incorporated into the Montelupi monument.

The '''Shell–Paques process''', also known by the trade name of '''Thiopaq O&amp;G''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paqell.com/thiopaq/process-description/ ''Thiopaq Process Description'']&lt;/ref&gt; is a gas [[desulfurization]] technology for the removal of [[hydrogen sulfide]] from natural-, refinery-, synthesis- and [[biogas]]. The process was initially named after the [[Shell Oil]] and Paques purification companies. After accession of a dedicated joint venture by the founders, Paqell B.V., the trade name for applications in the Oil &amp; Gas industry was changed to "THIOPAQ O&amp;G".  It is based on the biocatalytical conversion of [[sulfide]] into elemental [[sulfur]]. It operates at near-ambient conditions of temperature, about 30-40&amp;nbsp;°C, and pressure which results in inherent safety. It is an alternative to, for example, the [[Claus process]].

==Process chemistry==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:ThiopaqGenericBlockScheme.jpg|thumb|The process block scheme of the Shell-Paques process]] --&gt;

Each reaction can be applied individually or sequentially as dictated by the characteristics of the stream to be treated. The process consist of three main sections: An absorber (gas washing section), a bioreactor (sulfide oxidation and regeneration of washing liquid) and Sulfur handling section as shown in the figure below:

The washing step uses a dilute alkaline solution to remove hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) from the [[sour gas]] according to: 
	
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + NaOH → NaHS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
	
The loaded washing liquid is transported to a bioreactor where a biocatalyst oxidises the aqueous NaHS to elemental sulfur with about 95% selectivity according to: 
	
:NaHS + ½ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → S + NaOH
	
Combined reaction equation: 
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + ½ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → S + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The regenerated washing liquid is sent back to the washing column.
	
The controlled partial oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur (2) is catalyzed by naturally occurring microorganisms of the genus ''[[Halothiobacillus]]'' in the  bioreactor. These natural, living microorganisms present in the bioreactor catalyse the sulfur conversions and are, by their nature, resilient and adaptive.

In many situations the process can be used for sulfur removal and recovery. When sulfur recovery is desired, the elemental sulfur produced in the aerobic bioreactor will be separated from the aqueous effluent in a separator inside of the reactor. The excess sulfur will be removed as aqueous slurry or cake of up to 65% dry solids content. There are several options for handling this slurry and to convert it into products for sulfuric acid generation, fertiliser or fungicide.

The system is flexible and has several processing options that have ready application in the petroleum refinery or petrochemical complex for managing a variety of sulfur-containing streams including [[sulfidic caustic]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], hydrotreater offgas and fuel gas.

The '''Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry''' ([[abbreviation|abbrev]]: '''SCCCI'''; {{lang-zh|c=新加坡中华总商会|p=Xīnjīapō Zhōnghuá Zǒngshānghuì}}) is a [[business]] [[Chamber of commerce|chamber]] in [[Singapore]].

The organisation has a membership of more than 4,000 companies and over 150 trade associations in Singapore as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/chamber-has-evolved-with-singapore |title=Chinese chamber 'has evolved with Singapore': PM Lee |date=24 September 2016|author= Chia Yan Min }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) was first established in 1906 as the General Chinese Trade Affairs Association by prominent members of the Chinese community. Its original purpose was to look after the trading interests of the [[China|Chinese]] business community, however, to reflect the fact that it had expanded its scope from commerce into industry, the name was changed to its current name in 1977.&lt;ref name="history SG"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/c5ad40a0-9f59-4e18-9d66-2887e1bc758a |title=Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce is founded |work=History SG |publisher= National Library Board Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to protecting and promoting the commercial interest of the Chinese community, the organisation also played a role in the social, cultural and educational spheres with the intention to safeguard Chinese [[Tradition|custom]]s and values. It has raised funds to build schools, and provided assistance to the community in times of crisis.&lt;ref name="100 historic places"&gt;{{cite book |work=National Heritage Board |date=2002|title=Singapore's 100 Historic Places|publisher= Archipelago Press|isbn= 981-4068-23-3 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spaza shop''' is an informal convenience shop business in [[South Africa]], usually run from home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spazanews.co.za/ Spazanews.co.za Welcome page]&lt;/ref&gt; They also serve the purpose of supplementing household incomes of the owners, selling everyday small household items. These shops grew as a result of sprawling townships that made travel to formal shopping places more difficult or expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secure.financialmail.co.za/06/0922/features/hretail.htm|title=Retailers' drive into the township market threatens spaza shops|date=2006-09-28|author=Claire Bisseker|publisher=[[Financial Mail]]; BDFM Publishers (Pty) Ltd.|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somalis in South Africa]] are especially noted for running spaza shops in [[Township (South Africa)|black townships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=African migration: To the land of good hope: African migrants head south as well as north|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21693972-african-migrants-head-south-well-north-land-good-hope|accessdate=7 March 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South African banks are trying to win spaza shops as "bank shops" offering minimal banking services at lower costs than full bank branch offices. The link to the bank's back office is mostly via [[mobile phone]] based [[mobile banking]].&lt;ref name="mobilemoneyafrica_2011-04-23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mobilemoneyafrica.com/standard-sees-big-target-at-the-lower-end/#more-3482

'''Sélim Khawam''' was a dealer in Egyptian antiquities and the founder of the firm that became Khawam Brothers.

==Early life==
Khawam's family were of Syrian Christian origins and moved to Egypt in 1850 when Sélim Khawam started a jewellery shop near the [[Ramses railway station]] in Cairo. They later became involved in the antiquities business.&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Roger Khawam", ''[[The Times]]'', 13 May 2016, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6i2Lkeca3 ''Bibliothèque d’Égyptologie de Monsieur Roger Khawam''] Pierre Berge Associates, Paris, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3228">'''Technology Intelligence (TI)''' is an activity that enables companies to identify the [[technology|technological]] opportunities and threats that could affect the future growth and survival of their business. It aims to capture and disseminate the technological information needed for [[strategic planning]] and decision making. As technology life cycles shorten and business become more [[globalize]]d having effective TI capabilities is becoming increasingly important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/12771/ Technology intelligence: Identifying threats and opportunities from new technologies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403035608/http://publications.eng.cam.ac.uk/12771/ |date=2008-04-03 }} Mortara, L. and Kerr, C. and Phaal, R. and Probert, D., [[University of Cambridge]] (2007)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[Project Socrates]]  identified the exploitation of technology as the most effective foundation for decision making for the complete set of functions within the private and public sectors that determine competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = DoD Unveils Competitive Tool: Project Socrates Offers Valuable Analysis | journal = Washington Technology | date = 1988-05-05 | first = Esther | last = Smith| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centre for Technology Management]] has defined 'technology intelligence' as "the capture and delivery of technological information as part of the process whereby an organisation develops an awareness of technological threats and opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ind/ijtip/2006/00000002/00000001/art00006 A conceptual model for technology intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13267">There are several approaches to defining the substance and scope of '''technology policy'''.

According to the American scientist and policy advisor [[Lewis M. Branscomb]], technology policy concerns the "public means for nurturing those capabilities and optimizing their applications in the service of national goals and interests".&lt;ref name="branscomb1995"&gt;Branscomb, L. M. (1995). Confessions of a Technophile. Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; Branscomb defines [[technology]] in this context as "the aggregation of capabilities, facilities, skills, knowledge, and organization required to successfully create a useful service or product".&lt;ref name="branscomb1995" /&gt;

Other scholars differentiate between technology policy and [[science policy]], suggesting that the former is about "the support, enhancement and development of technology", while the latter focuses on "the development of science and the training of scientists".&lt;ref&gt;Dodgson, M., &amp; Bessant, J. (1997). Effective innovation policy: A new approach. Long Range Planning, 30(1), 143.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rigas Arvanitis, at the Institut de Recherche pour le développement (IRD) in France, suggests that "science and technology policy covers all the public sector measures designed for the creation, funding, support and mobilisation of scientific and technological resources".&lt;ref name="arvanitis"&gt;Arvanitis, Rigas. Science and technology policy. Eolss Publishers Company Limited, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology policy is a form of 'active [[industrial policy]]', and effectively argues, based on the empirical facts of technological development as observed across various societies, industries and time periods, that markets rarely decide industrial fortunes in and of their own and state-intervention or support is required to overcome standard cases of market-failure (which may include, for example, under-funding of Research &amp; Development in highly competitive markets).&lt;ref name="borris&amp;stowsky1997"&gt;Borris, M. &amp; Stowsky, J. (1997). Technology Policy and Economic Growth. Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. UC Berkeley: Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology policy may be more broadly defined. [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/faculty-a-z/michael-pollitt/ Michael G. Pollitt] offers a [[multidisciplinary approach]] with social science and humanities perspective on "Good" policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G.|first=Pollitt, M.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological determinism==
[[Technological determinism]] presumes that a society's [[technology]] drives the development of its social structure and cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.R. and Marx, L., 1994. Does technology drive history?: The dilemma of technological determinism. Mit Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is believed to have been coined by [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely [[Clarence Ayres]] who was a follower of [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[John Dewey]]. [[William Ogburn]] was also known for his radical technological determinism.

Viewed through the lens of [[Science policy]], public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]], intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives, direct funding or indirect support to those organizations who fund, and conduct, research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government in July 1945, wrote "Science is a proper concern of government"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm Vannevar Bush (July 1945), "Science, the Endless Frontier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Vannevar Bush directed the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], and his writings directly inspired researchers to invent the [[hyperlink]] and the [[computer mouse]].  The [[DARPA]] initiative to support computing was the impetus for the [[Internet Protocol]] stack. In the same way that scientific consortiums like [[CERN]] for [[high-energy physics]] have a commitment to public knowledge, access to this public knowledge in physics led directly to CERN's sponsorship of development of the [[World Wide Web]] and standard Internet access for all.

The first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist [[Karl Marx]], whose theoretical framework was grounded in the perspective that changes in technology, and specifically [[Productive forces|productive technology]], are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure, and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society. Marx's position has become embedded in contemporary society, where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is all-pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith &amp; Marx|first= Merrit Roe &amp; Leo |title= Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism|publisher= The MIT Press|date=June 1994|isbn= 978-0262691673}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx's insights, not all Marxists are technological determinists, and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist. Furthermore, there are multiple forms of technological determinism.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bimber|first=Bruce|title=Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=May 1990|volume=20|issue=2|pages=333–351|doi=10.1177/030631290020002006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of technology as a means to liberation or enslavement, a question arising from a technological determinist perspective, David E. Cooper wrote in the Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 38:7-18 (1995), "people myopically impressed by the world as an object of beauty or worship die out. Those who are myopically impressed by it as a source of energy do not: they even prosper." &lt;ref name="Cooper, D. (1995). Technology: Liberation or Enslavement?"&gt;Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement, 38, 7-18. doi:10.1017/S1358246100007256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology policy and economics==
Technology policy takes an 'evolutionary approach' to technical change, and hereby relates to evolutionary growth theory, developed by [[Luigi Pasinetti]], J.S. Metcalfe, Pier Paolo Saviotti, and Koen Frenken and others, building on the early work of [[David Ricardo]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasinetti, Luisi 1981 Structural change and economic growth, Cambridge University Press. J.S. Metcalfe and P.P. Saviotti (eds.), 1991, ''Evolutionary Theories of Economic and Technological Change'', Harwood, 275 pages. J.S. Metcalfe 1998, ''Evolutionary Economics and Creative Destruction'', Routledge, London. Frenken, K., Van Oort, F.G., Verburg, T., Boschma, R.A. (2004). ''Variety and Regional Economic Growth in the Netherlands – Final Report'' (The Hague: Ministry of Economic Affairs), 58 p. (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | doi = 10.1007/s00191-007-0081-5 | title = Export variety and the economic performance of countries | year = 2008 | last1 = Saviotti | first1 = Pier Paolo | last2 = Frenken | first2 = Koen | journal = [[Journal of Evolutionary Economics]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.S. Metcalfe]] noted in 1995 that "much of the traditional economic theory of technology policy is concerned with so-called 'market failures' which prevent the attainment of Pareto equilibria by violating one or other of die conditions for perfect competition".&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, J.S., 1995. Technology systems and technology policy in an evolutionary framework. Cambridge Journal of Economics, 19(1), pp.25-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the evolutionary paradigm, classic [[political science]] teaches technology as a static 'black box'. Similarly [[Neoclassical economics]] treats technology as a residual, or exogenous factor,  to explain otherwise inexplicable growth (for example, shocks in supply that boost production, affecting the equilibrium price level in an economy). In the United States, the creation of the U.S. [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] responded to the need policy approaches wherein not all technologies were treated as identical based on their social or economic variables.  Technology policy is distinct from [[science studies]] but both have been influenced by [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]]. Research in the technology policy domain recognizes the importance of, amongst others, [[Vannevar Bush]], [[Moses Abramovitz]], [[William J. Abernathy]] and [[James M. Utterback]].

Technology policy approaches Science as the pursuit of verifiable or falsifiable hypotheses, while science studies has a [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] view whereby science is not thought to get at an objective reality. Technology policy is rarely post-modern. Its goal is the improvement of policy and organizations based on an evolutionary view, and understanding, of the underlying scientific and technological constraints involved in economic development, but also their potential. For example, some [[clean coal technology|clean coal technologies]] via carbon sequestration and the allocation of electromagnetic spectrum by auction are ideas that emerged from technology policy schools. The [[Dominant design]] paradigm, developed by [[William J. Abernathy]] and [[James M. Utterback]], is an idea with significant implications for innovation, market structure and competitive dynamics both within and between nations that emerged from empirical research in [[Technology management]], a domain of Technology Policy.

The '''UCLA-NUS Executive MBA (EMBA) program''' is a management education program developed jointly by the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management|University of California, Los Angeles (Anderson)]] and the [[NUS Business School]], [[National University of Singapore]]. It allows senior executives from all around the world to participate in.

== About the schools ==

===UCLA Anderson School of Management===
[[UCLA Anderson School of Management]] was established in 1935 and provides management education to more than 1,300 students enrolled in full-time, part-time and executive [[MBA]] and doctoral programs.

===NUS Business School===
By invitation from the Board of Directors of [[Ally Financial|GMAC]] (the administrative body for GMAT), the School has been representing the Southeast Asian region as a governing school of GMAC since 2000. The School is also a "Non-European" member of the international network for excellence in management development ([[EFMD]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1765">An '''undue hardship''' is special or specified circumstances that partially or fully exempt a person or organization from performance of a legal obligation so as to avoid an unreasonable or disproportionate burden or obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;http://adata.org/faq/what-considered-undue-hardship-reasonable-accommodation &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/U/UndueHardship.aspx|title=Undue Hardship Definition|website=www.duhaime.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], Article 2&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, employers are required to provide a [[reasonable accommodation]] to qualified individuals with disabilities, but when an accommodation becomes too taxing on the organization it is classified as an undue hardship and is no longer required.  
These hardships include the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and structure of the employer's operation.

==Early life and education==
[[File:W.E.PereraParents.jpg|thumb|right|W. E. Perera's parents, Mr and Mrs W. Charles Perera]]
W. E. Perera was born in Telok Anson, Perak, to Weeratunge Charles Perera and his wife, Galgodliynage Marthina Perera. His father a contract railway engineer from [[Kotahena]], Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) settled in Malaya (1880s) after accepting the permanent position as Head Guard of the railway between Teluk Anson and [[Tapah]] and later retiring as Chief Inspector, Permanent Ways, of the Malayan Railways.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook4"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his siblings, elder sister Margaret, and younger brothers Samuel, Joseph and Daniel grew up in [[Seremban]], [[Negri Sembilan]] where his father was subsequently transferred. W. E. Perera started his education at [[St. Francis Institution]], [[Malacca]] and then moved to [[St. Xavier's Institution]], [[Penang]] to complete his [[Senior Cambridge|Junior Cambridge]] exams. After passing the local government school leaving exams at Standard VII, at the direction of his father, he continued his studies whilst living in [[Perai|Prai]], [[Penang]] with his parents. He passed his Senior Cambridge Certificate exams on a second try during the height of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="message1966"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perera | first = W. Edward | title = Memoirs to the family |year = 1966| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I (1914–1918)===
The First World War came to Malaya at the [[battle of Penang]] on 28 October 1914. As he describes in his memoirs,&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;

{{quote|The First World War had broken out and I remember one morning at about 4.30 am when I was studying alone, my parents and brothers being all asleep I heard a loud explosion. Everybody was awakened by the noise and we opened the door and went outside and looked towards the seaside, when we saw flashes of light and heard more explosions. That was the bombardment of the Russian cruiser [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug|Zhemchug]] by the German pirate cruiser "[[SMS Emden (1908)|Emden]]". After the sinking of the Russian Cruiser, the German ship steamed out of the Harbour and disappeared before the British Man-of-War had time to catch up with her. That morning when we went to school we saw the dead bodies of the Russian sailors floating all over the sea between [[Butterworth, Penang|Butterworth]] and Penang. It was all excitement in Penang and our school closed for the day. We spent a good part of that morning at the harbour watching the marine police  and volunteers bringing ashore dead bodies. The single regiment of the [[Federation of Malaya]] known as the [[Malay States Guides]] which was stationed in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] was quickly summoned to Penang. This regiment was composed of Moslem and Sikh soldiers. The Moslems were sent to guard [[Singapore]] and the Sikhs to guard Penang.}}

During this time W E Perera was a member of the Cadet Corps and through his friend Pertha Singh, befriended all the petty officers of the local guarding regiment frequently meeting with them in "one famous bar in those days known as Kee Kee Hotel", Penang.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;
Although being in the Commonwealth the sympathies of the locals were with the Germans during the early part of World War I.

{{quote|As soon as Turkey joined the war on the side of the Germans, the Moslem section of the Malay States Guides stationed in Singapore  mutinied and there was great commotion in the country. The volunteer company in Penang was called out for duty in Singapore and we in the Cadet Corps took on an appearance of importance. We were give more rifle practice, sham-fights and guard duties to perform.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;}}

After leaving school and short apprenticeships in engineering and surveying, his father arranged for him to join the Government service to apprentice under the Chief Clerk of the Railway Traffic office and later the Lands Office in Teluk Anson. Here, W. E. Perera learnt to buy and sell land, plant rubber and became conversant in the Malay language. He also applied to join the Army in an Anglo-Indian regiment being formed in India with volunteers from Malaya much to the disapproval of his father. However, his departure was delayed and later cancelled when the [[Armistice Day|Armistice]] was ratified with Germany.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On being transferred to Batu Gajah, he lived in his own quarters, socialised with the local Eurasian community, studied and experimented in  psychology, parapsychology, took up athletics and even music, playing the clarinet in a local band. He passed his clerical examinations and then completed a teaching diploma alongside doing a course in bookkeeping.&lt;ref name="message1966"/&gt;

==Career and marriage==
[[File:W.E.PereraWedding.jpg|thumb|right|Mr and Mrs W. Edward Perera]]
W. E. Perera was employed by the [[Anglo-Chinese School, Ipoh|Rev. W. E. Horley]] as a teacher at the Methodist High School in Telok Anson.  By heeding the sound advice of his mentor Mr W. A. Rabel and friends, he saved enough money to invest in coconut and rubber plantations which he successfully ran whilst continuing his career as a teacher. This gave him financial independence to pursue various social activities like helping organise the Boy Scouts of Lower Perak and the Methodist Youth Fellowship, Telok Intan. In 1922, he created "The Cosmopolitan Club", Telok Anson, a multi-racial, secular social club much to the angst of the British who tried to keep the races separate. This gave him the opportunity to interact and befriend influential people from various social and ethnic groups like the Japanese, Chinese, Eurasians, Indians, Europeans, Malays and the Royalty of Teluk Anson.&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook5"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1928 after a brief visit to see his mother and sister in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]], he met and eventually married Meepaygamay Kankananga Joci Perera (7 March 1908 – 6 January 1994) on 11 January 1929. They had 10  children: Minona, Jothika, Abhay, Wimala, Susimal,Tissa, Kimsuke, Jinamal, Kusala and Jaya in the years 1930 to 1947.

==The war years==

===Japanese invasion of Malaya (1942-1945)===
The war arrived to Telok Anson in form of air bombing raids by the Japanese Air Forces. Despite being instructed to leave Teluk Anson by the British district officer, W. E. Perera was one of a few people that boldly came out of hiding to help the unfortunate victims. He was a volunteer in the St Johns Ambulance at that time and months earlier had received training as a Superintendent of a medical unit which he put to good use.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook6"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in one of his birthday messages:&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook7"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As soon as the Japanese invaders established a forward base at Telok Anson and the retreating British army had destroyed the water works at Changkat Jong, I don't know what prompted me to approach the Commander of the Japanese suicide Corps and warn him of the danger of the Japanese soldiers drinking the drain water, for the pollution would make them sick before they got to Singapore, their destination. In fact I was indirectly pleading for the safety of our own population. The Commander being an understanding man with knowledge of some English offered me a motor-car (all motor-cars including my own having been commandeered by the invaders) and a written order to collect workers and technicians to repair the waterworks and give water to the town immediately. He also provided me with all transport for the workers and a pass to allow us to travel without any molestation by their soldiers. I managed to find, and encourage a few workmen to come with me and we worked at Changkat Jong Headworks and several mains for three or four days working day and night and succeeded in giving water to Telok Anson to the relief of the Japanese as well as our own people. I enjoyed this thrill immensely.

Having obtained the ear of this Suicide Corps Commander, I pleaded with him to stop his soldiers from molesting the young girls in the town. I remember he told me that it was not possible for him to do as his men were going to die at the front but he suggested that I should form an interim government and appoint a mayor of the town. This would help to curb somewhat the behavior of his men. I lost no time in getting some of my friends in hiding to come forward for this task. We organised a sanitation brigade and the local police to function under the late Raja Yahaya as O.C.P.D. and Mr. J. Bahaduri a lawyer as the Mayor. This was another thrilling experience for me. About three months after the occupation of Perak, civil authorities arrived from Japan and organised the Government of Perak. The late Cik Megat Yunus was appointed the District Officer of Telok Anson.

Although I knew nothing of electricity, and the English schools were not functioning the late Cik Megat Yunus and [[Yusuf Izzuddin Shah of Perak|Raja Yussof, the then Raja Muda of Perak]] in recognition of my services appointed me Officer-in -charge of Electricity, so that I could have a salary to run my kitchen. When I organised the Huttenbacks Electrical Organisation with the help of the old members of staff and restored electricity to the town: another job of organisation was thrust on me.

The Telok Anson Government Hospital had been totally looted when the British evacuated, and the hospital beds and furniture were also missing. With information I got, I was fortunate in locating most of the looted drugs in the home of a younger brother of an Assistant Surgeon in this hospital. Sometime prior to the coming of the Japanese, the medical Officer having been panic-stricken left his post stealthily without leaving any instructions to his assistants in hospital. Some persons from whom I recovered the hospital things threatened my life, but I cared not being full of the thrill of doing a good job.}}

Throughout the war, Mr W. E. Perera was not affected by the [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities of the Japanese soldiers]] or the [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army|Communists]] but he was not immune to other factions which he thought were [[Opportunism|war opportunists]]. W. E. Perera slapped an [[Indian National Army]] health officer who rebuked him for contributing only 5 Japanese dollars for their movement. This landed W. E. Perera being branded a traitor, arrested and detained in the [[Kempeitai]] jail. However, after a few hours, he was released when his friends who worked for the Japanese protested his innocence to the Kempeitai.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook8"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, a number of people lived with the family of W. E. Perera at his residence at various times for protection against persecution by the Japanese, Communists and for economic reasons. These included Mr Neoh Ban Soon and family, Mr James Ranatunge and family, Mrs Rosie Shoemarker and family, Mrs Loveridge and six former members of an Auxiliary Armed Force. To purchase food during these years, W. E. Perera sold some of his properties.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook9"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W. E Perera saved a number of people from being executed during this period. As witnessed by his eldest son Jothika,&lt;ref name="singhalesebook5" /&gt;

{{quote|Mrs Shoemarker (a Eurasian) was saved twice by father. A Japanese officer saw her, said " Ingiris" (English) and took out his revolver to shoot her. Father pleaded with him that she was an Indian, and he changed his mind ....She was again taken for execution by the communists as she had borne a child off a Japanese. Father rescued her again ..... Dato Abdullah, The Chief Minister and later Minister of Lands and Mines was district officer in Teluk Anson when father rescued him from Chinese communists.}}

===Communist Insurgency (1946–1958)===
[[File:W.E.Perera MBE.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mr. W. E. Perera receiving his insignia of the order of the M.B.E. from General Sir Gerald Templer, the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya.|Mr. W. E. Perera receiving his insignia of the order of the M.B.E. from Gen. Sir [[Gerald Templer]], the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya.]]

Life in Telok Anson was still difficult after the surrender of the Japanese at the end of World War II when the [[Malayan Emergency]] was declared. In the message given to his family, W. E. Perera relates the following:&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook10"&gt;{{cite book |
 last = Arseculeratne | first = S. N. | title = Sinhalese Immigrants in Malaysia and Singapore 1850 - 1990|year = 1991| pages = 362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the interregnum lasting about a month, we were ruled by the communists and paid salaries by them. I remember one day I had to go to Ipoh in a lorry to fetch fuel oil from Ipoh for our engines. On the way back I was fortunate to meet some British paratroopers for the first time in years, and I lost no time in giving them the information that was then rife in Telok Anson that in the next two days the Chinese troops from China would be in Telok Anson and there would be a liquidation of all leading Government servants. The paratroopers told me that their orders were that the British Indian Troops that were then disembarking at [[Port Swettenham]] were destined to the north by-passing Telok Anson. Being impressed with the veracity of my information, I was happy when those men gave me the assurance that they would immediately inform their Hqrs. of what I had told them. We were thrilled to see the arrival of a contingent of British Indian troops in Telok Anson early the next afternoon.

My greatest thrill was during the early period of the British military administration, when the Communists tried to show their power by ordering the closure of schools and holding processions and rallies etc. and denouncing the British and kidnapping all wealthy people who failed to support them with finance. On my own initiative, I opened the old school at Immigrant / Anson Roads in defiance of their orders and in addition, I opened Chinese classes in the afternoon with the co-operation of Pastor Lim Hong Yong to take off the children from the streets as the Chinese Schools remained closed. This enraged the Communists who made an attempt to burn the old building but we quelled the fire in time. The British military administration was behind me and they even provided me with money to rehabilitate the old school long before the missionaries arrived on the scene.}}

When the missionaries arrived and found out what W. E. Perera, a non-Methodist teacher had done for their school, they appointed him Principal of the School.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook10" /&gt;

As principal, he created a new high school with a laboratory for science teaching as an extension of ACS, Teluk Anson by getting his friend Mr V. Kn. Kannappa Chettiar to dispose of a five-acre block of rubber land which he owned adjoining the Raja Muda's Istana for a reasonably low price of $25,000. The school was constructed with donations from the Missionaries, various guilds and associations like the rubber and copra associations, sizeable contributions from [[Perak royal mausoleum|Raja Musa the then Raja Muda of Perak]], and the Malay Gurus Association for special class-rooms to be named after them.&lt;ref name="message1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="singhalesebook2" /&gt;

W.E Perera was the first in Malaya to initiate a housing society for teachers of his school at Teluk Anson from 1953 to 1955. He sought loans, land, got the houses built and created the housing estate named ''Kampung Guru'' (Teacher's Village) after refusing to have it named after him. This estate was opened by Governor Mc Gillivray of Teluk Anson.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook3" /&gt;

Not one to rest on his laurels, W. E. Perera refused to accept any offers of honours or awards from the [[Yusuf Izzuddin Shah of Perak|Sultan of Perak]] for his community service during the war. He also refused the recommendation for an [[MBE]] (Member of the Order of the British Empire) award made by the then governor Sir [[Edward Gent]]. However, when General Sir [[Gerald Templer]] offered it again with the statement "the people have requested that it be bestowed upon you", W. E. Perera could not turn down the honour.&lt;ref name="singhalesebook3" /&gt;

==Retirement==
Keeping to his desire to retire in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Selangor]] so that his children could have better work and social opportunities, W. E Perera accepted the position of Principal of the Kishan Dial School, [[Petaling Jaya]] from the late Swami Satayanda. He eventually settled in Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur in 1965. Here he delved into the study of Asian philosophy and was involved in the establishment of the [[Buddhist Maha Vihara, Brickfields|Brickfields Buddhist Temple]] among other social endeavours like volunteering in the schools for the underprivileged. He taught Buddhist philosophy at the local university and regularly had discussions with visiting and resident Theravada Buddhist monks like the Revs. [[K. Sri Dhammananda]], Ananda Mangala and [[Henepola Gunaratana]] whom he mentored.&lt;ref name="banteG"&gt;{{cite book |

W. E. Perera died at the University hospital, Petaling Jaya from a massive heart attack before he was due to receive a pacemaker. Having been the first voluntary worker with the blind to have pledged his eyes earlier, his corneas were donated to the eye bank and successfully transplanted into two recipients.&lt;ref name="StaitsTimesnews"&gt;{{cite book |
