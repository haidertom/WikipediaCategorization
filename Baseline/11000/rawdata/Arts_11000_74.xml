A '''beehive tomb''', also known as a '''tholos tomb'''  (plural '''tholoi''') ([[Greek language|Greek]]: θολωτός τάφος, θολωτοί τάφοι, "domed tombs"), is a burial structure characterized by its false [[dome]] created by the superposition of successively smaller rings of mudbricks or, more often, stones. The resulting structure resembles a [[beehive]], hence the traditional English name.

Tholoi were used for burial in several cultures in the [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] and [[West Asia]], but in some cases they were used for different purposes such as homes (Cyprus), ritual (Syria), and even fortification (Spain, Sardinia). Although Max Mallowan used the same name for the circular houses belonging to the [[Neolithic]] culture of [[Tell Halaf]] ([[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]), there is no relationship between them.

==Greece==
In [[Greece]], the vaulted  ''tholoi'' are a monumental Late [[Bronze Age]] development.  Their origin is a matter of considerable debate: were they inspired by the tholoi of Crete which were first used in the [[Minoan pottery|Early Minoan]] period&lt;ref&gt;M. S. F. Hood, "Tholos Tombs of the Aegean," Antiquity 34(1960) 166-176.&lt;/ref&gt; or were they a natural development of [[tumulus]] burials dating to the Middle Bronze Age?&lt;ref&gt;K.A. and Diana Wardle, Cities of Legend, The Mycenaean World, London 2000, 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
In concept, they are similar to the much more numerous [[Mycenaean chamber tomb]]s which seem to have emerged at about the same time. Both have chamber, doorway [[stomion (archeology)|stomion]] and entrance passage [[Glossary of architecture#D|d]]romos but tholoi are largely built while chamber tombs are rock-cut.

A few early examples of tholoi have been found in [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenia]] in the SW Peloponnese Greece (for example at [[Voidhokoilia]]),&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Korres, "Tymboi, tholoi, kai taphikoi kykloi tes Messenias," in Proceedings of the First International Conference of Peloponnesian Studies 2 (Athens 1976) 337-369.&lt;/ref&gt; and recently near [[Troezen]] in the NE Peloponnese.&lt;ref&gt;E. Konsolaki-Yiannopoulou, “E Magoula ston Galata tes Troizenias: Ena neo ME-YE kentro ston Saroniko,” in E. Konsolaki-Yiannopoulou (ed.), Argosaronikos: Praktika 1ou Diethnous Synedriou Istorias kai Archaiologias tou Argosaronikou A (Athens 2003) 159-228.&lt;/ref&gt; These tholoi are built on level ground and then enclosed by a mound of earth. A pair of tumuli at [[Marathon, Greece]] indicate how a built rectangular (but unvaulted) central chamber was extended with an entrance passage.&lt;ref&gt;S. Marinatos, "Further News from Marathon," Archaeologika Analekta Athenon 3 (1970): 155-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

After about [[1500 BCE]], beehive [[tomb]]s became more widespread and are found in every part of the Mycenaean heartland. In contrast, however, to the early examples these are almost always cut into the slope of a hillside so that only the upper third of the vaulted chamber was above ground level. This masonry was then concealed with a relatively small mound of earth.

The tombs usually contain more than one [[burial]], in various places in the tomb either on the floor, in pits and cists or on stone-built or rock-cut benches, and with various [[grave goods]]. After a burial, the entrance to the tomb was filled in with [[soil]], leaving a small mound with most of the tomb underground. 

The chamber is always built in [[masonry]], even in the earliest examples, as is the stomion or entrance-way. The dromos in early examples was usually just cut from the [[bedrock]], as in the Panagia Tomb at [[Mycenae]] itself. In later examples such as the [[Treasury of Atreus]] and [[Tomb of Clytemnestra]] (both at [[Mycenae]]), all three parts were constructed of fine [[ashlar]] masonry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Wace|A.J.B. Wace]], “Excavations at Mycenae: IX. The Tholos Tombs”, Annual of the British School at Athens 25, 1923, 283-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chambers were built as [[corbel]]led vaults, with layers of stone placed closer together as the vault tapers toward the top of the tomb.These stone layers were trimmed from inside the tomb, creating a smooth dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Schneider|title=Art Across Time|publisher=McGraw Hill|page=123|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Cavanagh and R. R. Laxton, "The Structural Mechanics of the Mycenaean Tholos Tomb," Annual of the British School at Athens 76(1981)109-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The entrances provided an opportunity for conspicuous demonstration of wealth. That of the Treasury of Atreus, for example, was decorated with columns of red and green “Lapis Lacedaimonius” brought from quarries over 100&amp;nbsp;km away.

The abundance of such tombs, often with more than one being associated with a settlement during one specific time period, may indicate that their use was not confined to the ruling [[monarchy]] only, although the sheer size and therefore the outlay required for the larger tombs (ranging from about 10 meters to about 15 meters in diameter and height) would argue in favour of royal commissions. The larger tombs contained amongst the richest finds to have come from the Late Bronze Age of Mainland Greece, despite the tombs having been [[pillage]]d both in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and more recently. Although the [[Vapheio]] tholos, south of Sparta, had been robbed, two cists in the floor had escaped notice. These contained, among other valuable items, the two gold “Vapheio cups” decorated with scenes of bull taming which are among the best known of Mycenaean treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Schneider|title=Art Across Time|publisher=McGraw Hill|page=126|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levant and Cyprus==

Circular structures were commonly built in the Near East, including the examples known as ''tholoi'' found in the [[Neolithic]] [[Tell Halaf|Halaf culture]] of Iraq, Syria and Turkey. They were probably used as both houses and as storage structures, but ritual use may also have occurred. Other, later examples are found in [[Cyprus]] ([[Choirokoitia|Khirokitia]]), where they were used as homes. There is no clear connection between these domestic, circular buildings and later tholos tombs.

==Southern Europe and Sardinia==
[[Image:Sardinien Orroli Nuraghe Arrubio Scheinkuppel.jpg|right|thumb|''Tholos'' of the [[Nuraghe Arrubiu]]]]

In the [[Chalcolithic]] period of the [[Iberian peninsula]], beehive tombs appear among other innovative "[[megalith]]ic" variants, since c. 3000 BCE. They are especially common in southern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], while in Central Portugal and southeastern France other styles (artificial [[cave]]s especially) are preferred instead. The civilization of [[Los Millares]] and its [[Bronze Age]] successor, [[El Argar]], are particularly related to this burial style.&lt;ref&gt;Cerdá, F.J., et al., ''Historia de España I. Prehistoria'', 1986. {{ISBN|84-249-1015-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Bronze Age fortifications known as ''[[motillas]]'' in [[La Mancha]] (Spain) also use the ''tholos'' building technique.

The imposing stone structures known as ''[[nuraghi]]'' as well as the similar structures of southern [[Corsica]], dominated the Bronze Age landscape of [[Sardinia]] (Italy). Nuraghi are truncated conical towers of dry-laid stone, about 40 feet in diameter, sloping up to a circular roof some 50 feet above the ground. The vaulted ceiling is 20 to 35 feet above the floor.
Although the remains of some 7,000 nuraghi have been found, up to 30,000 may have been built.

There are also recorded [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tombs at a necropolis at [[Banditaccia]] from the 6th and 7th Centuries BCE having an external appearance similar to a beehive. The interiors are decorated and furnished as Etruscan dwellings.

==Bulgaria==
The beehive [[Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak]] is an example of the richly decorated tholoi tombs of [[Thracians|Thracian]] rulers, many of which are found in modern [[Bulgaria]] and date from the 4th-3rd century BC.  The walls of the Kazanlak tomb are covered with plaster and stucco, with ornate scenes from the life of the deceased.  Other [[Tumulus|tumuli]], known as ''mogili'' in Bulgarian, that feature underground chambers in the form of a beehive dome include, among others, the [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo]], [[Thracian tomb Golyama Arsenalka|Golyama Arsenalka]], [[Thracian tomb Seuthes III|Thracian tomb of Seuthes III]]. There have been several significant gold and silver treasures associated with Thracian tombs currently kept at Bulgaria's Archaeological and National History Museums and other institutions.

==Oman==

The earliest stone-built tombs which can be called "beehive" are in [[Oman]], built of stacked flat stones which occur in nearby geological formations. They date to between 3,500 and 2,500 years BCE, to a period when the Arabian peninsula was subject to much more rainfall than now, and supported a flourishing civilisation in what is now desert, to the west of the mountain range along the [[Gulf of Oman]]. No burial remains have ever been retrieved from these "tombs", though there seems no other purpose for their building. They have only superficial similarities with the Aegean tombs (circular shape) as they are built entirely above ground level and do not share the same tripartite structure - the entrances are usually an undifferentiated part of the circular walling of the tomb.

Currently there are three areas where these tombs can be found:  [[Al Hajar Mountains|Al Hajar]] Region, Hat Region, and Hadbin area close to [[Barka (Oman)|Barka]]. The Hajar tombs are very numerous and one or two have been restored, allowing you to crawl into the centre of a 5-6m tall stone structure.

==Somalia==
NE of Qandala is a field of tombs of varying sizes.

'''Benham's top,''' also called '''Benham's disk,''' is named after the English newspaper-man, amateur scientist, and toymaker [[Charles Benham]], who in 1895 sold a [[top]] painted with the pattern shown. When the disk is spun, arcs of pale color, called [[Fechner colors]] or pattern-induced flicker colors (PIFCs), are visible at different places on the disk. Not everyone sees the same colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2656082/What-colour-YOU-Dizzying-optical-illusion-creates-different-shade-viewer-no-one-knows-why.html |title=What colour can YOU see? Dizzying optical illusion creates a different shade for every viewer - but no-one knows why |publisher=''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'' |author=Ellie Zolfagharifard |date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benham was inspired to propagate the Fechner color effect through his top after his correspondence with [[Gustav Fechner|Dr. Gustav Theodor Fechner]], who had observed and demonstrated the said effect. Benham's top made it possible for speakers of the English language to learn of the Fechner color effect, about which Fechner's original reports were written in German.

The phenomenon is not entirely understood. One possible reason people see colors may be that the [[color receptors]] in the human eye respond at different rates to red, green, and blue. More specifically, the latencies of the center and the surrounding mechanisms differ for the different types of color-specific ganglion cells.

The phenomenon originates from neural activity in the [[retina]] and spatial interactions in the [[primary visual cortex]], which plays a role in encoding low-level image features, such as edges and spatiotemporal frequency components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=von Campenhausen C, Schramme J |title=100 years of Benham's top in colour science |journal=Perception |volume=24 |issue=6 |year=1995 |pages=695–717 |doi=10.1068/p240695 |pmid=7478909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that the blue-yellow [[opponent process]] accounts for all the different PIFCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schramme J |title=Changes in pattern induced flicker colors are mediated by the blue/yellow opponent process |journal=Vision Research |volume=32 |issue=11 |year=1992 |pages=2129–34 |doi=10.1016/0042-6989(92)90074-S |pmid=1304090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benham's top and other PIFCs are being researched for use as a diagnostic tool for diseases of the eye and the visual track.

The term ''bodega'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] can mean "pantry", "tavern", or "wine cellar". The derivative term '''''bodegón''''' is an augmentative that refers to a large ''bodega'', usually in a derogatory fashion. In [[Spanish art]], a ''bodegón'' is a [[still life]] painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but with significant still life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. It also refers to low-life or everyday objects, which can be painted with flowers, fruits, or other objects to display the painter's mastery.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Paul. ''Art: A New History'', [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]], 2003, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|left|Classic [[trompe-l'œil]] wall painting in [[Pompeii]] ([[Naples National Archaeological Museum]])]]
Starting in the [[Baroque]] period, such paintings became popular in [[Spain]] in the second quarter of the 17th century.  The tradition of still life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary [[Low Countries]], today [[Belgium]] and [[Netherlands]] (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. [[Dutch_Golden_Age_painting#Still_lifes|Northern still lifes]] had many subgenres; the ''breakfast piece'' was augmented by the ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'', the ''flower bouquet'', and the ''[[vanitas]]''. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of ''breakfast piece'' did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Though now considered a Spanish invention, the classic [[trompe-l'œil]] presentation of fruit on a stone slab was common in ancient [[Rome]].

[[File:Diego Velazquez - An Old Woman Cooking Eggs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Old Woman Frying Eggs'', by [[Diego Velázquez]], 1618 ([[National Gallery of Scotland]])]]
Still life painting in [[Baroque]] Spain was often austere; it differed from the [[Flemish Baroque painting#Still life and animal painting|Flemish Baroque]] still lifes, which often contain both rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items with fabric or glass. In bodegones, the game is often plain dead animals still waiting to be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air.  Both Netherlandish and Spanish still lifes often had a moral [[vanitas]] element.  Their austerity, akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, never copies  the sensual pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of many Northern European still life paintings.

The [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] paintings ''[[The Waterseller of Seville (Velázquez)|The Waterseller of Seville]]'', ''[[:Image:Diego Velázquez 017.jpg|Old woman frying eggs]]'', and ''[[The Lunch (Velázquez)|The lunch]]'' are often described as  ''bodegones''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/624772/Diego-Velazquez/61327/Sevilla-Seville#ref=ref369061 Encyclopædia Britannica article on Velasquez does so.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As does this dictionary of art terms: {{cite book|author=Lucie-Smith, Edward|title=The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms|year=1984|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=32}} [[template:LCCN|LCCN]] 83-51331&lt;/ref&gt; due to the artist's depiction of jars and foodstuff. Some people reject this use of the term, calling them instead a mixture of [[genre painting]] in [[Bamboccianti]] style and [[still life]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

'''''CIOPW''''' is a collection of artwork by [[E. E. Cummings]] published in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Kostelanetz, “E.E. Cummings’s Long-Forgotten Artist’s Book,” ''Hyperallergic'': https://hyperallergic.com/378792/e-e-cummingss-long-forgotten-artists-book/ &lt;/ref&gt;  The title is an [[acronym]] made from the initial letters of the five media Cummings used to produce the collection: [[charcoal]], [[ink]], [[Oil painting|oil]], [[pencil]], and [[watercolours]].

''CIOPW'' contains 99 works, 27 of which are drawings and 72 of which are paintings. Since it is Cummings’ art and not his words that are on display, the title is also to be read as the ancient Greek word σιωπῶ, “I am silent,” with (i) a so-called lunate sigma, (ii) an omicron rather than an omega the first time (a combination sometimes found on Greek inscriptions), (iii) a “P” rather than a “Π” to keep the sound the same, and (iii) a “W” to represent “ω” visually.  The title should thus be pronounced “siôpô,” with the stress on the last syllable. Compare his other Greek titles EIMI = εἰμί, “I am”; and XAIPE = χαῖρε (pronounced "chaire," with a guttural ch), "greetings, be well."&lt;ref&gt;David Sider, “Art Without Words: Cummings’ CIOPW,” ''Spring'' 21-22 (2015 [2016]) 221-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles de Sousy Ricketts''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (2 October 1866 – 7 October 1931) was a versatile English artist, illustrator, author and printer, and is best known for his work as book designer and [[typographer]] from 1896 to 1904 with the '''Vale Press''', and his work in the theatre as a set and costume designer.

==Life and career==
Ricketts was born in [[Geneva]] to a French mother and an English father. He grew up mainly in France and Italy. He began his studies in art at the [[Lambeth School of Art|City and Guilds Technical Art School]] in [[Lambeth]], in 1882, after both his parents had died.

According to [[William Rothenstein]], "Ricketts, with his pale, delicate features, fair hair and pointed red-gold beard, looked like a [[Jean Clouet|Clouet]] drawing. Half French, he had the quick mind and the rapid speech of a southerner."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Image:Charles Haslewood Shannon; Charles de Sousy Ricketts by George Charles Beresford.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Haslewood Shannon]] and Charles Ricketts by [[George Charles Beresford]]]]
At the Art School he met [[Charles Haslewood Shannon|Charles Shannon]] (1863–1937), painter and lithographer, who would be his lifelong partner in both his artistic and personal life.&lt;ref name="illustrator"&gt;{{citation |title=The Illustrator and the Book in England from 1790 to 1914 |first=Gordon Norton |last=Ray |year=1992 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-26955-8 |page=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], they settled in England rather than abroad.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Vale Press and artistic career==
They founded ''The Dial'', a magazine, which had five issues from 1889 to 1897, and the Vale Press, named after their house, The Vale, in [[Chelsea, London]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} "The portrait of Ricketts by Shannon was painted two years after Ricketts had founded the Vale Press. It is a record of their friendship, slightly tentative in its character, with Ricketts turning his head away so that he is seen in profile. He liked it precisely for this reason since it shows him 'turning away from the 20th century to think only of the 15th.' It is labelled on the back 'The Man in an Inverness Cloak'."&lt;ref&gt;National Portrait Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricketts was one of two well-known illustrators of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s work, the other being [[Aubrey Beardsley]] who worked on ''Salomé''. He and Shannon were friends and supporters of Wilde, for whom Ricketts painted, in the style of Clouet, the hero of Wilde's short story, 'The Portrait of Mr. W. H.'"&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mikado Ricketts.jpg|thumb|Costume design for ''[[The Mikado]]'', 1926.]]
[[Image:Charles Ricketts06.jpg|thumb|Costume design for Tremouille in [[G. B. Shaw]]'s play [[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]] – Watercolour]]
It was in the work of the Vale Press that Ricketts would find his talents were best employed. The enterprise also involved [[Thomas Sturge Moore]], and later William Llewellyn Hacon (1860–1910), a [[barrister]]. The actual printing was carried out by Ballantyne Press under the supervision of Charles McCall. A total of about 75 books were produced, including a complete [[Shakespeare]] in 39 volumes, before the special type fonts were destroyed. In parallel, Ricketts was involved with the '''Eragny Press''', run by [[Lucien Pissarro]] and his wife Esther, from 1894 to 1914.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

After 1902, he turned more to painting and sculpture. His principal pictures in public galleries are "The Death of Don Juan" ([[Tate Gallery]]), "The Plague" ([[Musée du Luxembourg]], Paris) and "Montezuma" ([[Manchester Art Gallery]]).&lt;ref name="The Times' 1931, p. 7"&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 9 October 1931, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricketts also wrote on art, was a collector, and was elected an Associate of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1922 and a full member in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 29 February 1928, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 he was appointed a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission.&lt;ref name="The Times' 1931, p. 7" /&gt; He was also a member of the [[International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers]].&lt;ref name="Gla"&gt;[http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib2_1203018932 "The International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers"], ''Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851–1951'', [[Glasgow University]], accessed 31 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre design===
Ricketts became a celebrated and sought-after designer for the stage. "Mr Ricketts is infallible in his ideas on costume" observed ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 November 1910, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Plays on which he worked included Oscar Wilde's ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' (1906), [[Laurence Binyon]]'s ''Attila'' (1907), ''[[King Lear]]'' (1909), [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[The Dark Lady of the Sonnets|The Dark Lady]]'' (1910), [[Arnold Bennett]]'s ''Judith'' (1916), Shaw's [[Annajanska, the Bolshevik Empress]] (1918), [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''The Betrothal'' (1920), Shaw's ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' (1924), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1926) and [[John Masefield]]'s ''The Coming of Christ'' (1928).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 June 1909, 25 November 1910, 25 January 1916, 25 November 1920, 17 April 1924, 28 December 1926 and 14 May 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Outside London he worked for the [[Abbey Theatre]], Dublin on plays by [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] and [[J.M. Synge]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 January 1933, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Ricketts also designed much-publicised new productions of ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'' for [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Ricketts's costume designs for ''The Mikado'' were retained by subsequent designers for more than 50 years – see Bell, Diana: ''The Complete Gilbert &amp; Sullivan'', Wellfleet Press, New Jersey, 1989, {{ISBN|1-55521-440-1}}, pp. 148–52.  See also [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/1926/index.html these photos and information about the 1926 ''Mikado'' designs]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael MacLennan]] wrote "Last Romantics", a play based on the life of Ricketts, Shannon and their circle, including [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and [[Michael Field (pseudonym)|Michael Field]].  The play premiered in 2003 and was a finalist for the [[Governor General's Literary Award]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadacouncil.ca/news/releases/2003/qg127245397155625000.htm "The Canada Council for the Arts announces finalists for the 2003 Governor General's Literary Awards"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529170331/http://www.canadacouncil.ca/news/releases/2003/qg127245397155625000.htm |date=29 May 2013 }}.

==Later life and death==
Through his friend, the Russian singer [[Vladimir Rosing]], [[Cecil Arthur Lewis]] met Ricketts and Ricketts became Lewis' artistic mentor and sponsor.  After Ricketts' death, Lewis edited his letters and journals for publication. Part of Ricketts' ashes are buried at Arolo, in the park of the villa that Ricketts donated to Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=213.

'''Circus Juventas''' (formerly '''Circus of the Star''') is a youth [[performing arts]] [[circus]] school located in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], serving [[youth]] throughout the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]] metropolitan area. The organization was founded in 1994 by Dan and Betty Butler, and offers [[circus arts]] training to young people ranging from 3 to 21 years old.

Emulating the style of [[Cirque du Soleil]], Circus Juventas's first show was at Saint Paul's Highland Fest in 1995. From there, the school's enrollment quickly expanded and the organization initiated a campaign to fund a $2.1 million permanent [[big top (circus)|big top]] facility, which opened in 2001 on Saint Paul parkland in the [[Highland Park, Saint Paul|Highland Park]] neighborhood. That year, it began to produce annual summer performances showcasing the work of its most advanced students, each with a distinct theme.

These shows have proven popular with local audiences and have been well received critically, with reviewers praising the professionalism and fearlessness exhibited in the productions, while noting students' occasional missteps during performances. Circus Juventas students have performed and competed both around the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area and abroad. As of 2014, Juventas was the largest youth performing arts circus in North America. The school had tentative plans to add a second facility elsewhere in the region.

==History==
The founders of Circus Juventas, Dan and Betty Butler, met as teenagers at the Sailor Circus of [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] during the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Forliti|first=Amy|title=Minn.

===Future===
In early 2014, the Butlers announced plans to expand their big top facility by an additional {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt; The additional space would house a dance and theater studio, a costume shop, offices, and a {{convert|4500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} gym.&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt; Naming rights for the new structure would provide a component of the $4 million the school hoped to raise for the $2 million expansion, a $1 million addition to the circus's endowment, and eventual repairs to the building's exterior, estimated at $1 million.&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt; Betty Butler stated that the project stemmed from the desire to create "a true professional program, a separate program" for students looking to study and perform circus arts post-Juventas, even though she and her husband originally shied away from pre-professional training as a core aspect of their circus school.&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt;

According to Saint Paul's Parks and Recreation Department, the cliffside space which the expansion would occupy was deemed unsuitable for building a structure of the expansion's proposed size.&lt;ref name=fighting&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duchschere|first1=Kevin|title=Fighting with St. Paul, Circus Juventas hunts for new home|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/west/268673032.html?page=all|accessdate=July 26, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Butlers were considering building a new facility of up to {{convert|50000|sqft|m2}} in the western suburbs of Minneapolis–Saint Paul.&lt;ref name=fighting /&gt; Construction of a new building would likely cost $10 million, require a capital campaign to fund,&lt;ref name=fighting /&gt; and probably not begin for five to 10 years.&lt;ref name=staying&gt;{{cite news|last1=Combs|first1=Marianne|title=Circus Juventas: 'We're staying in St. Paul'|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/state-of-the-arts/2014/07/circus-juventas-were-staying-in-st-paul/|accessdate=August 1, 2014|work=MPR News|agency=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the school is performing a small expansion to its Highland Park space, on which the Circus has a lease for at least 17 more years, as of 2014.&lt;ref name=staying /&gt;

==Performances==
The school typically puts on two shows each year: a spring performance featuring less advanced students studying circus arts at beginning and intermediate levels, and a late summer show to display the talents of more advanced students.&lt;ref name=knightarts&gt;{{cite web|last=Schouweiler|first=Susannah|title=Circus Juventas' "Grimm" enchants|url=http://www.knightarts.org/community/stpaul/circus-juventas-grimm-enchants|work=Knight Arts|publisher=John S. and James L.

==Reception==
Jando Dominique, reporting for ''Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts'', summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas's shows by describing them as "always sold out and enthusiastically reviewed by the press."&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt; Renee Valois cited the age of the performers and the proximity between them and the audience when she asked in a ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'' review of ''Oz'' comparing the circus school with Cirque du Soleil, "Dare I say Circus Juventas is more exciting than the troupe that inspired it?"&lt;ref name=ozwonder&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valois|first1=Renee|title=Circus Juventas' performance of 'Oz' is a wonder|url=http://www.twincities.com/stage/ci_23799191/circus-juventas-performance-oz-is-wonder|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Minnesota Monthly'', Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012's ''Showdown'': "There is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through the air like pros."&lt;ref name=youngfearless /&gt; In ''Spectacle'', Dominique noted that Juventas's productions consistently have "a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter."&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt;

Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, "at two hours and 45 minutes, plus a 20-minute intermission, [''Grimm''{{'s}}] run time is an awfully long haul for the smallest circus-goers."&lt;ref name=knightarts /&gt; Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of ''Grimm'' that "there are moments&amp;nbsp;– just a few stand out&amp;nbsp;– when you realize that these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fairy tales in flight|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/126578298.html|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, writing for ''BroadwayWorld'', Elaina Lenertz stated, "Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lenertz|first1=Elaina|title=Circus Juventas' Showdown Wows Audiences with Pint-Sized Performers|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/minneapolis/article/BWW-Reviews-Circus-Juventas-SHOWDOWN-Wows-Audiences-with-Pint-Sized-Performers-20120822|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=BroadwayWorld|date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[visual arts]], '''color theory''' or '''colour theory''' is a body of practical guidance to [[color]] mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the [[color wheel]]: [[primary color]], [[secondary color]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/research/rgb-cmyk-colour-systems/ | last1 = Dekel | first1 = Gil |title=RGB and CMYK Colour systems |date=2016-03-28 |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tertiary color]]&lt;!-- {{http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory}} --&gt;. Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings of [[Leone Battista Alberti]] (c. 1435) and the notebooks of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (c. 1490), a tradition of "colory theory" began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy over [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of color (''Opticks'', 1704) and the nature of [[primary color]]s. From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to [[colorimetry]] and [[vision science]].&lt;!-- {{http://utah.agclassroom.org/files/uploads/estore/color_garden.pdf}} --&gt;

[[File:Pigment Colours - Classification.jpg|thumb|Classification of pigment colors]]

The foundations of pre-20th-century color theory were built around "pure" or ideal colors, characterized by different sensory experiences rather than attributes of the physical world. This has led to a number of inaccuracies in traditional color theory principles that are not always remedied in modern formulations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The most important problem has been a confusion between the behavior of [[light]] mixtures, called [[additive color]], and the behavior of paint, ink, dye, or pigment mixtures, called [[subtractive color]]. This problem arises because the absorption of light by material substances follows different rules from the perception of light by the eye.

A second problem has been the failure to describe the very important effects of strong luminance (lightness) contrasts in the appearance of colors reflected from a surface (such as paints or inks) as opposed to colors of light; "colors" such as browns or ochres cannot appear in mixtures of light. Thus, a strong lightness contrast between a mid-valued yellow paint and a surrounding bright white makes the yellow appear to be green or brown, while a strong brightness contrast between a rainbow and the surrounding sky makes the yellow in a rainbow appear to be a fainter yellow, or white.

A third problem has been the tendency to describe color effects holistically or categorically, for example as a contrast between "yellow" and "blue" conceived as generic colors, when most color effects are due to contrasts on three relative attributes that define all colors:

# Value, (light vs. dark, or white vs. black),
# Chroma,[saturation, purity, strength, intensity] (intense vs. dull), and
# Hue (e.g. the name of the color family:red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta).

Thus, the visual impact of "yellow" vs. "blue" hues in visual design depends on the relative lightness and saturation of the hues.

These confusions are partly historical, and arose in scientific uncertainty about color perception that was not resolved until the late 19th century, when the artistic notions were already entrenched. However, they also arise from the attempt to describe the highly contextual and flexible behavior of color perception in terms of abstract color sensations that can be generated equivalently by any visual media.

Many historical "color theorists" have assumed that three "pure" primary colors can mix ''all possible colors'', and that any failure of specific paints or inks to match this ideal performance is due to the impurity or imperfection of the colorants. In reality, only imaginary "primary colors" used in colorimetry can "mix" or quantify all visible (perceptually possible) colors; but to do this, these imaginary primaries are defined as lying outside the range of visible colors; i.e., they cannot be seen. Any three real "primary" colors of light, paint or ink can mix only a limited range of colors, called a [[gamut]], which is always smaller (contains fewer colors) than the full range of colors humans can perceive.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Historical background ==

Color theory was originally formulated in terms of three "primary" or "primitive" colors—red, yellow and blue ([[RYB color model|RYB]])—because these colors were believed capable of mixing all other colors. This color mixing behavior had long been known to printers, dyers and painters, but these trades preferred pure pigments to primary color mixtures, because the mixtures were too dull (unsaturated).

[[File:GoetheFarbkreis.jpg|right|thumb|[[Goethe]]'s color wheel from his 1810 ''[[Theory of Colours]]'']]

The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th century theories of [[color vision]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} as the fundamental sensory qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular the contrast between "complementary" or opposing hues that are produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]'' (1810) by the German poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and ''The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast'' (1839) by the French industrial chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]]. [[Charles Hayter]] published ''A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information'' (London 1826), in which he described how all colours could be obtained from just three.
[[File:Color diagram Charles Hayter.jpg|thumb|Page from ''A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information'' by [[Charles Hayter]]]]

Subsequently, German and English scientists established in the late 19th century that color perception is best described in terms of a different set of primary colors—red, green and blue violet ([[RGB color model|RGB]])—modeled through the additive mixture of three monochromatic lights. Subsequent research anchored these primary colors in the differing responses to light by three types of color receptors or ''cones'' in the [[retina]] ([[trichromacy]]). On this basis the quantitative description of color mixture or [[colorimetry]] developed in the early 20th century, along with a series of increasingly sophisticated models of [[color space]] and color perception, such as the [[opponent process]] theory.

Across the same period, industrial chemistry radically expanded the color range of lightfast synthetic pigments, allowing for substantially improved saturation in color mixtures of dyes, paints and inks. It also created the dyes and chemical processes necessary for color photography. As a result, three-color printing became aesthetically and economically feasible in mass printed media, and the artists' color theory was adapted to primary colors most effective in inks or photographic dyes: [[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] (CMY). (In printing, dark colors are supplemented by a black ink, known as the [[CMYK]] system; in both printing and photography, white is provided by the color of the paper.) These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and subtractive color mixing with additive color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that ''absorbed'' only one of the retinal primary colors: cyan absorbs only red (−R+G+B), magenta only green (+R−G+B), and yellow only blue violet (+R+G−B). It is important to add that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant as an economical way of producing a wide range of colors for printing, but is deficient in reproducing certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient in reproducing purples. A wider range of color can be obtained with the addition of other colors to the printing process, such as in [[Pantone]]'s [[Hexachrome]] printing ink system (six colors), among others.

[[File:Munsell-system.svg|thumb|right|Munsell color system|[[Munsell color system|Munsell]]'s color system represented as a three-dimensional solid showing all three color making attributes: ''lightness'', ''saturation'' and ''hue''.]]

For much of the 19th century artistic color theory either lagged behind scientific understanding or was augmented by science books written for the lay public, in particular ''Modern Chromatics'' (1879) by the American physicist [[Ogden Rood]], and early color atlases developed by [[Albert Munsell]] (''Munsell Book of Color'', 1915, see [[Munsell color system]]) and [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] (Color Atlas, 1919). Major advances were made in the early 20th century by artists teaching or associated with the German [[Bauhaus]], in particular [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Johannes Itten]], [[Faber Birren]] and [[Josef Albers]], whose writings mix speculation with an empirical or demonstration-based study of color design principles.

== Traditional color theory ==

=== Complementary colors ===
[[File:Chevreul's RYB chromatic diagram.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Chevreul]]'s 1855 "chromatic diagram" based on the [[RYB color model]], showing [[complementary colors]] and other relationships]]

{{Main|Complementary colors}}

For the mixing of colored light, Isaac Newton's [[color wheel]] is often used to describe complementary colors, which are colors which cancel each other's hue to produce an achromatic (white, gray or black) light mixture.  Newton offered as a conjecture that colors exactly opposite one another on the hue circle cancel out each other's hue; this concept was demonstrated more thoroughly in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

A key assumption in Newton's hue circle was that the "fiery" or maximum saturated hues are located on the outer circumference of the circle, while achromatic white is at the center. Then the saturation of the mixture of two spectral hues was predicted by the straight line between them; the mixture of three colors was predicted by the "center of gravity" or centroid of three triangle points, and so on.

[[File:Color star-en (tertiary names).svg|thumb|Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors of the [[RYB color model]]]]

According to traditional color theory based on [[subtractive primary color]]s and the [[RYB color model]], yellow mixed with purple, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter's complementary colors. These contrasts form the basis of [[Chevreul]]'s law of color contrast: colors that appear together will be altered as if mixed with the complementary color of the other color. Thus, a piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange, because orange is the complementary color to blue.

However, when complementary colors are chosen based on definition by light mixture, they are not the same as the artists' primary colors.  This discrepancy becomes important when color theory is applied across media. Digital color management uses a hue circle defined according to [[additive primary colors]] (the [[RGB color model]]), as the colors in a computer monitor are additive mixtures of light, not subtractive mixtures of paints.

One reason the artist's primary colors work at all is that the imperfect pigments being used have sloped absorption curves, and thus change color with concentration. A pigment that is pure red at high concentrations can behave more like magenta at low concentrations. This allows it to make purples that would otherwise be impossible. Likewise, a blue that is ultramarine at high concentrations appears cyan at low concentrations, allowing it to be used to mix green. Chromium red pigments can appear orange, and then yellow, as the concentration is reduced. It is even possible to mix very low concentrations of the blue mentioned and the chromium red to get a greenish color. This works much better with oil colors than it does with watercolors and dyes.

So the old primaries depend on sloped absorption curves and pigment leakages to work, while newer scientifically derived ones depend solely on controlling the amount of absorption in certain parts of the spectrum.

Another reason the correct primary colors were not used by early artists is that they were not available as durable pigments. Modern methods in chemistry were needed to produce them.

=== Warm vs. cool colors ===

The distinction between "warm" and "cool" colors has been important since at least the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color12.html |title=color temperature |publisher=handprint |date=2009-04-19 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast, as traced by etymologies in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], seems related to the observed contrast in landscape light, between the "warm" colors associated with daylight or sunset, and the "cool" colors associated with a gray or overcast day. Warm colors are often said to be hues from red through yellow, browns and tans included; cool colors are often said to be the hues from blue green through blue violet, most grays included. There is historical disagreement about the colors that anchor the polarity, but 19th-century sources put the peak contrast between red orange and greenish blue.

Color theory has described perceptual and psychological effects to this contrast. Warm colors are said to advance or appear more active in a painting, while cool colors tend to recede; used in interior design or fashion, warm colors are said to arouse or stimulate the viewer, while cool colors calm and relax. Most of these effects, to the extent they are real, can be attributed to the higher saturation and lighter value of warm pigments in contrast to cool pigments. Thus, brown is a dark, unsaturated warm color that few people think of as visually active or psychologically arousing.

Contrast the traditional warm–cool association of color with the [[color temperature]] of a theoretical radiating [[black body]], where the association of color with temperature is reversed. For instance, the hottest [[star]]s radiate blue light (i.e., with shorter wavelength and higher frequency), and the coolest radiate red.  

[[File:Color temperature black body 800-12200K.svg|thumb|center|500px|The hottest radiating bodies (e.g. stars) have a "cool" color, while the less hot bodies radiate with a "warm" color (image in [[Kelvin scale]])]]

This contrast is further seen in the psychological associations of colors with the [[Relativistic Doppler effect]] seen in astronomical objects.  Traditional psychological associations, where warm colors are associated with advancing objects and cool colors with receding objects, are directly opposite those seen in [[astrophysics]], where stars or galaxies moving towards our viewpoint from Earth are [[blueshifted]] (advancing) and stars or galaxies moving away from Earth are [[redshifted]] (receding).
[[File:Redshift blueshift.svg|thumb|center|Doppler [[redshift]] for receding and [[blueshift]] for advancing]]

=== Achromatic colors ===

Any color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be ''unsaturated'', ''achromatic'', ''near neutral'', or ''neutral''. Near neutrals include browns, tans, pastels and darker colors. Near neutrals can be of any hue or lightness. Pure achromatic, or ''neutral'' colors include black, white and all grays.

''Near neutrals'' are obtained by mixing pure colors with white, black or grey, or by mixing two complementary colors. In color theory, neutral colors are easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue complementary to the saturated color; e.g., next to a bright red couch, a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish. &lt;!-- this isn't just "in the color theory"... it's a property of human color vision --&gt;

Black and white have long been known to combine "well" with almost any other colors; black decreases the apparent ''saturation'' or ''brightness'' of colors paired with it, and white shows off all hues to equal effect.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

=== Tints and shades ===
{{Main|Tints and shades}}

When mixing colored light (additive color models), the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red, green and blue (RGB) is always white, not gray or black. When we mix colorants, such as the pigments in paint mixtures, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black or a color's complement.

It is common among some painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called ''shades''—or lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called ''tints''. However it is not always the best way for representational painting, as an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in hue. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. purplish-red added to yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).

=== Split primary colors ===

In [[painting]] and other visual arts, two-dimensional [[color wheel]]s or three-dimensional [[color solid]]s are used as tools to teach beginners the essential relationships between colors. The organization of colors in a particular color model depends on the purpose of that model: some models show relationships based on [[Color vision|human color perception]], whereas others are based on the color mixing properties of a particular medium such as a computer display or set of paints.

This system is still popular among contemporary painters,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} as it is basically a simplified version of Newton's geometrical rule that colors closer together on the hue circle will produce more vibrant mixtures. However, with the range of contemporary paints available, many artists simply add more paints to their palette as desired for a variety of practical reasons.&lt;!-- isn't a "split primary" palette also adding more paints? --&gt; For example, they may add a scarlet, purple and/or green paint to expand the mixable [[gamut]]; and they include one or more dark colors (especially "earth" colors such as yellow ochre or burnt sienna) simply because they are convenient to have premixed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}&lt;!-- I thought it was because mixtures of orange/yellow with black didn't achieve the desired effect --&gt; Printers commonly augment a CMYK palette with [[spot color|spot]] (trademark specific) ink colors.

=== Color harmony ===

It has been suggested that "Colors seen together to produce a pleasing affective response are said to be in harmony".&lt;ref&gt;Burchett, K. E. (2002). "Color harmony". ''Color Research and Application'', 27 (1), pp. 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, color harmony is a complex notion because human responses to color are both affective and cognitive, involving emotional response and judgment. Hence, our responses to color and the notion of color harmony is open to the influence of a range of different factors. These factors include individual differences (such as age, gender, personal preference, affective state, etc.) as well as cultural, sub-cultural and socially-based differences which gives rise to conditioning and learned responses about color. In addition, context always has an influence on responses about color and the notion of color harmony, and this concept is also influenced by temporal factors (such as changing trends) and perceptual factors (such as simultaneous contrast) which may impinge on human response to color. The following conceptual model illustrates this 21st century approach to color harmony:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Color harmony} = f(\text{Col} 1, 2, 3, \dots, n) \cdot (ID + CE + CX + P + T)&lt;/math&gt;

Wherein color harmony is a function (''f'') of the interaction between color/s (Col 1, 2, 3, …, ''n'') and the factors that influence positive aesthetic response to color: individual differences (''ID'') such as age, gender, personality and affective state; cultural experiences (''CE''), the prevailing context (''CX'') which includes setting and ambient lighting; intervening perceptual effects (''P'') and the effects of time (''T'') in terms of prevailing social trends.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2010). "Color harmony revisited". ''Color Research and Application'', 35 (4), pp. 267–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. Göttingen, 1775, plate III.jpg|thumb|Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. Göttingen, 1775, plate III.]]

In addition, given that humans can perceive over 2.8 million different hues,&lt;ref&gt;Pointer, M. R. &amp; Attridge, G.G. (1998). "The number of discernible colors". ''Color Research and Application'', 23 (1), pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been suggested that the number of possible color combinations is virtually infinite thereby implying that predictive color harmony formulae are fundamentally unsound.&lt;ref&gt;Hard, A. &amp; Sivik, L. (2001). "A theory of colors in combination – A descriptive model related to the NCS color-order system". ''Color Research and Application'', 26 (1), pp. 4–28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, many color theorists have devised formulae, principles or guidelines for color combination with the aim being to predict or specify positive aesthetic response or "color harmony". 

Color wheel models have often been used as a basis for color combination principles or guidelines and for defining relationships between colors. Some theorists and artists believe juxtapositions of complementary color will produce strong contrast, a sense of visual tension as well as "color harmony"; while others believe juxtapositions of analogous colors will elicit positive aesthetic response. Color combination guidelines (or formulas) suggest that colors next to each other on the color wheel model (analogous colors) tend to produce a single-hued or monochromatic color experience and some theorists also refer to these as "simple harmonies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Color Harmonies|last=Garau|first=Augusto|publisher=University of Chicago press|year=1993|isbn=0226281965|location=|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, split complementary color schemes usually depict a modified complementary pair, with instead of the "true" second color being chosen, a range of analogous hues around it are chosen, i.e. the split complements of red are blue-green and yellow-green. A triadic color scheme adopts any three colors approximately equidistant around a color wheel model. Feisner and Mahnke are among a number of authors who provide color combination guidelines in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Feisner, E. A. (2000). ''Colour: How to use colour in art and design''. London: Laurence King.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahnke, F. (1996). ''Color, environment and human response''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- the above paragraph (and frankly this whole section) is absurdly vague.  we should get some sources about psychological research with color, and attribute controversial subjective statements to particular authors, instead of presenting them as fact. --&gt;

[[File:020 schiffermueller1.jpg|thumb|Ignaz Schiffermüller, Versuch eines Farbensystems (Vienna, 1772), plate I.]]

Color combination formulae and principles may provide some guidance but have limited practical application. This is because of the influence of contextual, perceptual and temporal factors which will influence how color/s are perceived in any given situation, setting or context. Such formulae and principles may be useful in fashion, interior and graphic design, but much depends on the tastes, lifestyle and cultural norms of the viewer or consumer.

As early as the ancient Greek philosophers, many theorists have devised color associations and linked particular connotative meanings to specific colors. However, connotative color associations and color symbolism tends to be culture-bound and may also vary across different contexts and circumstances. For example, red has many different connotative and symbolic meanings from exciting, arousing, sensual, romantic and feminine; to a symbol of good luck; and also acts as a signal of danger. Such color associations tend to be learned and do not necessarily hold irrespective of individual and cultural differences or contextual, temporal or perceptual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=If it's Purple, Someone's Gonna Die|first=Patti|last=Bellantoni|publisher=[[Elsevier]], [[Focal Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-240-80688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that while color symbolism and color associations exist, their existence does not provide evidential support for color psychology or claims that color has therapeutic properties.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2010). "Colour psychology and colour therapy: Caveat emptor". ''Color Research and Application''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formulae ===
There are tried and true formulae for finding colour harmony. To use these formulas all that is needed is to choose a section (or sections) of the color wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GCFLearnFree.org|title=Beginning Graphic Design: Color|date=2016-10-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2LLXnUdUIc&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monochromatic ====
The monochromatic formula chooses only one color (or hue). Variations of the color are created by changing the value and saturation of the color. Since only one hue is used, the color and its variations are guaranteed to work.

== Current status ==

Colour theory has not developed an explicit explanation of how specific media affect color appearance: colors have always been defined in the abstract, and whether the colors were [[ink]]s or [[paint]]s, [[oil paint|oil]]s or [[watercolor painting|watercolor]]s, [[reversal film|transparencies]] or reflecting [[photographic printing|print]]s, [[computer display]]s or [[movie theater]]s, was not considered especially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/renaissance.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josef Albers]] investigated the effects of relative contrast and color saturation on the illusion of transparency, but this is an exception to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interaction of Color. Revised and Expanded Edition|first=Josef|last=Albers|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11595-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''culture of [[Lebanon]]''' and the [[Lebanese people]] emerged from various civilizations over thousands of years. It was home to the [[Phoenicia]]ns and was subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Assyria]]ns, the [[Greeks]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], the [[Arabs]], the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], the [[Ottoman Turks]] and the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French]]. This variety is reflected in Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different religious groups, and features in the country's festivals, musical styles, literature, [[cuisine of Lebanon]] and [[architecture of Lebanon]]. [[Tourism in Lebanon]] is popular with periods of interruption during conflict.

Despite the religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they “share an almost common culture”.&lt;ref name="Stokes, Jamie page 406"&gt;Stokes, Jamie.  ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East'', page 406&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on Article 11 of the [[Constitution of Lebanon]] states: "[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official national language.

{{main|Architecture of Lebanon}}

Architecture in Lebanon includes the legacies of various occupying powers including the Romans, Phoenicians, Ottomans and French, as well as post independence developments.

When the Ottomans exiled [[Fakhr-al-Din II|Fakhreddine]] to [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]] in 1613, he entered an alliance with the [[Medicis]]. Upon his return to Lebanon in 1618, he began modernizing Lebanon. He developed a silk industry, upgraded olive-oil production, and brought with him numerous Italian engineers who began the construction of mansions and civil building throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gh8ZrZRKaRwC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;lpg=PA294&amp;dq=Italianate+architecture+Fakhreddine |title=Syria &amp; Lebanon&amp;nbsp;— Google Books |publisher= books.google.com |accessdate=2010-01-18|isbn=978-1-86450-333-3|author1=Carter, Terry| author2= Dunston, Lara|author3=Humphreys, Andrew|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Beirut]] and [[Sidon]] were especially built in the Italianate style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AylB2M5DjaoC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Italianate+architecture+Fakhreddine |title=Warlords and merchants: the Lebanese ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-01-18|isbn=978-0-86372-297-4|author1=Dib, Kamal|author2=Dīb, Kamāl|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], specifically, Tuscan, influence on architecture in Lebanon dates back to the [[Renaissance]] when Fakhreddine, the first Lebanese ruler who truly unified [[Mount Lebanon]] with its Mediterranean coast executed an ambitious plan to develop his country.

The influence of these buildings, such as the ones in [[Deir el Qamar]], influenced building in Lebanon for many centuries and continues to the present time. For example, streets like [[Rue Gouraud]] continues to have numerous, historic houses with Italianate influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12079102&amp;CFID=22575473&amp;CFTOKEN=49147749 |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308022752/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12079102&amp;CFID=22575473&amp;CFTOKEN=49147749 |archivedate=2009-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings like the [[Sursock Museum|Nicolas Sursock mansion]] on [[Rue Sursock]], which is today a major museum, attest{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} to the continuous influence of Italianate architecture in [[Lebanon]].

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Lebanon}}
Cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Armes|title=Arab filmmakers of the Middle East: a dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHT8LjR_kC4C&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=11 December 2011|date=23 August 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35518-8|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films,&lt;ref&gt;Harabi, Najib (University of Applied Sciences, Northwestern Switzerland)  [http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/251761/day3creative%20Industry%20WB_version%201.pdf Knowledge Intensive Industries: Four Case Studies of Creative Industries in Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000044/http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/251761/day3creative%20Industry%20WB_version%201.pdf |date=2013-01-17 }}, World Bank Project (May 2009) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are:

===Theatre===
{{Main|Theatre of Lebanon}}
Lebanese theatre has its origin in [[passion play]]s.  The musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of modern Arab theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Reed Stone|title=Popular culture and nationalism in Lebanon: the Fairouz and Rahbani nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EdxrNmDE1UC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77273-0|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars like Abdulatif Shararah divided theatre in Lebanon into three phases: translations of European plays, Arab nationalism, and realism.&lt;ref&gt;Badawī, Muḥammad Muṣṭafá.

===Cultural relations between Lebanon and Egypt ===
The cultural relations between Lebanon and [[Egypt]] is considered a unique kind of cultural historical relations, Because there is a considerable overlap between the Lebanese and Egyptian [[culture]]s, especially in the fields of literature, theater, cinema and journalism, all of them played an integral role towards each other especially in theater, cinema and journalism, that's what was confirmed by the Conference Egypt in the eyes of the Lebanese and which is Within the activities of the cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World . Which is held at the headquarters of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, and in the presence of the Lebanese Ambassador in Egypt, [[Madeleine Tabar]] and Ahmed Ghanem founder of cultural program Egypt in the eyes of the World  and an elite of Lebanese artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-balad.com/761416|title=سفير لبنان بالقاهرة : حريصون على تدعيم أواصر التعاون مع مصر|author=|date=|website=el-balad.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405104551/http://www.el-balad.com/761416|archivedate=5 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion==
Many Christians and most Muslims who live in the cities wear European style clothes. In the countryside, women sometimes wear traditional colorful skirts and men wear a traditional sherwal (baggy trousers). Dress was historically Ottoman, but remains only as part of the [[folk culture]]. Today, almost all Lebanese wear Western clothing.

Famous names in the Lebanese fashion industry include [[Elie Saab]], [[Zuhair Murad]], Reem Acra, and [[Rabih Kayrouz]].

==Holidays and festivals==
[[File:Beiteddine Palace InnerCourtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Beiteddine Palace]], venue of the [[Beiteddine Festival]]]]
{{Main|Public holidays in Lebanon}}
Lebanon celebrates national holidays and both [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] holidays.

Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian Calendar and Julian Calendar.  Maronites, [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], Catholics, Protestant, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar.

Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura. Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day.

Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture.&lt;ref name = "Festivals"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Sean|author2=Latif  |others=Zawiah|title=Lebanon|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Children's Books|date=30 August 2007|series=Cultures of the World|volume=13|page=123|chapter=Leisure|isbn=978-0-7614-2081-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cA-RDzlwVVAC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most famous are [[Baalbeck International Festival]], [[Byblos International Festival]], [[Beiteddine Festival|Beiteddine International Festival]], Broumana Festival, Batroun Festival, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival.&lt;ref name="Festivals" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carter|first=Terry|author2=Dunston Lara|others= Humphreys Andrew|title=Syria &amp; Lebanon|publisher=Lonely Planet|date=1 August 2004|edition=2|series=Guidebook Series|page=11|chapter=Getting Started|isbn=978-1-86450-333-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EskzgI-229IC&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's [[Ministry of Tourism (Lebanon)|Ministry of Tourism]], Lebanon Hosts about 15 Concerts from International Performers Each Year Ranking Number one for Nightlife in the Middle east and 6th Worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/news/Details.aspx?NewsId=10|title=Lebanon Summer &amp; Winter Festivals|work=Lebanese Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=19 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722145040/http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/news/Details.aspx?NewsId=10|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Lebanese cuisine}}
[[File:Yoghurt and Hummus at Moroccan Soup Bar.jpg|thumb|right|230px|An array of Lebanese cuisine.]]

Lebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], and [[Cyprus]].

The Lebanese national dishes are the [[kibbe]], a meat pie made from finely minced [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[burghul]] (cracked [[wheat]]), and the [[tabbouleh]], a salad made from [[parsley]], [[tomato]]es, and burghul. The national beverage is [[Arak (drink)|arak]], a strong [[anise]]-flavored liquor made from fermented [[grape juice]]. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki.

Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of [[mezze]] - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled [[meat]] or [[fish]]. In general, meals are finished with [[Arabic coffee]] and fresh [[fruit]], though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.

[[M'Juhdara]], a thick stew of [[onions]], [[rice]], and [[lentils]], is sometimes considered poor man's fare and is often eaten around [[Lent]] by people in the Lebanese diaspora.

Beirut and its environs contain many restaurants of various national origins. At the same time, [[wine]] is growing in popularity and a number of vineyards currently exist in the [[Bekaa valley]] and elsewhere. [[Beer]] is also highly popular and Lebanon produces a number of local beers, of which [[almaza]] is perhaps the most popular.

===Food in daily life===
Lebanese cuisine is influenced by other Mediterranean cuisines. [[Pita bread]] is a staple. The Lebanese enjoy [[hummus]] (a chick pea dip), fool (a fava bean dip), and other bean dishes. [[Rice]] is nearly a staple, and [[pasta]] is very popular. Salted yogurt is common in many dishes. [[Red meat]] and chicken are common but are usually eaten as part of a dish. Eating in Lebanon is tied to family: people almost never eat alone. The Lebanese consider eating out a social and almost aesthetic experience. During Lent, Christians eat meatless dishes and at Saint Barbara, they eat a variety of wheat-based dishes. Lebanon sells fruits and vegetables to neighboring Arab countries, as well as to Italy, France, and the United States. [[Wine]] is produced in the Bekaa and exported to France{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.

==Society==
{{main|Lebanese society}}

Lebanese society is similar to certain cultures of [[Southern Europe|Mediterranean Europe]] as the country is "linked ideologically and culturally to Europe through France, and its uniquely diverse religious composition [create] a rare environment that [is] at once Arab and European.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Craig S. ''The Middle East For Dummies''&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often considered as Europe's gateway to Western Asia as well as Asia's gateway to the Western World.&lt;ref&gt;Lebanon Culture. [http://hangoverguide.com/lebanon/ hangoverguide.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402060253/http://www.hangoverguide.com/lebanon/ |date=2012-04-02 }}, 18 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed-sex groups of youth are very common especially in Verdun, [[Hamra Street]], [[Ashrafieh]], and [[Beirut Central District|downtown Beirut]] as well as other places. Premarital physical sexual relations are very common, although intercourse is frowned upon and avoided by both Muslim and Christian girls.

The contraceptive prevalence rate is estimated at 58%, of which 34% modern contraceptives, primarily IUDs, pills and condoms.&lt;ref name="unfpa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org.lb/UNFPA-LEBANON/Country-Profile.aspx|title=UNFPA Lebanon - Country Profile|author=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org.lb|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919052311/http://www.unfpa.org.lb/UNFPA-LEBANON/Country-Profile.aspx|archivedate=19 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution in Lebanon]] is nominally legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Prostitution – The business of sex|publisher= Executive Magazine|date= |url= http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/prostitution-the-business-of-sex|accessdate= 2014-10-22|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141106130624/http://www.executive-magazine.com/society/prostitution-the-business-of-sex|archivedate= 2014-11-06|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison to most other Arab capitals, Beirut is more [[westernized]] and more [[culturally liberal]]. Compared to [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]], and [[Baghdad]], and especially in contrast to such cities as [[Riyadh]], Beirut is more tolerant with regard to relations between men and women, and also with regard to [[homosexuality]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Notwithstanding the persistence of traditional attitudes regarding the role of women, [[Lebanese women]] enjoy equal [[civil rights]] and attend institutions of higher education in large numbers (for example, women constituted 41 percent of the student body at the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1983). Although women in Lebanon have their own organizations, most exist as subordinate branches of the political parties.

While gay sex does not enjoy wide acceptance, Beirut has a number of gay bars and nightclubs, in addition to five LGBT rights organizations, namely Helem, Arab Foundation for Equality (AFE), Nasawiya-Feminist Collecrive, Proud Lebanon, and Mosaïque.  {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In [[popular culture]], '''formula fiction''' is [[literature]] in which the storylines and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s have been reused to the extent that the [[narrative]]s are predictable.  It is similar to [[genre fiction]], which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.  The label of ''formula fiction'' is used in [[literary criticism]] as a mild [[pejorative]] to imply lack of originality.

Formula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, [[plot device]]s and [[stock character]]s.

Genres like [[high fantasy]], [[Western movie|Westerns]] and [[science fiction]] [[space opera]] often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-[[Medieval Europe]]an setting, the [[Old West]], or [[outer space]].  Approaching a given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of possible predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of [[European dragon|dragon]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]s in [[high fantasy]], [[Faster than light|warp drives]] in [[science fiction]], or [[shootout]]s at high noon in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew, though these elements can easily be treated subversively as well, playing with some of the preconceptions inherent in formula fiction.

The ''formula'' is defined specifically by predictable [[narrative structure]]. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the [[romantic comedy]] genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work's reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.

''Formula fiction'' should not be confused with ''[[pastiche]]'' (the mimicking of another work or author's style), though the latter by its nature may include elements of the former; the same holds true of some [[parody]] and [[satire|satirical]] works as well, which may well include formulaic elements such as common [[stereotype]]s or [[caricature]]s, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly [[cliché]] or [[realism (arts)|unrealistic]] nature. Indeed, between [[parody]], [[satire]] and such [[subgenre]]s as romantic comedy, [[comedy]] as a whole often relies on either formulaic elements, or the mocking of such elements.

Formula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early [[pulp magazine]] markets, though some works published in that medium, such as "[[The Cold Equations]]", subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.

The dissection and tracking of common formulaic [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s (as well as their subversions and new permutations) has become reasonably popular beyond strictly academic circles. (The [[Final Girl]] being one such example, as well as, to some extent, Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''). [[Amateur]] circles have websites such as the [[TV Tropes|TV Tropes Wiki]].

The '''Gamergate controversy''' stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[hashtag]] #GamerGate. The controversy centered on issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture. ''Gamergate'' is used as a blanket term for the controversy as well as for the harassment campaign and actions of those participating in it.

In August 2014, the harassment campaign targeted several women in the [[video game industry]]; notably game developers [[Zoë Quinn]] and [[Brianna Wu]], as well as feminist media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]]. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend, wrote a disparaging blog post about her, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included [[doxing]], threats of rape, and death threats. 

Gamergate proponents ("Gamergaters") said that they were a movement, but had no official leaders, spokespeople, or manifesto.  Gamergate supporters organized anonymously or [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymously]] on online platforms such as [[4chan]], [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[Twitter]], and [[Reddit]]. Statements claiming to represent Gamergate have been inconsistent and contradictory, making it difficult for commentators to identify goals and motives. Gamergate supporters said there was unethical collusion between the press and feminists, progressives, and social critics. These concerns have been dismissed by commentators as trivial, conspiracy theories, groundless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics. As a result, Gamergate has often been defined by the harassment its supporters engaged in. Gamergate supporters have frequently responded to this by denying that the harassment took place or by falsely claiming that it was manufactured by the victims.

The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a [[right-wing]] backlash against progressivism. 

Industry responses to the harassment campaign have focused on ways to minimise harm and prevent similar events. Gamergate has led figures both inside and outside the industry to focus on methods of addressing online harassment.

==History==

===Zoë Quinn and ''Depression Quest''===
In 2013, [[Zoë Quinn]], an independent game developer, released ''[[Depression Quest]]'', a text-focused game designed to convey the experience of depression though a series of fictional scenarios,{{refn|name=Kidd &amp; Turner}}{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}} based in part on Quinn's own experience with the illness.{{refn|name=Hanson}}{{refn|name=Parkin}} The game received positive reviews in the gaming media, but faced backlash online from gamers who disliked its departure from typical game formats emphasizing violence and skill&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jane|2017|p=30}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=43}};  {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who opposed "political" intrusions into gamer culture.{{refn|name=Salter}} Quinn was subjected to several months of harassment after its release,&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KernelMag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt; including rape and death threats.{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}}{{refn|name=Jane}} Quinn documented the harassment she received and spoke openly to the media about it, which led to an even greater intensity of abuse against her, including the posting of her home address online.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=43–45}} She ultimately fled her house out of fear for her safety.{{refn|name=Parkin}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=44}}

[[File:Zoe Quinn Car 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Game developer [[Zoë Quinn]], the initial target of the harassment campaign]]

The event that would come to be known as Gamergate began in 2014 as a personal attack on Quinn, incited by a blog post by Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni.{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=29}}{{refn|name=Hanson}}{{refn|name=Mantilla}} Called the "Zoe Post",{{efn |Gjoni initially published the post on the video-game sites ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' and ''[[Something Awful]]''. After it was removed by the sites' moderators, Gjoni published "The Zoe Post" via the blogging platform WordPress.{{refn|name=Jason}}}} it was a lengthy, detailed account of their relationship and breakup{{sfnp|Jane|2017|pp=29-30}} that included copies of personal chat logs, emails, and text messages.&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt; The blog falsely implied that Quinn had gotten a favorable review of ''Depression Quest'' because of her sexual relationship with Nathan Grayson, a video-game reviewer for the website ''[[Kotaku]]''.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=44}}{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=30}}{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=316}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=84}} Grayson never actually reviewed Quinn's games, and Grayson's only article mentioning her was published before their relationship began.&lt;ref name="Singal September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcmag about gg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canadacom" /&gt; Gjoni later updated his blog post to acknowledge this,&lt;ref name="pcmag about gg" /&gt; saying that a typographical error was to blame.{{refn|name=Jane}} Nonetheless, a link to the blog posted on [[4chan]], where many participants had previously been highly critical of ''Depression Quest'', led to renewed attacks on Quinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jane|2017|p=30}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=44}}; {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=36}}; {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gjoni's blog post, Quinn and her family were subjected to a virulent and often [[misogynistic]] harassment campaign.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name="nybooks 2015-06-25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=HeronBelford2014/&gt; Online attackers of Quinn at first used the label "Quinnspiracy",{{refn|name=Singal September 2014}}{{refn|name=Shaw &amp; Chess 2016}}{{refn|name=Aghazadeh et al}} later adopting the [[hashtag]] "#Gamergate" after it was coined by the actor [[Adam Baldwin]],{{efn |Baldwin, known for his right-wing political views,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kidd|Turner|2016|p=130}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; tweeted the hashtag #GamerGate near the end of August alongside a pair of videos promoting the "Quinnspiracy" by a YouTube user called Internet Aristocrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kidd|Turner|2016|pp=129–130}}; {{harvp|Shaw|Chess|2016|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later tell an interviewer that a left-wing "culture war" was imposing "political crap" on gamers.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{refn|name=Kaufman}}}} whose nearly 190,000 Twitter followers helped the spread of the hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salter|2017|p=45}}; {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harassment of Gamergate targets was coordinated via [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), spreading rapidly over [[imageboard]]s and forums like 4chan and [[Reddit]].&lt;ref name="TeleStuart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Massanari 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;

Within four months of the start of Gamergate, Quinn's record of threats she had received had grown 1,000-fold.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{refn|name=Jason}} At a conference Quinn said, "I used to go to game events and feel like I was going home&amp;nbsp;[...] Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm currently in the room with ones that said they wanted to beat me to death?".&lt;ref name=BBCQuinnInterview /&gt; One anonymous 4chan user threatened to "give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal".{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}{{refn|name=Parkin}} Commentators both inside and outside the video game industry condemned the attacks against Quinn.&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; The attacks included [[doxing]] (researching and broadcasting personally identifiable information about an individual) and hacking of her [[Tumblr]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], and [[Skype]] accounts; she was again subjected to rape and death threats.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; Quinn again fled her home to stay with friends.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}{{refn|name=Jason}} She wrote that "the Internet spent the last month spreading my personal information around, sending me threats, hacking anyone suspected of being friends with me, calling my dad and telling him I’m a whore, sending nude photos of me to colleagues, and basically giving me the 'burn the witch' treatment".&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, quoted in {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Singal September 2014}}

===Other targets of harassment===

Gamergate supporters subjected others to similar harassment, doxing, and death threats. Those who came to the victims' defense were ridiculed as "white knights", or "[[social justice warrior]]s" (SJWs);&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; this characterization was intended, according to Heron, Belford and Goker, to neutralize any opposition by questioning their motives.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; Shortly after the Gamergate hashtag was coined, video game developer [[Phil Fish]] had his personal information, including various accounts and passwords, hacked and publicly posted in retaliation for defending Quinn and attacking her detractors.&lt;ref name=FishPaste/&gt;&lt;ref name=BI/&gt; The hacks and doxing also exposed documents relating to Fish's company, Polytron.&lt;ref name=DailyFish/&gt; As a result, Fish left the gaming industry and put Polytron up for sale, calling the situation "unacceptable" and saying, "it's not worth it".&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=FishPaste/&gt;&lt;ref name="gs fish" /&gt;

[[File:Anita Sarkeesian 2013.jpg|thumb|Feminist and media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]] received death threats after releasing a ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'' video.]]

The campaign expanded to include renewed harassment of prominent&lt;ref name="prominent 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prominent 2" /&gt; feminist media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]], who had previously been a target of online harassment due in part to her YouTube video series ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'', which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper.&lt;ref name="TheStar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TorontoExclusive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cosmo" /&gt; After a new episode of ''Tropes vs. Women'' was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home.&lt;ref name="BusinessWeekSarkessian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPostSarkeesian" /&gt; At the [[XOXO (festival)|XOXO]] arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that "one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences". "The perpetrators", Sarkeesian went on to say, "do not see themselves as perpetrators at all&amp;nbsp;[...] They see themselves as noble warriors".&lt;ref name=VergeXOXO /&gt;

Sarkeesian canceled an October 2014 speaking appearance at [[Utah State University]] (USU) after the school received three anonymous threats, the second of which claimed affiliation with Gamergate.&lt;ref name="SLT ALberty101614" /&gt; The initial threat proposed that "a Montreal Massacre style attack will be carried out against the attendees, as well as the students and staff at the nearby Women's Center", alluding to the [[École Polytechnique massacre]], a 1989 mass shooting motivated by [[antifeminism]].&lt;ref name="montreal-massacre-threat-ctv" /&gt; USU's President and Provost released a joint statement saying that USU, in consultation with state and federal law enforcement agencies, had assessed that there was no credible threat to students, staff or the speaker.&lt;ref name=USUthreat/&gt;  Requests for additional security measures were declined because of Utah's [[Open carry in the United States|open carry]] laws, leading to the cancellation.&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AnitaUSUCNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=AnitaUSUBBC /&gt;  The threats drew the attention of mainstream media to the Gamergate situation.&lt;ref name="venturebeat mainstream"/&gt; Wingfield of ''The New York Times'' referred to the threat as "the most noxious example of a weeks long campaign to discredit or intimidate outspoken critics of the male-dominated gaming industry and its culture".&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigated the threat to attack Sarkeesian and other Gamergate-related threats.&lt;ref name=HJFBI/&gt; The investigations, which were plagued with jurisdictional issues, ultimately closed with the FBI failing to identify the perpetrators of some threats and declining to prosecute others.&lt;ref name="FBI 2017Jan27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge fbi closed" /&gt;
[[File:Brianna Wu next to Motorcycle.jpg|thumb|Video game developer [[Brianna Wu]] suffered Gamergate-related harassment beginning in late 2014.]]

In mid-October [[Brianna Wu]], another independent game developer and co-founder of video game studio [[Giant Spacekat (company)|Giant Spacekat]], saw her home address and other identifying information posted on [[8chan]] as retaliation for mocking Gamergate. Wu then became the target of rape and death threats on Twitter and elsewhere. After contacting police, Wu fled her home with her husband, saying she would not allow the threats to intimidate her into silence.&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WuBoston /&gt;&lt;ref name=GlobeFeature /&gt; Wu announced an {{US$|11000}} reward for information leading to a conviction for those involved in her harassment, and set up a legal fund to help other game developers who have been harassed online.&lt;ref name="wu reward"/&gt; As of April 2016, Wu was still receiving threats in such volume that she employed full-time staff to document them.&lt;ref name="csm 20160411" /&gt;

Harassment related to Gamergate continued for several months after the onset of the controversy. Two critics of Gamergate were targets of attempted "[[swatting]]"—hoaxed reports to emergency services intended to provoke a [[SWAT]] team response at the target's home. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that both swatting attempts were coordinated through the "[[Baphomet#Modern interpretations and usage|baphomet]]" subforum of 8chan.&lt;ref name="ars swatting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian swatting" /&gt; After the initial rush of threats that caused her to flee her home, Wu documented receiving roughly 45 death threats by April 2015; Silicon Valley investor [[Marc Andreessen]] offered up to a $10,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those who made the threats.&lt;ref name="inc" /&gt; Wu's studio, Giant Spacekat, withdrew from the Expo Hall of [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX East 2015]]. Wu cited security concerns, lack of confidence in the management and their failure to return calls.&lt;ref name="wu pax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat 2015-02-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe 2015-02-24" /&gt;

Actress and gamer [[Felicia Day]] wrote a blog post about her concerns over Gamergate and her fear of retaliation if she spoke against it. Almost immediately her home address and phone number were posted online, leading to harassing letters and phone calls.&lt;ref name="seattletimes 2015-09-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DayGuardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=DayTime /&gt; Actor [[Wil Wheaton]] and former [[NFL]] player [[Chris Kluwe]] also posted criticisms of Gamergate. [[Stephen Colbert]] questioned why men like Kluwe had not been threatened by Gamergate, noting that the targets were almost entirely women.&lt;ref name=ColbertVerge /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPoColbert /&gt;

Some who have identified as Gamergate supporters said that they have been harassed.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt; YouTube personality [[Boogie2988|Steven "Boogie2988" Williams]] remarked that a comment on one of his videos included his address and a threat to his wife's life.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Codd /&gt; In an interview with [[BBC Three (online)|BBC Three]], Gamergate supporter [[TotalBiscuit|John Bain]], known by his YouTube moniker "TotalBiscuit", said he had been the target of death threats and harassment from anonymous people who opposed his view on Gamergate.&lt;ref name="bbc3 2016-03-16" /&gt; Mike Diver wrote in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' that threats against Gamergate supporters had been neglected in press coverage.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt; According to the BBC, the technology writer [[Allum Bokhari]] said that a "well-known trolling group" was "working to provoke both sides against each other".&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt;

Bomb threats have also been made towards events attended by Gamergate supporters. A May 2015 meeting in Washington D.C. arranged by writer [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and journalist [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] was the target of a bomb threat made over Twitter, according to local police responding to information supplied by the FBI.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-05-03" /&gt; During "Airplay", an event run by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] in August 2015, multiple bomb threats were made. This led to the evacuation of the building and the surrounding neighborhood.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-08-16"/&gt;

===Coordination of harassment===

Gamergate harassment was orchestrated largely through anonymous message boards such as [[4chan]], [[8chan]], and [[Reddit]],{{refn|name=Nieborg &amp; Foxman}}{{sfnp|Murray|2018|p=36}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=41}} particularly the "KotakuInAction" [[Subreddits|subreddit]].&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=47}} ''[[Ars Technica]]'' reported that a series of 4chan discussion logs suggests that Twitter [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppet]] accounts were used to popularize the Gamergate hashtag.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt; Heron, Belford, and Goker, analyzing the logs, said that early Gamergate IRC discussions focused on coordinating the harassment of Quinn by using [[Astroturfing|astroturf]] campaigns to push attacks against her into mainstream view. They also describe how initial organizers attempted to cultivate a palpable narrative for public consumption while internally focusing on personal grudges against Quinn and aggressive sexual imagery.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; Mortensen wrote in ''[[Games and Culture]]'' that Gamergate's structure as an anonymous swarm allowed it to create an environment where anyone who criticized it or became its target was at risk, while allowing them to avoid individual responsibility for harassment.&lt;ref name="Mortensen2016" /&gt;

There has been considerable discussion of [[Norm (social)|self-policing]] and the [[Collective responsibility|responsibility]] supporters of Gamergate share when the hashtag is used for harassment. A number of websites have blocked users, removed posts, and created policies to prevent their users from threatening Quinn and others with doxing, assault, rape and murder, and planning and coordinating such threats.&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt;&lt;ref name=dot /&gt; 4chan founder [[Christopher Poole]] banned all discussion of Gamergate on the site as more attacks occurred, leading to Gamergate supporters using 8chan as their central hub.&lt;ref name="Massanari 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapost 8chan"/&gt;

Many Gamergate supporters have denied that the harassment took place, or falsely accused victims of fabricating the evidence.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPostSarkeesian" /&gt; Gamergate supporters have used the term "Literally Who" to refer to victims of harassment such as Quinn, saying they are not relevant to Gamergate's goals and purposes. Commentators have decried the use of such terminology as dehumanizing, and said that discussions on Gamergate forums often center around those referred to as "Literally Who".&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DipCour"/&gt; Some Gamergate supporters have denounced the harassment, arguing that the perpetrators are in the minority and do not represent them.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt;

By September 24, 2014, over one million Twitter messages incorporating the Gamergate hashtag had been sent.&lt;ref name="metro what is gg" /&gt; A ''[[Newsweek]]'' and [[Brandwatch]] analysis found more than two million Twitter messages between September and October 2014.&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch" /&gt; Software developer [[Andy Baio]] also produced an analysis of #Gamergate tweets showing a discussion that was polarized between pro- and anti-Gamergate factions. One quarter of the tweets sampled were produced by users new to Twitter, most of whom were pro-Gamergate.&lt;ref name="fastcodesign 2014-10-28" /&gt; While the number of Gamergate supporters is unclear, in October 2014 ''[[Deadspin]]'' estimated 10,000 supporters based on the number of users discussing Gamergate on Reddit.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;

==Organization==

The series of events that came to be known as Gamergate has been described as "torturously complex".{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} As a movement, it had no official leaders or clearly defined agenda.{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|pp=113-114}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=41–42}} Because of its anonymous membership, lack of organization and leaderless nature, sources differ as to the goals or mission of Gamergate and defining it has been difficult.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt; Frank Lantz of [[NYU]]'s Game Center wrote that he could not find "a single explanation of a coherent Gamergate position".&lt;ref&gt;Lantz, quoted in {{harvp|Meyer|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Grant, editor-in-chief of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', told the ''Columbia Journalism Review'': "The closest thing we've been able to divine is that it's noise. It's chaos&amp;nbsp;[...] all you can do is find patterns. And ultimately Gamergate will be defined—I think has been defined—by some of its basest elements."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, quoted in {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;

As the threats expanded, international media focused on Gamergate's violent, misogynistic element and its inability to present a coherent message. Bob Stuart, in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]],'' reported that "Gamergate has since swelled into an unwieldy movement with no apparent leaders, mission statement, or aims beyond calling out 'social justice warriors'.&amp;nbsp;[...] When members of the games industry are being driven from their houses and jobs, threatened, or abused, it makes Gamergate's claim that it is engaged in an ethical campaign appear laughable."&lt;ref name=TeleStuart /&gt; The campaign's focus broadened to take on other targets in the news media, as with [[Bollea v. Gawker|Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media]].&lt;ref name="NYTThielGawker" /&gt;

Jesse Singal, in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', stated that he had spoken to several Gamergate supporters to try to understand their concerns, but found conflicting ideals and incoherent messages. Singal observed Gamergate supporters making a constant series of attacks on Quinn, Sarkeesian, and other women, while frequently stating that Gamergate "is not about" them.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt; Chris Ip of the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' said that any legitimate message from Gamergate supporters regarding ethics in journalism was lost in the noise created by harassment, sexism, and misogyny.{{Verify source|date=May 2018}} With anyone able to tweet under the hashtag and no single person willing or able to represent the hashtag and take responsibility for its actions, Ip said it is not possible for journalists to neatly separate abusers from those seeking reasonable debate.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt; 

[[Jon Stone (poet)|Jon Stone]] wrote in ''The Guardian'' that {{Nowrap|"[Gamergate]}} readjusts and reinvents itself in response to attempts to disarm and disperse its noxiousness, subsuming disaffected voices in an act of continual regeneration, cycling through targets, pretexts, manifestoes, and moralisms".&lt;ref name="Ryan Cooper Week" /&gt; ''Polygon''{{'}}s Grant said that Gamergate has remained amorphous and leaderless so that the harassment can be conducted without any culpability.&lt;ref name="OTMGrant" /&gt;{{Time needed|date=May 2018}}

===Harassment and Twitter===

While organized through anonymous message boards such as 4chan and Reddit, Gamergate harassment was most prominent on Twitter. Michael Salter, a [[University of Western Sydney]] criminologist,  writes that Twitter's design and architecture was "highly conducive" to such abuse campaigns, allowing Gamergaters to overwhelm users' ability to individually block the large numbers of fake or "sockpuppet" accounts used to send abusive and harassing messages.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=47–48}} 

Twitter was criticized for its inability to respond quickly and prevent harassment over the service. Within the United States, Twitter and other social media sites are not liable for content posted by third-parties of their service under [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]] (1996), and so have no legal obligation to police malicious content such as harassment and threats.&lt;ref name="fastcompany 2015-06-02" /&gt; Brianna Wu, shortly after becoming a target of harassment, stated that Twitter facilitated harassment by the ease with which anyone could make a new account even after having an earlier account blocked, and challenged the service to improve its responsiveness to complaints.&lt;ref name="businessweek wu twitter"/&gt; Robinson Meyer of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said Gamergate is an "identity crisis" for Twitter, and by not dealing with harassing users, the platform is failing to protect victims.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

Early on during Gamergate, software developer Randi Harper started the "Good Game Auto Blocker" or "ggautoblocker", an expanding list of known Twitter accounts that were tied to the Gamergate hashtag which could be automatically [[block (Internet)|blocked]], therefore reducing the degree of harassment received.&lt;ref name="verge 2015-06-10" /&gt; In November 2014, Twitter announced a collaboration with the non-profit group "Women, Action &amp; the Media" (WAM), in which users of Twitter can report harassment to a tool monitored by WAM members, who would forward affirmed issues to Twitter within 24 hours. The move, while arising in the wake of the Gamergate harassment, was due to general issues of the harassment of women on the Internet.&lt;ref name="wiredWAMTwitterHarassment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheVergeWAMTwitter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wam release" /&gt; In May 2015, WAM reported that of 512 reported harassment instances by the tool during the month of November 2014, 12% of those were tied to the Gamergate controversy based on the ggautoblocker list, with most harassment occurring from single-instance accounts targeting a single person.&lt;ref name="wam report" /&gt;

===Efforts to affect public perceptions===

Early in the controversy, posters on 4chan focused on donating to a self-described [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] group called [[The Fine Young Capitalists]] (TFYC), who had been embroiled in a dispute with Quinn over a female-only game development contest they had organized. Advocating donations to help TFYC create the game, posters on 4chan's politics board argued that such donations would make them "look really good" and would make them "PR-untouchable".&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fastcodesign 2014-11-03" /&gt;

To respond to widespread criticism of Gamergate as misogynistic, posters on 4chan created a second Twitter hashtag, #NotYourShield, intended to show that Gamergate was not about opposition to feminism or wanting to push women out of gaming. In the 4chan post that may have coined the hashtag, it was framed as a way to "demand the SJWs stop using you as a shield to deflect genuine criticism".&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt; Many of the accounts used to tweet the tag seemed to be [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]] that had copied their avatars from elsewhere on the internet; the methods used to create it have been compared to #EndFathersDay, a hoax manufactured on 4chan using similar methods.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt; Quinn said that in light of Gamergate's exclusive targeting of women or those who stood up for women, "#notyourshield was, ironically, solely designed to be a shield for this campaign once people started calling it misogynistic".&lt;ref name=Escapist4chan /&gt; [[Arthur Chu]] wrote that the hashtag was an attempt to leverage [[white guilt]] and to prevent allies from supporting the people being attacked by Gamergate.&lt;ref name="Chu2014" /&gt;

===Targeting advertisers===

Gamergate supporters were critical of the wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose from a list of target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a form letter containing it to an advertiser.&lt;ref name=waposuccess /&gt; [[Intel]] reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have a chilling effect on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy&lt;ref name="GIBizIntel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VergeIntelStatement" /&gt; and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.&lt;ref name="Intel_Telegraph" /&gt;

===Sad Puppies===
Gamergate became associated with the "[[Sad Puppies]]" and "Rabid Puppies" during [[Hugo Awards#Since 2000|2015 Hugo Awards]] for science fiction writing. These groups organized [[voting bloc]]s that dominated the 2015 Hugo Awards. The campaign was described as a backlash against the increasing racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in science fiction. Members of the bloc said that they sought to counteract what they saw as a focus on giving awards based on the race, ethnicity, or gender of the author or characters rather than quality, and bemoaning the increasing prominence of what they described as 'message' fiction with fewer traditional "zap gun" sciencefictional trappings.&lt;ref name="atlantic 2015-04-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes 2015-08-24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired 2015-08-23" /&gt; By 2018, the Sad Puppies had diminished visibility, and Quinn's 2017 memoir, ''[[Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate]]'', was nominated for the 2018 [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work]] (for non-fiction works related to science fiction or fantasy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/03/31/2018-hugo-award-finalists-announced/ |title=2018 Hugo Award Finalists Announced |date=2018-03-31 |work=Tor.com |access-date=2018-08-27 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics in journalism complaints==
The most active Gamergate supporters or "Gamergaters"{{sfnp|Barnes|2018|p=94}}{{refn|name=Braithwaite}} said that Gamergate was a movement for ethics in games journalism and that any harassment of women was done by others not affiliated with Gamergate.{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}}{{refn|name=Jane}}{{sfnp|Barnes|2018|p=94}} They argued that the close relationships between journalists and developers demonstrated a conspiracy among reviewers to focus on progressive social issues,&lt;ref name="KernelMag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014"/&gt; leading to conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Straumsheim2015" /&gt; Some supporters pointed to what they considered disproportionate praise for games such as ''[[Depression Quest]]'' and ''[[Gone Home]]'', which feature unconventional gameplay and stories with social implications, while they viewed traditional [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA games]]  as downplayed.&lt;ref name="overland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTSuellentrop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="willametteweek" /&gt; Journalists who did not cover the examination into Quinn's private life were accused of conspiracy, and a [[blacklist]] circulated by Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name=ibtimes1 /&gt;

Observers in the media have largely rejected these claims as baseless. Chris Ip of the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' wrote that "many criticisms of press coverage by people who identify with Gamergate&amp;nbsp;[...] have been debunked" and concluded that "at core, the movement is a classic culture war".&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt; Writing in ''Vox'', Todd VanDerWerff said that "[e]very single question of journalistic ethics Gamergate has brought up has either been debunked or dealt with".&lt;ref name=VoxLose /&gt; According to [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]], then editor-at-large of ''Gamasutra'', the ethics concerns were a [[conspiracy theory]], albeit a sincere one; Alexander writes that there is nothing unethical about journalists being acquainted with those they cover and that meaningful reporting requires journalists to develop professional relationships with sources.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; ''Ars Technica'', ''Vox'', and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', among others, stated that discussions of gender equality, sexism and other social issues in game reviews present no ethical conflict.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mortensen2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VoxLose /&gt;&lt;ref name=WiredHudson /&gt;&lt;ref name=UWiscCulver/&gt;

Several writers who attempted to understand Gamergate's motivations concluded that, rather than relating to purported issues with gaming journalism ethics, Gamergate represented an effort to suppress opposing views.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VergeDead" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoRosenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Internet Monitor 2014" /&gt; Salter writes that "mass media had a decisive role in evaluating the competing claims of Gamergate and its critics, and ultimately dismissing Gamergate as a misogynist abuse campaign".{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=55}} Screenshots of 4chan boards, collected and published by Quinn, suggested that complaints about ethics in games journalism were invented ''post hoc'' by Gamergaters to distract critics from their ongoing abuse of her.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=46}}{{refn|name=Johnston September 2014}} Jay Hathaway wrote at ''Gawker'' that this strategy emerged once Gamergaters found that harassing Quinn about her sexual history was unlikely to win them support; according to Hathaway, IRC chat logs showed that "the [Gamergate] movement was focused on destroying Zoë Quinn first, reforming games reporting second".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=85}} (attributed to T.C. Sottek)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Hathaway}}

Other commentators argued that Gamergate had the potential to raise significant issues in gaming journalism, but that the wave of misogynistic harassment and abuse associated with the hashtag had [[poisoned the well]], making it impossible to separate honest criticism from sexist trolling.&lt;ref name=goldman /&gt;&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt; Visible support for Gamergate in the form of tweets, online videos, and blogs seldom involved discussion of ethics, but often featured misogynistic and/or racist commentary.&lt;ref name="Massanari 2017"/&gt; The targets were mainly female game developers, academics, and writers.{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=33}}

Researchers at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at [[Harvard University]] described Gamergate as a "vitriolic campaign against Quinn that quickly morph[ed] into a broader crusade against alleged corruption in games journalism" which involved considerable abuse and harassment of female developers and game critics.&lt;ref name="Internet Monitor 2014" /&gt; Concerns have also been raised when juxtaposing the behavior of Gamergate supporters with their claimed message: Dr. Kathleen Bartzen Culver, a professor and media ethics expert at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], wrote that while Gamergate supporters claimed to be interested in journalism ethics, their "misogynistic and threatening" behavior belied this claim. "Much of the conversation—if I can even call it that—has been a toxic sludge of rumor, invective, and gender bias. The irony comes from people who claim to be challenging the ethics of game journalists through patently unethical behavior."&lt;ref name=UWiscCulver/&gt;

After analyzing a sample of tweets related to Gamergate, ''Newsweek'' concluded that it was primarily about harassment rather than ethics, stating that the sample "suggests that&amp;nbsp;[...] contrary to its stated goal, Gamergate spends more time tweeting negatively at game developers than at game journalists".&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch"/&gt; Casey Johnston wrote for ''Ars Technica'' that, based on logs from the 4chan users who initially pushed Gamergate into the spotlight, the goal behind the hashtag campaign was to "perpetuate misogynistic attacks by wrapping them in a debate about ethics".&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt; An academic analysis of a week's worth of public posts tagged with #Gamergate found that the [[issue public]]s involved were not "only or even primarily" concerned with ethics in gaming journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess &amp; Matamoros-Fernández, quoted in {{harvp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BurgessMatamoros-Fernández2016" /&gt;

In an interview with Anita Sarkeesian in ''The Guardian'', [[Jessica Valenti]] said that "the movement's much-mocked mantra, 'It's about ethics in journalism{{'"}} was seen by others as "a natural extension of sexist harassment and the fear of female encroachment on a traditionally male space". Sarkeesian asked, "if this 'movement' was about journalism, why wasn't it journalists who had to deal with a barrage of rape and death threats?".&lt;ref name="guardian aug2015"/&gt; Wu told ''The Boston Globe'' that the ethics claims were "a pretext" and described Gamergate as "an actual hate group&amp;nbsp;[...] they're upset and threatened by women who are being very outspoken about feminism".&lt;ref&gt;Wu, quoted in {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

Gamergate has been criticized for focusing on women, especially female developers, while ignoring many large-scale journalistic ethics issues. Alex Goldman of NPR's ''On the Media'' criticized Gamergate for targeting female indie developers rather than [[AAA (game industry)|AAA games publishers]], and said claims of unethical behavior by Quinn and Sarkeesian were unfounded.&lt;ref name=goldman /&gt; In ''Wired'', Laura Hudson found it telling that Gamergate supporters concentrated on impoverished independent creators and critics, and nearly exclusively women, rather than the large game companies whose work they enjoyed.&lt;ref name=WiredHudson /&gt; ''Vox'' writer Todd VanDerWerff highlighted an essay written by game developer David Hill, who said that corruption, [[nepotism]], and excessive [[commercialism]] existed in the gaming industry, but that Gamergate was not addressing those issues.&lt;ref name=VoxConfuse /&gt; Adi Robertson, of ''The Verge'', commented on the long-standing ethical issues gaming journalism has dealt with, but that most Gamergate supporters did not seem interested in "addressing problems that don't directly relate to feminist criticism or the tiny indie games scene".&lt;ref name=VergeDay/&gt;

{{anchor|GameJournoPros}}In mid-September 2014, [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], vocal critic of feminism and left-wing ideologies, published leaked discussions from a mailing list for gaming journalists called GameJournoPros on the [[Breitbart News]] website. Yiannopoulos and Gamergate supporters saw the mailing list as evidence of collusion among journalists.&lt;ref name=GGJargon /&gt; The list's founder acknowledged suggesting that journalists write an open letter of support to Quinn in response to the harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate.&lt;ref name=GJPresponse /&gt;&lt;ref name=FudgeResponse/&gt; Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest.&lt;ref name=westmanjournal/&gt; Following the leak, the mailing list was closed.&lt;ref name=FudgeResponse/&gt;

==Social and cultural implications==
Observers have generally described Gamergate as part of a long-running culture war against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; ''The Washington Post''{{'}}s digital culture writer [[Caitlin Dewey]] said that "Whatever Gamergate may have started as, it is now an Internet culture war" between predominantly female game developers and critics advocating for greater inclusion, and "a motley alliance of vitriolic naysayers" opposed to such changes.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, quoted in {{harvp|Hanson|2017|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Guide to Gamergate}} ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical issues than in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women.&lt;ref name=VoxLose/&gt; ''Ars Technica'' quoted early members as saying that they had no interest in videogames and were primarily interested in attacking Quinn.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;

Gamergate has been described as being driven by antifeminist ideologies.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe 2015-06-12" /&gt; Some supporters have denied this, but acknowledge that there are misogynistic voices within Gamergate.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vice /&gt; Antonsen, Ask, and Karlstrom wrote in ''Nordic Journal of Science and Technology Studies'' "in the case of #gamergate, it is the explicit goal of many of the participants to exclude groups of people, particularly women, from the debate and from the game industry and limit women's rights as citizens."&lt;ref name="nordic" /&gt; Jon Stone, in ''The Guardian'', called it a "swelling of vicious right-wing sentiment" and compared it to the [[men's rights movement]].&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt; Commentators such as Stone, [[Liana Kerzner]], and Ryan Cooper have said that the controversy is being exploited by right-wing voices and by conservative pundits who had little interest in gaming.&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MetalEater2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan Cooper Week" /&gt; Chrisella Herzog states that in addition to violent sexism, Gamergate has virulent strains and violent sentiments of homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, racism, and neo-Nazism.&lt;ref name="DipCour" /&gt; Some figures associated with Gamergate went on to become components of the so-called [[alt-right]], &lt;ref name="Alt-right Component" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein J"/&gt; which thus  featured in the [[2016 American presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Alt-right precursor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="From Video Games to Politics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Old Racism, New Technology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimesHollywoodGG" /&gt;

Quinn said the campaign had "roped well-meaning people who cared about ethics and transparency into a pre-existing hate mob",&lt;ref name="ViceQuinn" /&gt; and urged industry publishers and developers to condemn the hashtag.&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt; She further asked those Gamergate supporters who had any earnest discussion about ethics to move away from the "Gamergate" tag.&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt;

===Gamer identity===

Gamergate is often considered to be a reaction to the changing cultural identity of the "[[gamer]]". As video games grew in mainstream popularity during the 1990s, a "gamer" identity emerged around games marketed to an audience that was predominantly young, male and heterosexual. Over the years, the growing popularity of games expanded that audience to include many who did not fit the traditional gamer demographic, particularly women.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=42–43}} Games with artistic and cultural themes grew in popularity, and [[independent video game development]] made these games more common, while [[mobile games|mobile]] and [[casual games|casual]] games expanded the scope of the industry beyond the traditional gamer identity.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}}&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; The games most popular with typical "gamers", often featuring explicit violence along with exaggerated gender stereotypes, were joined by a more diverse set of games that included gay, lesbian, and transgender themes. "Indie" gaming blogs and websites were created to comment on these developments, in contrast to the more established gaming press, which was traditionally dependent on the games industry itself.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=42–43}}

The media-studies scholar Adrienne Massanari writes that Gamergate is a direct response to such changes in video-game content as well as changes in the demographics of players.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} Surveys by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] in 2014 and 2015 showed that video-game players were between 44% and 48% female,&lt;ref name="gamesindustry women" /&gt;{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} with an average age of thirty-five.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} This broader audience began to question some assumptions and [[fantasy tropes and conventions|tropes]] that had been common in games. Shira Chess and Adrienne Shaw write that concern over these changes is integral to Gamergate, especially a fear that sexualized games aimed primarily at young men might eventually be replaced by less sexualized games marketed to broader audiences.&lt;ref name="Chess 2015" /&gt; Gamergaters often dismiss such games and their more diverse, casual group of players as being not "real" games or gamers.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} Alyssa Rosenberg of ''The Washington Post'' said that some of Gamergaters' concerns were rooted in a view of video games as "appliances" rather than art, that should be reviewed based on feature checklists rather than traditional artistic criteria.&lt;ref name=WaPoRosenberg /&gt; Chris Suellentrop of ''The New York Times'' criticized resistance to innovative uses of the gaming medium, and the belief that increased coverage and praise of artistic games like ''[[Gone Home]]'' would negatively affect blockbuster games such as ''Grand Theft Auto V''.&lt;ref name=NYTSuellentrop/&gt;

Gamergate is particularly associated with opposition to the influence of so-called "[[social justice warrior]]s" in the gaming industry and media, who are perceived as a threat to traditional gaming culture.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}}{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} As the video-game market grew more diverse, cultural critics became interested in issues of [[gender representation in video games|gender representation]] and identity in games.&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; One prominent feminist critic of the representation of women in gaming is Anita Sarkeesian,&lt;ref name="prominent 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prominent 2"/&gt; whose ''Tropes vs. Women in Video Games'' project is devoted to female stereotypes in games. Her fund-raising campaign and videos were met with hostility and harassment by some gamers. Further incidents raised concerns about [[sexism in video gaming]].&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name=PolygonFBI /&gt; Prior to August 2014, escalating harassment prompted the [[International Game Developers Association]] (IGDA) to provide support groups for harassed developers and to begin discussions with the FBI to help investigate online harassment of game developers.&lt;ref name=PolygonFBI /&gt; In an interview on [[Comedy Central]]'s program ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Sarkeesian said she believes women are targeted because they are "challenging the status quo of gaming as a male-dominated space".&lt;ref name=Colbert /&gt;

In late August 2014, shortly after the initial accusations against Grayson and harassment of Quinn, several gaming sites published opinion essays on the controversy that focused on the growing diversity of gaming and the mainstreaming of the medium, some of which included criticism of sexism within gamer culture.&lt;ref name="Plunkett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston August 2014"/&gt; These so-called "gamers are dead" articles were seen as part of a conspiracy to undercut traditional gamer identity{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}&lt;ref name="Chess 2015" /&gt; and were used by participants to rally support for Gamergate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}; {{harvp|Shaw|Chess|2016|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s'' [[David Auerbach]] and ''[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel's]]'' David Elks criticized these articles for alienating their publications' audience by attacking the gamer identity.&lt;ref name=stokesentinel/&gt; Writing for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', L. Rhodes said the antagonism in the Gamergate controversy was a result of the industry seeking to widen its customer demographic instead of focusing on core gamers, which Rhodes says "is precisely what videogames needed".&lt;ref name="paste 2015-04-20" /&gt; Brendan Keogh of ''[[Overland (magazine)|Overland]]'' stated that Gamergate "does not represent a marginalised, discriminated identity under attack so much as a hegemonic and normative mainstream being forced to redistribute some of its power".&lt;ref name="overland"/&gt;

===Misogyny and sexism===
{{see also|Sexism in video gaming}}

Gamergate has been described as an expression of sexism and misogyny within gaming culture; its main themes are criticism of feminism and so-called "social justice warriors", who are perceived as a threat to traditional video games.{{sfnp|Murray|2018|p=36}}{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} Women's greater visibility in the gaming industry has seen a corresponding rise in gendered harassment and intimidation directed at them.{{refn|name=Salter}} Among mainstream journalists, the harassment campaign that became known as Gamergate is considered emblematic of this surge of online misogyny.{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=112}} According to Sarah Kaplan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "sexism in gaming is a long-documented, much-debated but seemingly intractable problem", and became the crux of the Gamergate controversy.&lt;ref name=WaPo /&gt; Jaime Weinman writing in ''[[Maclean's]]'' said, "[w]hether it was supposed to be or not, GamerGate is largely about women".&lt;ref name=Macleans /&gt; Discussing Gamergate on her [[ESPN]] blog, Jane McManus compared the misogyny that women in the gaming industry experience to that faced by the first women entering sporting communities.&lt;ref name="ESPNMcManus" /&gt; Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] has described Gamergate as "something that we need to stand clearly against".&lt;ref name="IBTimesTrudeauGG" /&gt;

Sexism and misogyny had been identified as problems in the video game industry and online community prior to the events of Gamergate.&lt;ref name="gdc misogyny 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe Women Outside" /&gt; Sarkeesian considered that the Internet has a "boys'-locker-room feel" to it, with male users trying to show off to each other which causes escalating cases of harassment in situations like Gamergate.&lt;ref name="guardian aug2015"/&gt; In March 2014, game designer [[Cliff Bleszinski]] wrote a blog post commenting on the "latent racism, homophobia and misogyny" that existed within the online gaming community.&lt;ref name="NYTSuellentrop"/&gt; In a November 2014 interview with ''[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]'', Wu said the game industry "has been a boys' club for 30 years", and that the common portrayal of women as "sex symbols and [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]" in video games has led to the players taking the same attitudes.&lt;ref name="develop harassment"/&gt; Brendan Sinclair, writing for ''[[GamesIndustry.biz]]'', stated that the events of the Gamergate controversy were "reprehensible and saddening" and "this industry has some profound issues in the way it treats women".&lt;ref name="gibiz silver lining"/&gt;

Many commentators have said that the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. [[Lisa Nakamura]], a professor of digital studies at the University of Michigan, wrote that Gamergate "showed the world the extent of gaming's misogyny".&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, quoted in {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakamura"/&gt;  Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, [[Amanda Marcotte]] in an article for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' accused the video game world of being "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" with hate on any "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a ''[[Teen Titans]]'' cover and to a community manager of the ''[[Mighty No. 9]]'' game because she drew a feminine [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]], and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]''.&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that "[b]efore [Gamergate] had a name, it was nothing but trying to get me to kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family.&amp;nbsp;[...] There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone."&lt;ref name="BBCQuinnInterview"/&gt; [[Danielle Citron]] of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to "fundamentally distort who she is".&lt;ref name="inc"/&gt;

Targets of Gamergate supporters have overwhelmingly been women, even when men were responsible for the supposed wrongdoings. Writing in ''The New Yorker'', Simon Parkin observed that Quinn was attacked while the male journalist who was falsely accused of reviewing her work favorably largely escaped, revealing the campaign as "a pretense to make further harassment of women in the industry permissible".&lt;ref name="Parkin" /&gt; In ''The New York Times'', Chris Suellentrop said that a petition sought to have a female colleague fired for criticizing the portrayal of women in ''Grand Theft Auto V'', while he and many other male critics raised similar concerns but did not face similar reprisals.&lt;ref name=NYTSuellentrop /&gt; Most commentators have described Gamergate as consisting largely of white males, though some supporters have said that it includes a notable percentage of women, minorities and LGBT members.&lt;ref name="inquisitr" /&gt;

Critics of the movement have described it as a kind of misogynistic [[terrorism]].{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=5}}{{refn|name=Musgrave}} Writing in ''The Week'', Ryan Cooper called the harassment campaign "an online form of terrorism" intended to reverse a trend in gaming culture toward increasing acceptance of women, and stated that social media platforms need to tighten their policies and protections against threats and abuse.&lt;ref name=TheWeek /&gt; Speaking on [[Iowa Public Radio]], academic Cindy Tekobbe said the harassment campaign was intended to drive women from public spaces and intimidate them into silence.&lt;ref name=IPR /&gt; Prof. Joanne St. Lewis of the [[University of Ottawa]] stated that Gamergate's harassment and threats should be considered acts of terrorism as the perpetrators seek to harm women and to prevent them from speaking back or defending others.&lt;ref name="vice 2015-02-13" /&gt;

Though ''Newsweek'' reported that the FBI had a file regarding Gamergate, no arrests have been made nor charges filed,&lt;ref name="newsweek FBI" /&gt; and parts of the FBI investigation into the threats had been closed in September 2015 due to a lack of leads.&lt;ref name="verge fbi closed"/&gt; Former FBI supervisory special agent for cybercrimes, Tim Ryan, stated that cyberharassment cases are a low priority for authorities because it is difficult to track down the perpetrator and they have lower penalties compared to other crimes they are tasked to enforce.&lt;ref name="slate 2014-10-17" /&gt; In June 2015, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Elonis v. United States]]'' that harassing messages sent online are not necessarily [[true threat]]s that would be prosecutable under criminal law and, according to ''[[Pacific Standard]]'', this poses a further challenge in policing Gamergate-related harassment.&lt;ref name="psmag 2015-06-04" /&gt; However, the Court's decision also suggested that if threats made over social media were found to be true threats, they should be treated the same as threats made in other forms of communication.&lt;ref name="fastcompany 2015-06-02" /&gt;

Wu has expressed her frustration over how law enforcement agencies have responded to the threats that she and other women in the game industry have received.&lt;ref name="ars 2015-05-21" /&gt; On public release of the FBI's case files on Gamergate, Wu said she was "livid", and that "Only a fraction of information we gave the FBI was looked into. They failed on all levels."&lt;ref name="gamesindustyFBIGG" /&gt;The lack of legal enforcement contributes towards the harassers' ability to maintain these activities without any risk of punishment, according to Chrisella Herzog of ''[[The Diplomatic Courier]]''; at worst, harassers would see their social media accounts suspended but are able to turn around to register new accounts to continue to engage.&lt;ref name="DipCour"/&gt;

U.S. Representative [[Katherine Clark]], one of whose constituents was Brianna Wu, called for a stronger response from law enforcement to online abuse, partly as a result of advocacy by the women targeted by Gamergate.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=53–54}}&lt;ref name="Merlan"/&gt; On March 10, 2015, Clark wrote a letter to the [[House Appropriations Committee]] asking it to call on the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to crack down on the harassment of women on the internet, saying the campaign of intimidation associated with Gamergate had highlighted the problem.&lt;ref name="clark 2015-03-10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge 2015-03-11" /&gt; She asked the U.S. Department of Justice to "prioritize" online threats against women, saying, "We do not think this a harmless hoax. We think this has real-life implications for women".&lt;ref name="Merlan"/&gt; Clark also hosted a Congressional briefing on March 15, along with the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus to review issues of cyberstalking and online threats; during the briefing, Quinn spoke of her experiences with Gamergate, which an executive director of the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] described during the hearing as "an online hate group&amp;nbsp;[...] which was started by an ex-boyfriend to ruin [Quinn's] life".&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-04-21" /&gt; On May 27, the [[United States House of Representatives]] formally supported Clark's request for increased measures to combat online abuse against women, explicitly pressing for more investigations and prosecutions by the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="wgbh 2015-06-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon 2015-05-29" /&gt; On June 2, Rep. Clark introduced the "Prioritizing Online Threat Enforcement Act of 2015" to Congress. The bill would have allocated more funding for the FBI to employ additional agents to enforce laws against [[cyberstalking]], online criminal harassment, and threats.&lt;ref name="metrowest 2015-06-04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.2602" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo 2015-06-07" /&gt; Two years later, in June 2017, Rep. Clark introduced the "Online Safety Modernization Act of 2017" with co-sponsors Reps. [[Susan Brooks]] (Indiana) and [[Pat Meehan]] (Pennsylvania), which combined several of Clark's previous bills. The bill focused on penalizing "cybercrimes against individuals", including doxing, swatting, and [[sextortion]], as well as granting $20 million for law enforcement training to help tackle such crimes, and $4 million to establish the National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals in order to study and collect statistics and information related to these crimes.&lt;ref name="verge 2017-06-29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clark hr__2017"/&gt;

==Gaming industry response==

The harassment of Quinn, Sarkeesian, Wu, and others led prominent industry professionals to condemn the Gamergate attacks for damaging the video gaming community and the public perception of the industry.&lt;ref name="Straumsheim2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek 2015-05-31" /&gt; ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}}s Laura Parker stated that the Gamergate situation led those outside of the video game industry to be "flooded with evidence of the video-game community as a poisonous and unwelcoming place", furthering any negative views they may have had of video games.&lt;ref name="vanityfair 2015-08-04" /&gt; Independent game developer Andreas Zecher wrote an open letter calling upon the community to take a stand against the attacks, attracting the signatures of more than two thousand professionals within the gaming industry.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; Many in the industry saw the signatures "as proof that the people sending vicious attacks at Quinn and Sarkeesian weren't representative of the video game industry overall".&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt; Writing for ''The Guardian'', Jenn Frank described the tactics used in the harassment campaign and the [[climate of fear]] it generated through its attacks on women and their allies, concluding that this alienating and abusive environment would harm not only women but also the industry as a whole.&lt;ref name=GuardianJF /&gt; Frank herself received significant harassment for writing this article, and announced an intention to quit games journalism as a result.&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt; Games designer Damion Schubert wrote that Gamergate was "an unprecedented {{sic|catastrof**k}}", and that silencing critiques of games harms games developers by depriving them of feedback.&lt;ref name="EscapistSchubertInterview"/&gt; Several video game developers, journalists, and gamers from across various gender, racial, and social backgrounds adopted new Twitter hashtags, such as #INeedDiverseGames, #StopGamergate2014 and #GamersAgainstGamergate, to show solidarity with the people targeted by the harassment and their opposition to the reactionary messages from Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name="salon 2014-12-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans, Janish 2015" /&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] characterized Gamergate as a "magnet for harassment", and notes the possible financial risk for companies dealing with it on social media platforms.&lt;ref name="eff 2015-01-08" /&gt; The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a statement condemning the harassment, stating that "[t]here is no place in the video game community—or our society—for personal attacks and threats".&lt;ref name="wapost esa" /&gt; ESA president Mike Gallagher, speaking at the June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, clarified that the ESA did not become more involved as they felt it was an argument that was outside their industry and their involvement would have been disruptive, but praised the efforts to counter harassment that will benefit the industry in the future.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 2015-06-14" /&gt; At [[BlizzCon]] 2014, [[Blizzard Entertainment]] president and co-founder [[Mike Morhaime]] denounced recent harassment; blaming a "small group of people [who] have been doing really awful things" and "tarnishing our reputation" as gamers. He called on attendees to treat each other with kindness and demonstrate to the world that the community rejects harassment. His statements were widely interpreted as referring to Gamergate.&lt;ref name=CNet /&gt;&lt;ref name=joystiqblizzcon /&gt;&lt;ref name=PCGamerMM /&gt; CEOs of both the American and European branches of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[Shawn Layden]] and Jim Ryan respectively, said the harassment and bullying were absolutely horrific and that such inappropriate behavior would not be tolerated at Sony.&lt;ref name="ibtimes 2015-02-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sony response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venture sony" /&gt; The Swedish Games Industry issued a statement denouncing the harassment and sexism from Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name="GuardianQvist" /&gt;

Responses to Gamergate have encouraged the video game industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them.&lt;ref name="wapo 3 women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate GG2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nightline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune august2015"/&gt; Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a "Diversity in Technology" program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at increasing the number of women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO [[Brian Krzanich]] stated in announcing the program that "it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent".&lt;ref name="Polygon Intel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes Intel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired 2015-01-07" /&gt; [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) COO [[Peter Moore (businessman)|Peter Moore]] said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' "[i]f there's been any benefit to Gamergate,&amp;nbsp;[...] I think it just makes us think twice at times".&lt;ref name="fortune 2015-09-04" /&gt; Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', [[IGDA]] executive director Kate Edwards said, "Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic for a long time now. There's ample evidence of that over and over again... What we're finally seeing is that it became so egregious that now companies are starting to wake up and say, "We need to stop this. This has got to change."&lt;ref name="seattletimes"/&gt;

The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] 2015 included markedly more female protagonists in these new games, as well as more visible presence by women at the event. Some commentators characterized this as a response to Gamergate and a rejection of the misogynistic Gamergate harassment.&lt;ref name="RepresentationStrides" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GamergateFail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BadassCharacters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBTBatman" /&gt;

The game ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' references Gamergate with hashtag, #CrusaderGate, which the [[Riddler]] uses to unsuccessfully try to rally the Internet against Batman; bemoaning its failure, the Riddler describes those who use the hashtag as "idiotic and easily roused rabble".&lt;ref name="ArkhamKnightPolygon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBTBatman" /&gt;

==Gamergate representation in media==
"[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)#Episodes|Intimidation Game]]", an episode of the crime television series ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', portrays a fictionalized version of the Gamergate controversy, including a character whom some observers said resembled Sarkeesian and whose story seemed based on those of women subject to the harassment campaign.&lt;ref name="ars 2015-02-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2015-02-12" /&gt; The 2015 documentary film ''[[GTFO (film)|GTFO]]'' analyzed issues of sexism and harassment in video gaming. The film's director, Shannon Sun-Higginson, stated Gamergate was "a terrible, terrible thing, but it's actually symptomatic of a wider, cultural, systemic problem".&lt;ref name="nytimes 2015-03-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes 2015-03-13" /&gt; The Gamergate situation was covered as part of a larger topic of online harassment of women in the June 21, 2015, episode of ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]''.&lt;ref name="time 2015-06-22" /&gt; The impact of the Gamergate controversy on Brianna Wu was the subject of the March 16, 2016, episode of ''[[The Internet Ruined My Life]]''.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney 2016-03-16" /&gt;

==Reducing online harassment==

In January 2015, Quinn and Alex Lifschitz created the [[Crash Override Network]], a private group of experts who provide free support and counsel to those that have been harassed online, including as a result of Gamergate, and to work with law authorities and social media sites in response to such threats.&lt;ref name="CSM 2015-01-20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verge 2015-01-17" /&gt; Software developer Randi Harper founded a similar group, the [[Online Abuse Prevention Initiative]], a non-profit organization that also seeks to provide aid to those harassed online.&lt;ref name="guardian 2016-04-13" /&gt;

Anita Sarkeesian was named as one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet in March 2015, and later in the magazine's Top 100 Most Influential People of 2015, in recognition of her role in highlighting sexism in the video game community in the wake of the Gamergate controversy.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=53–54}}&lt;ref name="time 2015-03-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time 2015-04-16" /&gt; She was also highlighted as one of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''{{'}}s fifty "Internet's Most Fascinating" in a 2015 list due to her efforts to curb online harassment.&lt;ref name="cosmo"/&gt;

An on-line abuse panel (itself the subject of controversy) at the 2016 [[SXSW]] festival said that there was no technological solution to the problem of harassment given human nature;&lt;ref name="SXSW On-Line Harassment Panel" /&gt; although policy changes have been made, the larger issue is more societal than platform-specific.&lt;ref name="engadetSXSWSummit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RecodeSXSWSummit" /&gt; Referring to the discussion at SXSW in a speech for [[Women's History Month]], [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] said that "We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they're attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes."&lt;ref name="obama" /&gt; Obama urged targets of harassment to speak out, praising the courage of those who had resisted online harassment. "And what's brought these issues to light is that there are a lot of women out there, especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even when they know they'll be attacked for it".&lt;ref name="obama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailydot 2016-03-18"/&gt;

'''Georg Friedrich Meier''' (26 March 1718 – 21 June 1777) was a German philosopher and aesthetician. A follower of [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], he reformed the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] by introducing elements of [[John Locke]]'s empiricist theory of knowledge.&lt;ref name=CHECP&gt;{{Citation | last=Thiel | first=Udo | year=2006 | contribution=Meier, Georg Friedrich | editor-last=Haakonssen | editor-first=Knud | title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=2 | pages=1202–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meier studied philosophy and theology at the [[University of Halle]], where he was a pupil of Baumgarten. Meier succeeded Baumgarten as extraordinary professor, and became a full professor at Halle in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/meier-georg-friedrich-17181777-eoph/ "Meier, Georg Friedrich"], ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Reference, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Harriet Tubman Memorial,''''' also known as '''''Step on Board''''', is located in [[Harriet Tubman Park]] in the [[South End, Boston|South End]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartboston.com/content/step-board-harriet-tubman-memorial|title=Step on Board / Harriet Tubman Memorial » Public Art Boston|website=www.publicartboston.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It honours the life of abolitionist [[Harriet Tubman]]. It was the first memorial erected in Boston to a woman on city-owned property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wgbh.org/basicBlack/episodeDetail.cfm?featureid=8222&amp;rssid=1|title=Basic Black|website=www.wgbh.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial is a 10-foot tall [[bronze]] sculpture by artist [[Fern Cunningham]] and depicts Tubman leading a small group of people. She holds a Bible under her right arm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The figures are backed by a vertical slab, on the reverse of which is a diagram of the route Tubman took when accompanying passengers on the [[Underground Railroad]], and several quotes by and about Tubman.

The inscription on the back of the memorial reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
''Step On Board''
HARRIET ROSS TUBMAN
1820 - 1913

''Go Down Moses, Way Down in Egypt's Land,''
''Tell Old Pharoah - Let My People Go''

''There are two things I've got a right to,''
''and these are death or liberty. One or another''
''I mean to have. No one will take me back alive.''
              &amp;mdash;Harriet Tubman

''The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the''
''witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism.''
              &amp;mdash;[[Frederick Douglass]]

''Tell my brothers to be always watching unto prayer,''
''and when the good old ship of Zion comes along,''
''to be ready to step aboard.''
              &amp;mdash;Harriet Tubman

''She expected deliverance when she prayed,''
''unless the Lord had ordered otherwise.''
              &amp;mdash;[[Sarah Bradford]]
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Harrington College of Design''' (1931–2015) was a [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit college]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] area of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] that closed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrington students settle in at Columbia after college closing|url=http://www.columbiachronicle.com/campus/article_6229d152-93a8-11e5-a66c-9784cd6abc0b.html|website=The Columbia Chronicle|accessdate=2017-08-31|date=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offered students programs leading to either a [[Master's degree|master's]], [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], or [[associate's degree]] upon completion of the [[Interior Design]] Program, [[Digital Photography]] Program, or [[Communication Design]] Program. Each program was credentialed with multiple levels of accreditation. The school was owned by [[Career Education Corporation]].

==History==
The school traced its history to 1931 when [[Frances Harrington]], a practicing interior designer, traveled to Chicago to provide a series of lectures for interior design professionals. She soon found a growing interest in the study of interior design and expanded her offerings by creating the Harrington Institute of Interior Design.

As Harrington Institute grew, Ms. Harrington began providing diplomas to her qualified day division students. When she retired in 1959, her former student Robert Marks assumed leadership of the school. Marks added many programs and degree options to the school's curriculum. Changes in programs, which are now under the guidance of the school's professional Advisory Board, are driven by input from the design industry's professional organizations.&lt;ref name="OEDB"&gt;[http://oedb.org/campus/harrington-college-of-design ''Online Education Database''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118204857/http://oedb.org/campus/harrington-college-of-design |date=January 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Harrington Institute changed its name to Harrington College of Design after being purchased by Career Education Corporation, and proceeded to expand the school's design-related programs of study. The school moved to its current location at 200 W. Madison Street and mandated an annual 20% enrollment increase, which they were able to sustain for a few years until the economy faltered then crashed in 2008.  The campus at 200 W. Madison Street in Chicago closed at the end of the summer semester in August 2015.

==Academics==
Harrington College of Design offered Bachelor's and associate degrees in [[Interior Design]], [[Digital Photography]] and [[Communication Design]]&lt;ref name="educationcenteronline.org"&gt;[http://www.educationcenteronline.org/AllSchools/Harrington-College-of-Design.html Harrington College of Design - Education Center Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502053923/http://www.educationcenteronline.org/AllSchools/Harrington-College-of-Design.html |date=May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accreditation===
Harrington was regionally accredited by [[The Higher Learning Commission]] of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] from January 01 2010 until June 30 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/InstAccrDetails.aspx?756e697469643d3131333039362663616d70757349643d30267264743d372f32302f323031372031323a33313a313320504d|title=U.S. Department of Education Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs|website=ope.ed.gov|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nationally accredited by the [[Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools]] to award associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees. Since the school has both [[regional accreditation]] and [[national accreditation]], most schools will accept their credits in transfer and recognize their degrees for entry into graduate programs.&lt;ref name="demand"&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/10/19/transfer ''Demanding Credit'', Inside Higher Education website, dated October 19, 2005 by Scott Jaschik] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305192541/http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/10/19/transfer |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tussle"&gt;[http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/02/26/transfer ''Tussling Over Transfer of Credit'', Inside Higher Education website, February 26, 2007 by Doug Lederman] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115210406/http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/02/26/transfer |date=January 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;[http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/education/courses/distancelearn-09.html ''What is the Difference Between Regional and National Accreditation'', Yahoo!

Additionally, Harrington was recognized as a private college by the [[Illinois Board of Higher Education]] (IBHE) and was authorized by the IBHE to confer associate, baccalaureate and master's degrees. The Interior Design Program leading to the bachelor of fine arts degree was accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (formerly FIDER). The college was also accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation.

Harrington College of Design’s Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Interior Design was accredited by the [[Council for Interior Design Accreditation]] (formerly FIDER). The Associate of Applied Science Degree in Interior Design was not accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation.&lt;ref name="accreditation"&gt;[http://www.accredit-id.org/accredhistory.html ''Council for Interior Design Accreditation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212151703/http://www.accredit-id.org/accredhistory.html |date=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Harrington had a six-story, {{convert|82000|sqft|m2}} vertical campus located in the [[Chicago Loop]]. Three floors of the campus served as a display space, designed to hold a mix of classrooms, galleries and offices. Harrington also had an extensive library that contains updated digital research for students.

==Organizations==
Harrington College of Design belonged to several organizations:

*'''American Society of Interior Design (ASID) Student Chapter''' — Helps students gain connections with professionals in the design industry.&lt;ref name="ASID"&gt;[https://www.asid.org/studentcenter/Student+Chapter+Schools+by+State.htm ''ASID'', student chapter schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115081207/https://www.asid.org/studentcenter/Student+Chapter+Schools+by+State.htm |date=January 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hidden City''''' is a [[Political cinema|political thriller]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Stephen Poliakoff]]. It starred [[Charles Dance]], Cassie Stuart, [[Richard E. Grant]] and [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]], and was Poliakoff's directorial debut.&lt;ref&gt;'''She's Been Away &amp; Hidden City'', Stephen Poliakoff, Methuen Drama, 1989, page page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a limited theatrical release in 1988, before being shown in [[Channel 4]]'s ''Film on Four'' strand on 9 May 1989 (postponed from 9 March 1989).&lt;ref&gt;''The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide'', [[Kaleidoscope Publishing]], 2010, page 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

Infuriated by receiving the wrong piece of film, statistician James Richards (Dance) arranges for the researcher who made the mistake, Sharon Newton (Stuart), to be sacked. When she realises that he is responsible, Sharon contacts James and demands his help. She has obtained a mysterious piece of film which, while superficially a collection of street scenes, seems to show the abduction of a woman. The film abruptly cuts off, instructing the viewer to see ''The Hedgerows of England''. As this film has been registered classified by the Ministry of Defence, Sharon, obsessed by the identity of the woman, needs James, with his official credentials, to help her find it.

James tracks down the location of the film, but a visit to an old tram depot and an archive beneath Oxford Street proves frustrating, as the film has now been moved. He and Sharon chase it to a landfill site, where they notice a police presence, and then to the incinerator at Edmonton, where they manage to rescue it before it is burned. But upon viewing the film, they find that it is very poor quality, revealing only a dark image of a woman in front of some kind of tribunal. A card at the end tells them that the next film to look for is called ''Hop-Picking in Kent''. James is not entirely unhappy to find his comfortable life disrupted by the search for the film, and wakes up, after a drunken evening spent at a video duplication service, at Sharon's house, where he discovers that she has a young daughter. Needing to go out to work, she leaves her daughter with James.

Taking the baby out to meet his ex-wife, James is cornered by two officials, who beat him up and demand to know the whereabouts of something he has found. Shaken, he goes to see his City friend Anthony (Paterson), who advises him to go home and forget about it. But Anthony also drops a hint that he too has been questioned, and James realises that he is in serious danger. Returning to his house, he finds it has been searched and realises that the officials want some medical records which he idly picked up from the landfill site. After an unexpected encounter with them, James manages to escape and is reunited with a distressed Sharon, who has been worried about her daughter.

Meanwhile, a friend of Sharon's does some illicit searching for her in the archives and discovers the film ''Hop-Picking In Kent''. Within the bland information film is a full version of the mysterious film, featuring a different woman along with a man. Some kind of emergency has occurred and left the participants dead. Moving forward in time, the film documents the birth of an abruptly aborted government project named Magnificat. The women from the original film then reappears, sitting in a location which James recognises: an official building which has re-opened as a café. The film ends with the woman reunited with a horribly scarred man and confronting the cameraman, asking why he is filming. James suggests that this was the result of an accident with nuclear power which has been hushed up and that the café was once a secure convalescent unit. He also wonders why the film was made in the first place. James and Sharon decide to keep the film secret and he throws the offending medical records into a bin. Meanwhile, somewhere in London, a cleaner has her break in an isolated room where the remnants of Project Magnificat are still stored.

The '''Hypogeum of Yarhai''' is a [[hypogeum]] (underground tomb) from the ancient Syrian city of [[Palmyra]] which flourished in the second and third centuries AD. It is considered one of the finest examples of Palmyrene funerary art. It's a mass grave which was built to contain the remains of the Yarhai family who commissioned it to be built in 108 AD.&lt;ref name=darke&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jv2jHT_GRe0C|title=Syria|last=Darke|first=Diana|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jv2jHT_GRe0C&amp;pg=PA113 113]|year=2010|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841623146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypogeum dates back from 108 AD. It was originally located in Palmyra's Valley of the Tombs before being excavated and restored.&lt;ref name="roughguide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citebook|title=Rome in the East: The Transformation of an Empire|first1=Warwick|last1=Ball|year=2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hblTDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq|isbn=9781317296355}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then moved to [[Damascus]] in 1935 and was later placed in its [[National Museum of Damascus|national museum]].&lt;ref name="roughguide"/&gt;

Characteristic of most Palmyrene monuments, the ornate hypogeum is made of pale yellow [[limestone]],&lt;ref name=darke/&gt; and is sealed by two monolithic doors.&lt;ref name=darke/&gt; At its center is a depiction of the deceased presiding over a funerary banquet to sustain them in their afterlie,&lt;ref name=darke/&gt; while surrounding them, the walls display a set of [[Palmyrene funerary reliefs|funerary reliefs]], characteristic of the city of Palmyra, depicting the members of the Yarhai family, with its women partly veiled to represent death,&lt;ref name=darke/&gt;&lt;ref name="roughguide"&gt;{{Citebook|title=The Rough Guide to Syria|first1=Andrew|last1=Beattie|first2=Timothy|last2=Pepper|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iCfkTe8v2EC|isbn=9781858287188}}&lt;/ref&gt; to seal the compartment shelves which contained their bodies.&lt;ref name=darke/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15988">The Indonesian New Art Movement ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru'') was an [[art movement]] of young artists from [[Bandung]] and [[Yogyakarta]] against the institutional concept of Indonesian [[fine art]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Seni Rupa'') being limited to [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s. The movement emerged in 1974, first organised in a protest against the judging of the Second Jakarta Painting Bienalle which awarded prizes to decorative style of paintings and sculptures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asian Modernism: Diverse Development in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand|last=Tatehata|first=Akira|publisher=The Japan Foundation Asia Centre|year=1995|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters published the Black December Statement (''Desember Hitam'') criticising the lack of social and political consciousness in Indonesian decorative art practices.

The "new art" championed [[Installation art|installations]], [[Found object|ready-mades]], [[photograph]]s, [[Found object|found-objects]] and [[Photorealism|photo-realist paintings]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which translate to the experimentation of different mediums and mixed media in Indonesian [[contemporary art]]. In 1987, a [[manifesto]] was written by key figures of the New Art Movement titled "Fine Art of Emancipation, Emancipation of Fine Art."

The New Art Movement ended in 1989 and is considered the beginning of Indonesian [[contemporary art]].

== History ==
In 1974, a group of young artists emerged calling themselves the New Art Movement. The movement was first and foremost an academic rebellion towards fine arts universities in Bandung and Yogyakarta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whiteboardjournal.com/interview/21051/art-history-and-policies-with-jim-supangkat/|title=Art &amp; Curation with Jim Supangkat {{!}} Whiteboardjournal|website=www.whiteboardjournal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting the institution's definition of fine art that was limited to decorative art, paintings and sculptures.

The New Art Movement arose spontaneously in both Yogyakarta and Bandung, the two groups having little contact with each other. It was the art critic Sanento Yuliman, a teacher at [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: Institut Teknologi Bandung or ITB), who noticed the [[Antimodernist|anti-modernist]] tendency common between the two. He then joined them together under the name New Art Movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The movement first began in a protest against the judging of the Second Jakarta Painting Biennale of 1974, which awarded prizes to decorative styles of paintings. Protesters consisting of young artists from Bandung and Yogyakarta published the ''Black December Statement'' criticising the lack of social and political consciousness in decorative art, and declaring that it was indicative of the lack of creativity in Indonesian art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Artists of the New Art Movement perceived decorative art as elitist and centralised on Western-derive [[aesthetics]], which they claim were irrelevant to both Indonesia's traditional arts and to the issues of contemporary society. They wanted a more democratic and accessible art, in [[List of art mediums|medium]] and in style.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=‘Artist Roles and Meaning in Modern Indonesian Painting’ in Modernity in Asian Art|last=Wright|first=Astri|publisher=Wild Peony|year=1993|isbn=|location=Sydney|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1977, after the first Exhibition of the New Art Movement in [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]], it was clear that the movement was against any narrow definition of art. They claimed that the existing rigid definition of [[fine art]] hindered the development of [[contemporary art]] and creativity in Indonesia. The movement emphasised the importance of redefining art and its purpose, supporting the basis for its name: "new art"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title='The Two Forms of Indonesian Art' in Modern Indonesian Art: Three Generations of Tradition and Change 1945-1990|last=Supangkat|first=Jim|publisher=Festival of Indonesia|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement's exhibitions in 1975-1980 and in 1987-1989 introduced artworks other than [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s, championing [[Installation art|installations]], [[Found object|ready-mades]], [[photograph]]s, [[Found object|found-objects]] and [[Photorealism|photo-realist paintings.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 2 May 1987, a [[manifesto]] was published by key figures of the New Art Movement titled "Fine Art of Emancipation, Emancipation of Fine Art."

The New Art Movement ended in 1989 and is considered the beginning of Indonesian contemporary art. Notable figures of the movement include [[Jim Supangkat]], the art historian Sanento Yuliman, [[Dede Eri Supria]], Dadang Christanto and FX Harsono.

== Black December Statement ==

On 31 December 1974, Muryotohartoyo, Juzwar, Harsono, B. Munni Ardhi, M. Sulebar, Ris Purwana, Daryono, Adiyati, D.A. Peransi, Baharuddin Marasutan, Ikranegara, Adri Darmadji, Hardi and Abdul Hadi WM, presented the Black December Statement.

The statement critiques Indonesia's lack of clear cultural strategy in art making, and that the producers of arts and culture are not in the smallest sense aware of the discourse regarding the most basic human problems in Indonesian culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ivaa-online.org/files/uploads/texts/Black%20December%201974%20Statement.pdf|title=Black December 1974 Statement|last=|first=|date=|website=Indonesian Visual Art Archive (IVAA)|archive-url=http://archive.ivaa-online.org/|archive-date=2015|dead-url=|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black December statements are as follow:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. That the diversity of Indonesian painting is a reality that may not be denied, nonetheless this diversity does not in itself show healthy development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. That in order to guarantee a sustainable cultural development painters are beckoned to provide spiritual directions that are based on the values of humanity, and are oriented to the realities of social life and political-economic culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. That creativity is the destiny of painters that go through whatever means possible in order to arrive at new perspectives for Indonesian painting. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;4. That therefore the identity of Indonesian painting has an immediate and clear existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;5. That what creates dead-end for the development of Indonesian painting to this day is old and over-used concepts, that are still held on to by the establishment, arts and cultural producers and established artists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Note: The Black December Statement is translated from [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]] to [[English language|English]] in 2015 after the collaborative efforts of the Indonesian Visual Art Archive (IVAA) and Asia Art Archive.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Manifesto ==

Thirteen years after the Black December Statement was presented, the New Art Movement published a [[manifesto]] titled "Fine Art of Emancipation, Emancipation of Fine Art." The manifesto was presented in [[Jakarta]] on 2 May 1987.

The manifesto states three key proclamations:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/CollectionOnline/Details/47629|title=Manifesto Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru 1987: Fine Art of Emancipation, Emancipation of Fine Art|last=|first=|date=|website=Asia Art Archive|archive-url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/|archive-date=2015|dead-url=|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Fine art needs emancipation. Expression of visual art should prioritise the deconstruction of misunderstood traditions of fine art. Rational visual art expression should prioritise statements based on the aesthetics of emancipation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. A redefinition of fine art is required, to free it from the definition rooted in ''artes-liberals – ''seek a new definition which can accommodate every expression of visual art.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. Emancipation of encultured thought is required to counter isolated points of view that only acknowledge one notion of art, and only one global society within a unified harmonious culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The movement also made an explicit statement in relation to the third proclamation:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"In addition to a new definition, development of Indonesian contemporary art also needed basic aesthetic thinking and a study of art history to replace the cultural identity debate and East-West confrontation"''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The manifesto was deemed successful in the way [[Installation art|installation]] and [[conceptual art]] becomes immersive in modern Indonesian art compared to the few previous attempts which had no [[manifesto]] to back them up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Style and Development ==
The "new art" primarily consists of [[Installation art|installations]], [[Found object|ready-mades]], [[photograph]]s, [[Found object|found-objects]] and [[Photorealism|photo-realist paintings]].

=== Development ===

The New Art Movement was [[Antimodernist|anti-modernist]]. It rejected [[Modern art|modern art's]] purity of expression, the individualism of the artist, and the tendency toward the decorative as the highest form of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Supangkat|first=Jim|date=|title=Indonesian Contemporary Art: a Continuation|url=|journal=Potential of Asian Thought|volume=|pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the movement developed, the works of New Art artists began to take on the character of [[Installation art|installations]] and collaborative practices.

In an arguably [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] approach, the movement also aims to tear down the barrier between [[High culture|high art]] and [[Low culture|low art]]. The interest of the New Art artists in low art was closely linked to the problems of [[poverty]] in the city and maintenance of traditional culture in rural regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Style and Concept ===
The style and [[concept]] of New Art artists are characteristically different to contemporary Indonesian art in the present day, which consists of [[Post-Suharto era|post-reformasi]] artists known most commonly as ''Generation 2000''. Although the [[Installation art|installation]] and [[Mixed media|mixed-media]] format of this newer generation of artists is heavily influenced by the New Art Movement, their concerns are significantly different.

New Art artists experience politics in a more strident environment before the end of the Suharto regime, which strongly inform their art practice.  In such ways, artists like FX Harsono and Dadang Christanto comment on specific tragedies in Indonesian history most notably the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966]]. Many of the New Art artists emphasised [[social criticism]] in their works.

Contemporary readings and studies of the New Art Movement propose that [[Memory|memories]] are central to the works of these artists. Their works become a site of remembrance, recollections of the past, and reconciliation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kengerian tak terucapkan/The Unspeakable Horror|last=Wiyanto|first=Hendro|publisher=Bentara Budaya Jakarta|year=2002|isbn=|location=Jakarta|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that reference the power struggle of the 'common people', the marginalised, and the severe consequences of socio-political tensions that occurred in that time.

== Issues and Debates ==
The New Art Movement was often criticised by the conservative art establishment as a derivative to [[Pop art|Pop Art]], although leading New Art artist FX Harsono claims that the artists were more interested in [[Neo-Dada]] than Pop Art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This conversation with the West, presented in a rather revolutionary manner by New Art artists, returns to the modernist debate about East-West confrontation in art of developing countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the interest of '[[national identity]]', the New Art Movement was criticised to have championed avant-garde mediums and concepts of [[Art of Europe|Western art history]] instead of embracing the nation's traditional values that makes it characteristically "Indonesian." The movement tackled this issue by emphasising the importance of basic [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] thinking and a study of [[art history]] to replace the cultural identity debate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Also critical to the progression of the New Art Movement is clarifying the positions of contemporary art and traditional art. Artists and critics responds to this struggle by claiming that "traditional art is not something of the past, but is still alive and evolves like contemporary art."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, New Art artists sought to merge the two art forms in their contemporary art practice.

In the latter part of the 1980s, the New Art Movement concluded that "art is a plural concept,"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; embracing installations as its primary/hybrid format in ending the East-West confrontation debates and claiming the inter-relationship of contemporary and traditional art.

The issues and methods involved in the New Art movement play an important part in the great interest on cultural identity that emerged in Indonesia in the 1980s, and continue to inform the practice of contemporary art in the present day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Sonia Delaunay, Blaise Cendrars, 1913, La Prose du Transsibérien et de la petite Jehanne de France, illustrated book with watercolor applied through pochoir and relief print on paper, 200 x 35.6 cm, Princeton University Art Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], 1913, ''La Prose du Transsibérien et de la petite Jehanne de France'', illustrated book with watercolor applied through pochoir and relief print on paper, 200 x 35.6 cm, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]
'''''La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France''''' (Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France) is a collaborative [[Artist's book|artists' book]] by [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[Sonia Delaunay-Terk]]. The book features a poem by Cendrars about a journey through [[Russia]] on the [[Trans-Siberian Express]] in 1905, during the first [[Russian Revolution (1905)|Russian Revolution]], interlaced with an almost-abstract [[pochoir]] print by Delaunay-Terk. The work, published in 1913, is considered a milestone in the evolution of artist's books&lt;ref&gt;The Century of Artists' Books, Drucker, Granary, 1994, p50&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[modernist poetry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grasslimb.com/sallis/GlobeColumns/globe.07.cendrars.html James Sallis, Boston Globe]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[abstract art]].

The publisher of a 2008 reprint of the book has called it "one of the most beautiful books ever created".&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300141894 Yale University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Cendrars himself referred to the work as ‘a sad poem printed on sunlight’.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Prose du Transsibérien, Chris Michaelides, British Library Podcast transcribed [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/breakingtherules/images/btrtranssiberien.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cendrars and the New Man Press==
Blaise Cendrars was the nom-de-plume for Fréderic Louis Sauser, a play on Braise (ember) and Cendres (ash); 'writing is being burned alive, but it also means being reborn from the ashes'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.nl/en/themes/koopman-collection/le-panama-ou-les-aventures-de-mes-sept-oncles-poeme Quoted in Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Netherlands Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Switzerland, at 15 he had run away from home  to train as an apprentice jeweller in [[St Petersburg]], but continued to travel, including an important stay in New York where he wrote his first major poem ''Les Pâques à New York'', 1912, before settling in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parisreview.org/media/4388_CENDRARS.pdf Interview with Cendrars, 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110012434/http://parisreview.org/media/4388_CENDRARS.pdf |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in [[Paris]], he started a small press, ''Éditions des Hommes Nouveaux'' (New Man Editions) with the help of an anarchist who owned a clandestine printing press at the Mouzaïa Quarter, 19th arrondissement. His first edition, 125 copies of ''Les Pâques à New York'', was published October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parisreview.org/media/4388_CENDRARS.pdf Interview with Blaise Cendrars, Paris Review, p15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110012434/http://parisreview.org/media/4388_CENDRARS.pdf |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite failing to sell a single copy, he pressed ahead with the second book, ''La prose du Transsibérien'', published June 1913 (see [[1913 in poetry]]). Intended as an edition of 150, only 60 copies were printed, of which about 30 are thought to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Enrichement de la Bibliotheque nationale 1961-73, quoted in Sims Reed Rare Books, Dada Futurism etc, 2008 p40&lt;/ref&gt; The book, a series of 4 sheets glued together in an accordion-style binding, measures 199&amp;nbsp;cm tall when unfolded; the height of all 150 end to end would have equalled the height of the [[Eiffel Tower]], a potent symbol of modernity at the time, and referenced in both the poem and the print.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The poem] describes the 16-year old poet’s epic, perhaps imaginary, train journey from Moscow to Harbin (in Mongolia) during the Russo-Japanese War and the Russian Revolution of 1905. The route is shown on the contemporary map printed at the top right of the sheet. It is a long, oppressive ride through Russia with apocalyptic scenes of war and revolution, and descriptions of cold, hunger, death and devastation which worsen as the train follows its eastward course and are punctuated by the repeated, melancholy question of Jehanne, the poet's companion, "Dis Blaise, sommes nous bien loin de Montmartre?" (Blaise, are we very far from Montmartre?')"  Chris Michaelides&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/breakingtherules/images/btrtranssiberien.pdf Podcast by Chris Michaelides, British Library, transcribed at]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book is an early example of the deliberate use of multiple [[fonts]] - twelve in all - in different sizes and colours to suggest movement and differing moods, contemporaneous to similar experiments by the [[Futurism|Italian futurists]]. It is also unusual for 'defying the [[codex]] form'&lt;ref&gt;The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary, 1995 p51&lt;/ref&gt; and for placing the images on an equal footing to the text; they run parallel and complementary to the text, rather than as illustrative or decorative additions.

==Simultaneity and the Parisian Avant-Garde==
[[File:Trans-SiberianProse.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France'' 1913]]
[[File:Transsiberien.jpg|thumb|The last section of ''La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France'' featuring the Eiffel Tower, 1913]]
It was through [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], a mutual friend, that Cendrars was to meet Sonia and her husband [[Robert Delaunay]], members of the Parisian avant-garde, leading exponents of [[cubism]], and inventors of the term ''Simultaneity''.

The Delaunays had coined the word from their study of [[Michel-Eugène Chevreul|Chevreul's]] laws of simultaneous contrast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmEDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA150&amp;dq=The+Chevreul+Illusion&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPA3-IA1,M2 Chevreul's Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colours]&lt;/ref&gt; This new style had first appeared in April 1912 with Robert Delaunay's series of paintings of ''Fenêtres'' (Windows) followed closely by Sonia's abstract ''Contrastes Simultanés'' and was boldly taken up by both husband and wife for the rest of their careers. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The intensity of the colour field is heightened in accordance with the law of simultaneous contrast: orange seen next to green becomes more red, while green seen next to orange appears more blue. These constant two-way influences create an unusual vibration in the eye of the viewer. Delaunay read this phenomenon as movement and rhythm and understood it as the painting appropriate to a modern society in motion."&lt;ref&gt;Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Düchting, Taschen 1994, p35&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The series of ''Windows'', with their use of the Eiffel Tower as the central theme, were a direct influence on Sonia's contributions to the poem; again, the eye was supposed to move between elements of the picture and the words creating a sensation of speed and disorientation that echoed the poem's theme of travel. The book is contained in a wrapper which declares it the "first simultaneous book'. It also contains a map of Siberia at the beginning of the book, showing the route of the train journey.

==Reception of the Book==

When published, the book was to cause a sensation in the avant-garde circles in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Düchting, Taschen 1994, p38&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, of the surviving copies are now held by major museums and libraries, including the [[V&amp;A]], [[Tate Modern]], [[MoMA]], the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Swiss National Library]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Swiss National Library]].

'''Sona''' (sing. Lusona) drawing is an [[Ideogram|ideographic]] tradition known across eastern [[Angola]], northwestern [[Zambia]] and adjacent areas of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and is mainly practiced by the [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] and [[Luchazi language|Luchazi]] people.{{sfn|Gerhard Kubik|2006|p=1}} These ideographs function as [[Mnemonic|mnemonic devices]] to record proverbs, fables, games, riddles and animals, and to transmit knowledge.&lt;ref name="Elsevier BV 1991 pp. 198–198"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On mathematical elements in the Tchokwe "Sona" tradition Gerdes, Paulus. 1990. For the Learning of Mathematics10(1), 31–34 | journal=Historia Mathematica | volume=18 | issue=2 | year=1991 | issn=0315-0860 | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(91)90542-6 | url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4273355/FID840/eqtyres/erg/111361/1361.htm | pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

According to ethnologist [[Gerhard Kubik]], this tradition must be ancient and certainly pre-colonial, as observers independently collected the same ideographs among peoples separated for generations. Additionally, early [[petroglyphs]] from the [[Zambezi|Upper Zambezi]] area in Angola and Citundu-Hulu in the [[Moçâmedes Desert]] exhibit structural similarities with lusona ideographs.{{sfn|Gerhard Kubik|2006|p=229}} Those petroglyphs date from a period between the 6th century BC and the 1st-century BC.{{sfn|José Redinha|1948}}

== Usage ==

Sona ideographs are sometimes used as murals, and most of the time executed in the sand. To make them, drawing experts — after cleaning and smoothing the ground — would impress equidistant dots and draw a continuous line between them. The dots can represent trees, persons or animals, while the lines can represent paths, rivers, fences, walls, contours of a body, etc.&lt;ref name="Hodder2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=I. Hodder|title=The Meanings of Things: Material Culture and Symbolic Expression|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0cVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213|date=12 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-76232-4|page=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical properties ==

The mathematical ideas exhibited by those ideographs are [[Transformation geometry|transformational geometry]], [[abstract algebra]] and linear algebra. 80% are symmetric and 60% are mono-linear.&lt;ref name="NessFarenga2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Ness|author2=Stephen J. Farenga|author3=Salvatore G. Garofalo|title=Spatial Intelligence: Why It Matters from Birth through the Lifespan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HC8lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=12 May 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-53118-0|page=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an example of the use of a coordinate system and geometric algorithms.&lt;ref name="Elsevier BV 1991 pp. 198–198"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On mathematical elements in the Tchokwe "Sona" tradition Gerdes, Paulus. 1990. For the Learning of Mathematics10(1), 31–34 | journal=Historia Mathematica | volume=18 | issue=2 | year=1991 | issn=0315-0860 | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(91)90542-6 | url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4273355/FID840/eqtyres/erg/111361/1361.htm | pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geometric algorithms ===

Sona drawings can be classified by the algorithms used for their construction. Paulus Gerdes identified six algorithms, most commonly the "plaited-mat" algorithm, which seems to have been inspired by mat weaving.{{sfn|Paulus Gerdes|1999|p=163-167}}

=== Chaining rules and theorems ===

Various studies suggest that the drawing experts knew specific rules of "chaining" and "elimination" relating to the systematic construction of monolinear figures. Studies suggest that the "drawing experts" who invented these rules knew why they were valid, and could prove in one way or another the validity of the theorems that these rules express.&lt;ref name="Gerdes 1994 pp. 345–376"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerdes | first=Paulus | title=On mathematics in the history of Sub-Saharan Africa | journal=Historia Mathematica | volume=21 | issue=3 | year=1994 | issn=0315-0860 | doi=10.1006/hmat.1994.1029 | page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to find accounts of theorems developed by the drawing experts to generalize specific patterns relating to dimension and monolinearity/polylinearity,&lt;ref name="NessFarenga2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Ness|author2=Stephen J. Farenga|author3=Salvatore G. Garofalo|title=Spatial Intelligence: Why It Matters from Birth through the Lifespan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HC8lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56|date=12 May 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-53118-0|page=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this tradition was secret and in extinction when it started to be recorded.

However, the drawing experts possibly knew that rectangles with relatively prime dimensions give one-line drawings. This idea is supported by the fact that of the 30 smallest relatively prime rectangular shapes, 75% appears among the documented drawings. It is further possible that they knew that if a square of a dot is added to a one-line lusona, the lusona would still be mono-linear. It seems clear that they had experimentally discovered this fact for 2 X 2 squares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.beloit.edu/computerscience/faculty/chavey/sona/ |title=Sona Geometry |last=Chavey |first=Darrah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manjusha.jpg|200px|thumb|Manjusha Box used in Snake Festival]]
'''Manjushas''' are an [[India]]n art form.  They are temple-shaped boxes comprising eight pillars. They are made of bamboo, jute and paper. They also contains paintings of [[Hindu]] gods and goddesses and other characters. These boxes are used in Bishahari puja, a festival dedicated to the Snake God that is celebrated in [[Bhagalpur]] and nearby regions, India.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Importance==
Manjusha Art is and ancient and historically significant art form, considered on a par with Madhubani art.  Manjusha Art or Manjusha Kala is often referred to as [[Snake Paintings]] by foreigners as swirling snakes in the art depict the central character Bihula's tale of love and sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =The Internationally recognised famous Indian Art related to Ang region | url=http://manjushaart.rediffblogs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study on Manjusha Art &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Manjusha Art: Reflections in Folk Lore, Trade and Regional History|  first1=Rajiva Kumar |last1=Sinha |first2=O.P. |last2=Pandey |publisher=Shivalik Prakashan |location= Delhi |oclc=811492081}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an excellent example of how this art reflects the history of ancient Anga Mahajanapada.

== Characteristic of Manjusha Art ==
* Three colors are used in Manjusha Art

On April 8, 2000, Mark Hogancamp was attacked outside of a bar by five men who beat him nearly to death after he told them he was a cross-dresser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Green |first=Penelope |date=2011-04-06 |title=In a Tiny Universe, Room to Heal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/garden/07marwencol.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After nine days in a coma and forty days in the hospital, Hogancamp was discharged with brain damage that left him little memory of his previous life. Unable to afford therapy, he creates his own by building a 1/6-scale [[World War II]]-era [[Belgian]] town in his yard and populating it with dolls representing himself, his friends, and even his attackers.  He calls that town "[[Marwencol]]," blending the names "Mark," "Wendy" and "Colleen."

Hogancamp was initially discovered by photographer David Naugle, who documented and shared his story with [[Esopus (magazine)|''Esopus'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esopusmag.com/archivesubright.php?Id=3199&amp;pID=3014|title=Marwencol on My Mind|last=Hogancamp|first=Mark|date=Fall 2005|website=[[Esopus (magazine)|Esopus]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511082836/http://www.esopusmag.com/archivesubright.php?Id=3199&amp;pID=3014|archive-date=2006-05-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then his work was shown in a [[New York City|New York]] [[Contemporary art gallery|art gallery]].

==In popular culture==
In 2013, [[Robert Zemeckis]] began work on a dramatization of the story for [[Universal Studios]] based on a script by Caroline Thompson.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/&gt; ''[[Welcome to Marwen]]'' is set to be released in December 2018, starring [[Steve Carell]] as Hogancamp.&lt;ref name="variety.com"/&gt;

'''Mathura art''' refers to a particular school of [[Buddhist art]], which centered on the city of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern [[India]], during the period in which [[Buddhism]] flourished in India. The art of Mathura is usually contrasted with the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]]. In particular there is a debate about the origin of the Buddha image and the role played by each school of art. Before the creation of an image of the Buddha, probably around the 1st century CE, Indian Buddhist art had essentially been [[aniconic]], avoiding representation of the Buddha, but rather relying on its symbols, such as the [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Law]] or the [[Bodhi tree]]. 

==Early history==
[[File:Yaksha Parkham Mathura with detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Manibhadra|Parkham Yaksha]] (2nd-1st century BCE). The hem of the dress is sometimes considered as derived from Greek art. Describing a similar statue, John Boardman writes: "It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism". According to Boardman these folds are also similar to those of the [[Bharhut]] Yavana [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bharhut_Yavana.jpg].&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman, "The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity", Princeton University Press, 1993, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;]]
===Mauryan and Indo-Greek rule===
Mathura was an important city of central northern [[India]] for the [[Maurya Empire]], whose capital was in eastern India at [[Pataliputra]]. [[Mauryan art]] flourished during that period. Following the demise of the Mauryan Empire and its replacement by the [[Sunga Empire]], numismatic, literary and epigraphic evidence suggest that the [[Indo-Greek]]s, when they invaded India, occupied the area of Mathura for close to a century from the time of [[Menander I]] until approximately 70 BCE, with the Sungas remaining eastward of Mathura. From numismatic, literary and epigraphic evidence, it seems that the [[Indo-Greeks]] had control over [[Mathura]] at some time, especially during the rule of [[Menander I]] (165-135 BC).&lt;ref name="Rhie"&gt;History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.8-10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC&amp;pg=PA8]&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription in Mathura discovered in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Published in "L'Indo-Grec Menandre ou Paul Demieville revisite," Journal Asiatique 281 (1993) p.113&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Yavanarajya inscription]], mentions "The last day of year 116 of Yavana hegemony (''Yavanarajya'')", suggesting the presence of the Indo-Greeks in the 2nd-1st century BC in Mathura down to 70 or 69 BC.&lt;ref name="Rhie"/&gt; On the contrary, the [[Sungas]], are known to have been absent from Mathura (no epigraphical or coin remains) and only located eastward of the Mathura region.&lt;ref name="Rhie"/&gt;

====The Parkham Yaksha (2nd-1st century BCE)====
Some of the earliest works of art of the Mathura school are the [[Yaksha]]s, monumental sculptures of earth divinities that have been dated to the 2nd-1st century BCE, possibly starting during the time of the Mauryas or after. These Yakshas, such as the [[Manibhadra|Parkham Yaksha]], although essentially Indian in style, usually suggest some Hellenistic influence, such as the geometrical folds of the drapery or the walking stance of the statues. The Parkham Yaksha is datable to period 200 BCE – 50 BC&lt;ref&gt;Costumes &amp; Ornaments As Depicted in the Early Sculpture of Gwalior Museum By Sulochana Ayyar, Mittal Publications, 1 December 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; According to Upinder Singh, the statue is 2.59 meters high. On stylistic grounds it should be dated to the 2nd/1st century BC, but an inscription in Brahmi suggest a 3rd century BC date. The inscription says "Made by Gomitaka, a pupil of Kunika. Set up by eight brothers, members of the Manibhadra congregation ("puga")." This inscription thus indicates that the statue represents the Yaksa [[Manibhadra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA365 "A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12 the century" by Upinder Singh p.365]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]], the hem of the dress is derived from Greek art. Describing a similar statue, John Boardman writes: "It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism". Similar folds can be seen in the Bharhut Yavana.&lt;ref&gt; [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bharhut_Yavana.jpg Bharut Yavana] (John Boardman, "The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity", Princeton University Press, 1993, p.112.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Scythian rule===
[[File:MathuraLionCapital.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Mathura lion capital]], 1st century CE.]]
From around 70 BCE, the region of Mathura fell to Indian rulers of the [[Mitra dynasty]] and then to the [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Northern Satraps]] under Rajuvula. Little is known precisely from that period on terms of artistic creation. The Indo-Scythian [[Rajuvula]], ruler of Mathura, created coins which were copies of the [[Indo-Greek]] ruler [[Strato II]], with effigy of the king and representation of [[Athena]] on the obverse. 

====The Mathura lion capital (1st century CE)====
Rajuvula is also known for the famous [[Mathura lion capital]] which records events of the Indo-Scythian dynasty as well as their support of Buddhism. It is also an interesting example of the state of artistic attainment in the city of Mathura at the turn of our era. The capital portrays two lions reminiscent of the lions of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], but in a much cruder style. It also displays at its center a Buddhist [[triratana]] symbol, further confirming the involvement of Indo-Scythian rulers with Buddhism. The triratna is contained in a [[flame palmette]], an element of Hellenistic iconography, and an example of [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art]].

Mathura then became the capital of the [[Kushan Empire]] from around 30 CE. 

====Bodhisattva statues (2nd century CE)====
One dated example of statuary from that period is the [[Bala Bodhisattva]], which, although not from Mathura but from [[Sarnath]] clearly describes the state of artistic attainment under the rule of Kushan ruler Kanishka. The Bala Boddhisattva is also nearly identical in style with other known statues from Mathura but definitely dated with an inscription as is the case for the Bala Boddhisattva.

The style of these statues is somewhat reminiscent of the earlier monumental [[Yaksha]] statues, usually dated to a few centuries earlier. On the contrary, despite other known instances of [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art]], very little, if anything at all can be seen in this type of statue. Especially the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]] seems to have had little to no influence.&lt;ref&gt;Origin of the Buddha Image, June Coomaraswamy, p.300-301 [http://www.tepotech.com/Art_Bulletin/192794JuneCoomaraswamyOriginoftheBuddhaImage.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Buddha coinage (Circa 130 CE)====
[[File:Kanishka Buddha detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Depiction of the [[Buddha]] (with legend ΒΟΔΔΟ "Boddo") in Kanishka's coinage.]]
From his capital of Mathura or alternatively from the capital of his territories of the northwest, [[Peshawar]], [[Kanishka]] issued the first known representation of the [[Buddha]] on a coin, and actually the first known representation of the Buddha that can be dated precisely, in this case, to the reign of Kanishka (127–150 CE). The [[Bimaran casket]] is usually dated to 50 CE, but with less certainty than the Kanishka coin.

Only six Kushan coins of the Buddha are known in gold (the sixth one is the centerpiece of an ancient piece of jewellery, consisting of a Kanishka Buddha coin decorated with a ring of heart-shaped ruby stones). All these coins were minted in gold under Kanishka I, and are in two different denominations: a [[dinar]] of about 8 gm, roughly similar to a Roman [[aureus]], and a quarter dinar of about 2 gm. (about the size of an [[obol (coin)|obol]]). The Buddha is represented wearing the monastic robe, the ''[[antaravasaka]]'', the ''[[uttarasanga]]'', and the overcoat ''[[sanghati]]''. In general, the representation of the Buddha on these coins is already highly symbolic, and quite distinct from the more naturalistic and Hellenistic images seen in early Gandhara sculptures. On several designs a mustache is apparent. The palm of his right hand bears the [[Chakra]] mark, and his brow bear the [[urna]]. An [[aureola]], formed by one, two or three lines, surrounds him. The full gown worn by the Buddha on the coins, covering both shoulders, suggests a Gandharan model rather than a Mathuran one, and the style is clearly Hellenistic.

Kanishka also issued other types of Buddhist coinage, representation a "Shakyamuni Buddha" standing and walking, as well as a seated "Maitreya Buddha". It should be noted however that Maitreya is a [[Bodhisattva]] and not a [[Buddha]] according to the Buddhist cannon.

====The Mathura standing Buddha====
[[File:Buddha in Abhaya Mudra - Circa 2nd Century CE - ACCN 00-A-4 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-23 5692.JPG|thumb|A Mathura standing Buddha, [[Mathura Museum]]]]
The Mathura standing Buddha seems to be a slightly later development compared to the Bodhisattvas of the type of the [[Bala Bodhisattva]]. Although several are dated to the 2nd century CE, they often tend to display characteristics of [[Gupta Empire|Gupta art]], especially with the very thin dress seemingly sticking to the body of the Buddha. These statues of the Buddha however tend to display characteristic and attitudes more readily seen in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]]: the head of the Buddha is surrounded by a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the clothing covers both shoulders, the left hand hold the gown of the Buddha while the other hand form an [[Mudra|Abbhiya mudra]], and the folds in the clothing are more typical of the Gandharan styles.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"&gt;Hellenism in Ancient India, Gauranga Nath Banerjee, p.96-98 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mCtKn4J1n38C&amp;pg=PA97]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many respect, the standing Buddha of Mathura seems to be a combination of the local sculptural tradition initiated by the [[Yaksha]]s with the Hellenistic designs of the Buddhas from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of Gandhara.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt;

====Other sculptural works====
The Mathura sculptures incorporate many Hellenistic elements, such as the general idealistic realism, and key design elements such as the curly hair, and folded garment. 

[[File:Life of the Buddha Mathura.jpg|thumb|left|A Mathura relief showing the complete life of the Buddha, from birth to death. The clothing is Gandharan.]]
Specific Mathuran adaptations tend to reflect warmer climatic conditions, as they consist in a higher fluidity of the clothing, which progressively tend to cover only one shoulder instead of both. Also, facial types also tend to become more Indianized. Banerjee in ''Hellenism in ancient India'' describes "the mixed character of the Mathura School in which we find on the one hand, a direct continuation of the old Indian art of [[Barhut]] and [[Sanchi]] and on the other hand, the classical influence derived from Gandhara".&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, ''Hellenism in ancient India''&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases however, a clear influence from the art of Gandhara can also be felt, as in the case of the Hellenistic statue of [[Herakles]] strangling the [[Nemean lion]], discovered in Mathura, and now in the [[Kolkota]] [[Indian Museum]], as well as [[Bacchanalian]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Aspects of Indian Art, by J.E.

[[Hindu art]] started to develop from the 1st to the 2nd century CE and found its first inspiration in the Buddhist art of Mathura. It progressively incorporated a profusion of original Hindu stylistic and symbolic elements however, in contrast with the general balance and simplicity of Buddhist art.

The art of Mathura features frequent sexual imagery. Female images with bare breasts, nude below the waist, displaying labia and female genitalia are common. These images are more sexually explicit than those of earlier or later periods.

[[File:Cammarano-self portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1887)]]
'''Michele Cammarano''' (25 February 1835, [[Naples]] - 15 September 1920, Naples) was an Italian painter who was best known for his battle scenes, although he worked with a wide variety of subjects.

== Biography ==
His grandfather was [[Giuseppe Cammarano]], a painter and set-designer, and his father was [[Salvadore Cammarano]], a famous opera [[librettist]] who wrote for [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. He enrolled at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli]] in 1853.&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/michele-cammarano_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Biography] from the [[Treccani|Enciclopedia Treccani]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, he studied with [[Gabriele Smargiassi]], [[Giuseppe Mancinelli]] and the Palizzi brothers ([[Filippo Palizzi|Filippo]] and [[Giuseppe Palizzi|Giuseppe]]), painters in the [[Naturalism (art)|Naturalistic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleriarecta.it/bio-Cammarano_Michele-84.html Brief biography] @ the Galleria Recta.&lt;/ref&gt; He had his first exhibition in 1855 at the ""Real Museo Borbonico".&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;
[[File:Bataille de Dogali.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The [[Battle of Dogali]] (1896)]]
In 1860, however, he became fascinated with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and enlisted in the "Guardia Nazionale" to help eliminate the [[brigantaggio]]; a major step in the [[reunification of Italy]]. His experiences had a decisive influence on his artistic career. A brief stay in Florence after his service brought him into contact with the [[Macchiaioli]], who also had some influence.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; In 1863, one of his paintings was purchased by King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/trombealvento/vari/cammarano.htm Brief biography] @ Libero.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, he moved to Rome then, in 1867, to Venice. In 1870, his admiration for [[Gustave Courbet]] led him to Paris. He was determined to meet Courbet, which he did and, while he was there, discovered the works of [[Théodore Géricault]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

In 1888, he was commissioned by the Italian government to create a monumental canvas depicting the [[Battle of Dogali]] (1887). After reading about the geography and local customs, he moved to [[Massawa]] to inspect the battle site in person and remained for almost five years to complete the painting.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; While there, he also created landscapes and portraits of the local people.

In 1900, he was appointed to succeed his old teacher, Filippo Palizzi, as Professor at the Institute in Naples. After that, his productivity declined; although he made a few trips to Sicily to paint landscapes.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; A street in Naples has been named after him.

[[File:Moscow 05-2017 img41 Conservatory.jpg|thumb|The Great Hall, the main performance auditorium]]
The '''Moscow Conservatory''', also officially '''Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory ''' ({{lang-ru|Московская государственная консерватория им. П. И. Чайковского|link=no}}) is an educational music institution located in [[Moscow]], Russia. It grants undergraduate and graduate diplomas in musical performance and musical research. The conservatory offers various degrees including Bachelor of Music Performance, Master of Music and PhD in research. 

==History==
It was co-founded in 1866 as the '''Moscow Imperial Conservatory''' by [[Nikolai Rubinstein]] and Prince [[Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy|Nikolai Troubetzkoy]]. It is the second oldest conservatory in Russia] after the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] was appointed professor of theory and harmony at its opening. Since 1940 the conservatory bears his name.

==Choral faculty==
Prior to the [[October Revolution]] the choral faculty of the conservatory was second to the [[Moscow Synodal School]] and [[Moscow Synodal Choir]], but in 1919 both were closed and merged into the choral faculty. Some of the students now listed as being of the conservatory were in fact students of the Synodal School.

==Great Hall==
The renovation of the hall was completed in 2011.

==Characters and cast==

===Main cast===

'''Don DeWitt''' is a child of the Nintendo Generation. He was raised on a diet of video games from [[Mario (franchise)|Mario]] to [[Call of Duty]], [[Final Fantasy]] to [[Double Dragon]] and everything in between. His father got him his first ever gaming console, an original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], when he was just a kid and after his father, died Don's prevalent memory of his departed father was playing video games with him as a kid.

Since then he's grown up with his left thumb on a directional pad and his right thumb on the A button. Always so involved in gaming that he neglected the outside world, never realized the potential he had to be somebody and slowly started to feel like an outcast. Even his favorite social spot is a Gamer Bar in his home city of London.

Don one day is pulled him into an alternate reality where the video games are real life. At first this could be a dream come true for Don, he's now standing in the worlds that he could only explore through a television screen before... but soon he realizes this is far from a dream-scenario, because if he is killed now, it truly is Game Over. Don is portrayed by series creator [[Petros L. Ioannou]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylifeasavideogame.com/#!don-dewitt/c22o5 Don DeWitt Character Description], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kera Althorn''' is only child of the Emperor of the Great Interstellar Althorn Empire, is a young woman who as her title would suggest had everything. She was always taken care of, never had to lift a finger to do anything . But it wasn't to last...

When a military coup broke out led by the brutal General Atticus Dynas and Kera's family was overthrown and killed, Kera was thrown into a prison cell. Kera wasn't going to take this lying down though. She might not have been active in the past but she was sure as hell going to do something about it now.

Kera breaks out of prison using the help of her family's personal M.E.N.U, a sentient super-computer, and steals an old ambassadorial ship called "The Fortress" and flies away. Kera remembers one thing, the story of the Grand Champion, who united all the video game heroes once to combat an impossible threat. She now travels from world to world seeking alliances with the Champions to take back her throne as she truly becomes a self-sufficient soldier. Kera is portrayed by [[Jennifer Polansky]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylifeasavideogame.com/#!kera-althorn/cdyo Kera Althorn Character Description], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''M.E.N.U''' (or simply '''Menu''') is the Multi-Electrical Networked User System is a highly sophisticated sentient super-computer that can process at twenty-trillion petaflops and contains virtually the entire database of the Althorn Empire stored in its drives, yet still finds the time to make the occasional sarcastic remark, witty retort and highly refined dick, butt or fart joke.

Loyal to Kera's family, Menu was a super computer designed to make their lives easier, and while in most science fiction that means he's going to turn evil, Menu is quite the opposite. In fact when everyone turned against the Royal Family, Menu stuck with Kera and now aids her on her quest to bring down her father's murderer.

Menu often appears as a floating head and hands on a screen, be it on the ship The Fortress, or on Kera and Don's wrist mounted portable system. He acts as an interface helping the heroes to communicate and is always on hand with a wise-crack or two or six. Menu is portrayed by [[brentalfloss]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylifeasavideogame.com/#!menu/c1utl Menu Character Description], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''My Life as a Video Game'' was originally conceived by writer Petros L. Ioannou, as a video game review show. Each review would involve his being sucked into the game he was reviewing good or bad to point out the flaws. However slowly as it developed, Ioannou decided to make it more of a [[scripted television|scripted comedy show]] with an ongoing storyline and soon reviewer element was removed entirely in favour of a more plot and character driven narrative that would seek to analyse and poke fun at [[Video game culture|gaming culture]] on a whole, while creating its own universe. This also would allow him to analyse gaming genres from the past, that might not be as common anymore such as the [[Beat 'em up]] and more modern ones such as the [[First Person Shooter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘My Life As A Video Game’: Petros Ioannou &amp; BrentalFloss Power Up With NMR [INTERVIEW]|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/04/my-life-as-a-video-game-petros-ioannou-brentalfloss-power-up-with-nmr-interview/|accessdate=11 April 2014|newspaper=NewMediaRockstars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kickstarter===
On October 21, 2013, Leon Films, with a video from producer [[Petros L. Ioannou]] and co-star [[brentalfloss|Brent Black]], launched a [[crowdfunding]] effort for ''My Life as a Video Game'' on [[Kickstarter]] with 35&amp;nbsp;days to reach a goal of $30,000. With the help of a video from Black on his channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-cRWJpZmSQ Check out the NEW SHOW, I'm in!], brentalfloss YouTube channele&lt;/ref&gt; released about two weeks into the Kickstarter, the project reached is goal and raised $32,314 in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leonfilms/my-life-as-a-video-game-a-new-webseriesQ My Life as a Video Game - A New Webseries!], kickstarter.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The show is based around "arcs", each corresponding to three episodes of a story roughly ten minutes in length. Together they combine one television length episode for easier viewing together. The only exception to this is the pilot episode which stands alone, though is considered to be part of the First Person Shooter arc that takes place immediately afterward.

'''Māori Television''' is a [[List of New Zealand television channels|New Zealand television station]] that broadcasts programmes that make a significant contribution to the revitalisation of the [[Māori language]] and [[Tikanga Māori|culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.tpk.govt.nz/documents/download/271/Impact-Survey-Maori-Television.pdf|title=Impact of Mäori Television on the Mäori Language|last=|first=|date=July 2011|publisher=[[Te Puni Kōkiri]]|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|quote=The Impact Survey results show a consistent relationship between greater viewing of Mäori Television and increasing language usage, greater language learning, and proficiency increases and maintenance. Collectively these outcomes point towards Mäori Television having a marked positive contributing impact on Mäori language revitalisation.|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by the [[Government of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]], the station commenced broadcasting on 28 March 2004 from its studios in [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket, Auckland]].

==History==
Māori Television was launched on 28 March 2004 and attracted a cumulative audience of 300,000 in its first month on air (April 2004).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The main channel attracts 1.5 million viewers each month; half of all Māori aged five or more, and one third of all New Zealanders.&lt;ref name="Throng"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.throng.co.nz/maori-television/maori-television-marks-fifth-onair-anniversary|title=Maori Television Marks Fifth On-Air Anniversary|date=26 March 2009|work=Throng|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Te Reo (TV)|Te Reo]], the station's second channel, was launched in 28 March 2008. It stands out from the main channel in that it is both free of advertising, and broadcast completely in Māori (without subtitles). Te Reo features special tribal programming with a particular focus on new programming for the fluent members of its audience. 

==Operations==
The station is under the stewardship of two stakeholders which are the New Zealand Government, and the Māori Television Electoral College (Te Putahi Paoho). It has an annual budget of $45m, almost one third of state spending on television in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In July 2015, the Māori Television board decided that [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] or [[Rotorua]] could be a new home for the broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/maori-television-could-move-offices-2015070511|title=Maori Television could move offices|date=24 November 2015|website=3 News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124085943/http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/maori-television-could-move-offices-2015070511|archivedate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station has a seven-member board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maoritelevision.com/about/about-maori-television/board-executive|title=Board &amp; Executive|website=Māori Television|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
A survey conducted by Business and Economic Research Limited found that 84 per cent of the general New Zealand population believe that Māori Television should be a permanent part of New Zealand broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Throng" /&gt;

Māori Television continues to attract a rapidly growing and increasingly broad audience across age, gender and ethnicities. More than two-thirds of the audience are non-Māori, who are looking for local programming such as ''Kai Time on the Road'', ''Kete Aronui'' and ''Ask Your Auntie'', many New Zealand movies and documentaries, and the diverse range of international movies and documentaries that normally would not get air-time on the main commercial networks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Mission==
The station aims to revitalise [[Maori language|Māori language]] and [[Māori culture|culture]] through its programming. The relevant legislation says "The principal function of the Service is to promote te reo Māori me nga [[tikanga Maori|tikanga Māori]] (Māori language and culture) through the provision of a high quality, cost-effective Māori television service, in both Māori and English, that informs, educates, and entertains a broad viewing audience, and, in doing so, enriches New Zealand's society, culture, and heritage".

==Controversies==
Canadian John Davy was appointed chief executive of Māori Television in 2002. However, it was found that his qualifications were false — he claimed to hold a degree from "Denver State University" which did not exist — and he was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=2043885|title=John Davy sent to prison for eight months|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Louisa Cleave|date=29 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, newsreader Julian Wilcox was fired (and reinstated) after he contributed to information provided to other media that led to negative coverage of the station. That same year, ''[[Te Kāea]]'' presenter Ngarimu Daniels was banned from taking part in protests, and her partner was referred to as a "dyke" by a senior station manager. She was awarded $16,000 compensation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10343308|title=Maori TV presenter wins $16,000, right to protest|last=Beston|first=Anne|date=August 31, 2005|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her partner, Leonie Pihama, a leading Māori academic and film-maker, resigned from the station's board citing a conflict of interest.

Crosley cautioned that attempts to view Dunham as a bellwether of modern feminism would unfairly overshadow the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crosley|first1=Sloane|authorlink1=Sloane Crosley|title=A Voice of a Generation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/books/review/lena-dunham-memoir-not-that-kind-of-girl-review.html|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hadley Freeman]], in a review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', described Dunham as being a smart and talented writer, and the book as being brutally honest, but also narcissistic and thin in experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freeman|first1=Hadley|authorlink1=Hadley Freeman|title=Not That Kind of Girl review – Lena Dunham exposes all, again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/30/not-that-kind-of-girl-lena-dunham-review-memoir|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[James Wolcott]] found the book filled with "chatty punch lines, airy anecdotage, and sour kiss-offs" and, ultimately, "callow, grating, and glibly nattering."&lt;ref&gt;https://newrepublic.com/article/120027/not-kind-girl-review-lena-dunhams-callow-grating-memoir&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidi Stevens of ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote, "But the book, as a whole, is a lovely, touching, surprisingly sentimental portrait of a woman who, despite repeatedly baring her body and soul to audiences, remains a bit of an enigma: a young woman who sets the agenda, defies classification and seems utterly at home in her own skin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Lena Dunham's 'Not That Kind of Girl' Packed With Witty Anecdotes, Honesty|first=Heidi|last=Stevens|date=October 1, 2014|url=http://www.popmatters.com/wire/186390-lena-dunhams-not-that-kind-of-girl-packed-with-witty-anecdotes-hones/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the book a "B+" and that it was "guided mostly by a Woody-Allen-with-a-uterus kind of whimsy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Leah|title=Not That Kind of Girl (2014)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20856612,00.html|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Sexual abuse ===
In November 2014, Dunham and the book became a subject of controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Soraya Nadia|title=Lena Dunham responds to sites accusing her of sexually abusing her sister|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/03/lena-dunham-responds-to-sites-accusing-her-of-sexually-abusing-her-sister/|accessdate=November 8, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a profile of Dunham by [[Kevin D. Williamson]] published in ''[[National Review]]''. In her book, Dunham describes examining her sister [[Grace Dunham|Grace]]'s genitals when they were children out of curiosity, bribing her with candy for kisses and casually masturbating while lying in bed next to her. Williamson characterizes this as sexual abuse,&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williamson|first1=Kevin D.|authorlink1=Kevin D. Williamson|title=Pathetic Privilege|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/391348/pathetic-privilege-kevin-d-williamson|accessdate=November 12, 2014|issue=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Lena, Grace, and child psychologists, sexual abuse experts, and researchers in human sexuality reject the notion.&lt;ref name=MWM&gt;{{cite news|last=Moyer|first=Kevin D.|title=Sexual Abuse Allegations|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/11/04/lena_dunham_sibling_sexual_abuse_allegations_ridiculous_and_dangerous.html|accessdate=February 10, 2014|issue=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oldenburg|first1=Ann|title=Lena Dunham: Sexual abuse or sexual exploration?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/11/06/lena-dunam-sexual-abuse-sister-grace-exploration-lawsuit/18524915|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=USA Today|date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caffaro|first1=John|title=Sibling sexual assault is epidemic.

In an interview about the controversy in  ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine's XX Factor blog, developmental psychologist [[Ritch Savin-Williams]] says that the cited passages do not indicate abuse and that "Children have been doing this stuff forever and ever and ever and ever, and they will do it forever and ever and ever."&lt;ref name=MWM/&gt; Child sexual abuse expert [[David Finkelhor]] said that a judgement requires more than a single incident, and psychologist [[Sharon Lamb]] opined that the incidents described in the book were "within the norms of childhood sexual behavior" and that "It wouldn’t be sex offender wrong, it would be inappropriate..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark-Flory|first1=Tracy|title=Child therapists: Stop freaking out about Lena Dunham|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/11/04/child_therapists_stop_freaking_out_about_lena_dunham|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=Salon|issue=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunham later apologized for some of the wording in the book, specifically the joking use of the term 'sexual predator', which she described as insensitive.&lt;ref name="TLAT"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Lena Dunham apologizes for her 'comic use' of 'sexual predator'|first=Christine|last=D'Zurilla|date=November 4, 2014|url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81876655/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothman|first1=Michael|title=Lena Dunham Apologizes for 'Sexual Predator' Section in Her Book|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/lena-dunham-apologizes-sexual-predator-section-book/story?id=26685074|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=Good Morning America|publisher=ABC News|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
In December 2014, [[Breitbart News]] investigated Dunham's claim that Dunham was at a party, "alone, drunk and high on Xanax and cocaine" and was sexually assaulted by a leading member of the [[Oberlin College]] Republicans, whom she called "Barry". Breitbart found a politically conservative alumnus of Oberlin with the forename Barry, later known as "Barry One", who had attended the school at the same time as Dunham but denied he was the man described by her. Breitbart later raised further doubts that the incident between "Barry One" and Dunham had even occurred. Oberlin College publicly distanced themselves from the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Could 'Barry' sue Lena Dunham over her memoirs?|first=Eugene|last=Volokh|date=December 4, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/12/04/could-barry-sue-lena-dunham-over-her-memoirs|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alumnus ("Barry One") subsequently set up a legal fund online to pursue legal action against Dunham and her publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Washington Times]]|title=Lena Dunham: 'Barry One' starts legal fund to fight actress' rape claim|first=Jessica|last=Chasmar|date=December 7, 2014|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/lena-dunham-barry-one-starts-legal-fund-to-fight-a|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Barry One"'s counsel stated that 'Despite multiple requests ... Dunham has not issued any sort of statement clearing Barry's name and clarifying the confusion that is happening.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/lena-dunham-barry-one-starts-legal-fund-to-fight-a/ "Barry One" starts legal fund to fight Lena Dunham claims"], ''The Washington Times''. Retrieved February 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2014, [[Random House]] issued a statement claiming Dunham had related that "Barry" was a [[pseudonym]] and had no connection to the Oberlin alumnus with the same first name. The pseudonym was to be removed from all further editions of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NPR|title=Book News: Random House Promises Changes To Lena Dunham Book|first=Colin|last=Dwyer|date=December 9, 2014|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/12/09/369600711/book-news-random-house-promises-changes-to-lena-dunham-book|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5041">[[File:Page number.jpg|thumb|250 px|Page number in a book]]
'''Page numbering''' is the process of applying a sequence of numbers (or letters, or roman numerals) to the pages of a book or other document. The number itself, which may appear in various places on the page, can be referred to as a '''page number''' or as a '''folio'''.&lt;ref name="CMS"&gt;''[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch01/ch01_sec005.html The Chicago Manual of Style, Sixteenth Edition]'' (2003), pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other numbering schemes such as [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] numbering, page numbers allow the [[citation]] of a particular page of the numbered document and facilitates to the reader to find specific parts of the document and to know the size of the complete text (by checking the number of the last page).

==Numbering conventions==
Even numbers usually appear on [[Recto and verso|verso]] pages, while odd numbers appear on [[Recto and verso|recto]] pages. In the printing industry, in cases where odd numbers appear on verso pages and even numbers on recto pages, this is referred to as ''non-traditional folios'' (in the past, it had been referred to as ''Chinese folios'', however this term has fallen out of favor in recent years).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In books, some pages, known as ''blind folios'',&lt;ref name="CMS"/&gt; of the [[front matter]] and [[back matter]] are numbered, but the numbers are not always printed on the pages. Publishers are not consistent about how they number the pages of their books. Some publishers stick with the default numbering of the tool they are using, which is typically to number the first page of the front matter as one and all pages after that in a consecutive order. When publishers wish to distinguish between the front matter and the story, the initial title pages are not numbered, the front matter is numbered using lower-case [[Roman numerals]] (i, ii, iii, etc.) and the first page of the story or main content begins with one. The title page of the story is not numbered, but if a story is broken into multiple parts (Part I, Part II, etc.), the title page for the section may be included in the numbering but not shown on the page. The first page of Chapter One would then be numbered as page three rather than page one as would be the normal case.

The sixteenth edition of the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]''&lt;ref name="CMS"/&gt; calls for the beginning of the text to begin with the Arabic number 1, while the front matter that precedes it is to be numbered with lower-case Roman numerals. If the front matter is extensive and a second half-title page is included, it is to be numbered as page one and its verso as page two. If a part title is included, it is to be included in the same numbering as the text. Page numbers do not appear on part titles. Most citation systems also call for the identification of the page number from which a quote or point is drawn. For example, such usage is specified in their citation formats of both the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style, Sixteenth Edition'' (2003), pp. 596, 598.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Bluebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation, Seventeenth Edition'' (2000), pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Location number}}Electronic documents==
[[E-books]] and other electronic documents published in a non-[[Reflowable document|reflowable format]] such as [[PDF]] are normally [[Pagination|paginated]] and numbered in the same way as their printed counterparts.

While reading devices for reflowable documents such as [[EPUB]] e-books may display page numbers, these numbers change from device to device depending on factors such as the size of the display and the selected font size. This makes them unsuitable for citation purposes. To remedy this problem, [[Amazon Kindle]] e-books contain what are called "location numbers", that is, numbers in the margin of the electronic text that indicate where the corresponding page begins in the printed version of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pogue|first=David|title=Page Numbers for Kindle Books an Imperfect Solution|url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/page-numbers-for-kindle-books-an-imperfect-solution/|accessdate=9 July 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]], "Pogue's Post" blog|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
In [[codicology]], each physical sheet (''folium'', abbreviated ''fol.'' or ''f.'') of a manuscript is numbered, and the sides are referred to as ''folium [[recto and verso|rectum]]'' and ''folium [[recto and verso|versum]]'', abbreviated as ''r'' and ''v'' respectively. This results in designations like ''5r'' (the front side of the fifth sheet), or ''8v'' (the back side of the eighth sheet).

&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous comparable burials have been found in neighboring western Mongolia.

The tombs are [[Scythian]]-type [[kurgans]], [[tumulus|barrow]]-like tomb mounds containing wooden chambers covered over by large [[cairn]]s of boulders and stones, dated to the 4th - 3rd centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''A Special Issue on the Dating of Pazyryk.'' ''Source: Notes in the History of Art'' 10, no. 4, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacular burials at Pazyryk are responsible for the introduction of the term ''kurgan'', a Russian word of Turkic origin, into general usage to describe these tombs. The region of the Pazyryk kurgans is considered the [[type site]] of the wider [[Pazyryk culture]]. The site is included in the [[Golden Mountains of Altai]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The bearers of the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding pastoral [[nomad]]s of the [[steppe]], and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in [[Persia]], [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;{{cite book

These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation.

Because of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai-Sayan burials, notably those of the 5th century BCE at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as [[Katanda]], [[Shibe, Siberia|Shibe]], and [[Tuekt]], were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them.
Certain geometric designs and [[sun symbols]], such as the circle and [[Rosette (design)|rosette]], recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. Such specifically Scythian features as zoomorphic junctures, i.e. the addition of a part of one animal to the body of another, are rarer in the Altaic region than in southern Russia. The stag and its relatives, however, figure as prominently in Altai-Sayan as in [[Scythian art]]. &lt;ref name="Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.britannica.com/art/Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts |title=Altaic Tribes|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"At Pazyryk too are found bearded mascarons ([[funerary mask|masks]]) of well-defined Greco-Roman origin, which were doubtless inspired by the [[Hellenistic kingdoms]] of the [[Cimmerian]] [[Bosporus]]."&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pazyryk deer.jpg|thumb|upright|A gilded wooden figurine of a deer from the Pazyryk burials, fifth century BC]]
The first tomb at Pazyryk, barrow 1, was excavated by the [[archaeologist]] M. P. Gryaznov in 1929; barrows 2-5 were excavated by [[Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko]] in 1947-1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudenko|1970|pp=18, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the tombs had already been looted in earlier times, the excavators unearthed buried horses, and with them immaculately preserved cloth saddles, felt and woven rugs including the world's oldest pile [[carpet]],&lt;ref name="EB_Carpet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512386/rug-and-carpet/73762/Symbolism-of-overall-design#toc73765 |title=Rug and carpet: Oriental carpets |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB_Central_Asian_Arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102325/Central-Asian-arts/13969/Altaic-tribes |title=Central Asian Arts: Altaic tribes |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [https://web.archive.org/web/20000106182748/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7e.html 3-metre-high four-wheel funeral chariot] from the 5th century BC and other splendid objects that had escaped the ravages of time.&lt;ref name="EB_Stone_Age"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/567232/Stone-Age/52383/European-cultures |title=Stone Age: European cultures |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These finds are now exhibited at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

Craniological studies of samples from the Pazyryk burials determined that skulls were generally of [[Europoid]] type, with some showing [[Mongoloid]] features.&lt;ref name="Rudenko45"&gt;{{harvnb|Rudenko|1970|p=45}} "Although in general the skulls in the series are of europeoid type, there are some among them with markedly mongoloid features."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pazyryk chief===
Rudenko's most striking discovery was the body of a tattooed Pazyryk chief: a thick-set, powerfully built man who had died when he was about 50. Parts of the body had deteriorated, but much of the tattooing was still clearly visible (see [[:Image:Scythian tatoo.jpg|image]]). Subsequent investigation using reflected [[infrared photography]] revealed that all five bodies discovered in the Pazyryk kurgans were tattooed.&lt;ref&gt;Findings published in ''Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia'', Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; No instruments specifically designed for tattooing were found, but the Pazyryks had extremely fine needles with which they did miniature [[embroidery]], and these were probably used for tattooing.

The chief was elaborately decorated with an interlocking series of striking designs representing a variety of fantastic beasts. The best preserved [[tattoo]]s were images of a [[donkey]], a [[argali|mountain ram]], two highly stylized [[deer]] with long antlers and an imaginary [[carnivore]] on the right arm. Two monsters resembling [[griffin]]s decorate the chest, and on the left arm are three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a [[mountain goat]]. On the front of the right leg a [[fish]] extends from the foot to the knee. A monster crawls over the right foot, and on the inside of the shin is a series of four running rams which touch each other to form a single design. The left leg also bears tattoos, but these designs could not be clearly distinguished. In addition, the chief's back is tattooed with a series of small circles in line with the vertebral column.  This tattooing was probably done for therapeutic reasons. Contemporary Siberian tribesmen still practice tattooing of this kind to relieve back pain.

===Ice Maiden===
{{main|Siberian Ice Maiden}}
[[Image:Mummy of the Ukok Princess.jpg|thumb|The Ice Maiden - fifth century BC]]
The most famous undisturbed Pazyryk burial so far recovered is the [[Siberian Ice Maiden|Ice Maiden]] or "Altai Lady" found by archaeologist [[Natalia Polosmak]] in 1993 at Ukok, near the Chinese border. The find was a rare example of a single woman given a full ceremonial burial in a wooden chamber tomb in the fifth century BC, accompanied by six horses.&lt;ref name="nova" /&gt;
She had been buried over 2,400 years ago in a casket fashioned from the hollowed-out trunk of a Siberian [[Larch|larch tree]]. On the outside of the casket were stylized images of deer and [[snow leopard]]s carved in leather. Shortly after burial the grave had apparently been flooded by freezing rain, and the entire contents of the burial chamber had remained frozen in [[permafrost]]. Six horses wearing elaborate harnesses had been sacrificed and lay to the north of the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Polosmak, Natalia (1994). "A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven." ''National Geographic'' 186:4, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The maiden's well-preserved body, carefully embalmed with peat and bark, was arranged to lie on her side as if asleep. She was young, and her hair was shaven off but wearing a wig and tall hat; she had been 167 cm (5 feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches) tall. Even the [[animal style]] [[tattoo]]s were preserved on her pale skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms. Her coffin was made large enough to accommodate the high felt headdress she was wearing, which was decorated with swans and gold-covered carved cats.&lt;ref&gt;Polosmak (1994), pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; She was clad in a long crimson and white striped woolen skirt and white felt stockings. Her yellow blouse was originally thought to be made of wild "[[tussah]]" silk but closer examination of the fibers indicate the material is not Chinese but was a [[wild silk]] which came from somewhere else, perhaps [[India]].&lt;ref name="atlas"/&gt; Near her coffin was a vessel made of [[yak]] horn, and dishes containing gifts of [[coriander]] seeds:  all of which suggest that the Pazyryk trade routes stretched across vast areas of Iran{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Similar dishes in other tombs were thought to have held ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'',  confirming a practice described by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref name="nova"/&gt; but after tests the mixture was found to be coriander seeds, probably used to disguise the smell of the body.

Two years after the discovery of the "Ice Maiden" Dr. Polosmak's husband, Vyacheslav Molodin, found a frozen man, elaborately tattooed with an elk, with two long braids that reached to his waist, buried with his weapons.

Doctor Anicua also noted that her blouse was a bit stained, indicating that the material was not a new garment, made for the burial.

===Pazyryk carpet===
[[Image:Scythiancarpet.jpg|thumb|upright|The Pazyryk carpet]]

One of the most famous finds at Pazyryk is the '''Pazyryk carpet''', which is probably the oldest surviving [[pile carpet]] in the world. It measures 183×200&amp;nbsp;cm and has a knot density of approximately 360,000 [[knot density|knots per]] square meter, which is higher than most modern carpets. The middle of the carpet consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. The Pazyryk carpet was manufactured in Ancient Armenia (one of hypotheses)around 400 BC. When it was found it had been deeply frozen in a block of ice, which is why it is so well-preserved. The carpet can be seen at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.&lt;ref name="Carpet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carpetencyclopedia.com/pages/History-184.html |title=History of handknotted carpets |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=CarpetEncyclopedia.com |publisher= |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other findings===
In a corner of one grave chamber of the Pazyryk cemetery was a fur bag containing cannabis seed, a censer filled with stones, and the hexapod frame of an inhalation tent - these are believed to have been utilized at the end of the funerary ritual for purification.

Other undisturbed kurgans have been found to contain remarkably well-preserved remains, comparable to the earlier [[Tarim mummies]] of [[Xinjiang]]. Bodies were preserved using [[mummy|mummification]] techniques and were also naturally frozen in solid ice from water seeping into the tombs.  They were encased in coffins made from hollowed trunks of [[larch]] (which may have had sacral significance) and sometimes accompanied by sacrificed concubines and horses.  The clustering of tombs in a single area implies that it had particular ritual significance for these people, who were likely to have been willing to transport their deceased leaders great distances for burial.

As recently as the summer of 2012,  tombs have been discovered at various locations.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  In January 2007 a timber tomb of a blond chieftain warrior was unearthed in the permafrost of the [[Altai Republic|Altai mountains region]] close to the Mongolian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Russian Archaeologists Discover Remains of Ancient Chieftain in Altai Permafrost | url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2007/01/10/ancienttomb.shtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302010403/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2007/01/10/ancienttomb.shtml | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-03-02 | date=2007-01-10 | accessdate=2007-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the presumed Pazyryk chieftain is tattooed; his sable coat is well preserved, as are some other objects, including what looks like [[scissors]]. A local archaeologist, Aleksei Tishkin, complained that the indigenous population of the region strongly disapproves of archaeological digs, prompting the scientists to move their activities across the border to [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Daria Radovskaya | url=http://www.rg.ru/2007/01/10/kochevnik.html | title=Кочевник был блондином | publisher=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] | date=2007-01-10 | accessdate=2007-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pazyryk culture==
{{main|Pazyryk culture}}
Rudenko initially assigned the neutral label [[Pazyryk culture]] for these nomads and dated them to the 5th century BC; the dating has been revised for barrows 1-5 at Pazyryk, which are now considered to date to the 4th-3rd centuries B.C.&lt;ref&gt;See above, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pazyryk culture has since been connected to the [[Scythians]] whose similar tombs have been found across the steppes.  The Siberian [[animal style]] tattooing is characteristic of the Scythians. Trading routes between [[Central Asia]], [[China]] and the [[Near East]] passed through the oases on the plateau and these ancient Altai nomads profited from the rich trade and culture passing through.&lt;ref name="nomads"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7.html
|title=Early Nomads of the Altaic Region
|publisher=The Hermitage
|accessdate=2007-07-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that Pazyryk trade routes were vast and connected with large areas of [[Asia]] including [[India]], perhaps Pazyryk merchants largely trading in high quality horses.&lt;ref name="nova"/&gt;

There is also the possibility that the current inhabitants of the [[Altay Mountains|Altai]] region are descendants of the Pazyryk culture, a continuity that would accord with current ethnic politics: [[Archaeogenetics]] is now being used to study the Pazyryk mummies.

The '''Pied Bull Hotel''' is located at 57 Northgate Street, on the corner of King Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376356|desc= The Pied Bull Hotel, Chester|accessdate= 31 October 2011|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The building dates from the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, probably in the site of two [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[tenement]]s.  It was partly refronted in the later part of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, and extended to the rear in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  It is thought to be the Chester inn described by [[George Borrow]] in ''[[Wild Wales]]''.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 94| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The hotel is constructed in brick, with some [[sandstone]] and [[timber framing]], and has grey [[slate]] roofs.  It is in three storeys with cellars.  On the Northgate Street side of the building is a three-arched [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]], above which are two storeys in [[Brickwork#Flemish bond|Flemish bond]] brick.  The rear face to the arcade is timber framed and includes an entrance containing a 17th-century door, with a slightly [[bay window|bayed window]] on each side.  On the corners of the building are sandstone [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]].  In the upper two storeys are [[sash window]]s, and at the top is a plain stone [[coping (architecture)|coped]] [[parapet]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;

Most of the historical features have been removed from the interior.  The features retained include a large sandstone fireplace in the front room, which dates probably from the early or mid-17th&amp;nbsp;century, and the 17th-century carved oak staircase.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

'''Pierrette Bloch''' (June 16, 1928 – July 7, 2017) was a Paris-born Swiss painter and textile artist.

==Early life==
Pierrette Bloch was born on June 16, 1928 in Paris. In 1939, Bloch and her parents left France for Switzerland to escape the war. At the age of 15, she began living on her own in a hotel, which she says helped foster very early on a complete sense of independence and autonomy. She began her professional artistic training at the end of the 1940s, taking courses in the plastic arts in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00020969?rskey=Mn27bF&amp;result=1 Benezit Artist Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bloch began exhibiting her works in Paris and the United States in the 1950s. The ensemble of her works have their roots in the use of  "poor" materials such as ink, paper, mesh, and horsehair. The last of these, horsehair, began appearing in her work in the 1970s, with her first sculpture using horsehair created in 1979, and have become one of the key symbols of her work. The corpus of her work thus spans mediums, including drawings, collages and three-dimensional pieces, and falls into the category of postwar abstraction. Her work has been exhibited in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

A monograph on Pierrette Bloch was published in November 2013 by Musée Jenisch.

==Death==
Bloch died on July 7, 2017 in Paris at the age of 89.&lt;ref name="lemondeobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dagen|first1=Philippe|title=Mort de Pierrette Bloch, artiste d’une " inextinguible continuité "|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2017/07/08/mort-de-pierrette-bloch-artiste-d-une-inextinguible-continuite_5157830_1655012.html|accessdate=July 9, 2017|work=Le Monde|date=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait Miniature of Margaret Roper''''' is a painting by the German artist and printmaker [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] created between 1535–36, and today held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="met1"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/margaret_more_1505_1544_wife_of_william_roper_hans_holbein_the_younger/objectview.aspx?collID=11&amp;OID=110001105 Margaret More]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved on 17 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Roper]] (1505–44) was the eldest child of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and wife of the English biographer [[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]]. It is the second and less well known of two portraits of Roper painted by Holbein. The first, ''Portrait of an English Woman'', is generally believed to show Roper but may depict another unknown lady of the English court. The New York work was painted during the artist's second visit to London, likely in the mid-1530s.&lt;ref name="G92"&gt;Goldberg, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/h/hans_holbein_the_younger,_port.aspx Hans Holbein the Younger, Portrait of an English Woman, a drawing]". [[British Museum]], Retrieved 11 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the work was created shortly after her father's beheading at the hands of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1535.&lt;ref name="mm12"&gt;"[http://12.151.120.44/toah/ho/08/euwb/ho_50.69.2.htm Margaret More (1505–1544), Wife of William Roper, 1535–36]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved on 17 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; With a diameter of just {{convert|1+3/4|in|cm}}, the work was one of over a hundred [[Portrait miniature|miniature]]s and portraits painted by Holbein while in England. This work is one of a pair of [[pendant]]s; the second depicts the sitter's husband.

Roper is depicted in three-quarters view with a narrow face and wearing extravagant clothes that reflect her social position. She is wearing a [[gable hood]] with pinned up red/orange embroidered lappets (facing the viewer) and a long black veil (with one side pinned up). Her black gown is lined with a broad band of fur. She holds a green book in her hands which are decorated by gold rings. A horizontal gold inscription reads "Ao ÆTATIS XXX".&lt;ref name="met1" /&gt; The work was donated to the Metropolitan Museum by the Rogers Fund in 1950.

'''Punchinello Players''', founded in 1914, was a [[theatre]] organization of the [[University of Minnesota]]. When it closed it was the second oldest student-run [[community theater]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name=UNS&gt;{{cite web|title=UNM News Service 4.19.82|publisher=University of Minnesota News Service|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello - located on the [[University of Minnesota#St. Paul campus|St. Paul campus]] - originated for the purpose of improving the lives of the greater community, and as a University-associated theater it continued that purpose throughout its existence via production of chosen works.&lt;ref name=Manhood&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Country Plays with Country Players|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiREAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA417&amp;dq=back+to+the+farm+minnesota+rural+manhood&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4ZSg0MPYAhWK5oMKHTmqDaoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=back%20to%20the%20farm%20minnesota%20rural%20manhood&amp;f=false|journal=’Rural Manhood: Devoted to the County (Rural) work of the Young Men’s Christian Associations in Village, Town and Open Country |publisher=The International Committee of Young Men’s Christian Associations, New York |date=January 1918 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |pages=417–418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello Players closed in 1994 due primarily to its home, North Hall (formerly a student dormitory), being slated for demolition.

==Debut==
'''Back to the Farm'''

''Back to the Farm'' was a two-year production (1913–1915) written by School of Agriculture student Merline H. Shumway and directed by Estelle Cook &lt;ref name=Manhood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bookdepository.com/Back-Farm-Merline-H-Merline-Henderson-Shumway/9781360495736 Back to the Farm : A Play in Three Acts]&lt;/ref&gt; to create awareness of the University's new Agricultural Extension Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= |first1= |authorlink= | title=Exension History|url=https://www.extension.umn.edu/about/history/|work=[[University of Minnesota]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the rural communities of [[Minnesota]]. 
''Back to the Farm'' was created to demonstrate the value of scientifically trained farmers. It centers around a farm family in which the father is an old-school farmer, who isn't open to his sons' new ideas about how to do things. The son leaves the farm and enrolls at a nearby agricultural college for their 4-year program. They mend their relationship and he returns to the farm, implementing what he's learned - with the result that the farm becomes the most productive in the state.&lt;ref name="Card"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Gopher: Annual Publication of the Student Body of the University of Minnesota|volume=39|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|work= University of Minnesota|date=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|426}} 
Initially presented at County Fairs around the state, its popularity exceeded expectations and the play continued to tour at farmers' institutes and other educational sessions, eventually being performed fifty times in the first year and many more times for years afterwards.{{refn|group=note| From notes of a freshman: October 11. Saw “Back the Farm” in chapel, and nearly died laughing. Ted Thorson as “Gus” is certainly a card.&lt;ref name="Card"/&gt;}}{{rp|58}}  Follow-up plays including ''Kindling the Hearth Fire'' and ''Partners'' - written/directed by Shumway, Cook and others - were also well received, and in those years a set of plays were created, performed and made available in bulletin form for communities to perform themselves.&lt;ref name=Extension&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Suggested Plays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52hRAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq |journal= Extension Circular |volume=1 |publisher=South Dakota State College |date=January 1918 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADWilson&gt;{{cite magazine |title=University Extension – The Agricultural Extension Division |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5POAAAAMAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|journal= ''President’s Report'' |volume=21 |issue=37 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |date=1918 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |pages=129–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pageant&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Minnesota Extension Service News. |url= https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/174490s | volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=University of Minnesota, Department of Agriculture, Extension Division |date=October 1921 |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agricultural Extension Program (along with General Extension, founded 4 years later in 1913) was instituted to increase the university's outreach. [[George Edgar Vincent]] - University President from 1911-1917 - put in place innovative programming including 'University Weeks' with plays, lectures, concerts and debates similar to the [[Chautauqua Institute]] he had previously led, in the spirit of increasing educational and cultural opportunities for the general public.&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential History|url=https://president.umn.edu/about/presidential-history/george-edgar-vincent|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chautauqua&gt;{{cite book| last1= |first1=|authorlink= | title=’ ‘The Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties: From Self-Improvement to Adult Education in America, 1750-1990.”|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BjGrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=minnesota+The+pursuit+of+knowledge+under+difficulties+:+from+self-improvement+to+adult+education+in+America,+1750-1990.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8-IGg-MTYAhVD9IMKHeFaCKwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=minnesota&amp;f=false|work=[[Stanford University Press]] |date=1994|page=291 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=150years&gt;{{cite book| last1=Lehmberg |first1=Stanford |authorlink=Stanford Lehmberg| last2=Pflaum|first2=Ann M. |authorlink2=Ann M.

Those initial rural productions of ''Back to the Farm'' launched the existence of Punchinello Players in 1914, originally under the name the Minnesota Agriculture Dramatic Club. The organization changed its name to Punchinello Players in 1923.&lt;ref name=snac&gt;{{cite web|title=Punchinello Players|url=http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6bd25ct|publisher=Snac Cooperative|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty Advisors==

The first committed, long-term faculty advisor of Punchinello was William J. Routledge, who steered the organization from its beginnings through till the 1940-1941 school year.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gopher: Annual Publication of the Student Body of the University of Minnesota",Volume 45, Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota, 1922, Page 484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Minnesota Alumni Weekly",Volume 23, Number 9, Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota, 11/22/23 Page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the 1941-1942 school year, Francis E. Drake was Faculty Advisor, but Punchinello - like many University organizations - was largely dormant during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;"The University of Minnesota Directory of Student Organizations", Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota Student Activities Bureau, Office of the Dean of Students, published annually&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='42 Gopher'&gt;"The 1942 Gopher" Yearbook, Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota Student Body, Vol 55. 1942. P. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Punchinello's faculty advisor and frequent production director for over three decades was William M. Marchand, Humanities Professor of the Rhetoric Department, [[CFANS]].&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite web|title=William Marchand Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/twincities/obituary.aspx?pid=181696415|publisher=Pioneer Press|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParkBugle&gt;{{cite web|title=William Marchand Obit|url=http://www.parkbugle.org/william-marchand/|publisher=Park Bugle|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Marchand had a PhD in theatre, and prior to coming to the University in 1960 he had co-founded the Paul Bunyan Theatre, a summer theatre in [[Bemidji]].&lt;ref name=MNDaily_Baumann&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Baumann |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Baumann|title='Born in 1914, Punchinello Players is still young at heart'|work=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=October 13, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North Hall==

Punchinello took over the former cafeteria area of North Hall (formerly a dormitory) in the 1960s, while [[O. Meredith Wilson]] was president.

Punchinello had operated out of various spaces prior to that point, including the Ag Auditorium during the 1940s and one of the World War II -era temporary buildings on the St. Paul Campus through the 1960s.&lt;ref name='42 Gopher'/&gt;

When Wilson became aware of that, he felt that something better could be arranged. Soon, Punchinello had a new home.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite web|title=O. Meredith Wilson, 1960-1967|url=https://president.umn.edu/about/presidential-history/o-meredith-wilson | publisher=Office of the President|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MNDaily_Roberts&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Roberts |first=Raequel |authorlink=Raequel Roberts|title='Punchinello Players elebrate 65th years|work=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=November 12, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theater proper (in the former cafeteria) sat 119, and there were various other spaces in the building that Punchinello used for props, costumes, sets, the green room and dressing rooms.&lt;ref name="MNDaily_Roberts"/&gt;

==Theater Genre==

Punchinello mainly performed traditional classics as well as some musicals, and the occasional newer work. Among the rare melodrama/related productions were ''[[Kind Lady (play)|Kind Lady]]'' by [[Edward Chodorov]], in 1942.&lt;ref name='42 Gopher'/&gt; and ''[[Dracula]]'' (from the novel by [[Bram Stoker]]) in 1969.&lt;ref name=1969UMN&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1969 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/51858| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedies have included ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1973 and ''[[Hay Fever]]'' by [[Noel Coward]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=73-74&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1973 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/51875| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=78-79&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1978 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/51894/1978October-DecemberPressReleases.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punchinello produced the [[Metatheatre|metatheatrical]] play [[Our Town]] by [[Thornton Wilder]] in 1969.

Punchinello often explored social issues, with sell-out productions such as ''[[The Crucible]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]] and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' by [[Samuel Beckett]] in 1983,&lt;ref name=Wtr83&gt;{{cite web| title = UMN Press Releases | website = UMN Conservancy | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] News Service | date = 1983 | url = https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/51968/1983January-MarchPressReleases.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y| access-date = December 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lesser known works including ''Play with a Tiger'' by [[Doris Lessing]] in 1979 and ''[[The Shadow Box|Shadow Box]]'' by [[Michael Cristofer]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=78-79 /&gt;

The students who were involved often were sometimes but not always theater majors, representing the range of disciplines within the University.&lt;ref name="MNDaily_Roberts"/&gt;

==Finale==
Its final two productions continued that tradition: [[William Saroyan]]'s ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'' was the second-to-last production. The final production, directed by William Marchand, was [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[Our Town]]''.&lt;ref name=Curtains&gt;{{cite web|title=It's curtains for Punchinello Players|url=http://parkbugle.org.s3.amazonaws.com/backissues/1994/02.pdf|publisher=ParkBugle|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baptistery of Neon''' (Italian: ''Battistero Neoniano'') is a religious building in [[Ravenna]], central [[Italy]]. The most ancient monument remaining in the city,  it was partly erected on the site of a [[Roman bath]]. It is also called the '''Orthodox Baptistery''' to distinguish it from the [[Arian Baptistery]] constructed on behest of [[Ostrogothic]] King [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] some 50 years later.

The octagonal brick structure was erected by [[Bishop]] Ursus at the end of the 4th or beginning of the 5th century, as part of his great [[Basilica]] (destroyed in 1734). The baptistery was finished by Bishop Neon at the end of the 5th century, at which time the [[mosaic]] decorations were added. The original floor is now some 3 meters underground, so the proper structure and extent of the building can no longer be seen. The octagonal design of the building, employed in virtually all Early Christian baptisteries, symbolizes the seven days of the week plus the Day of the Resurrection and Eternal Life.

The ceiling mosaic depicts [[John the Baptist]] baptizing [[Jesus]] (depicted with beard) standing waist high in the [[Jordan River]]. To one side stands the [[personification]] of the Jordan river, with a reed in one hand and a garment in the other. A procession of the twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] proceeds around the center mosaic in two directions, ending with [[Saint Peter]] meeting [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]].
[[Image:Baptistry of Neon ceiling mosaic (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|left|The ceiling mosaic in the Baptistry of Neon]]
The Baptistry is one of the eight structures in Ravenna registered as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]]. According to the [[ICOMOS]] evaluation of this patrimony, "this is the finest and most complete surviving example of the early Christian [[baptistery]]" which "retains the fluidity in representation of the human figure derived from Greco-Roman art".

Stephen Farthing continues to live and work in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Work==
[[File:Step9.gif|thumb|alt=Stephen Farthing.|''Louis XV Rigaud'' (1975), [[Walker Art Gallery]]]]''

Farthing described his work in a 2005 interview, saying "I have dined with the devil in terms of becoming a modern artist.  I have taken hold of history, tried to understand it—and then used and abused it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=196599&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Draw the line at copying? Not him &amp;#124; General |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=2005-06-10 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing's work reflects his education, personal experience and perspective on historical events that have captured his imagination.  After spending a period of study at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris while a student at the [[Royal College of Art]], Stephen Farthing inadvertently fell upon what one could later describe as a postmodernist relationship with history.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lerner,  "The Fourth Wall," in Stephen Farthing: The Fourth Wall, London: Purdy Hicks, 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Paris, he painted an interpretation of [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s portrait of [[Louis XV]] that as a student won him a prize at the John Moores Exhibition in Liverpool, today this painting stands as an early example of British post modernist painting.&lt;ref name="Stephen Farthing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/farthing.aspx |title='Louis XV Rigaud', Stephen Farthing - Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool museums |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228131607/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/farthing.aspx |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s whilst showing with Edward Totah in London, Farthing showed works that positioned Latin American vernacular culture within a modernist idiom and classicism within the vernacular.

During the 1990s, he reinvented history painting as a viable contemporary narrative taking on subject matters as diverse as the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], swagger portraiture, and the topographical mapping of cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/mcewan.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193821/http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/mcewan.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/122406/pro_122406079.shtml |title=Cleveland Browns owner getting his kicks from English football &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date=2006-12-24 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His most recent work makes explicit a theme that has consistently sat between Farthing and his audience, the "narrative" and "text".

[[File:MH.Trafalgar.2.20.06.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Hands of Fate. |''Hands of Fate'', ([[Battle of Trafalgar]])]]
[[File:GetAttachment-2.aspx.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Stephen Farthing.|''The Backstory: Boucher'' (2009)]]

Farthing commented that his work is, "not this thing about 'Oh, let's let the audience make up their mind what it is'…" but about "degrading it on purpose so it becomes not more ambiguous, but less what it was in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnparr.co.uk/articles/Farthing.pdf|title=Stephen Farthing : Marginally Out of Control|publisher=Lynnparr.co.uk|accessdate=2013-11-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193753/http://www.lynnparr.co.uk/articles/Farthing.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of 2009, Farthing had his first one-person show at the Purdy Hicks Gallery in London where, for the first time, he showed the "back-story" paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lerner,  "The Fourth Wall," in Stephen Farthing: The Fourth Wall, London: Purdy Hicks, 2009, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "back-story" paintings are a series of images painted with a text in reverse sitting on the picture plane between the audience and the image.  The text tells us what is going on not in the picture but behind it, so compromising and at the same time informing the image with  text.   His technically very skilled paintings  all seem to be grounded on one guiding principle  - that what we see will always be  always conditioned by what we know.

In November 2010, Farthing became the second living Royal Academician to be featured in the "laboratory" series of one man shows at the Royal Academy of Arts London. "The Back Story," featured an epic 30 foot painting of the Atlantic ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Academy of Arts|title=Artists' Laboratory 02: Stephen Farthing RA, The Back Story|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/artists-laboratory/artists-laboratory-02-stephen-farthing-ra-the-back-story,342,RAL.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301044735/http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/artists-laboratory/artists-laboratory-02-stephen-farthing-ra-the-back-story,342,RAL.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|work=Press Release|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chelsea Space|title=Stephen Farthing's Ultra Marine Painting|url=http://www.chelseaspace.org/blog/archives/272|work=Atlantic Ocean|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing's  work  as a painter  sits midway between the conservative and the cutting edge  between a classical and radical painting.

[[File:Ekaterina Vilkova and Igor Voynarovsky.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shooting a scene for the 2008 Russian film ''[[Stilyagi (2008 film)|Stilyagi]]]]

'''Stilyagi''' ({{lang-rus|стиляги|p=sʲtʲɪˈlʲæɡʲɪ}}, {{literally}} "stylish, style hunters") were members of a youth [[counterculture]] from the late 1940s until the early 1960s in the [[Soviet Union]].  A '''stilyaga''' ({{lang-rus|стиляга|p=sʲtʲɪˈlʲaɡə}}), was primarily distinguished by snappy clothing—preferably foreign-label, acquired from ''[[fartsovshchik]]s''—that contrasted with the communist realities of the time, and their fascination with ''[[zagranitsa]]'', modern Western music and fashions corresponding to that of the [[Beat Generation]]. English writings on Soviet culture variously translated the derogatory term as "[[dandy|dandies]]", "[[wikt:fashionista|fashionista]]s", "[[beatnik]]s", "[[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipsters]]", "[[zoot suit]]ers", etc.

Today, the stilyagi phenomenon is regarded as one of the Russian historical social trends which further developed during the late Soviet era (notably the [[Brezhnev stagnation|Stagnation Period]]) and allowed "informal" views on life, such as [[hippie]]s, [[punk subculture|punk]]s and [[Rapping|rappers]].

==Characteristics==
Their [[apolitical]] views, neutral or negative attitudes toward Soviet [[morality]], and their open admiration of modern, especially American, lifestyles were key characteristics that slowly developed during the 1950s.

At the dawn of the [[phenomenon]], the stilyagi look was rather a caricature, inspired by movies from abroad of recent years. It resembled the [[zoot suit]] but combined different bright colors. By the late fifties, the look had evolved into something more elegant and stylish. Typical stilyagi wear included narrow pants, long jackets, narrow ties, bright-colored shirts, and thick soled shoes.

Usually stilyagi enjoyed popular American music of the 1940s, especially [[swing music|swing]] and [[boogie-woogie]], especially the music of [[Glenn Miller]], [[Benny Goodman]] and the soundtrack from the film ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]''. The "serenade" instantly became a cult among stilyagi, and one of its songs, the famous "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]", served as their unofficial anthem. Stilyagi developed their own styles of dance originating from [[boogie-woogie (dance)|boogie-woogie]] and later also adopted [[rock-n-roll]].

==History and legacy==
[[File:Rock on Bones2.jpg|thumb|300px|"Rock on the bones"]]
The first stilyagi were from the generation of young adults in their early twenties who had lived through the hard times of [[Great Depression|economic crisis]] and [[World War II]], leaving them perturbed about the future of their lives. Many of the young men returning from the army were heavily influenced by the contact with the foreign countries and modern [[Fads and trends|trends]] at the time. As a result, many of them wore clothes based on images from abroad (early 1940s [[romance film]]s, daily newspapers and photographs) and young women later adopted styles from modern female stereotypes too.

The main cause of this phenomenon was the struggle between [[capitalism]] and [[communism]]-led societies. The enforced uniformity of the Soviet thought and the heavy weight of its [[dictatorship]] were the only politically correct form of view, lifestyle and [[emotional expression|self-expression]] permitted during [[Stalinism]]. Therefore, the stilyagi sought to follow the modern ideology and morality in order to avoid Soviet pressure and its influence on society.

The stilyagi were largely repressed until [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death in 1953, which let the style grow into a [[counterculture]]. By 1955, the stilyagi had acquired both respect and contempt from many layers of society (especially the then emerging Soviet [[upper-middle class]], known as "[[intelligentsia]]") and were frowned upon in political instances, but had grown too many in number to be repressed. Thus, instead of trying to get rid of them, the media and politics, including journalism, eagerly mocked their style by portraying them as ridiculous as opposed to "normal" parts of Soviet society.

In the mid-1950s, many people were arrested for making musical recordings on [[Ribs (recordings)|"bones"]] (developed [[X-ray]] films).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jazz on Bones: X-Ray Sound Recordings|url=http://www.kk.org/streetuse/archives/2006/08/jazz_on_bones_xray_sound_recor_1.php|publisher=kk.org|accessdate=29 December 2010|date=August 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jazz-Rock Counterculture is Born|url=http://www.powerhat.com/tusovka/tus.ch1.html#howyoung-records |work=The Historical Political Development of Soviet Rock Music|accessdate=29 December 2010|author=Tracy Donovan Drake |archiveurl = https://swap.stanford.edu/20090621074303/http%3A//www%2Epowerhat%2Ecom/tusovka/tus%2Ech1%2Ehtml |archivedate = June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those found guilty of manufacturing and distributing such recordings received from three to five years of imprisonment in [[labour camp]]s for [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]].

In the late 1950s, the catchphrase "Today he dances jazz, but tomorrow [he] will sell [his] homeland" (Сегодня он танцует джаз, а завтра Родину продаст), became the stilyagi's signature and the key idea underlying their social protest. Stilyagi were recognized as an official musical, artistic and pop culture movement that later took on further modern influences, notably [[rockabilly]], [[rock-n-roll]] and [[pop rock]] musical genres.

Following the [[6th World Festival of Youth and Students|international festival of 1957]], however, the USSR became more open to modern culture. The official ban on jazz music was removed, and many records became available in stores from the 1960s. Admiration of modern music, especially the rock-n-roll wave of the sixties, met more tolerance from official ideology and little active resistance. All this contributed to the decline of the movement in the early sixties, as former stilyagi abandoned the lifestyles of their youth, while the next generation felt no need to follow such a lifestyle in order to enjoy modern culture or a nonpolitical way of life.

The influence of the stilyagi movement on Soviet-Russian culture is tremendous. Many of today's most respected Russian musicians, writers, film editors and other cultural personalities belonged to the movement, or shared its free, bohemian lifestyle. There is a 2008 Russian comedy musical film, ''[[Stilyagi (film)|Stilyagi]]'', about this subculture.

The '''Studio of Artistic Design''' ({{lang-rus|Мастерская художественного проектирования|Masterskaya khudozhestvennogo proektirovaniya}}) is an independent culture and education organization based in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] and founded in 1987. Its curriculum is directed towards [[creative thinking]], [[spatial awareness]], [[visual culture]] and [[visual perception]], as well as various types of art in [[graphic design]] contexts.

== History ==

The studio was set up by Russian artist Nikolay Selivanov in 1987 in Moscow's Children's Art School, and in 1993 they set up a computer studio. In 2003 the workshop was reorganized and there appeared an independent nonprofit organization called the Studio of Artistic Design. In 2008, an anniversary exhibition of the Workshop took place in Na Solyanke Art Gallery, one of Moscow's central exhibition halls, called "Contemporary Art From Easel to Computer. The exhibition took place on all three floors of the gallery.

== Partners ==
The studio cooperates with many organizations, museums and educational institutions, including the [[Russian Institute of Art Education]] under the [[Russian State Academy of Education]] and the [[UNESCO]] Institute for Information Technologies in Education.

[[File:The Hunt of the Unicorn Tapestry 1.jpg|thumb|270px|Tapestry 1, ''The Unicorn is Found'']]

'''''The Hunt of the Unicorn''''', or the '''''Unicorn Tapestries''''', is one of the most famous and spectacular but enigmatic survivors of the late Middle Ages. This series of seven [[tapestry|tapestries]] now in [[The Cloisters]] in New York was possibly made – or at least designed – in Paris at the turn of the sixteenth century. They are one of the canonical works of late medieval/early Renaissance art and show a group of noblemen and hunters in pursuit of a [[unicorn]] through an idealised French landscape. The tapestries were woven in wool, metallic threads, and silk. The vibrant colours, still evident today, were produced from dye plants: [[Reseda luteola|weld]] (yellow), [[Rose madder|madder]] (red), and [[woad]] (blue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicorn Tapestries|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Unicorn/unicorn_howcame.htm|website=www.MetMuseum.org|accessdate=2017-10-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507053309/https://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Unicorn/unicorn_howcame.htm|archivedate=2006-05-07|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First recorded in 1680 in the Paris home of the [[Duc de la Rochefoucauld|de la Rochefoucauld]] family, the tapestries were looted at the French Revolution. Rediscovered in a barn in the 1850s, they were hung at the family's [[Château de Verteuil (Charente)|Château de Verteuil]]. Since then they have been the subject of intense scholarly debate about the meaning of their iconography, the identity of the artists who designed them, and the sequence in which they were meant to be hung. Although various theories have been put forward, as yet nothing is known of their early history or provenance, and their dramatic but conflicting narratives have inspired multiple readings, from chivalric to Christological. Variations in size, style, and composition suggest they come from more than one set, linked by their subject matter, provenance, and the mysterious AE monogram which appears in each. One of the panels, ''The Mystic Capture of the Unicorn'', only survives in two fragments.

[[James Rorimer|James J. Rorimer]] speculated in 1942 that the tapestries were commissioned by [[Anne of Brittany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicorn Tapestries were made for Anne of Brittany |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257087.pdf.bannered.pdf|website=www.MetMuseum.org|accessdate=2017-12-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325125128/https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257087.pdf.bannered.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-25|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate her marriage to [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], King of France on 6 December 1491.&lt;ref name="mag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/tapestry_in_the_renaissance_art_and_magnificence|title=Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorimer interpreted the A and E monogram that appears in each tapestry as the first and the last letters of Anne's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1983 |isbn=0-87099-147-7 |location=New York |pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret B. Freeman, however, rejected this interpretation in her 1976 monograph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |first=Margaret B. |last=Freeman |date=1976 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art/Dutton |isbn= 0-525-22643-5 |pages=156 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a conclusion repeated by Adolph S. Cavallo in his 1998 work.&lt;ref name="ASC 21"&gt;{{cite book |page=21 |title=The Unicorn Tapestries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art |author=Adolph S. Cavallo |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-87099-868-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Campbell, former Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, recently acknowledged that experts "still do not know for whom or where [the tapestries] were made."  So far, scholarly efforts to explain the AE and other inscriptions, to identify the few heraldic symbols, and to coherently account for the puzzling narratives have met with limited success.

==Themes==
[[File:The Unicorn in Captivity - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|280px|''The Unicorn is in Captivity and No Longer Dead'']]
One theory is that the tapestries show [[paganism|pagan]] and Christian symbolism. The pagan themes emphasise the medieval lore of beguiled lovers, whereas Christian writings interpret the [[unicorn]] and its death as the [[Passion of Christ]]. The unicorn has long been identified by Christian writers as a symbol of Christ, conscripting the traditionally pagan symbolism of the unicorn. The original pagan myths about ''The Hunt of the Unicorn'' refer to an animal with a single horn that can only be tamed by a virgin; Christian scholars translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].

In the Gothic tapestry, the makers considered biblical events as "historical," and linked the biblical and secular narratives in the tapestry weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=19}},&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval art illustrated moral principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tapestries used narrative allegories to illustrate these morals. The secular unicorn hunt was not simply Christian art, but also an allegorical representation of the [[Annunciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Iconography of Christian Art |last=Schiller |first=Gertrud |publisher=Lund Humphries Publishers Limited |year=1971 |isbn=0-85331-270-2 |location=London |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acknowledging Rorimer's speculation that the tapestries were commissioned to celebrate a marriage, Freeman noted that medieval poets connected the taming of the unicorn to the devotion and subjugation of love. The taming of the unicorn symbolises the secular lover or mate who was enchained by a virgin and entrapped in the fence (in the tapestry ''The Unicorn in Captivity''). In addition, the author pointed out that the concept of an overlapping God of Heaven and God of love was accepted in the late middle ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1983 |isbn=0-87099-147-7 |location=New York |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The making of the tapestries ==
[[File:The hunt of the unicorn6.jpg|thumb|280px|Tapestry 6: ''The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle'']]
Questions about the original workmanship of the tapestries remain unanswered. The design of the tapestries is rich in figurative elements similar to those found in oil painting. Apparently influenced by the French style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2|location=London|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the elements in the tapestries reflect the woodcuts and metalcuts made in Paris in the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |date=1973–1973 |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |url= |journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |doi= |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The garden backgrounds of the tapestries are rich in floral imagery, featuring the "[[millefleur]]s" background style of a variety of small botanic elements. Invented by the weavers of the Gothic age, it became popular during the late medieval era and declined after the early Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than a hundred plants represented in the tapestries, scattered across the green backgrounds of the panels, eighty-five of which have been identified by botanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1983 |isbn=0-87099-147-7 |location=New York |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The particular flowers featured in the tapestries reflect the tapestries' major themes. In the unicorn series, the hunt takes place within a ''[[Hortus conclusus]]'', literally meaning "enclosed garden," which was not only a representation of a secular, physical garden, but a connection with the [[Annunciation]].
[[File:WLA metmuseum The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle'', detail]]

The tapestries were very probably woven in Brussels, which was an important center of the tapestry industry in medieval Europe. An example of the remarkable work of the Brussels looms, the tapestries' mixture of silk and metallic thread with wool gave them a fine quality and brilliant color. The wool was widely produced in the rural areas around Brussels, and a common primary material in tapestry weaving. The silk, however, was costly and hard to obtain, indicating the wealth and social status of the tapestry owner.

==Subjects==
The seven tapestries are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Flora of the unicorn tapestries |date=1947 |first1=E. J. |last1=Alexander |first2=Carol H. |last2=Woodward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''The Start of the Hunt''
# ''The Unicorn at the Fountain''
# ''The Unicorn Attacked''
# ''The Unicorn Defending Himself''
# ''The Unicorn Is Captured by the Virgin'' (two fragments)
# ''The Unicorn Killed and Brought to the Castle''
# ''The Unicorn in Captivity''
From the collection of Morgan and Rochefoucauld, the tapestries comprise five large pieces, one small piece, and two fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mobility associated with the size formed an essential consideration of the function of the tapestry in the medieval age and different sizes of Gothic tapestries served as the decoration to fit chosen walls in the middle age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern research, based on the possibility that the unicorn tapestries were designed for use as a bedroom ensemble, the five large pieces fit the back area of wall, while the other two pieces serve as the coverlet, or overhead canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |date=2010 |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources give slightly different titles and different sequences.  The factors that affect this are primarily threefold.  Firstly the nature of the tapestries themselves, which exhibit differences of manufacture and size, suggesting that the first and last may be independent works or form a different series. Secondly the nature of the classic stag hunt, usually cited to ''Livre de la Chasse'' by [[Gaston III, Count of Foix]].&lt;ref&gt;Bibliotheque National, Paris, Ms. fr. 616&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly the established story of the unicorn hunt, where the unicorn is made docile by a virgin, and then captured, wounded or killed. In addition the symbolism of the story needs to be taken into account.

==Provenance==
The tapestries were owned by the [[Duc de La Rochefoucauld|La Rochefoucauld]] family of France for several centuries, with first mention of them showing up in the family's 1728 inventory.  At that time five of the tapestries were hanging in a bedroom in the family's [[Château de Verteuil, Charente]] and two were stored in a hall adjacent to the chapel.  The tapestries were highly believed woven for François, the son of Jean II de La Rochefoucauld and Marguerite de Barbezieux. And there was a possible connection between the letters A and E and the La Rochefoucauld, which are interpreted as the first and last of Antoine's name, who was the son of François, and his wife, Antoinette of Amboise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |date=1973–1974 |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |url= |journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the French Revolution the tapestries were looted from the château and reportedly were used to cover potatoes – a period during which they apparently sustained damage.  By the end of the 1880s they were again in the possession of the family.  A visitor to the château described them as quaint 15th century wall hangings, yet showing "incomparable freshness and grace".  The same visitor records the set as consisting of seven pieces, though one was by that time in fragments and being used as bed curtains.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman (1973), 241&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] bought them in 1922 for about one million US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=Richard|date=11 April 2005|title=Capturing the Unicorn|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/11/050411fa_fact|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the tapestries hung in Rockefeller's house until [[The Cloisters]] was built when he donated them to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1938 and at the same time secured for the collection the two fragments the La Rochefauld family had retained. The set now hangs in [[The Cloisters]] which houses the museum's medieval collection.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
In 1998 the tapestries were cleaned and restored. In the process, the [[linen]] backing was removed, the tapestries were bathed in water, and it was discovered that the colours on the back were in even better condition than those on the front (which are also quite vivid). A series of high resolution [[digital photograph]]s were taken of both sides using a customised scanning device suspending a linear array scan camera and lighting over the delicate textile. The front and back of the tapestries were photographed in approximately three-foot square segments. The largest tapestry required up to 24 individual 5000 × 5000 pixel images. Merging the massive data stored in these photos required the efforts of two mathematicians, the [[Chudnovsky brothers]].

==Recreation==
[[Historic Scotland]] commissioned a set of seven hand-made tapestries for [[Stirling Castle]], a recreation of ''The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries'', as part of a project to furnish the castle as it was in the 16th century.  It was part-funded by the Quinque Foundation of the United States.[[File:Replica of 'The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle' tapestry, hanging in Mary of Guise's Inner Hall in the Royal Palace at Stirling Castle..JPG|thumb|''The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle'' tapestry, hanging in [[Mary of Guise]]'s Inner Hall in the Royal Palace at [[Stirling Castle]].]]

All seven currently hang in the Queen's Inner Hall in the Royal Palace.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stirlingcastle.gov.uk/tapestrystory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204235521/http://www.stirlingcastle.gov.uk/tapestrystory|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-12-04|title=The Stirling Tapestries|date=|accessdate=|website=Stirling Castle|publisher=|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapestry project was managed by [[West Dean College]] in West Sussex and work began in January 2002. The weavers worked in two teams, one based at the college, the other in a purpose-built studio in the Nether Bailey of Stirling Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://singingweaver.blogspot.co.uk/2013_05_12_archive.html |title=Day Fourteen... |date=April 2013 |accessdate= |website=Singing Weaver |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three tapestries were completed in Chichester, the remainder at Stirling Castle.

Historians studying the reign of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] believe that a similar series of "Unicorn" tapestries were part of the [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection]]. The team at West Dean Tapestry visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art to inspect the originals and researched the medieval techniques, the colour palette and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.westdean.org.uk/Tapestry/Showcase/HistoricScotland.aspx |accessdate=22 April 2009 |title=Historic Scotland |publisher=The Edward James Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional techniques and materials were used with [[mercerised cotton]] taking the place of silk to preserve its colour better.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The wool was specially dyed at West Dean College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/news/mediaresources/factsheets.htm#.UyrTdvl_vnh |title=Stirling Tapestries Factsheets |date= |accessdate= |website=Historic Scotland |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Potato Harvest''''' is a painting by the French artist [[Jean-François Millet]].

==History==
Jean-François Millet was raised in the area of France known as the old province of Normandy.  He was brought up with hard out-of-door labor.  After studying to become a painter, he devoted his art to illustrating peasants farming the land.  His subjects were often taken from his surroundings or from memories from his youth.&lt;ref name="Estelle"&gt;[Estelle, M.H., Jean Francois Millet, Tredition, 2011, pp. 1-2, {{ISBN|3842434642}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1850s, Millet began incorporating his subjects into landscapes.  The Potato Harvest is one of nine works which drew international acclaim at the Exposition Universelle in 1867.&lt;ref name="William Johnston"&gt;[Johnston, W.R., Nineteenth Century Art: From Romanticism to Art Nouveau, The Walters Art Gallery, p.56, {{ISBN|1857592433}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''The Potato Harvest'' depicts peasants working in the plains between Barbizon and Chailly.  It presents a theme representative of the peasants' struggle for survival.  Millet's technique for this work incorporated paste-like pigments thickly applied over a coarsely textured canvas.&lt;ref name="William Johnston"/&gt;

==Off the Wall==
Currently, ''The Potato Harvest'' is being featured in ''Off the Wall'', an open-air exhibition on the streets of [[Baltimore]], Maryland.  A reproduction of the painting, the original is part of [[The Walters Art Museum]] collection, will be on display at Di Pasquales.&lt;ref name="Off the Wall"&gt;[http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ Walters Art Museum - Off the Wall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119005400/http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Gallery in London began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S.. The ''Off the Wall'' reproductions of the Walters' paintings are done on weather-resistant vinyl and include a description of the painting and a QR code for smart phones.&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"&gt;[Smith, T., Walters Art Museum goes of the wall, The Baltimore Sun, September 11, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Swineherd'''" ({{lang-da|Svinedrengen}}) is a literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a [[prince]] who disguises himself as a [[swineherd]] to woo an arrogant princess. The tale was first published December 20, 1841 by C. A. Reitzel in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]  in ''Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection.''  The tale appears to be original with Andersen though similar tales are known.  "The Swineherd" has been adapted to various media.

==Plot==
A poor prince wants to marry the Emperor's daughter and sends her two beautiful gifts, a nightingale and a rose. The princess rejects the humble gifts because they're real and natural, rather than artificial. The prince then disguises himself and applies for the position of [[swineherd]] at the palace. Once on the job, he creates a musical pot. The princess slogs through the mud to the swineherd's hut and pays ten kisses for the pot. When the swineherd follows the pot with the creation of a musical rattle, she pays one hundred kisses for it. The Emperor, disgusted that his daughter would kiss a swineherd for a toy, casts her out. The prince, having found the princess unworthy of his love, washes his face, dons his royal attire, and spurns the princess as her father did. The princess is left outside the palace door singing dolefully.

==Sources==
The tale appears to be Andersen's invention though the punishing of proud princesses is a stock theme in folk and fairy tales. In Basile's ''[[Pentamerone]]'' (1634) a tale tells of proud Cinziella and her wooing by a prince disguised as a gardener.  In the Grimm collections, "[[King Thrushbeard]]" is a similar tale of a royal disguising himself to woo an arrogant princess.  Andersen's tale is less sentimental than the traditional tales. In traditional tales, the woman is softened and continues to love the man once he is revealed to be royalty but in Andersen she is cast away and left alone mourning the loss of love and status.&lt;ref&gt;Opie 230-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The tale was first published by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 20 December 1841 in ''Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. Third Booklet. 1842.'' and first translated into English by [[Charles Boner]] in 1846 who published it in ''A Danish Storybook''.&lt;ref&gt;Opie 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
The tale has been adapted to various media. ''Les cent baisers'' (The Hundred Kisses), is a ballet choreographed by [[Bronislava Nijinska]] to music by Baron [[Frédéric Alfred d'Erlanger|Frederic d'Erlanger]] and a libretto by [[Boris Kochno]].  The ballet premiered at [[Covent Garden]] 18&amp;nbsp;July 1935 with [[Irina Baronova]] as the Princess and [[David Lichine]] as the Prince. The ballet was first staged in Australia by de Basil's Ballets Russes on 5&amp;nbsp;December 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiadancing.org/subjects/5261.html Australia Dancing - Cent baisers, Les]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An operatic adaptation was undertaken by [[Nino Rota]] (1911&amp;ndash;1979) called ''The Swineherd Prince'' ({{lang-it|Il Principe Porcaro}}) when he was thirteen. Britain's only permanent marionette theatre, [[Harlequin Puppet Theatre]] at [[Rhos-on-Sea]], Wales, presented "The Swineherd" in an adaptation by Eric Brammell in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puppets.uk.com/rep.htm Harlequine Puppet Theater: The Repertoire]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Soviet/Russian composer [[Boris Tchaikovsky]] wrote a suite of [[incidental music]] for a radio production of ''The Swineherd''.

Parts of the story have been used in [[Evgeny Shvarts]]'s 1934 play "The Emperor's New Clothes".

{{wikisourcelang|ta|திருக்குறள்|Tirukkural}}
The '''Tirukkural''' ({{lang-ta|திருக்குறள்}}, literally ''Sacred Verses''), or shortly '''the Kural''', is a classic [[Tamil language|Tamil]] text consisting of 1,330 couplets or [[Kural (poetic form)|Kural]]s, dealing with the everyday virtues of an individual.{{sfn|C. Blackburn, 2000|pp=449–482}}{{sfn|Pillai, 1994|p=}} It is one of the two oldest works now extant in [[Tamil Literature]] in their entirety, the other being the [[Tolkappiyam]].{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=24}} Considered one of the greatest works ever written on ethics and morality, chiefly [[secular ethics]], it is known for its universality and non-denominational nature.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} It was authored by [[Thiruvalluvar|Valluvar]], also known in full as Thiruvalluvar. The text has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. The traditional accounts describe it as the last work of the third [[Sangam literature|Sangam]], but linguistic analysis suggests a later date of 450 to 500 CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}}

Traditionally praised as "the Universal Veda" and "the Universal Code of Conduct,"{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=155–156}} the Kural emphasizes on the vital principles of [[non-violence]], [[moral vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]],{{Ref label|A|a|none}} human brotherhood, absence of desires, path of righteousness and truth, and so forth, besides covering a wide range of subjects such as moral codes of rulers, friendship, agriculture, knowledge and wisdom, sobriety, love, and domestic life.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} The work is commonly quoted in vegetarian conferences, both in [[India]] and abroad.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=10–16}} Considered as chef d'oeuvre of both Indian and world literature,{{sfn|Pyatigorsky, n.d.|p=515}} the Kural is one of the most important works in the [[Tamil language]] and is often called "the masterpiece of Tamil Literature."{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=24}} This is reflected in some of the other names by which the text is given by, such as the Work of Three Books, Modern Veda, Divine Work, Faultless Word, and Tamil Veda.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=}}

The Kural has influenced several scholars across the ethical, social, political, economical, religious, philosophical, and spiritual spheres.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=7–13}}{{sfn|Sundaramurthi, 2000|p=624}} Authors influenced by the Kural include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Constantius Joseph Beschi]], [[Karl Graul]], [[George Uglow Pope]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], and [[Yu Hsi]], many of whom have translated the work into their languages. Translated into at least 40 languages as of 2014, the Kural is one of the [[List of literary works by number of translations|most widely translated works]] in the world.{{sfn|Ashraf, n.d.}} Because the life, culture and ethics of the [[Tamil people|Tamils]] are considered to be solely defined in terms of the values set by the Kural, the government and the people of [[Tamil Nadu]] alike uphold the text with utmost reverence.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} Along with the [[Gita]], the Kural is a prime candidate nominated to be the national book of India, for which a declaration was passed at the [[Tamil Nadu Assembly]] in 2006.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=63–80}}

==Etymology==
{{main|Glossary of names for the Tirukkural}}
The term ''Tirukkural'' is a compound word made of two individual terms, ''tiru'' and ''kural''. ''Tiru'' is an honorific Tamil term that corresponds to the universally Indian, Sanskrit term ''sri'' meaning "holy, sacred, excellent, honorable, and beautiful."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} The term ''tiru'' has as many as 19 different meanings.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=vii}} ''Kural'' means something that is "short, concise, and abridged."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} Etymologically, ''kural'' is the shortened form of ''kural paattu'', which is derived from ''kuruvenpaattu'', one of the two Tamil poetic forms explained by [[Tolkappiyam]], the other one being ''neduvenpaattu''.{{sfn|Kowmareeshwari, 2012a|pp=iv–vi}} According to Winslow, ''kural'' is used as a literary term to indicate "a metrical line of 2 feet, or a distich or couplet of short lines, the first of 4 and the second of 3 feet." Thus, ''Tirukkural'' literally comes to mean "sacred couplets."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}}

The Kural is unique among ancient works that it did not have a name nor did it have any mention of the author's name in it at the time of its release at the ruler's court at the city of [[Madurai]], the seat of the [[Third Sangam|Third Tamil Sangam]].{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} The author used the title ''Muppāl'', meaning "three divisions," to present it to the King,{{sfn|Pillai, 1972|p=3}} since the work was written about the first three of the four ancient Indian aims in life, known as ''[[Puruṣārtha|purushaarthas]]'', viz., virtue, wealth and love,{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}}{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333, 4341}} with the fourth aim, namely, salvation (''moksha''), implicitly said in the last five chapters of Book I.{{sfn|Pillai, 1972|pp=5–7}} Remaining nameless for several years after its writing, the work came to be referred to by various names in the centuries that followed. Nine traditional names had already been in use to refer to the book during the time of writing of the ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]'', a eulogy written on the Kural by various poets between the 1st and 11th centuries CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=155–156}} Nevertheless, the title ''Muppāl'' remained the work's primary name until the 13th century CE.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=105}} It is estimated that the Kural has historically been known by as many as 44 names given at various periods over the millennia, making it one of the numerously titled works.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}}

==Organization of the work==
The Kural is structured into 133 chapters, each containing 10 couplets (or kurals), for a total of 1,330 couplets.{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} The 133 chapters are grouped into three parts, or "books":{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}{{sfn|Mukherjee, 1999|pp=392–393}}
* Book I – Aṟattuppāl (அறத்துப்பால்): [[Aram (Kural book)|Book of Virtue]] ([[Dharma]]), dealing with virtues independent of the surroundings (Chapters 1-38)
* Book II – Poruṭpāl (பொருட்பால்): [[Porul (Kural book)|Book of Polity]] ([[Artha]]), dealing with virtues with respect to the surroundings (Chapters 39-108)
* Book III – Kāmattuppāl (காமத்துப்பால்): [[Inbam (Kural book)|Book of Love]] ([[Kama]]), dealing with virtues involved in conjugal human love (Chapters 109-133)

Each ''kural'' or couplet contains exactly seven words, known as ''cir''s, with four ''cir''s on the first line and three on the second, following the [[Kural (poetic form)|kural]] [[Poetic metre|metre]]. A ''cir'' is a single or a combination of more than one Tamil word. For example, the term ''Thirukkural'' is a ''cir'' formed by combining the two words ''thiru'' and ''kuṛaḷ''. The book on ''Aṟam'' (virtue) contains 380 verses, that of ''Poruḷ'' (wealth) has 700 and that of ''Inbam'' (love) has 250.{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}

The overall organisation of the Kural text is based on seven ideals prescribed for a commoner besides observations of love.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} This includes 40 couplets on God, rain, ascetics, and virtue; 200 on domestic virtue; 140 on higher yet most fundamental virtue based on grace, benevolence and compassion; 250 on royalty; 100 on ministers of state; 220 on essential requirements of administration; 130 on morality, both positive and negative; and 250 on human love and passion.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

== Date ==
{{main| Dating the Tirukkural}}
The Kural has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam]], and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed). The scholars who believe this tradition, such as Somasundara Bharathiar and M Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian [[K. K. Pillay]] assigned it to the early 1st century CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}}

Linguist [[Kamil Zvelebil]] is certain that ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' does not belong to the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] period, and dates it to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} His estimate is based on the language of the text, its allusions to the earlier works, and its borrowing from some Sanskrit treatises.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=156}} Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations, that are absent in the older Sangam literature. The text also features a higher number of [[Sanskrit]] [[loan word]]s compared to these older texts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}} According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, the author was also a part of the "one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition," as a few of his verses seem to be translations of the verses in Sanskrit texts such as ''[[Dharmaśāstra|Mānavadharmaśāstra]]'' and [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthaśāstra]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=171}}

[[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] assigned the work to c. 650 CE, believing that it borrowed from some Sanskrit works of 6th century CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} Zvelebil disagrees with this assessment, pointing out that some of the words that Pillai believed to be Sanskrit loan words have now been proved to be of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin by [[Thomas Burrow]] and [[Murray Barnson Emeneau]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=171}}

In the face of incessant debate on the precise date, taking the latest of the estimated dates, the [[Government of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu government]] officially declared 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar, as suggested by [[Maraimalai Adigal]], on 18 January 1935, adding Valluvar Year to the calendar.{{sfn|''Thiruvalluvar Ninaivu Malar'', 1935|p=117}}{{Ref label|C|c|none}}

Very little is known about Valluvar, the author of the Kural. In his work ''The Smile of Murugan'', [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Scholar [[Kamil Zvelebil]] cites a tradition suggesting he was an outcaste by birth, the issue of a union between a Brahmin man and a Pariah woman. Some think that he was a weaver by caste.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} He is believed to have been born in the temple town of [[Mylapore]], a locality within the present-day [[Chennai]], and is said to be a simple weaver by profession who wrote the kurals with divine inspiration. He was married to [[Vasuki (wife of Valluvar)|Vasuki]]. The first instance of the author's name mentioned as "Valluvar" is found to be several centuries later in a song of praise called the ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]''.{{sfn|Acharya.iitm.ac.in, n.d.}} Just as the book remained unnamed at the time of its presentation at the court of the ruler, the author too did not name himself in the writing of the book. Over the centuries that followed, people started calling the work "Tirukkural" and its author as "Thiruvalluvar". [[Monsieur Ariel]], who translated the Kural text into French, thus praised it as "the book without a name by an author without a name."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} There are also claims and counter-claims as to the authorship of the book and to the exact number of couplets written by Valluvar.

Valluvar is thought to have belonged to either [[Jainism]] or [[Hinduism]]. This can be observed in his treatment of the concept of [[ahimsa]] or [[non-violence]], which is the principal concept of both the religions. Valluvar's treatment of the chapters on [[moral vegetarianism]] (or [[veganism]]){{Ref label|A|a|none}} and [[non-killing]] reflects the Jain precepts, where these are stringently enforced.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} The three parts that the Kural is divided into, namely, ''aram'' (virtue), ''porul'' (wealth) and ''inbam'' (love), aiming at attaining ''veedu'' (ultimate salvation), follow, respectively, the four foundations of Hinduism, namely, [[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]].{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} His mentioning of God [[Vishnu]] in couplets 610 and 1103 and [[Goddess Lakshmi]] in couplets 167, 408, 519, 565, 568, 616, and 617 suggests the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] beliefs of Valluvar. Other eastern beliefs of Valluvar found in the book include previous birth and rebirth, seven births, and some ancient Indian astrological concepts, among others.{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|pp=1–6}} Despite using these contemporary religious concepts of his time, Valluvar has limited the usage of these terms to a metaphorical sense to explicate the fundamental virtues and ethics, without enforcing any of these religious beliefs in practice. This, chiefly, has made the treatise earn the title ''Ulaga Podhu Marai'' (the universal scripture).{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|pp=1–6}}

There is also the recent claim by Kanyakumari Historical and Cultural Research Centre (KHCRC) that Valluvar was a king who ruled Valluvanadu in the hilly tracts of the [[Kanyakumari district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} The only other book that is attributted to Valluvar other than the Kural text is ''Gnanavetti'', a text that deals with spiritual aspects, due to which the author is also known as "Gnanavettiyan."{{sfn|Aranga Ramalingam, 1994|pp=}}

==Structural plan of the work==
[[File:Thiruvalluvar Statue at Kanyakumari 02.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=2|The statue of Valluvar, the author of the Kural text, at [[Kanyakumari]]]]
Having written by a single author, the Kural literature reveals a single structural plan.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=160}} The Kural is not an anthology for there is not any later additions to the text.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–160}} According to [[Kamil Zvelebil]], the content of the Kural text is "undoubtedly patterned."{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=163}} The entire work has been structured very carefully without an allowance for any structural gaps in the text such that every couplet remains indispensable for the structured whole. Thus, one can find two distinct meanings for every couplet in the Kural literature, namely, a structural one and a proverbial one. In their isolated form, that is, when removed from the content-structure, the couplets lose their structural meaning, the most important of the two, with the isolated distiches still remaining charming and interesting in themselves. This simply makes the isolated couplet a wise saying or a moral maxim, "a 'literary proverb' in perfect form, possessing, in varying degree, the prosodic and rhetoric qualities of gnomic poetry."{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–163}} On the other hand, within the content-structure, the couplets acquire their structural meaning in relation to other couplets, forming higher patterns, and finally, in relation to the entire work, they acquire perfection in the totality of their structure.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–163}}

According to [[Perunchithiranar (Tamil nationalist)|Pavalareru Perunchithiranar]], Valluvar has employed 28 different methods of conveying thoughts in the Kural text.{{sfn|Perunchithiranar, 1933}}

==Substance of the work==
Written with the contemporary society in view{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}} and marked by [[pragmatic idealism]],{{sfn|Top 12 Economists of India}} the Kural text is unique among the ancient literature in terms of both its poetic and its intellectual accomplishments.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|p=4333}} In poetic terms, it fuses verse and aphoristic form in diction in a "pithy, vigorous, forceful and terse" manner. In intellectual terms, it is written on the basis of [[secular ethics]], expounding a universal, moral and practical attitude towards life. Unlike religious scriptures, the Kural refrains from talking of hopes and promises of the other-worldly life. Rather it speaks of the ways of cultivating one's mind to achieve the other-worldly bliss in the present life itself. By occasionally referring to bliss beyond the worldly life, Valluvar equates what can be achieved in humanly life with what may be attained thereafter.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} Only in a couple of introductory chapters (Chapters 1 and 3) does Valluvar sound religious. Even here, he maintains a tone that could be acceptable to people of all faiths.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=36–37}}

It is believed that Valluvar composed every chapter in response to a request to produce ten best couplets on a particular subject. Nevertheless, he seldom shows any concern as to what [[similes]] and [[superlatives]] he used earlier while writing on other subjects, purposely allowing for some repetition and mild contradictions in ideas one can find in the Kural text. Despite knowing its seemingly contradictory nature from a purist point of view, Valluvar employs this method to emphasise the importance of the given code of ethic. Following are some of the instances where Valluvar employs contradictions to expound the virtues.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

* While in Chapter 93 Valluvar writes on the evils of intoxication, in Chapter 109 he uses the same to show the sweetness of love by saying love is sweeter than wine.
* To the question "What is wealth of all wealth?" Valluvar points out to two different things, namely, grace (Kural 241) and hearing (Kural 411).
* In regard to the virtues one should follow dearly even at the expense of other virtues, Valluvar points to veracity (Kural 297), not coveting another's wife (Kural 150), and not being called a slanderer (Kural 181). In essence, however, in Chapter 33 he crowns non-killing as the foremost of all virtues, pushing even the virtue of veracity to the second place (Kural 323).
* Whereas he says that one can eject what is natural or inborn in him (Kural 376), he indicates that one can overcome the inherent natural flaws by getting rid of laziness (Kural 609).
* While in Chapter 7 he asserts that the greatest gain men can obtain is by their learned children (Kural 61), in Chapter 13 he says that it is that which is obtained by self-control (Kural 122).

Nevertheless, the basic ideas of Valluvar is found in the introductory section of the Kural, which includes the first four chapters of the text. Valluvar begins this portion with the invocation of God and continues to praise the rain for being the vitalizer of all life forms on earth and describe the qualities of a righteous person, before concluding the introduction by emphasizing the value of ''aṟam'' or virtue.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}} Valluvar extols rain next only to God for it provides food and serves as the basis of a stable economic life by aiding in agriculture, which Valluvar asserts as the most important economic activity later in Book II of the Kural text.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}}

The entire writing of all the three books of the Kural text bases ''aṟam'' or [[dharma]] as its cornerstone, which resulted in the Kural being referred to simply as ''Aṟam''.{{sfn|Alathur Kilar|pp=Verse 34}}{{sfn|Kowmareeshwari, 2012b|pp=46–47}}{{sfn| Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|p=55}} Contrary to what the [[Manusmriti]] says, Valluvar holds that ''aṟam'' is common for all, irrespective of whether the person is a bearer of [[palanquin]] or the rider in it.{{sfn|Valluvar|pp=Verse 37}}{{sfn|Visveswaran, 2016|pp=ix–xi}} The greatest of virtues according to Valluvar is [[non-killing]], followed by [[veracity (ethics)|veracity]],{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4341–4342}}{{sfn|Sethupillai, 1956|pp=34–36}} which he plainly indicates in couplet 323,{{sfn|Valluvar|pp=Verse 323}} and the two greatest sins that Valluvar feels very strongly are ingratitude and [[meat-eating]].{{sfn|Sethupillai, 1956|pp=34–36}}{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|p=13}}{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963|pp=162–163}} As observed by [[P. S. Sundaram]] in the introduction to his work, while "all other sins may be redeemed, but never ingratitude," Valluvar couldn't understand "how anyone could wish to fatten himself by feeding on the fat of others."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|p=13}} The Kural differs from every other work on morality in that it follows ethics, surprisingly a divine one, even in its Book of Love.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=26}} In the words of [[Gopalkrishna Gandhi]], Valluvar maintains his views on personal morality even in the Book of Love, where one can normally expect greater poetic leniency, by describing the hero as "a one-woman man" without concubines.{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}}

==Comparison with other ancient literature==
[[File:Tirukkural manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Palm leaf manuscript of the Tirukkural]]
Unlike the mystic philosopher of [[Lao Tzu]] or the law-giving prophets of the [[Judaeo-Christian tradition]], Valluvar remained a philosopher concerning with the day-to-day conduct of a common individual.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} Scholars compares the codes of virtue, nobility, propriety, just governance, conduct, social obligations, self-control, education and knowledge with other ancient thoughts such as the Confucian sayings in [[Lun Yu]], [[Hitopadesa]], [[Panchatantra]], [[Manusmriti]], [[Tirumandiram]], [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible, sayings of the [[Buddha]] in [[Dhammapada]], and the ethical works of Persian origin such as [[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]] and [[Bustan (book)|Bustan]], in addition to the holy books of various religions.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

===Similarities with ancient Indian literature===
Several ancient Indian literature such as [[Manusmriti]], [[Kautilya]]'s [[Arthashastra]], [[Kamandaka]]'s [[Nitisara]] bear likeness with the second book (''Porul''), the book on wealth, of the Kural text, while [[Vatsyayana]]'s [[Kamasutra]] shares similarities with ''Inbam'', the third book of the Kural text (the book on love).{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} However, the attitude and approach of Valluvar in expounding the virtues remain entirely different from any of these contemporary works. While the Artha Shastra is based on subtle statecraft, the ''Porul'' of the Kural text bases morality and benevolence as its cornerstones.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|pp=901–902}} The social hierarchies and discrimination found in Manusmriti are contrasted with Valluvar's concept of universal brotherhood and oneness of humanity. Unlike Kamasutra, which is all about eros and techniques of sexual fulfillment, the Kural text of ''Inbam'' remains a poetic appreciation of flowering human love as explicated by the Sangam period's concept of intimacy, known as ''aham'' in the Tamil literary tradition.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}

===Similarities with Confucian thoughts===
The Kural text and the [[Confucianism|Confucian sayings]] recorded in the classic [[Analects|Analects of Chinese]] (called ''Lun Yu'', meaning "Sacred Sayings") resemble each other in many ways. Both Valluvar and [[Confucius]] focused on the behaviors and moral conducts of a common person. Similar to Valluvar, Confucius advocated legal justice embracing human principles, courtesy, and [[filial piety]], besides the virtues of [[wiktionary:benevolence|benevolence]], [[righteousness]], [[loyalty]] and [[trustworthiness]] as foundations of life.{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|pp=104-111}} Incidentally, Valluvar differed from Confucius in two respects. Firstly, unlike Confucius, Valluvar was also a poet. Secondly, Confucius did not deal with the subject of [[conjugal love]], for which Valluvar devoted an entire division in his work.{{sfn|Anonymous|1999|p=vii}}

==Publication of the work==
[[File:Thirukkural Madras 1812.JPG|thumb|150px|First known edition of the Kural, published in Tamil, in 1812.]]

Save for the highly educated circle of scholars and elites outside the Tamil land, the Kural remained largely unknown to the outside world for close to one-and-a-half millennia. It had been passed on as word of mouth from parents to their children and from preceptors to their students for generations within the Tamil-speaking regions of [[South India]]. It was not until 1595 when the first translation of the work appeared in [[Malayalam]] that the work became known to the wider circle outside the Tamil-speaking communities.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The work first came to print in 1812, with the Kural text getting published in Tamil, chiefly by the efforts of the then Collector of Madras [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], who established the "Chennai Kalvi Sangam."{{sfn|S. Blackburn, 2006|pp=92–95}} It was published by Thanjai Gyanaprakash.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It was only in 1835 that Indians were permitted to establish printing press. Thus, the Kural became the first book to be published in Tamil.{{sfn|Madhavan, ''The Hindu'', 21 June 2010}} Soon, Mahalinga Iyer published the first 24 chapters of the Kural with commentaries for the first time. In 1850, the complete work of the Kural was published with commentaries by [[Vedagiri Mudaliar]], who published a revised version later in 1853. This publication was later used by [[Ramalinga Adigal|'Vallalar' Ramalinga Adigal]] to teach the Kural to the masses.{{sfn|Kolappan, ''The Hindu'', 3 October 2018}}

==Commentaries and translations==
{{main|Translations of Tirukkural|List of Tirukkural translations by language|Tirukkural translations into English}}

===Commentaries===
The Kural is arguably the most reviewed of all works in [[Tamil literature]], and almost every notable scholar has written commentaries (explanation in prose or verse) on it.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{Ref label|D|d|none}} According to R. Ilankumaran, there are four requisites necessary to write commentaries to the Kural text:{{sfn|Ilankumaran, 2018|p=xi}}
# The awareness that the meaning of everything that is written in the Kural text is available in the work itself
# A workable knowledge of the [[Tolkappiam]]
# A thorough knowledge of the [[Sangam literature]] and [[Sangam landscape|landscape]]
# A practical knowledge of how things work in their nature.

There have been several commentaries written on the Kural over the centuries. Many poets of the first few centuries of the [[common era]] used various Kural couplets to illustrate their works. These include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Seethalai Satthanar]], [[Sekkilar]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]].{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} These can be considered the first commentaries to the Kural text, albeit in verse form and incomplete.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} In the centuries that followed, numerous commentators of various other works employed Kural couplets to elaborate their ideas, providing explanations to the couplets in the process, both in verse and in prose forms.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} These include Adiyarkku Nallar, Nacchinaarkiniyar, Mayilainathar, and Shankara Namacchivayar.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=338}}

Exclusive commentaries on the Kural text started appearing much later. There were at least ten medieval commentaries written by pioneer poets of which only six are available today. The [[Ten Medieval Commentators|ten canonical medieval commentators]] include [[Manakkudavar]], [[Dharumar]], [[Dhamatthar]], [[Nacchar]], [[Paridhi|Paridhiyar]], [[Thirumalaiyar]], [[Mallar (poet)|Mallar]], Kaliperumal or [[Pari Perumal]], [[Kaalingar]], and [[Parimelazhagar]], all of whom lived between the 10th and the 13th centuries CE. Of these, only the works of Manakkudavar, Paridhi, Kaalingar, Pari Perumal, and Parimelazhagar are available today. The works of Dharumar, Dhaamatthar, and Nacchar are only partially available. The commentaries by Thirumalaiyar and Mallar are lost. The pioneer among these commentators are Parimelazhagar and Manakkudavar.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|p=2}} Besides these, there are three more medieval commentaries written by unknown authors.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} One of them was published under the title "Palaiya Urai" (meaning ancient commentary), while the second one was based on Paridhiyar's commentary.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} The third one was published in 1991 under the title "Jaina Urai" (meaning Jaina commentary) by [[Saraswathi Mahal Library]] in [[Thanjavur]].{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|p=129}} Following these medieval commentaries, there are at least 21 [[venba]] commentaries to the Kural, including Somesar Mudumoli Venba, Murugesar Muduneri Venba, Sivasiva Venba, Irangesa Venba, and Vadamalai Venba, all of which are considered commentaries in verse form.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=ix}}

Several modern commentaries started appearing in the 19th and the 20th centuries. Some of the commentaries of the 20th century include those by [[Iyothee Thass]], [[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]], [[Thiru Vi Ka]], [[Bharathidasan]], [[M. Varadarajan]], [[Namakkal kavignar]], [[Thirukkuralar V. Munusamy]], [[Devaneya Pavanar]], [[Karunanidhi|M. Karunanithi]], and [[Solomon Pappaiah]].

===Translations===
[[File:Tirukkural.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas-relief]] inscriptions of the Kural couplets at [[Valluvar Kottam]]]]
The first translation known of the Kural text is a Malayalam translation that appeared in about 1595. However, the manuscript remained unpublished and was first reported by the Annual Report of the Cochin Archeological Department for the year 1933 to 1934.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The [[Christian missionaries]] who came to [[India]] during the [[colonial era]], inspired by the similarities of the [[Christian ideal]]s found in the Kural, started translating the text into various [[European languages]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=28–47}} The [[Latin]] translation of the Kural, the first of the translations into European languages, was made by [[Constanzo Beschi|Constantius Joseph Beschi]] in 1730. However, he translated only the first two parts, viz., virtue and wealth, leaving out the section on love assuming that it would be inappropriate for a Christian missionary to do so. The first French translation was brought about by an unknown author by about 1767 that went unnoticed. The first available French version was by Monsieur Ariel in 1848. Again, he did not translate the whole work but only parts of it. The first [[German language|German]] translation was made by [[Karl Graul|Dr. Karl Graul]], who published it in 1856 both at [[London]] and [[Leipzig]]. Graul's translation was unfortunately incomplete due to his premature death.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=30–31}} The first, and incomplete, [[English language|English]] translations were made by N. E. Kindersley in 1794 and then by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] in 1812. While Kindersley translated a selection of the Kural text, Ellis translated 120 couplets in all—69 of them in verse and 51 in prose.{{sfn|S. Blackburn, 2006|pp=92–95}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1992|pp=}} [[William Henry Drew (Christian missionary)|W. H. Drew]] translated the first two parts in prose in 1840 and 1852, respectively. It contained the original Tamil text of the Kural, Parimelazhagar's commentary, Ramanuja Kavirayar's amplification of the commentary and Drew's English prose translation. However, Drew was able to translate only 630 couplets, and the remaining were made by [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]], a native missionary. Like Beschi, Drew did not translate the part on love.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=31}} The first complete English translation of the Kural was the one by [[George Uglow Pope]] in 1886, which brought the Kural to the western world.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=32}}

By the end of the 20th century, there were about 24 translations of the Kural in English alone, by both native and non-native scholars, including those by [[V. V. S. Aiyar]], [[K. M. Balasubramaniam]], [[Shuddhananda Bharati]], [[A. Chakravarti]], [[M. S. Purnalingam Pillai]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[P. S. Sundaram]], [[V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar]], [[G. Vanmikanathan]], [[Kasturi Srinivasan]], [[S. N. Sriramadesikan]], and [[K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=36}} At present, the Kural has been translated into 37 languages.{{sfn|Ashraf, n.d.}} It is also said that the work has also been translated into [[Vaagri Booli language|Vaagri Booli]], the language of the [[Narikurava|Narikuravas]], a tribal community in Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 25 March 2013}} It is the most translated Tamil literature and also the most translated non-religious text of India.

===Translational difficulties===
With a highly compressed prosodic form, the Kural text employs the intricately complex ''[[Kural (poetic form)|Kural venba]]'' [[Poetic metre|metre]], known for its eminent suitability to gnomic poetry.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=166}} This form, which Zvelebil calls "a marvel of brevity and condensation," is closely connected with the structural properties of the Tamil language and has historically presented extreme difficulties to its translators.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=167}} Talking about translating the Kural into other languages, [[Herbert Arthur Popley]] observes, "it is impossible in any translation to do justice to the beauty and force of the original."{{sfn|Popley, 1931|p=x}} Zvelebil claims that it is impossible to truly appreciate the maxims found in the Kural couplets through a translation but rather that the Kural has to be read and understood in its original Tamil form.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}}

Besides these inherent difficulties in translating the Kural, some scholars have attempted to either read their own ideas into the Kural couplets or deliberately misinterpret the message to make it conform to their preconceived notions. The Latin translation by [[Constantius Joseph Beschi|Father Beshi]], for instance, contains several such mistranslations noticed by modern scholars. According to V. Ramasamy, "Beschi is purposely distorting the message of the original when he renders பிறவாழி as ‘the sea of miserable life’ and the phrase பிறவிப்பெருங்கடல் as ‘sea of this birth’ which has been translated by others as ‘the sea of many births’. Beschi means thus ‘those who swim the vast sea of miseries’. The concept of rebirth or many births for the same soul is contrary to Christian principle and belief."{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=33}}

==Memorials==
[[File:இலண்டன் திருவள்ளுவர்.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Valluvar at SOAS, [[University of London]].]]
The Kural text and its author have been highly venerated over the centuries. In the early 16th century, a [[Thiruvalluvar Temple|temple]] was constructed in [[Mylapore]], [[Chennai]], in honor of Valluvar. It was extensively renovated in the 1970s.{{sfn|Chakravarthy and Ramachandran, 2009}} There are also temples for Valluvar at [[Periya Kalayamputhur (Dindigul district)|Periya Kalayamputhur]], [[Thondi]], [[Kanjoor|Kanjoor Thattanpady]], [[Senapathy village (Idukki district)|Senapathy]], and [[Vilvarani (Tiruvannamalai district)|Vilvarani]].{{sfn|Vedanayagam, 2017|p=113}}

In 1976, [[Valluvar Kottam]], a monument to honor the Kural literature and its author, was constructed in [[Chennai]]. The chief element of the monument includes a 39-m-high chariot, a replica of the chariot in the temple town of [[Thiruvarur]], and it contains a life-size statue of Valluvar. All the 1,330 verses of the Kural text are inscribed on bas-relief in the corridors in the main hall.

Statues of Valluvar have been erected across the globe, including the ones at [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]], Chennai, [[Bengaluru]], [[Haridwar]], [[Puttalam]], [[Singapore]], and [[London]].{{sfn|Vedanayagam, 2017|pp=110–111}} The tallest of these is the 133-feet (40.6&amp;nbsp;m) stone [[Thiruvalluvar Statue|statue of Valluvar]] erected in 2000 atop a small island in the town of Kanyakumari on the southernmost tip of the [[Indian peninsula]], at the confluence of the [[Bay of Bengal]], the [[Arabian Sea]], and the [[Indian Ocean]].{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 2 January 2000}} This statue is currently India's 25th tallest.

==Reception==
{{main|Praise of Tirukkural}}
[[File:Valluva-nayanar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|right|An ancient portrait of Valluvar]]
While it has been widely acknowledged that Valluvar was of [[Jain]] origin{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} and the Kural to its most part was inspired from [[Jain philosophy|Jain]], [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] and other [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient Indian philosophies]],{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}}{{sfn|Venkataramanan, ''The Hindu'', 12 January 2018}} owing to its universality and non-denominational nature, almost every religious group in [[India]] and across the world, including [[Christianity]], has claimed the work for itself. For example, [[G. U. Pope]] speaks of the book as an "echo of the 'Sermon on the Mount.'" In the Introduction to his English translation of the Kural, Pope even claims, "I cannot feel any hesitation in saying that the Christian Scriptures were among the sources from which the poet derived his inspiration." However, the chapters on the ethics of [[moral vegetarianism]] (Chapter 26) and [[non-killing]] (Chapter 33), which the Kural emphasizes emphatically unlike the [[Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|14:3–14:29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[Abrahamic]] religious texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|5|1|end=5|style=ns|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the ethics of the Kural is rather a reflection of the [[Jain philosophy|Jaina moral code]] than of [[Christian ethics]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} J. M. Nallaswamy Pillai dismisses Pope’s statement as “an absurd literary anachronism,” citing the Kural text as “a stumbling block which can browbeat the most sublime ideas of Christian morality.”{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|pp=26–27}}

The Kural is praised for its universality across the globe. The ancient Tamil poet [[Avvaiyar]] observed, "Valluvar pierced an atom and injected seven seas into it and compressed it into what we have today as Kural."{{sfn|Avvaiyar|pp=Verse 55}}{{sfn| Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} The [[Russia]]n philosopher [[Alexander Piatigorsky]] called it chef d'oeuvre of both Indian and world literature "due not only to the great artistic merits of the work but also to the lofty humane ideas permeating it which are equally precious to the people all over the world, of all periods and countries."{{sfn|Pyatigorsky, n.d.|p=515}} [[G. U. Pope]] called its author "a bard of universal man."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2015|p=vi}} According to [[Albert Schweitzer]], "there hardly exists in the literature of the world a collection of maxims in which we find so much of lofty wisdom."{{sfn| Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Leo Tolstoy]] called it "the Hindu Kural,"{{sfn|Tolstoy, 1908}} and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] called it "a textbook of indispensable authority on moral life" and went on to say, "The maxims of Valluvar have touched my soul. There is none who has given such a treasure of wisdom like him."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Sir A. Grant]] said, "Humility, charity and forgiveness of injuries, being Christian qualities, are not described by Aristotle. Now these three are everywhere forcibly inculcated by the Tamil Moralist."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=xii (Introduction)}} [[Edward Jewitt Robinson]] said that the Kural contains all things and there is nothing which it does not contain.{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} Rev. [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]] said, "No Tamil work can ever approach the purity of the Kural. It is a standing repute to modern Tamil."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} According to [[K. M. Munshi]], "Thirukkural is a treatise par excellence on the art of living."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Sri Aurobindo]] stated, "Thirukkural is gnomic poetry, the greatest in planned conception and force of execution ever written in this kind."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Monsieur Ariel]], who translated and published the third part of the Kural to French in 1848, called it "a masterpiece of Tamil literature, one of the highest and purest expressions of human thought."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} According to Rev. [[Emmons E. White]], "Thirukkural is a synthesis of the best moral teachings of the world."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Rajaji]] commented, "It is the gospel of love and a code of soul-luminous life. The whole of human aspiration is epitomized in this immortal book, a book for all ages."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]], former [[President of India]], said, "Thirukkural is a treasure house of worldly knowledge, ethical guidance and spiritual wisdom."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}}

Along with [[Nalatiyar]], another work on ethics and morality from the Sangam period, the Kural is praised for its veracity. An age-old Tamil maxim has it that "[[banyan]] and [[neem]] maintain oral health; Four and Two maintain moral health," where "Four" and "Two" refer to the [[quatrains]] and [[couplets]] of Nalatiyar and the Kural, respectively.

==In popular culture==
With the rediscovery of the image of Valluvar in 1959, the portrait of the author with matted hair and a flowing beard, as drawn by artist K. R. Venugopal Sharma in 1960,{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}} was accepted by the state and central governments as the standardised version. It soon became a popular and the standard portrait of the poet.{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}} In 1964, the image was unveiled in the [[Indian Parliament]] by the then President of India [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]]. In 1967, the Tamil Nadu government passed an order stating that the image of Valluvar should be present in all government offices across the state of Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|Sharma, 2018|pp=41–42}}{{Ref label|E|e|none}}

The Kural does not appear to have been set in music by Valluvar. However, a number of musicians have set it to tune and several singers have rendered it in their concerts. Modern composers who have tuned the Kural couplets include [[Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri]] and [[Ramani Bharadwaj]]. Singers who have performed full-fledged Tirukkural concerts include [[M. M. Dandapani Desikar]] and [[Chidambaram C. S. Jayaraman]].{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}} [[Madurai Somasundaram]] and [[Sanjay Subramanian]] are other people who have given musical rendering of the Kural. Mayuram Vishwanatha Shastri set all the verses to music in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Music Academy Conference lectures, 2017|pp=}} In January 2016, [[Chitravina N. Ravikiran]] set the entire 1330 verses to music in a record time of 16 hours.{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}}{{sfn|''Deccan Herald'', 31 March 2018}} It can be said that it was [[Tamil cinema|cinema]] that made the general public hear Tirukkural being sung. For instance, [[K. Balachander]]'s [[Kavithalayaa Productions]] opened its films with the very first couplet of the Kural sung in the background.{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}}

Several Tirukkural conferences were conducted in the twentieth century, most famously by [[Tirukkural V. Munusamy]] in 1941{{sfn|Periyannan, 2013|p=}} and by [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] in 1949. The 1949 conference, headed by [[Thiru. V. Kalyanasundaram|Thiru. Vi. Ka]], [[T. P. Meenakshisundaram]], and [[A. Chakravarti]], was held for two days on 15 and 16 January, with several scholars and celebrities participating in it, including S. Somasundara Bharathi, Kandhasami Mudaliyar, Tirukkuralar Munusamy, C. Ilakkuvanar, S. Mutthaiyah Mudaliyar, K. Appadurai, Pulavar Kulandhai, Actor [[N. S. Krishnan]], and the later-day Chief Minister of the state [[C. N. Annadurai]].{{sfn|Veeramani, 2015|pp=326–348}}

In 1818, the then Collector of Madras [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], who had a high regard for Valluvar and his work, issued a gold coin bearing Valluvar's image when he was made in charge of the Madras treasury and mint.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}}{{Ref label|F|f|none}}{{Ref label|G|g|none}} In the late 19th century, the South Indian saint [[Vallalar]] launched a movement in [[Vadalur]] to teach Tirukkural to the masses.{{sfn|Kolappan, ''The Hindu'', 3 October 2018}}{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}} In 1968, the Tamil Nadu government made it mandatory to display a Kural couplet in all government buses.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}} The train running a distance of 2,921&amp;nbsp;kilometers between Kanyakumari and [[New Delhi]] is named by the Indian Railways as the ''[[Thirukural Express]]''.{{sfn|IndianRailInfo, n.d.}} Kural also remains an integral part of the lifestyle of Tamil-speaking populations that it is propagated through various means such as music,{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}} dance,{{sfn|Venkatasubramanian, ''The Hindu'', 26 April 2018}} street shows,{{sfn|Venkataramanan, ''The Hindu'', 22 April 2010}} recitals,{{sfn|Madhavan, ''The Hindu'', 26 August 2016}} activities,{{sfn|Ramakrishnan, ''The Hindu'', 4 September 2006}} and puzzles and riddles.{{sfn|Sujatha, ''The Hindu'', 11 July 2016}}&lt;!--Dear Fellow Editors: Add these after finding citations: drama, art, theatre, lectures, discourses, movies, media, personal chats--&gt;

The Kural remains one of the most influential texts of ancient India and the chief text of the Tamil language, influencing generations of scholars at a pan-Indian expanse.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The work had influenced people from all walks of lives, which can be inferred from the parallels found in the literatures of various languages within the Indian Subcontinent.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=50–55}} Although translations of the work into other Indian languages were not available until at least the 16th century, the work had been studied by other language scholars for centuries before the foreign invasion of India.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} With its translations into European languages starting from the early 18th century, Kural began to have a global influence. Besides numerous poets of the [[Sangam era]] including [[Avvaiyar I]] and [[Kapilar]], authors influenced by the Kural include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Seethalai Satthanar]], [[Sekkilar]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Vallalar]], [[Monsieur Ariel]], [[Constantius Joseph Beschi]], [[Karl Graul]], [[August Friedrich Caemmerer]], [[Nathaniel Edward Kindersley]], [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], [[Charles E. Gover]], [[George Uglow Pope]], [[Vinoba Bhave]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]], and [[Yu Hsi]]. Many of these authors have translated the work into their languages.{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}}{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334, 4341–4342}}

Historically, the Kural experienced a few centuries of hiatus soon after its writing, dubbed the "Dark Age," following which it enjoyed a revival period when the teachings of the Kural started to influence people greatly.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|pp=894–895}} A notable example was from the period of [[Karikalan]] during the 1st century CE, when the [[Chola dynasty|Chola ruler]] was influenced by the Kural to undertake several historically significant agricultural reforms, including reclaiming lands and building dams.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=899}} Another example was during the [[Pallava Dynasty]] when the people had to face the [[Kalabhra dynasty|Kalabhra invasion]] around 250 CE.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}}

Kural remains the only work that was honored with an exclusive work of compiled paeans in the [[Sangam literature]], authored by 55 different poets, including legendary ones.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} Kural also remains the most cited work during the [[Sangam era]] and the most quoted Tamil work ever since. Classical works such as the [[Purananuru]], [[Manimekalai]], [[Silappathikaram]], [[Periya Puranam]], and [[Kamba Ramayanam]] all cite the Kural by various names, bestowing numerous titles to the work that was originally untitled by its author.{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963|pp=16–30}} In Kamba Ramayanam, poet [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] has used as many as 1100 couplets of the Kural.{{sfn|Desikar, 1975|pp=}}

The Kural text was first included in the school syllabus by the then [[British Raj|British government]].{{sfn|TNN, ''The Times of India'', 26 July 2017}} However, only select 275 couplets have been taught to the schoolchildren between III to XII Standards.{{sfn|Ashok, ''Live Law.in'', 1 May 2016}} Attempts to include the Kural literature as a compulsory subject in schools were ineffective in the decades following [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Independence]].{{sfn|Saravanan, ''The Times of India'', 27 April 2016}} On 26 April 2016, the [[Madras High Court]] directed the state government to include all the 108 chapters of the [[Book of Aram|Books of Aram]] and [[Book of Porul|Porul]] of the Kural text in school syllabus for classes VI through XII from the academic year 2017–2018 "to build a nation with moral values."{{sfn|Saravanan, ''The Times of India'', 27 April 2016}} The court observed, "No other philosophical or religious work has such moral and intellectual approach to problems of life."{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 27 April 2016}}

The Kural has inspired many to pursue the path of ahimsa or non-violence. [[Leo Tolstoy]] was inspired by the concept of [[non-violence]] found in the Kural when he read a [[German language|German]] version of the book, who in turn instilled the concept in [[Mahatma Gandhi]] through his [[A Letter to a Hindu]] when young Gandhi sought his guidance.{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}}{{sfn|Tolstoy, 1908}} Gandhi then took to studying the Kural in prison, which eventually culminated in his starting the non-violence movement to fight against the British.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} It is said that Gandhi had learnt Tamil only to read the original text of the Kural.{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 27 April 2016}} [[Vallalar]] was inspired by the Kural at a young age and spent his whole life promoting compassion and non-violence, emphasizing on a compassionate, non-killing, and meatless way of life.{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}}{{sfn|Sivagnanam, 1974|p=96}}

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} The Kural insists on "[[moral vegetarianism]]", the doctrine that humans are morally obligated to refrain from [[Ethics of eating meat|eating meat]] or harming [[Sentience|sentient beings]],{{sfn|Parimelalhagar, 2009|pp=256–266, 314–336}} known as "veganism" since the 20th century, as described by [[Mylan Engel]] in his "The Immorality of Eating Meat" (2000).{{sfn|Engel, 2000|pp=856–889}} The concept of [[ahimsa]] or இன்னா செய்யாமை, which remains the moral foundation of veganism,{{sfn|Dinshah, 2010}} is described in the chapter on [[non-violence]] (Chapter 32).{{sfn|Parimelalhagar, 2009|pp=314–324}}

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} The couplets are generally numbered in a linear fashion across the three books, covering all the 1,330 couplets. They can also be denoted by their chapter number and couplet number within the chapter. Thus, the third couplet in Chapter 104 ([[Agriculture]]), for instance, can be numbered either as 1033 or, less commonly, as 104:3.

'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} The Valluvar Year is obtained by adding 31 years to the present [[Gregorian year]].{{sfn|''Thiruvalluvar Ninaivu Malar'', 1935|p=117}}

'''d.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}} ''Commentary'' refers to prosaic interpretations written by various scholars for the original verse form of the Kural couplets. These commentaries are chiefly written in Tamil by pioneer writers over the millennia. In highly canonical literary works and works of poetry, such as the [[Silappathikaram]] and [[Kamba Ramayanam]], commentary can also appear in verse form, often blending with the work inseparably. ''Translation'', on the other hand, refers to any interpretation, either in prose or in verse, verbatim or otherwise, of the Kural couplets in other languages. Thus, any commentary written in a language other than Tamil is considered a prose translation of the Tamil original in that particular language.

'''e.''' {{Note label|E|e|none}} [[Government of Tamil Nadu]], G. O. Ms. 1193, dated 1967.{{sfn|Sharma, 2018|pp=41–42}}

'''f.''' {{Note label|F|f|none}} A stone inscription found on the walls of a well at the Periya Palayathamman temple at [[Royapettah|Royapettai]] indicates Ellis' regard for Valluvar. It is one of the 27 wells dug on the orders of Ellis in 1818, when Madras suffered a severe drinking water shortage. In the long inscription Ellis praises Valluvar and uses a couplet from the Tirukkural to explain his actions during the drought. When he was in charge of the Madras treasury and mint, he also issued a gold coin bearing Valluvar's image. The Tamil inscription on his grave makes note of his commentary of Tirukkural.{{sfn|Mahadevan, n.d.}}

'''g.''' {{Note label|G|g|none}} The original inscription in Tamil written in the ''asiriyapa'' [[Poetic metre|metre]] and first-person perspective: (The Kural he quotes is in italics) &lt;br /&gt; சயங்கொண்ட தொண்டிய சாணுறு நாடெனும் | ஆழியில் இழைத்த வழகுறு மாமணி | குணகடன் முதலாக குட கடலளவு | நெடுநிலம் தாழ நிமிர்ந்திடு சென்னப் | பட்டணத்து எல்லீசன் என்பவன் யானே | பண்டாரகாரிய பாரம் சுமக்கையில் | புலவர்கள் பெருமான் மயிலையம் பதியான் | தெய்வப் புலமைத் திருவள்ளுவனார் | திருக்குறள் தன்னில் திருவுளம் பற்றிய் | ''இருபுனலும் வாய்த்த மலையும் வருபுனலும்'' | ''வல்லரணும் நாட்டிற் குறுப்பு'' | என்பதின் பொருளை என்னுள் ஆய்ந்து | ஸ்வஸ்திஸ்ரீ சாலிவாகன சகாப்த வரு | ..றாச் செல்லா நின்ற | இங்கிலிசு வரு 1818ம் ஆண்டில் | பிரபவாதி வருக்கு மேற் செல்லா நின்ற | பஹுதான்ய வரு த்தில் வார திதி | நக்ஷத்திர யோக கரணம் பார்த்து | சுப திநத்தி லிதனோ டிருபத்தேழு | துரவு கண்டு புண்ணியாஹவாசநம் | பண்ணுவித்தேன்.

'''Treehouse Arts Ensemble''' is a multi-disciplinary, non-profit arts organization&lt;ref name="Register-Herald1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.register-herald.com/local/x355877146/Youth-Ensemble-set-to-perform-A-Christmas-Carol-in-Beckley | title=Youth Ensemble set to perform ''A Christmas Carol'' in Beckley | work=The Register-Herald | date=November 18, 2010 | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | author=Plummer, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Beckley, West Virginia]]. It was formed in 2004 by Joshua Taylor-Martin, Chris McLaughlin and Robert S. Moore III.&lt;ref name="Register-Herald1"/&gt; Since that time, the organization has presented works of Theatre, Dance, Visual Art, and Music in Southern West Virginia. Currently the staff consists of Co-Artistic Directors Robert S.

==Overview==
The Treehouse Arts Ensemble have presented their work at Soldiers Memorial Theatre and Arts Center in Beckley, WV, at Tamarack's Hulett C. Smith Theater in Beckley, as a part of FestivAll Charleston (WV) [http://www.festivallcharleston.com FestivAll Official Site], the West Virginia Cultural Center Theatre, and at various found venues throughout Southern West Virginia.

Every summer (since 2005) the organization has operated a Youth Theater Day Camp for Tamarack: The Best of West Virginia ([http://www.tamarackwv.com Tamarack Official Site]). Emphasizing the basic elements of putting a play together, Treehouse incorporates the production of an original play with activities and lessons to not only teach children these elements, but to put them into practice as the children perform their show for an audience of friends and family. Treehouse has also participated in Tamarack's Dinner Theatre Series in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.register-herald.com/local/x519091795/Tamarack-dinner-theater-to-begin-soon | title=Tamarack dinner theater to begin soon | work=The Register-Herald | date=January 12, 2008 | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | author=Stanton, Audrey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been slated to produce "Moon Over the Brewery" for 2008's installment of the popular series.

Recently, Treehouse Arts Ensemble has focused upon an original art installation that addresses the impressions and experiences of being an American in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''''Woman with Bicycle''''' is a six-story [[Mural|wall painting]] created by the [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]] and [[muralist]] [[Knox Martin]] in 1979 under the sponsorship of the [[Public Art Fund]].

==Former Landmark==
A well-known [[New York City]] art landmark, ''Woman with Bicycle'' was located at [[Houston Street|Houston]] and [[MacDougal Street|MacDougal]] Streets in [[Manhattan]]. Vivian Raynor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in 1981 of Knox Martin and ''Woman with Bicycle'': 

{{Quote|text=The artist is best known for his repertory of signs and symbols that allude to nature and, in particular, to the female form. Flatly and freely painted in Pop colors, they have often been executed on a grand scale, as in the outdoor mural at West Houston and MacDougal Streets in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/nyregion/art-knox-martin-angry-but-more-human.html|title=ART; KNOX MARTIN: ANGRY BUT MORE HUMAN|last=Raynor|first=Vivien|date=1981-06-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-16|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=Vivian Raynor, ''The New York Times''|source=}}

"'''Young fogey'''" is a term humorously applied, in British context, to some younger-generation, rather buttoned-down{{Clarify|date=October 2017}} writers and journalists, such as [[Simon Heffer]], [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] and, for a while, [[A. N. Wilson]]. The term is attributed to [[Alan Watkins]] writing in 1984 in ''[[The Spectator]]''.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

"Young [[wikt:fogey|fogey]]" is still used to describe [[Conservatism|conservative]] young men (aged approximately between 15 and 40) who [[vintage clothing|dress in a vintage style]] (usually that of the 1920s-1930s, also known as the "Brideshead" look (after the influence of the [[Evelyn Waugh]] novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''). Young-fogeys tend towards erudite, conservative cultural pursuits, especically art and traditional architecture, rather than sports. The young-fogey style of dress also has some surface similarity with the American [[preppy]] style, but is endogenous to the [[United Kingdom]] and anglo-centric areas of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==History==
The movement reached its peak in the 1980s with champions such as [[A.N. Wilson]], [[Gavin Stamp]] and [[John Martin Robinson]] and a relatively widespread following, but has declined since. Though generally a middle class phenomenon, it had a wider influence on fashions in the 1980s. Young-fogeys are rarely rich or upper class and sometimes make a style virtue of genteel poverty, especially when rescuing old houses.&lt;ref&gt;John Martin Robinson &amp; Alexandra Artley, The New Georgian Handbook. Harpers, London, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; They often combine a conservative cultural outlook with a distate of Conservative political activity. They find [[feminism]] perpexing but are often open to [[bisexuality]] with men; even firmly heterosexual youg-fogeys have [[homosocial]] tendencies.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Often religious, their conservative outlook extends to refuting progressive theology.

Today committed young-fogeys may found amongst students at Oxford, Cambridge, [[Durham University|Durham]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[St Andrews]] universities; and at some universities in the Commonwealth, notably the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Adherents tend to concentrate in some professions: in particular the [[antique]]s and art dealing, residential estate agency, conservative classical [[architecture]] practices and certain strata of the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] churches.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Strongholds of young fogeys include the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} but they are also seen elsewhere.

==People==
Irish broadcaster [[Ryan Tubridy]], who hosts ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'', has described himself as a "young fogey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/i-wont-stay-on-late-late-show-forever-reveals-ryan-1992876.html|title=I won't stay on Late Late Show forever, reveals Ryan - Making plans: Tubridy doesn't see 'dream job' as his final TV gig|first=Caitlin|last=McBride|work=Evening Herald|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] was described as a "young fogey" after [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|his 2010 election to Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1293560/QUENTIN-LETTS-Young-fogey-whos-charmed-Lefties.html|title=Young fogey who's charmed the Lefties|first=Quentin|last=Letts|work=Daily Mail|publisher=Daily Mail and General Trust|date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer, editor, and broadcaster [[Anthony Lejeune]] was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as: "always out of period, a misfit in the modern world for whom the term 'young fogey' might have been invented".&lt;ref name=times&gt;[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/obituary-anthony-lejeune-p7vkl5hcb Anthony Lejeune.] ''The Times'', 26 March 2018.
