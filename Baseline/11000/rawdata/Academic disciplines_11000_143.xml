[[Bernard of Clairvaux]]'s '''''Apologia ad Guillelmum''''' was written in 1125 at the ostensible request of his friend and fellow monastic reformer, [[William of St-Thierry|William of Saint-Thierry]], and is the key document in the early twelfth century controversy over art, the greatest controversy over art to occur in the West previous to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Things-Greater-Importance-Clairvauxs-Apologia/dp/0812281810|title=The "Things of Greater Importance": Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia and the Medieval Attitude Toward Art|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1990-07-01|publisher=Univ of Pennsylvania Pr|isbn=9780812281811|edition=First|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian period]], there was disagreement within the Church as to the appropriateness of [[Catholic Church art|religious art]].  While the use of religious art gradually came to be accepted by the mainstream, its rejection within certain limits remained a constant throughout the Middle Ages.  In the twelfth century, certain elements within reform monasticism (especially the [[Cistercians]] but also others) saw the use of art by monks as inappropriate for a number of reasons.  Criticism of the use of monastic art was seen as a criticism of the greatest patrons of religious art of the time, traditional [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasticism (virtually all of the greatest medieval art up until this time had been religious).  Since traditional Benedictine monasticism was one of the richest and most influential segments of society—and since art was one of the great vehicles of interaction between traditional monasticism and the lay public, this interaction being an important source of wealth for monasticism—the controversy over art that arose involved far more than aesthetic questions.

The ''Apologia'' is the most articulate document we have for this controversy and one of the most important in understanding how medieval art was used and perceived.  In it, Bernard takes up five major criticisms of the use of monastic art.

== Art to attract donations ==

=== The monastic investment ===
Perhaps Bernard's harshest criticism of the monastic use of art addresses the economic base of monastic art production: the monastic investment in art for the purpose of attracting donations from the visiting public. In doing so, he takes up a number of different themes such as the justification of investing in art, art for the honor of God, the relation between material and spiritual prosperity, and the financial necessity of pilgrimage art.

=== The liturgical artwork ===
[[File:Master Of Saint Gilles - The Mass of St Gilles - WGA14485.jpg|thumb|''The Mass of Saint Giles'', by the [[Master of Saint Giles]], c. 1500 (National Gallery, London)]]
In discussing the artistic means by which the investment in art was carried out, Bernard particularly criticizes excess in art, focusing especially on excess in material, craftsmanship, size, and quantity.  In this criticism, what he most objects to is not monumental sculpture and painting but rather liturgical art, that is, works often of gold, silver, and jewels that were used in the liturgy and often in the Cult of Relics.

=== The equation between excessive art and holiness ===
In his critique of the reception of art on the part of the general public, Bernard took up the indispensable element of medieval pilgrimage art: the equation between excessive art and holiness, that is, the use of excessive art in order to create a sense of ''praesentia'' (the physical presence of the holy).

=== Art in opposition to the care of the poor ===
Following in the patristic tradition, Bernard also sees art as in opposition to the care of the poor, his most significant social objection external to monasticism properly speaking.

=== Art as a spiritual distraction to the monk ===
One of Bernard's most important criticisms of the monastic use of art is that of art as a spiritual distraction to the monk.  Aside from simple distraction, this criticism includes such dangers to the medieval monk as curiosity and materiality.

=== To Whom the Apologia Was Addressed ===
While the traditional view has been that the ''Apologia'' was directed at the art of the monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] in particular and that of other offending Cluniac and traditional Benedictine monasteries in general, more recent scholarship has shown that the ''Apologia'' was instead directed at not only all of traditional monasticism but also marginal traditional Benedictine monasteries, the new ascetic orders ([[Carthusians]], [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertines]], [[Premonstratensians]], and so on), and Bernard's own [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1988-01-01|title=Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia as a Description of Cluny, and the Controversy over Monastic Art|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/767000|journal=Gesta|volume=27|issue=1/2|pages=125–132|doi=10.2307/767000|issn=0016-920X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is small, and generally naturalistic in style, avoiding iconic elements like the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], which is barely discernible.]]

The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  The [[Lutheran]] churches, as they developed, accepted a limited role for larger works of art in churches,&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; and also encouraged prints and book illustrations.  [[Calvinist]]s remained steadfastly opposed to art in churches, and suspicious of small printed images of religious subjects, though generally fully accepting secular images in their homes. 

In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

==Art and the Reformation==
[[File:Wittenberg Stadtkirche Cranachalter.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Cranach the Elder]]'s Altarpiece at [[Wittenberg]]. An early Lutheran work depicting leading Reformers as Apostles at the [[Last Supper]].]]
[[File:Altaarretabel Domkerk.JPG|thumb|300px|Altar piece in [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht]], attacked by Calvinists in the [[Beeldenstorm]] in 1566. This [[retable]] became visible again after restoration in 1919 removed the false wall placed in front of it.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] was a religious movement that occurred in Western Europe during the 16th century that resulted in a divide in Christianity between Roman Catholics and Protestants. This movement "created a North-South split in Europe, where generally Northern countries became Protestant, while Southern countries remained Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;''The Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Historicist and ''Causes of the Reformation.'' New Advent.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformation produced two main branches of [[Protestantism]]; one was the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of [[Martin Luther]], and the other the [[Reformed Churches]], which followed the ideas of [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  Out of these branches grew three main sects, the [[Lutheran]] tradition, as well as the [[Continental Reformed]] and [[Anglican]] traditions, the latter two following the Reformed (Calvinist) faith.&lt;ref name="Picken2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Picken|first=Stuart D.B.|title=Historical Dictionary of Calvinism|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=9780810872240|page=1|quote=While Germany and the Scandinavian countries adopted the Lutheran model of church and state, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Hungary, what is now the Czech Republic, and Scotland created Reformed Churches based, in varying ways, on the model Calvin set up in Geneva. Although England pursued the Reformation ideal in its own way, leading to the formation of the Anglican Communion, the theology of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England were heavily influenced by Calvinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans and Reformed Christians had different views regarding religious imagery.&lt;ref name="Nuechterlein2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuechterlein|first=Jeanne Elizabeth|title=Holbein and the Reformation of Art|accessdate=29 April 2018|year=2000|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] in Germany allowed and encouraged the display of a restricted range of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the "ancient, apostolic church".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt; The use of images was one of the issues where Luther strongly opposed the more radical [[Andreas Karlstadt]].  For a few years Lutheran altarpieces like [[Last Supper (Cranach)|the ''Last Supper'' by the younger Cranach]] were produced in Germany, especially by Luther's friend [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], to replace Catholic ones, often containing portraits of leading reformers as the apostles or other protagonists, but retaining the traditional [[depiction of Jesus]]. As such, "Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior."&lt;ref name="Spicer2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spicer|first=Andrew|title=Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe|date=5 December 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781351921169|page=237|quote=As it developed in north-eastern Germany, Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior. This much is evident from the background of an epitaph pained in 1615 by Martin Schulz, destined for the Nikolaikirche in Berlin (see Figure 5.5.).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans proudly employed the use of the [[crucifix]] as it highlighted their high view of the [[Theology of the Cross]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarquardtJordan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marquardt|first1=Janet T.|last2=Jordan|first2=Alyce A.|title=Medieval Art and Architecture after the Middle Ages|date=14 January 2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443803984|page=71|quote=In fact, Lutherans often justified their continued use of medieval crucifixes with the same arguments employed since the Middle Ages, as is evident from the example of the altar of the Holy Cross in the Cistercian church of Doberan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories grew up of "indestructible" images of Luther, that had survived fires, by divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 89&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Lutherans, "the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image."&lt;ref name="Dixon2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=C. Scott|title=Contesting the Reformation|date=9 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|language=English|isbn=9781118272305|page=146|quote=According to Koerner, who dwells on Lutheran art, the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand there was a wave of [[Iconoclasm#Reformation iconoclasm|iconoclasm]], or the destruction of religious imagery.  This began very early in the Reformation, when students in [[Erfurt]] destroyed a wooden altar in the [[Franciscan]] [[friary]] in December 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 19, note 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Reformed Christianity showed consistent hostility to religious images, as [[idolatry]], especially [[sculpture]] and large paintings.  Book illustrations and prints were more acceptable, because they were smaller and more private.   Reformed leaders, especially [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], actively eliminated imagery from churches within the control of their followers, and regarded the great majority of religious images as idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/html/institutes/index.html Institutes, 1:11, section 7 on crosses]&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction was often extremely divisive and traumatic within communities, an unmistakable physical manifestation, often imposed from above, that could not be ignored.  It was just for this reason that reformers favoured a single dramatic ''coup'', and many premature acts in this line sharply increased subsequent hostility between Catholics and Calvinists in communities{{snd}} for it was generally at the level of the city, town or village that such actions occurred, except in England and Scotland.  

But reformers often felt impelled by strong personal convictions, as shown by the case of Frau Göldli, on which Zwingli was asked to advise.  She was a Swiss lady who had once made a promise to [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|Saint Apollinaris]] that if she recovered from an illness she would donate an image of the saint to a local convent, which she did. Later she turned Protestant, and feeling she must reverse what she now saw as a wrong action, she went to the convent church, removed the statue and burnt it. Prosecuted for [[blasphemy]], she paid a small fine without complaint, but flatly refused to pay the additional sum the court ordered be paid to the convent to replace the statue, putting her at risk of serious penalties.  Zwingli's letter advised trying to pay the nuns a larger sum on condition they did not replace the statue, but the eventual outcome is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of his life, after iconoclastic shows of force became a feature of the early phases of the [[French Wars of Religion]], even Calvin became alarmed and criticised them, realizing that they had become counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;      
[[File:St. Michaelis Oberkleen Blick nach Westen 02.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Daniel Hisgen]]'s paintings are mostly cycles on the parapets of Lutheran church galleries.  Here the Creation (left) to the [[Annunciation]] can be seen.]]

Subjects prominent in Catholic art other than Jesus and events in the [[Christian Bible|Bible]], such as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints were given much less emphasis or disapproved of in Protestant theology.  As a result, in much of northern Europe, the Church virtually ceased to commission figurative art, placing the dictation of content entirely in the hands of the artists and lay consumers.  Calvinism even objected to non-religious [[funerary art]], such as the [[heraldry]] and effigies beloved of the Renaissance rich.&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Where there was religious art, iconic images of [[Christ]] and scenes from the Passion became less frequent, as did portrayals of the saints and clergy.  Narrative scenes from the Bible, especially as book illustrations and prints, and, later, moralistic depictions of modern life were preferred. Both Cranachs painted allegorical scenes setting out Lutheran doctrines, in particular a series on ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]''.  [[Daniel Hisgen]], a German [[Rococo]] painter of the 18th century in [[Upper Hesse]], specialized in cycles of biblical paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in Lutheran churches with an upper gallery, a less prominent position that satisfied Lutheran scruples.  Wooden organ cases were also often painted with similar scenes to those in Catholic churches.

Lutherans strongly defended their existing sacred art from a new wave of Calvinist-on-Lutheran iconoclasm in the second half of the century, as Calvinist rulers or city authorities attempted to impose their will on Lutheran populations in the "[[Second Reformation]]" of about 1560-1619.&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somehwat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michalski, 84.

A major theological difference between Protestantism and [[Catholicism]] is the question of [[transubstantiation]], or the literal transformation of the Communion wafer and wine into the body and blood of Christ, though both Lutheran and Reformed Christians affirmed the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], the former as a [[sacramental union]] and the latter as a [[pneumatic presence]].&lt;ref name="MattoxRoeber2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattox|first1=Mickey L.|last2=Roeber|first2=A. G.|title=Changing Churches: An Orthodox, Catholic, and Lutheran Theological Conversation|date=27 February 2012|publisher=Wm. B.

They are at the same time body and blood, bread and wine. This divine food is given, more-over, not just for the strengthening of faith, nor only as a sign of our unity in faith, nor merely as an assurance of the forgiveness of sin. Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The "real presence" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and mantained. Intimate union with Christ, in other words, leads directly to the most intimate communion in his holy body and blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protestant churches that were not participating in the iconoclasm often selected as altarpieces scenes depicting the Last Supper.  This helped the worshippers to recall their theology behind the [[Eucharist]], as opposed to Catholic churches, which often chose crucifixion scenes for their altarpieces to remind the worshippers that the sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Mass were one and the same, via the literal transformation of the Eucharist.

The Protestant Reformation also capitalized on the popularity of [[printmaking]] in northern Europe. Printmaking allowed images to be mass-produced and widely available to the public at low cost. This allowed for the widespread availability of visually persuasive imagery. The Protestant church was therefore able, as the Catholic Church had been doing since the early 15th century, to bring their theology to the people, and religious education was brought from the church into the homes of the common people, thereby forming a direct link between the worshippers and the divine.

There was also a violent propaganda war fought partly with [[popular prints]] by both sides; these were often highly scurrilous caricatures of the other side and their doctrines.  On the Protestant side, portraits of the leading reformers were popular, and their likenesses sometimes represented the Apostles and other figures in Biblical scenes such as the [[Last Supper]].

== Genre and landscape ==

After the early years of the reformation, artists in Protestant areas painted far fewer religious subjects for public display, although there was a conscious effort to develop a Protestant [[iconography]] of Bible illustration in book illustrations and [[old master print|prints]].  In the early Reformation artists, especially [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger|Younger]] and [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], made paintings for churches showing the leaders of the reformation in ways very similar to Catholic saints.  Later Protestant taste turned from the display in churches of religious scenes, although some continued to be displayed in homes.  There was also a reaction against large images from classical mythology, the other manifestation of high style at the time.  This brought about a style that was more directly related to accurately portraying the present times. The traditions of landscapes and genre paintings that would fully flower in the 17th century began during this period.

[[Peter Bruegel]] (1525–1569) of Flanders is the great genre painter of his time, who worked for both Catholic and Protestant patrons.  In most of his paintings, even when depicting religious scenes, most space is given to landscape or peasant life in 16th century Flanders.  Bruegel’s ''Wedding Feast'', portrays a Flemish-peasant wedding dinner in a barn, which makes no reference to any religious, historical or classical events, and merely gives insight into the everyday life of the Flemish peasant. Another great painter of his age, [[Lucas van Leyden]] (1489–1533), is known mostly for his [[engraving]]s, such as ''The Milkmaid'', which depicts peasants with milk cows.  This engraving, from 1510, well before the Reformation,  contains no reference to religion or [[classicism]], although much of his other work features both.

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 011.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter Bruegel]]'s ''Peasant Wedding Feast''.]]
Bruegel was also an accomplished landscape painter. Frequently Bruegel painted agricultural landscapes, such as ''Summer'' from his famous set of the seasons, where he shows peasants harvesting wheat in the country, with a few workers taking a lunch break under a nearby tree. This type of landscape painting, apparently void of religious or classical connotations, gave birth to a long line of northern European landscape artists, such as [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].

With the great development of the engraving and printmaking market in [[Antwerp]] in the 16th century, the public was provided with accessible and affordable images. Many artists provided drawings to book and print publishers, including Bruegel. In 1555 Bruegel began working for ''The Four Winds'', a publishing house owned by [[Hieronymus Cock]]. ''The Four Winds'' provided the public with almost a thousand [[etching]]s and engravings over two decades. Between 1555 and 1563 Bruegel supplied Cock with almost 40 drawings, which were engraved for the Flemish public.

The courtly style of [[Northern Mannerism]] in the second half of the century has been seen as partly motivated by the desire of rulers in both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and France to find a style of art that could appeal to members of the courtly elite on both sides of the religious divide.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, 98-101 on Rudolf, and Strong, Pt. 2, Chapter 3 on France, especially pp. 98-101, 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus religious controversy had the rather ironic effect of encouraging [[classical mythology]] in art, since though they might disapprove, even the most stern Calvinists could not credibly claim that 16th century mythological art really represented idolatry.

==Council of Trent==
[[File:Last Judgement (Michelangelo).jpg|thumb|[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]] fresco in the [[Sistine Chapel]] by [[Michelangelo]] (1534-41) came under persistent attack in the [[Counter-Reformation]] for, among other things, nudity (later painted over for several centuries), not showing Christ seated or bearded, and including the pagan figure of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]].]]

During the Reformation a great divergence arose between the [[Catholic Church]] and the Protestant Reformers of the north regarding the content and style of art work. The Catholic Church viewed Protestantism and Reformed iconoclasm as a threat to the church and in response came together at the [[Council of Trent]] to institute some of their own reforms. The church felt that much religious art in Catholic countries (especially Italy) had lost its focus on religious subject-matter, and became too interested in material things and decorative qualities.  The council came together periodically between 1545 and 1563. The reforms that resulted from this council are what set the basis for what is known as the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Italian painting after the 1520s, with the notable exception of the art of [[Venice]], developed into [[Mannerism]], a highly sophisticated style, striving for effect, that concerned many churchman as lacking appeal for the mass of the population.  Church pressure to restrain religious imagery affected art from the 1530s and resulted in the decrees of the final session of the  [[Council of Trent]] in 1563 including short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, which were to have great impact on the development of Catholic art.  Previous Catholic [[Church council]]s had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.

Statements are often made along the lines of "The [[decrees]] of the Council of Trent stipulated that art was to be direct and compelling in its narrative presentation, that it was to provide an accurate presentation of the biblical narrative or saint’s life, rather than adding incidental and imaginary moments, and that it was to encourage [[piety]]",&lt;ref&gt;''Art in Renaissance Italy.'' Paoletti, John T., and Gary M. Radke. Pg. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact the actual decrees of the council were far less explicit than this, though all of these points were probably in line with their intentions. The very short passage dealing with art came only in the final session in 1563, as a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft. The decree confirmed the traditional doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person themself, not the image, and further instructed that:&lt;blockquote&gt; ...every superstition shall be removed ... all lasciviousness be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting to lust... there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God.

And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop ...&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of decorative treatments of religious subjects declined sharply, as did "unbecomingly or confusedly arranged" Mannerist pieces, as a number of books, notably by the Flemish theologian [[Molanus]], Saint [[Charles Borromeo]] and Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], and instructions by local bishops, amplified the decrees, often going into minute detail on what was acceptable.  Many traditional iconographies considered without adequate scriptural foundation were in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art, and almost all nudity, including that of the infant Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', chapter VIII, especially pp. 107-128, 1940 (refs to 1985 edn), [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the great medievalist [[Émile Mâle]], this was "the death of medieval art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://danielmitsui.tripod.com/aaaaa/deathart.html The death of Medieval Art]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Extract from book by [[Émile Mâle]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art and the Counter-Reformation ==
[[File:Lamentation Scipione Pulzone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]]'', a typical Counter-Reformation work.]]

While Calvinists largely removed public art from religion and Reformed societies moved towards more "secular" forms of art which might be said to glorify God through the portrayal of the "natural beauty of His creation and by depicting people who were created in His image",&lt;ref&gt;''Art of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.'' Nosotro, Rit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-Reformation]] Catholic church continued to encourage religious art, but insisted it was strictly religious in content,  glorifying God and Catholic traditions, including the [[sacraments]] and the [[saints]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of the Counter Reformation.'' [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, "Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Lamport"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781442271593|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between Lutheran and Roman Catholic places of worship was the presence of the [[tabernacle]] in the latter.&lt;ref name="Lamport"/&gt;

[[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]], who invented the term ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'', cautions against connecting this more austere style in religious painting, which spread from Rome from about 1550, too directly with the decrees of Trent, as it pre-dates these by several years. He describes the decrees as "a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture".&lt;ref&gt;(Sidney) Freedberg, 427–428, 427 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scipione Pulzone]]'s (1550–1598) painting of the [[Lamentation of Christ|Lamentation]] which was commissioned for the [[Church of the Gesù]] in 1589 is a ''[[Counter-Maniera]]'' work that gives a clear demonstration of what the holy council was striving for in the new style of religious art. With the focus of the painting giving direct attention to the crucifixion of Christ, it complies with the religious content of the council and shows the story of the passion while keeping Christ in the image of the ideal human.

[[File:Paolo Veronese.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Last Supper ([[The Feast in the House of Levi]])'']]
Ten years after the Council of Trent's decree [[Paolo Veronese]] was summoned by the [[Inquisition]] to explain why his ''Last Supper'', a huge canvas for the [[refectory]] of a monastery, contained, in the words of the Inquisition: "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs and other such scurrilities" as well as extravagant costumes and settings, in what is indeed a fantasy version of a Venetian patrician feast.&lt;ref name="Transcript of Veronese's testimony"&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript of Veronese's testimony]&lt;/ref&gt;  Veronese was told that he must change his indecorous painting within a three-month period - in fact he just changed the title to ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'', still an episode from the Gospels, but a less doctrinally central one, and no more was said.&lt;ref name="David Rostand 1997"&gt;David Rostand, ''Painting in Sixteenth-Century Venice: Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto'', 2nd ed 1997, Cambridge UP {{ISBN|0-521-56568-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt any Protestant authorities would have been equally disapproving.  The pre-existing decline in "[[donor portrait]]s" (those who had paid for an altarpiece or other painting being placed within the painting) was also accelerated; these become rare after the Council.

[[File:Las lagrimas de san Pedro El Greco 1580.jpg|thumb|240px|''Repentance of Peter'' by [[El Greco]], 1580–1586.]]
Further waves of "Counter-Reformation art" occurred when areas formerly Protestant were again brought under Catholic rule. The churches were normally empty of images, and such periods could represent a boom time for artists. The best known example is the new [[Spanish Netherlands]] (essentially modern [[Belgium]]), which had been the centre of Protestantism in the Netherlands but became (initially) exclusively Catholic after the Spanish drove the Protestants to the north, where they established the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  [[Rubens]] was one of a number of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque painters]] who received many commissions, and produced several of his best known works re-filling the empty churches.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  Several cities in France in the [[French wars of religion]] and in Germany, [[Bohemia]] and elsewhere in the [[Thirty Years War]] saw similar bursts of restocking.

The rather extreme pronouncement by a synod in [[Antwerp]] in 1610 that in future the central panels of altarpieces should only show New Testament scenes was certainly ignored in the cases of many paintings by [[Rubens]] and other Flemish artists (and in particular the [[Jesuits]] continued to commission altarpieces centred on their saints, but nonetheless New Testament subjects probably did increase.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt;  Altarpieces became larger and more easy to make out from a distance, and the large painted or gilded carved wooden altarpieces that were the pride of many northern late medieval cities were often replaced with paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(David) Freedberg, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subjects were given increased prominence to reflect Counter-Reformation emphases. The ''[[Repentance of Peter]]'', showing the end of the episode of the ''[[Denial of Peter]]'', was not often seen before the Counter-Reformation, when it became popular as an assertion of the [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] against Protestant attacks.  This  followed an influential book by the [[Jesuit]] Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]] (1542–1621).   The image typically shows Peter in tears, as a half-length portrait with no other figures, often with hands clasped as at right, and sometimes "the [[rooster|cock]]" in the background; it was often coupled with a repentant [[Mary Magdalen]], another exemplar from Bellarmine's book.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, pp. 10 and 315&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Counter-Reformation grew stronger and the Catholic Church felt less threat from the Protestant Reformation, [[Rome]] once again began to assert its [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] to other nations around the world. The religious order of the [[Jesuits]] or the Society of Jesus, sent missionaries to the [[Americas]], parts of [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[eastern Asia]] and used the arts as an effective means of articulating their message of the Catholic Church's dominance over the Christian [[faith]]. The Jesuits' impact was so profound during their missions of the time that today very similar styles of art from the Counter-Reformation period in Catholic Churches are found all over the world.

Despite the differences in approaches to religious art, stylistic developments passed about as quickly across religious divisions as within the two "blocs".  Artistically Rome remained in closer touch with the Netherlands than with Spain.

'''Attitude-behavior consistency''' is when a person's attitude is consistent with their [[behavior]]. This is not true in many cases. The fact that people often express attitudes that are inconsistent with how they act may surprise those unfamiliar with social and behavioral science, but it is an important fact to understand because facts are often reported as if they are about people's actions when they may only be known to be true about their words. It is often much easier to conduct interviews or surveys than to obtain records of how people behave in situations.  Sometimes attitudes, such as voting, are measurably consistent with behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jerolmack|first=Colin|last2=Khan|first2=Shamus|date=2014-05-01|title=Talk Is Cheap Ethnography and the Attitudinal Fallacy|url=http://smr.sagepub.com/content/43/2/178|journal=Sociological Methods &amp; Research|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|pages=178–209|doi=10.1177/0049124114523396|issn=0049-1241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such cases it may be possible to obtain accurate estimates of behavior. However, there is no general method for correcting for attitude-behavior inconsistency.

== Applications to research methodology ==
Attitude-behavior consistency is an important concept for social science research because claims are often made about behavior based on evidence which is really about [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The attitudinal fallacy is committed when verbal data are used to support claims not about what people believe or say, but what they do.  Data collection methods based on self-report like [[Survey methodology|surveys]], and [[Interview (research)|interviews]]   are vulnerable to the attitudinal fallacy if they attempt to measure behavior and reported attitudes are inconsistent with the behavior. 

Research methods that directly observe behaviors avoid the attitudinal fallacy as a matter of course.  However many kinds of behavior are not easily observed. [[Ethnography]] can make rich observations and descriptions of behavior and allow for comparison between behavior and attitude. Unfortunately, in general ethnographic data cannot be used to draw statistically generalizable conclusions about behavior in a population.Ethnographers can still commit the attitudinal fallacy if they rely on quotations as evidence for behaviors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Experiment|Experiments]] in laboratories make it possible to observe behavior, with the limitations that come from the laboratory situation. [[Internet research]] makes it possible to study a wide array of behaviors that leave traces online. Data from the [[Internet of things]] and sensors that record behavior like from location tracking may make it possible to measure more kinds of behavior that avoids the attitudinal fallacy. It may not be possible to study some kinds of behavior other than through interviews or surveys. While the knowledge produced in such cases may be useful.  The possibility of inconsistency between behavior and reported attitudes is always a concern.      

Methods that are limited by their inability to measure behavior can still contribute to important understandings. These include how meaning is created, the significance of events to individuals, emotion, semiotics, representation and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamont|first=Michèle|last2=Swidler|first2=Ann|date=2014-04-08|title=Methodological Pluralism and the Possibilities and Limits of Interviewing|journal=Qualitative Sociology|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=153–171|doi=10.1007/s11133-014-9274-z|issn=0162-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ways attitudes and behaviors can be different ==

=== Social desirability ===
{{Main article| Social desirability bias}}  

Reports of attitudes and behaviors may be subject to social desirability bias.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Robert J.|date=1993-09-01|title=Social Desirability Bias and the Validity of Indirect Questioning|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/2/303|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=303–315|doi=10.1086/209351|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cases where respondents are anonymous, people may be less likely to acknowledge  behaviors that they see as undesirable. Conversely they may be more likely to report behaviors that are seen as more desirable.  Social desirability bias results from inconsistency between attitudes and behaviors. This is because although people may have positive attitudes toward behaviors they see as desirable, they do not actually perform the behaviors as often as they say they do. Studies making claims about behaviors based on reports when behaviors may be seen as desirable may be particularly sensitive to the attitudinal fallacy. Although indirect questioning has been a common practice among survey researchers, it is not generally effective at mitigating social desirability bias.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

People do not necessarily agree on which attitudes are socially desirable. Moreover, these attitudes may be situational (see below) and vary from setting to setting. Therefore, the ways in which attitudes are biased by social desirability may be interesting in its own right. Therefore, social desirability may not invalidate measures of internal factors such as personality in the same way as it invalidates studies of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ones|first=Deniz S.|last2=Viswesvaran|first2=Chockalingam|last3=Reiss|first3=Angelika D.|title=Role of social desirability in personality testing for personnel selection: The red herring|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=81|issue=6|pages=660–679|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.81.6.660|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attitudes and behaviors are situational  ===
A person's attitude and behavior both vary from situation to situation.  Behaviors may vary as when a person who rarely edits Wikipedia does so for a class assignment. Attitudes also vary from situation to situation. A college freshman may disapprove of binge drinking, only to subsequently become socialized to practice and celebrate doing so in the course of [[tailgating]].  Sometimes attitudes and behavior may be linked to reduce [[cognitive dissonance]]. But this need not be the case.

[[Australian]] Aboriginal [[kinship]] are the systems of [[law]] governing social interaction, particularly [[marriage]], in traditional [[Australian Aboriginal culture]]s. It is an integral part of the culture of every [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Aboriginal group]] across Australia.

==The subsection system==

Subsection systems are a unique social structure that divide all of Australian Aboriginal society into a number of groups, each of which combines particular sets of kin. In Central Australian Aboriginal English vernacular, subsections are widely known as "'''skins'''". Each subsection is given a name that can be used to refer to individual members of that group. Skin is passed down by a person's parents to their children.

The name of the groups can vary. There are systems with two such groupings (these are known as '[[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]' in kinship studies), systems with four (sections), six and eight (subsection systems). Some language groups extend this by having distinct male and female forms, giving a total of sixteen skin names, for example the Pintupi (listed below) and Warlpiri. While membership in skin groups is ideally based on blood relations, Australian Aboriginal subsection systems are classificatory, meaning that even people who are not actual blood relations are assigned to a subsection. They are also universal, meaning that every member of the society is assigned a position in the system.

Subsection systems are found in Aboriginal societies across much of Central, Western and Northern Australia. On the basis of detailed analysis and comparison of the various subsection systems and their terminologies, and in particular the apparent prefix /j-/ for male and /n-/ for female, it has been identified as a social innovation originally from the Daly River region of the Northern Territory, which then spread rapidly southwards to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Systems with two groupings (moieties)===

====Yolngu====

The [[Yolngu|Yolŋu]] people of north-eastern [[Arnhem Land]] divide society (and much of the natural world) into two [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]: ''Dhuwa'' and ''Yirritja''. Each of these is represented by people of a number of different groups (each with their own lands, languages and philosophies) through their [[hereditary]] [[Estate (law)|estates]] – so many things are either ''Yirritja'' or ''Dhuwa'':

:::{| class="wikitable"

|Rirratjingu, Galpu, Djambarrpuyngu, Golumala, Marrakulu,&lt;br/&gt;Marrangu, Djapu, Datiwuy, Ngaymil, Djarrwark.
|}

Fish, stone, river, sea etc., belongs to one or the other moiety. Things that are not either Dhuwa or Yirritja are called ''wakinŋu''. Yolŋu also have a kinship system with eight subsections (four Dhuwa and four Yirritja which is what creates moiety).

===Systems with four sections===

====Gamilaraay====

The [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] language group from [[New South Wales]] have a four section system.

====Martuthunira====

The [[Martuthunira language|Martuthunira]] language group from the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]] have a four section system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilybara: Aboriginal languages of the Pilbara region |last=Sharp, Janet |author2=Nicholas Thieberger |year=1992 |publisher= Wangka Maya, The Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre|location= Port Hedland, Western Australia |isbn= 0-646-10711-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The spelling '''''l.y''''' indicates that the letters represent two distinct [[phoneme]]s, and are not a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]).

Similar systems are found across most language groups in the Pilbara, though with some variation in the forms of the names. For example, speakers of [[Ngarla language|Ngarla]] use ''Milangka'' where Martuthunira use ''Pal.yarri''.

====Alyawarra====

The [[Alyawarre]] language group from [[Central Australia]] also have a four section system, but use different terms from the Martuthunira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Simple Introduction to Central Australian Kinship Systems |last=Wafer, Jim |year=1982 |publisher= Institute for Aboriginal Development, Alice Springs, Northern Territory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems with eight groups (subsection systems)===

====Lardil====
The [[Lardil]] of [[Mornington Island]] in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] have eight subsection groups, shown here with some of their totems:

::{| class="wikitable"

|-
|Balyarriny
|''Black tiger shark,&lt;br/&gt;sea turtle''
|Kamarrangi
|Buranyi
|-
|Bangariny
|''Brown shark, turtle''
|Yakimarr
|Ngarrijbalangi
|-
|Buranyi
|''Crane, salt water, &lt;br/&gt;sleeping turtle''
|Kangal
|Balyarriny
|-
|Burrarangi
|''Lightning, rough sea,&lt;br/&gt;black dingo''
|Ngarrijbalangi
|Kamarrangi
|-
|Kamarrangi
|''Rock, pelican, [[brolga]],&lt;br/&gt;red dingo''
|Balyarriny
|Burrarangi
|-
|Kangal
|''[[Barramundi]],&lt;br/&gt;grey shark''
|Buranyi
|Yakimarr
|-
|Ngarrijbalangi
|''Rainbird, shooting star,&lt;br/&gt;egret''
|Burrarangi
|Bangariny
|-
|Yakimarr
|''Seagull, barramundi,&lt;br/&gt;grey shark''
|Bangariny
|Kangal
|}

Each Lardil person belongs to one of these groups. Their paternal [[grandfather]]'s subsection determines their own; so a Balyarriny man or woman will have a Balyarriny grandfather. Members of each group may only marry members of one other, specified, group.

Once a person's subsection group is known, their relationship to any other Lardil can be determined. A Ngarrijbalangi is a 'father' to a Bangariny, a 'father-in-law' to a Yakimarr and a 'son' to another Bangariny, either in a social sense or purely through linearship.

The mechanics of the Lardil skin system means that generations of males cycle back and forth between two subsections. ''Ngarrijbalangi'' is father to ''Bangariny'' and ''Bangariny'' is father to ''Ngarrijbalangi'' and similarly for the three other pairs of subsections. Generations of women, however, cycle through four subsections before arriving back at the starting point. This means that a woman has the same subsection name as her ([[Matrilineality|matrilineal]]) great-great-grandmother.

====Pintupi====&lt;!-- This section header is linked to from the article "Makinti Napanangka" --&gt;
The [[Pintupi]] of the [[Western Desert (Australia)|Western Desert]] also have an eight subsection system, made more complex by distinct forms for male and female subsection names; male forms begin with "Tj", the female forms with "N". The [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] system is almost the same:

====Kunwinjku====
The [[Kunwinjku language|Kunwinjku]] of [[Arnhem Land|Western Arnhem Land]] have a similar system; male forms begin with "Na", the female forms with "Ngal":&lt;ref&gt;Etherington, Steven; Etherington, Narelle, ''[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/15561244?selectedversion=NBD12689936 Kunwinjku Kunwok : a short introduction to Kunwinjku language and society]'', Kunwinjku Language Centre, 1996, {{ISBN|0958690901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each person therefore has a [[patriline|patrimoiety]] and a [[matriline|matrimoiety]], a father's and a mother's subsection group.

===Extension of the system to non-relatives===

Outsiders who have significant interaction with such groups may be given a 'skin name', commonly based on the people they have interacted with and the types of interaction.

==Some common kinship terms used in Aboriginal English==
{{Main article|Australian Aboriginal English}}

The variety of English used by many Australian Aboriginal people employs kinship terms in ways that are based on their equivalents in Australian Aboriginal languages.

*''Aunty'' and ''uncle''  are terms of address for older people, to whom the speaker may not be related. 
*''Brother'' and ''sister''—as well as siblings this term is used to refer to children of one's mother's sister and of father's brother (cousin), just as in many indigenous languages.
*''Cousin-brother'' and ''cousin-sister'' are often used to refer to children of one's mother's sister and father's brother.
*''Cousin'' refers to children of one's father's sister and mother's brother, but may be extended to any relative of one's own generation, such as one who might share the same great grandparent as their own great grandparent, which is a second-cousin in Aboriginal terms.
*In south-east Queensland, ''daughter'' is used to refer to any woman of one's great-grandparents' generation. This is due to the cyclical nature of traditional kinship systems and mirrors usage in many Australian languages.
*''Father'' and ''mother'' include any relative of one's parents' generation, such as uncles, aunts, their own cousins and in-laws.
*''Grandfather'' and ''grandmother'' can refer to anyone of one's grandparents' generation. ''Grandfather'' can also refer to any respected elderly man, to whom the speaker may not be related.
*''Poison'' refers to a relation one is obligated to avoid. See ''[[Mother-in-law language]]''.
*The term ''second'', or ''little bit'' in northern Australia, is used with a distant relative who is described using a close kinship term. For example, one's ''second father'' or ''little bit father'' is a man of one's father's generation not closely related to the speaker. Usually having a ''second mother'' is having a woman of your own mother's generation who seems to act like a mother and would most likely care for you if anything were to happen to your own parents. It is contrasted with ''close'', ''near'' or ''true''.
*A ''skin'' or ''skin group'' is a section determined by the skin of a person's parents, and determines who a person is eligible to marry.
*''Son'' can refer to any male of the next generation, such as nephews, just as ''daughter'' can refer to any female of the next generation, including nieces.

A '''Bachelor of Education''' (B.Ed.) is a [[bachelor's degree|graduate]] [[professional degree]] which prepares students for work as a teacher in schools, though in some countries additional work must be done in order for the student to be fully qualified to teach.

==USA and Canada==
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], this degree is awarded for coursework completed within a program lasting one to five years, depending on the requirements established by the place where the province or state in which the university is located. In Canada, a B.Ed. degree is required for teaching certification.

A B.Ed. program may have direct entry from high school; as a combined degree with another bachelor's degree (e.g., B.A./B.Ed.); or as an after-degree program where the candidate has obtained a bachelor's degree, usually in the field in which the student wishes to teach. A good rapport or previous experience with young children or teens is also a desired characteristic of applicants.

There are several streams to a Bachelor of Education, each corresponding to the particular level of instruction. In the [[United States]], this includes [[elementary school]] education, [[middle school]] education, and [[high school]] education. Students in the elementary education stream generally study for a [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] degree. In the high school (secondary education) stream, the student specializes in one to two subject areas. Upon completion of the degree, they will prepare and eventually sit for the state's Board of Education certification examination.

A typical B.Ed. program may include coursework in [[pedagogy]], educational psychology, educational policy and leadership, assessment, curriculum development; and lesson planning, social justice, special education, and instructional technology.

==Australia==
In Australia, a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. In the majority of Australian universities, there is usually 2 distinct types of the Bachelor of Education: Primary and Secondary. The subjects and degree programs are quite different in both degrees e.g. for a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Primary) the focus of their degree would lie in behaviour, children, basic literacy, how children learn etc. For a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) they would therefore be teaching roughly 11- to 18-year-old adolescents and their programs would have less focus on those kinds of areas by the Primary degree. Instead, the degree is based around the student's intending teaching subjects; usually 1 or 2. In NSW, these teaching areas provide the major focus for their degrees in their final years. They consist of: English, Mathematics, Science (Biology, Physics &amp; Chemistry), Geography, History, Business Studies, Legal Studies, Economics, Society &amp; Culture and Languages.
The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Most Australian State Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or a bachelor's degree in one or two subject areas, with a Graduate Diploma in Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Graduate Diploma in Education.

Note: In Australia, the term Undergraduate Degree is used to describe all degrees undertaken by a first-time university student and usually no pre-requisite tertiary level studies are required, mostly just the completion of Secondary High School. Postgraduate degrees are used to describe the degrees completed with an Undergraduate degree as pre-requisite.

==Bangladesh==
In [[Bangladesh]], Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate professional degree for Hons. (4 years) and Diploma (1/2/3 years) in Education offered by the authorized Teachers Training Institutes or Colleges for those aimed their profession as a Teacher or as an Education and Curriculum Specialist or as an Educationalist in the government and non-governmental educational institutes or any educational organizations such as [[Save the Children]], [[UNICEF]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], BFES, SSUF, ASA etc. B.Ed. degree is mandatory for the teaching profession in both of primary and Secondary school level. Without teaching profession, if anyone wants to go other professions such as education &amp; curriculum specialist, researcher, administrator etc. in any educational or other sectors, he/she must have the minimum qualification of Hons. graduation degree in Education (B.Ed. hons. degree). Every year many talent Hons. graduate students from this subject get international scholarship from well known universities of other countries like [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[United States|USA]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] etc. The minimum qualification required for entry into '''B.Ed. Hons. (4 years)''' course is passed H.S.C or Equivalent and for entry into Diploma (1/2/3 years) course in education is [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc). The Hons. students of this subject have to read basic educational course contents as their major courses with some minor subject courses. In addition, usually for diploma (1/2/3 years) students from Arts faculty are trained to lecture subjects like history, civics, geography and languages and from Science faculty are trained to follow their lecture on mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology etc. whereas graduates from Commerce faculty trained up to lecture on accounting &amp; finance, economics, management &amp; marketing. After B.Ed. hons., one can continue for Master in Education (M.Ed.), M.Phil, PhD.D in Education in some universities of Bangladesh. National Council for Education and related Universities as well as their institutions is the constitutional authority to standardize courses for the educationalist and teachers in Bangladesh.

Major universities which offer B.Ed. in Bangladesh are:-
* Govt. Teachers' Training College, Dhaka, [[National University, Bangladesh]]

*Proyash Institute of Special Education &amp; Research (PISER), [[Bangladesh University of Professionals]]

==Israel==
In Israel, Bachelor of Education(B.Ed.) is a course offered Suitable for those interested in developing the field. Developed unique training programs tailored contemporary trends in professional training for teaching. In addition, there are plans Sitting studies of academics and teachers complete undergraduate studies. In Israel there are a number of colleges and universities offering B.Ed. studies as [[:he:מכללת לוינסקי לחינוך|Levinsky College of Education]] and B.Sc.Ed. at The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology

==India==
In India, Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate course offered for those interested in pursuing a career in teaching. The B.Ed. degree is mandatory for teaching at the secondary (classes 6 to 10) and higher secondary (10+2 or classes 11 and 12). The minimum qualification required for entry into B.Ed. course is [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc.). While students from the Arts stream are trained to teach subjects like History, Civics, Geography, and languages, the students from the Science stream are trained to teach Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The duration of the course is two years from session 2015-16 as per NCTE Regulations, 2014. After B.Ed., students can pursue [[Master of Education]] (M.Ed.) in any Indian university or teacher-training institutes offering the course. The [[National Council for Teacher Education]] is the statutory body which regulating teacher training courses in the country of India.

The Right to Free and Compulsory Education for Children (RTE Act 2009) came into force from April 2010. The act emphasizes on quality education for every child. As such, with the view to bring about quality education in schools, it is required that the entry level percentage to B.Ed. be 50 for those candidates in the General Category and 45 for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The Bachelor of Elementary Education (B.El.Ed.) programme is a four-year integrated professional degree programme offered after the higher secondary stage of school. B.El.Ed. is designed to integrate the study of subject knowledge, human development, pedagogical knowledge, and communication skills. Both professional and academic options are available to students who graduate with a B.El.Ed. degree.

==Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. Modules in the [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language]]s are compulsory.

Students study a range of Education-related subjects, including Psychology, Sociology, History, Social Policy, Professional Practice. Students also study subjects from another field or discipline as qualification for an intended teaching area or method.

The degree is available in several specialisations, including Primary, Secondary, Human Movement/Health, Music, or Early Childhood education. The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or an Undergraduate/Bachelor's Degree in one or two subject areas, with a Diploma of Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Diploma of Education.

==New Zealand==
The 3-year Bachelor of Education prepares graduates to teach in early childhood centres, primary and intermediate schools. With the Bachelor of Education one can specialise in Primary, Early Childhood, Physical Education and Huarahi Māori. The qualification is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to be effective teachers, and to gain provisional registration with the New Zealand Teachers Council. Teaching practicums allow students to gain invaluable experience in diverse education settings as they study. The Bachelor of Education can lead on to further postgraduate study.

== Nigeria ==
In [[Nigeria]], the Bachelor of Education degree is awarded at Universities and Colleges of Education across the nation as a first degree. There are a few specialised Universities of Education in the country that exist to train teachers professionally. Some of these specialised Universities include [[Tai Solarin University of Education]] and [[Ignatius Ajuru University of Education]]. The B.Ed can be done as combined honours with a B.A. or B.Sc. It can also be done as a single honours degree with specialisations in Nursery and Primary Education, Curriculum Development, Educational Administration and Policy Studies, among others. Students usually undergo intensive teaching practices at the 2nd and 3rd years of study. Upon graduation, they are registered by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) and can be employed as teachers afterwards. Postgraduate education usually take the form of an [[Master of Education|M.Ed]], PGDE, and GDE.

==Sri Lanka==
The Bachelor of Education degree was first introduced by the [[University of Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) in 1963. Prof. J. E. Jayasuriya, then Professor of Education at University of Ceylon introduced the course to meet the growing demand for professional teacher qualifications. Then the practice was to join the teaching profession with a bachelor's degree either in Arts or Sciences and after four years of teaching in a Secondary school teachers get the One year Post-Graduate Diploma in Education.

The University of Ceylon used to take only 50 -60 Post Graduate Diploma candidates at a time in an annual program. The B.Ed. degree was introduced combining the bachelor's degree and the Post Graduate Diploma in Education. B.Ed. was introduced as a four-year special degree and in contrast with the 9 - 10 3hr papers at the final degree examination, a B.Ed. degree required a candidates to sit for 19 - 20 papers for the finals. This happened due to combining of the bachelor's degree and the Post-graduate Diploma in Education. Only the top performing students were admitted to B.Ed. degree at University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. The first batch graduated in 1967. Following this Australia introduced the B.Ed. degree. Upali M Sedere was the first First Class holder of the B.Ed. degree from University of Ceylon, Peradeniya in 1969. Subsequently, in 1973, the B.Ed. program at the University of Sri Lanka changed in its scope and character.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], where both the [[university]] system and [[school]] system are very different, the degree is awarded after a three or four-year course (the course length depends on the university) which is specifically tailored to either [[primary education]] or for a limited range of [[secondary education]] subjects. It leads to [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS) in England and Wales and is a [[teaching qualification]] in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

As a result of the [[Robbins Report|Robbins Report on higher education (1963)]], the teacher training colleges were reformed as [[College of education|Colleges of Education]]. Such colleges, as in the case of those in London, became 'constituent colleges' of the [[Institute of Education]], with their academic award being from the [[University of London]]. Students were offered an extra year of study, bringing the course up to four years in length and resulting in the award of the Bachelor of Education degree. The first Bachelors of Education graduated in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atm.org.uk/mt/archive/mt196files/ATM-MT196-03-07.pdf atm.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BEd became more widespread in the early 1980s, when a [[bachelor's degree]] became a requirement for new teachers in the whole of the United Kingdom, replacing the old [[Certificate in Education]] (Cert Ed).

The BEd is not the only way of gaining Qualified Teacher Status or gaining a teaching qualification. Other routes are as follows:

==Bachelor of Science Education (B.Sc.Ed.)==
A Bachelor of Science Education is a degree awarded to students who complete the four to five-year course of study in the field of science (major and minor in biology, chemistry, physics, and math) with major Educational courses. It is the combination of degrees in science and education course (sometimes referred to double degree programs B.Sc + B.Ed. = B.Sc.Ed.). Even though B.Sc and B.Ed. are notionally two degrees, they must be taken together. There are very few universities that offer this course because it requires collaboration between the Faculty/School of Science and that of Education, to ensure that the teacher not only can work in an education institution but also in an industrial area related to science.

In Malaysia, it is one of the most difficult admittance degrees for the students to get into. Students not only need a distinction result but also need to go through a psychology test, rigorous interviews and demos of teaching. Students who already get these courses will be given a full scholarship by the Minister of Education. Upon graduation, the students will get job offers from government and private institutions (mostly to teach for matriculation, foundation or high school students) due to deep understanding of specific science and professional teaching training. Graduates also can work in other science related industries. Bachelor of Science ''and'' Education is totally different from Bachelor of Science ''in'' Education.

In Singapore, the [[National Institute of Education]], an autonomous institute of Nanyang Technological University, offers a four-year undergraduate programme, offering B.Sc.(Ed.) or B.A.(Ed.) in its initial teacher training programmes. Students are taught pedagogical theories and principles, alongside their chosen subject majors (and minors).

Kurien|others=R. Hal Scofield|title=Protein Blotting and Detection|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|location=New York|isbn=1934115738}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrices are generally chemically modified paper filters or microporous membrane filters. In a [[dot blot]], macromolecules are applied directly to the matrix. Macromolecules can also be separated and transferred via [[gel electrophoresis]].&lt;ref name="Kurien"/&gt;

One of the most common blotting matrices for protein analysis is [[nitrocellulose]], which has a high affinity for proteins due to hydrophobic interactions. However, proteins with low molecular weight have a small affinity for nitrocellulose, limiting potential applications. This defect may be remedied by [[glutaraldehyde]], which can covalently bond proteins to nitrocellulose. Another matrix is [[cellulose]] paper modified with diazophenylthiother, which can also facilitate covalent bonding of proteins. Nylon membranes are also used for protein blotting, although they may result in the binding of anionic dyes such as [[Coomassie blue]] and [[Amido black]]. [[Polyvinylidene fluoride]] membranes are also commonly used, due to their hydrophobicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Carl R. |last1=Merril |first2=Karen M. |last2=Washart|title=Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins|url=http://www.aun.edu.eg/molecular_biology/Protein%20workshop/Hames_Gel%20Electrophoresis%20of%20Proteins-A%20Practical%20Approach%203rd%20ed.pdf|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50280">'''Computer vision''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from [[digital image]]s or [[video]]s. From the perspective of [[engineering]], it seeks to automate tasks that the [[human visual system]] can do.&lt;ref name="Ballard-Brown-1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonka-Hlavac-Boyle-2008" /&gt;

Computer vision tasks include methods for [[image sensor|acquiring]], [[Image processing|processing]], [[Image analysis|analyzing]] and understanding digital images, and extraction of [[high-dimensional]] data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, ''e.g.'', in the forms of decisions.&lt;ref name="Klette-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro-Stockman-2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris-2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jahne-Haussecker-2000" /&gt; Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.&lt;ref name="Forsyth-Ponce-2003" /&gt;

As a [[scientific discipline]], computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.

Sub-domains of computer vision include [[3D reconstruction|scene reconstruction]], event detection, [[video tracking]], [[object recognition]], [[3D pose estimation]], learning, indexing, [[motion estimation]], and [[image restoration]].&lt;ref name="Morris-2004" /&gt;

==Definition==
Computer vision is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from [[digital image]]s or [[video]]s. From the perspective of [[engineering]], it seeks to automate tasks that the [[human visual system]] can do.&lt;ref name="Ballard-Brown-1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonka-Hlavac-Boyle-2008" /&gt; "Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding."&lt;ref name = bmva&gt; http://www.bmva.org/visionoverview The British Machine Vision Association and Society for Pattern Recognition Retrieved February 20, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; As a [[scientific discipline]], computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a [[medical scanner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/957285/star-treks-tricorder-handheld-medical-scanner-just-got-closer-to-becoming-a-reality/|title=Star Trek’s “tricorder” medical scanner just got closer to becoming a reality|first=Mike|last=Murphy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.

==History==
In the late 1960s, computer vision began at universities that were pioneering [[artificial intelligence]]. It was meant to mimic the [[human visual system]], as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior.&lt;ref name="Szeliski2010" /&gt; In 1966, it was believed that this could be achieved through a summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it "describe what it saw".&lt;ref name="Seymour1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boden2006" /&gt;

What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of [[digital image processing]] at that time was a desire to extract [[three-dimensional]] structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding. Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision [[Algorithm|algorithms]] that exist today, including [[Edge detection|extraction of edges]] from images, labeling of lines, non-polyhedral and [[Polyhedron model|polyhedral modeling]], representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, [[optical flow]], and [[motion estimation]].&lt;ref name="Szeliski2010" /&gt;

The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision. These include the concept of [[Scale space|scale-space]], the inference of shape from various cues such as [[shading]], texture and focus, and [[Active contour model|contour models known as snakes]]. Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] and [[Markov random field]]s.&lt;ref name="Kanade20122"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0jtBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191|title=Three-Dimensional Machine Vision|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-1981-8|author=Takeo Kanade}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1990s, some of the previous research topics became more active than the others. Research in [[Projective geometry|projective]] [[3D reconstruction|3-D reconstructions]] led to better understanding of [[Camera resectioning|camera calibration]]. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in [[bundle adjustment]] theory from the field of [[photogrammetry]]. This led to methods for sparse [[3D reconstruction from multiple images|3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images]]. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, [[Graph cuts in computer vision|variations of graph cut]] were used to solve [[image segmentation]]. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see [[Eigenface]]). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]] and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, [[Morphing|image morphing]], view interpolation, [[Image stitching|panoramic image stitching]] and early [[Light field|light-field rendering]].&lt;ref name="Szeliski2010" /&gt;

Recent work has seen the resurgence of feature-based methods, used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks.&lt;ref name="Sebe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicu Sebe|author2=Ira Cohen|author3=Ashutosh Garg|author4=Thomas S. Huang|title=Machine Learning in Computer Vision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lemw2Rhr_PEC|date=3 June 2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-3274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=William Freeman|author2=Pietro Perona|author3=Bernhard Scholkopf|title=Guest Editorial: Machine Learning for Computer Vision|journal=International Journal of Computer Vision|date=2008|volume=77|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s11263-008-0127-7|issn=1573-1405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==

===Artificial Intelligence===
Areas of [[artificial intelligence]] deal with autonomous planning or deliberation for robotical systems to [[robotic navigation|navigate through an environment]]. A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them. Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot.

Artificial intelligence and computer vision share other topics such as [[pattern recognition]] and learning techniques. Consequently, computer vision is sometimes seen as a part of the artificial intelligence field or the computer science field in general.

===Information Engineering===
Computer vision is often considered to be part of [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering|title=Information Engineering {{!}} Department of Engineering|website=www.eng.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/|title=Information Engineering Main/Home Page|website=www.robots.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid-state Physics===

[[Solid-state physics]] is another field that is closely related to computer vision. Most computer vision systems rely on [[image sensors]], which detect [[electromagnetic radiation]], which is typically in the form of either [[visible light|visible]] or [[infra-red light]]. The sensors are designed using [[quantum physics]]. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of [[optics]] which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated [[image sensors]] even require [[quantum mechanics]] to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process.&lt;ref name="Szeliski2010" /&gt; Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.

===Neurobiology===

A third field which plays an important role is [[neurobiology]], specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how "real" vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision related tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision (''e.g.'' [[Artificial neural network|neural net]] and [[deep learning]] based image and feature analysis and classification) have their background in biology.

Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of [[biological vision]] – indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.&lt;ref name="TextbookP1" /&gt;

===Signal Processing===

Yet another field related to computer vision is [[signal processing]]. Many methods for processing of one-variable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to processing of two-variable signals or multi-variable signals in computer vision. However, because of the specific nature of images there are many methods developed within computer vision which have no counterpart in processing of one-variable signals. Together with the multi-dimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.

===Other fields===

Beside the above-mentioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view. For example, many methods in computer vision are based on [[statistics]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] or [[geometry]]. Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision; how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance. Computer Vision is also used in Fashion Ecommerce, Inventory Management, Patent Search, Furniture, Beauty Industry as well.

===Distinctions===

The fields most closely related to computer vision are [[image processing]], [[image analysis]] and [[machine vision]]. There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover. This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names. On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented.

[[Computer graphics]] produces image data from 3D models, computer vision often produces 3D models from image data &lt;ref name="3DVAE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Amir-Arsalan/Synthesize3DviaDepthOrSil|title=Soltani, A. A., Huang, H., Wu, J., Kulkarni, T. D., &amp; Tenenbaum, J. B. Synthesizing 3D Shapes via Modeling Multi-View Depth Maps and Silhouettes With Deep Generative Networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 1511-1519).|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, ''e.g.'', as explored in [[augmented reality]].

The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted:

* [[Image processing]] and [[image analysis]] tend to focus on 2D images, how to transform one image to another, ''e.g.'', by pixel-wise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processing/analysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.
* Computer vision includes 3D analysis from 2D images. This analyzes the 3D scene projected onto one or several images, ''e.g.'', how to reconstruct structure or other information about the 3D scene from one or several images. Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.
* [[Machine vision]] is the process of applying a range of technologies &amp; methods to provide imaging-based automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance&lt;ref name="NASAarticle"/&gt; in industrial applications.&lt;ref name="TextbookP1"/&gt; Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, ''e.g.'', vision based robots and systems for vision based inspection, measurement, or picking (such as [[bin picking]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.robots.com/blog/viewing/the-future-of-automated-random-bin-picking&lt;/ref&gt;). This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that real-time processing is emphasised by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that the external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.
* There is also a field called [[imaging science|imaging]] which primarily focus on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with processing and analysis of images. For example, [[medical imaging]] includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications.
* Finally, [[pattern recognition]] is a field which uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and [[artificial neural networks]]. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.

[[Photogrammetry]] also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., [[stereophotogrammetry]] vs. [[computer stereo vision]].

==Applications==
Applications range from tasks such as industrial [[machine vision]] systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for:

[[File:Synthesizing 3D Shapes via Modeling Multi-View Depth Maps and Silhouettes With Deep Generative Networks.png|thumb|Learning 3D shapes has been a challenging task in computer vision. Recent advances in [[deep learning]] has enabled researchers to build models that are able to generate and reconstruct 3D shapes from single or multi-view depth maps or silhouettes seamlessly and efficiently &lt;ref name="3DVAE" /&gt;]]

* Automatic inspection, ''e.g.'', in manufacturing applications;
* Assisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a [[Automated species identification|species identification]] system;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wäldchen|first=Jana|last2=Mäder|first2=Patrick|date=2017-01-07|title=Plant Species Identification Using Computer Vision Techniques: A Systematic Literature Review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|language=en|pages=1–37|doi=10.1007/s11831-016-9206-z|issn=1134-3060}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Controlling processes, ''e.g.'', an [[industrial robots|industrial robot]];
* [[Activity recognition|Detecting events]], ''e.g.'', for visual surveillance or [[people counter|people counting]];
* Interaction, ''e.g.'', as the input to a device for [[computer-human interaction]];
* Modeling objects or environments, ''e.g.'', medical image analysis or topographical modeling;
* Navigation, ''e.g.'', by an [[autonomous vehicle]] or [[mobile robot]]; and
* Organizing information, ''e.g.'', for indexing databases of images and image sequences.

[[File:DARPA Visual Media Reasoning Concept Video.ogv|thumb|[[DARPA]]'s Visual Media Reasoning concept video]]
One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to [[Computer-assisted diagnosis|diagnose a patient]]. An example of this is detection of [[tumour]]s, [[arteriosclerosis]] or other malign changes; measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information: ''e.g.'', about the structure of the brain, or about the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also includes enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or X-ray images for example—to reduce the influence of noise.

A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called [[machine vision]], where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a manufacturing process. One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects. Another example is measurement of position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm. Machine vision is also heavily used in agricultural process to remove undesirable food stuff from bulk material, a process called [[optical sorting]].&lt;ref name="Davies-2005" /&gt;

Military applications are probably one of the largest areas for computer vision. The obvious examples are detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and [[missile guidance]]. More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data. Modern military concepts, such as "battlefield awareness", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions. In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.

[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Artist's concept of a [[Mars Exploration Rover]], an example of an unmanned land-based vehicle. Notice the [[stereo cameras]] mounted on top of the rover.]]
One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include [[submersible]]s, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles ([[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]). The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer vision based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, i.e. for knowing where it is, or for producing a map of its environment ([[Simultaneous localization and mapping|SLAM]]) and for detecting obstacles. It can also be used for detecting certain task specific events, ''e.g.'', a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for [[Driverless car|autonomous driving of cars]], but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles, to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, ''e.g.'', NASA's [[Mars Exploration Rover]] and ESA's [[ExoMars]] Rover.

Other application areas include:

* Support of [[visual effects]] creation for cinema and broadcast, ''e.g.'', [[camera tracking]] (matchmoving).
* [[Surveillance]].
* Tracking and counting organisms in the biological sciences &lt;ref name="BruijningVisser2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruijning|first1=Marjolein|last2=Visser|first2=Marco D.|last3=Hallmann|first3=Caspar A.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=Golding|first5=Nick|title=trackdem: Automated particle tracking to obtain population counts and size distributions from videos in r |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|year=2018|issn=2041210X|doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical tasks==
Each of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks; more or less well-defined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods. Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.

Computer vision tasks include methods for [[image sensor|acquiring]], [[Image processing|processing]], [[Image analysis|analyzing]] and understanding digital images, and extraction of [[high-dimensional]] data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, ''e.g.'', in the forms of decisions.&lt;ref name="Klette-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro-Stockman-2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris-2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jahne-Haussecker-2000" /&gt; Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.&lt;ref name="Forsyth-Ponce-2003" /&gt;

===Recognition===
The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and [[machine vision]] is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

* '''[[Object recognition]]''' (also called '''object classification'''){{spaced ndash}}one or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their 2D positions in the image or 3D poses in the scene. Blippar, [[Google Goggles]] and LikeThat provide stand-alone programs that illustrate this functionality.
* '''Identification'''{{spaced ndash}}an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of [[MNIST database|handwritten digits]], or identification of a specific vehicle.
* '''[[Object detection|Detection]]'''{{spaced ndash}}the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system. Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.

Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on [[convolutional neural network]]s. An illustration of their capabilities is given by the [[ImageNet#ImageNet Challenge|ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]]; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and hundreds of object classes. Performance of convolutional neural networks, on the ImageNet tests, is now close to that of humans.&lt;ref&gt;O. Russakovsky et al., "[https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]", 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters (an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras). By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.

Several specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such as:

* '''[[Content-based image retrieval]]'''{{spaced ndash}}finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content. The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative a target image (give me all images similar to image X), or in terms of high-level search criteria given as text input (give me all images which contains many houses, are taken during winter, and have no cars in them).
[[File:SRT Shape Recognition Technology.png|thumb|Computer vision for [[people counter]] purposes in public places, malls, shopping centres ]]
* '''[[Pose (computer vision)|Pose estimation]]'''{{spaced ndash}}estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera. An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an [[assembly line]] situation or picking parts from a bin.
* '''[[Optical character recognition]]''' (OCR){{spaced ndash}}identifying [[Character (computing)|characters]] in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or [[Search index|indexing]] (''e.g.'' [[ASCII]]).
* '''2D Code reading''' Reading of 2D codes such as [[Data Matrix|data matrix]] and [[QR code|QR]] codes.
* '''[[Facial recognition system|Facial recognition]]'''
* ''' [[Pattern recognition|Shape Recognition Technology]]''' (SRT) in [[people counter]] systems differentiating human beings (head and shoulder patterns) from objects

===Motion analysis===
Several tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images . Examples of such tasks are:

* '''[[Egomotion]]'''{{spaced ndash}}determining the 3D rigid motion (rotation and translation) of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.
* '''[[video tracking|Tracking]]'''{{spaced ndash}}following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or objects (''e.g.'', vehicles, humans or other organisms &lt;ref name="BruijningVisser2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruijning|first1=Marjolein|last2=Visser|first2=Marco D.|last3=Hallmann|first3=Caspar A.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=Golding|first5=Nick|title=trackdem: Automated particle tracking to obtain population counts and size distributions from videos in r |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|year=2018|issn=2041210X|doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12975}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the image sequence.
* '''[[Optical flow]]'''{{spaced ndash}}to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion. This motion is a result both of how the corresponding 3D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.

===Scene reconstruction===
Given one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at [[3D reconstruction|computing a 3D model]] of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of 3D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete 3D surface model. The advent of 3D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field. Grid-based 3D sensing can be used to acquire 3D images from multiple angles. Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple 3D images together into point clouds and 3D models &lt;ref name='3DVAE' /&gt;.

===Image restoration===
The aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like, a model which distinguishes them from the noise. By first analysing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.

An example in this field is [[inpainting]].

==System methods==
The organization of a computer vision system is highly application dependent. Some systems are stand-alone applications which solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc. The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on if its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation. Many functions are unique to the application. There are, however, typical functions which are found in many computer vision systems.

* '''Image acquisition''' – A digital image is produced by one or several [[image sensor]]s, which, besides various types of light-sensitive cameras, include [[rangefinder|range sensors]], tomography devices, radar, ultra-sonic cameras, etc. Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary 2D image, a 3D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands (gray images or colour images), but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt;
* '''Pre-processing''' – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to assure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method. Examples are
** Re-sampling in order to assure that the image coordinate system is correct.
** Noise reduction in order to assure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.
** Contrast enhancement to assure that relevant information can be detected.
** [[Scale space]] representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.
* '''[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature extraction]]''' – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data.&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt; Typical examples of such features are
** Lines, [[edge detection|edges]] and [[ridge detection|ridges]].
** Localized [[interest point detection|interest points]] such as [[corner detection|corners]], [[blob detection|blobs]] or points.
:More complex features may be related to texture, shape or motion.
* '''Detection/segmentation''' – At some point in the processing a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing.&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt; Examples are
** Selection of a specific set of interest points
** Segmentation of one or multiple image regions which contain a specific object of interest.
** Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprised foreground, object groups, single objects or [[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]] object parts (also referred to as spatial-taxon scene hierarchy)&lt;ref&gt;Barghout, Lauren. "[http://www.lirmm.fr/~lafourcade/pub/IPMU2014/papers/0443/04430163.pdf Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions]."

* '''High-level processing''' – At this step the input is typically a small set of data, for example a set of points or an image region which is assumed to contain a specific object.&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt; The remaining processing deals with, for example:
** Verification that the data satisfy model-based and application specific assumptions.
** Estimation of application specific parameters, such as object pose or object size.
** [[Image recognition]] – classifying a detected object into different categories.
** [[Image registration]] – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.
* '''Decision making''' Making the final decision required for the application,&lt;ref name="Davies-2005"/&gt; for example:
** Pass/fail on automatic inspection applications
** Match / no-match in recognition applications
** Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications

===Image-understanding systems===
Image-understanding systems (IUS) include three levels of abstraction as follows: Low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions; intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes; and high level includes objects, scenes, or events. Many of these requirements are really topics for further research.

The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are: representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.

While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing. Inference and control requirements for IUS are: search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, Volume 1|last = Shapiro|first = Stuart C.|publisher = John WIley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year = 1992|isbn = 0-471-50306-1|location = New York|pages = 643–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
There are many kinds of computer vision systems, nevertheless all of them contain these basic elements: a power source, at least one image acquisition device (i.e. camera, ccd, etc.), a processor as well as control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism. In addition, a practical vision system contains software, as well as a display in order to monitor the system. Vision systems for inner spaces, as most industrial ones, contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment. Furthermore, a completed system includes many accessories like camera supports, cables and connectors.

Most computer vision systems use visible-light cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most 60 frames per second (usually far slower).

A few computer vision systems use image acquisition hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both.
For example, a [[structured-light 3D scanner]], a [[thermographic camera]], a [[hyperspectral imager]], [[radar imaging]], a [[lidar]] scanner, a [[magnetic resonance image]], a [[side-scan sonar]], a [[synthetic aperture sonar]], or etc.
Such hardware captures "images" that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process visible-light images.

While traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of 30 frames per second, advances in [[digital signal processing]] and [[Graphics processing unit|consumer graphics hardware]] has made high-speed image acquisition, processing, and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second. For applications in robotics, fast, real-time video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms. When combined with a high-speed projector, fast image acquisition allows 3D measurement and feature tracking to be realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kagami|first1=Shingo|title=High-speed vision systems and projectors for real-time perception of the world|journal=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition - Workshops|date=2010|volume=2010|pages=100–107|doi=10.1109/CVPRW.2010.5543776|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=5543776|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egocentric vision]] systems are composed of a wearable camera that automatically take pictures from a first-person perspective. 

As of 2016, [[vision processing unit]]s are emerging as a new class of processor, to complement CPUs and [[graphics processing units]] (GPUs) in this role.&lt;ref name="the rise of VPUs"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third Type Of Processor For VR/AR: Movidius' Myriad 2 VPU |website=www.tomshardware.com |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/movidiud-myriad2-vpu-vision-processing-vr,30850.html |author=Seth Colaner |date=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angelico, cortona poliptych 01.jpg|thumb|400px|The Triptych]]
The '''''Cortona [[Triptych]]''''' is a [[Catholic Church]] depiction of the [[Madonna and Child]] with saints, painted by [[Fra Angelico]]. It is now kept at the [[Diocesan Museum (Cortona)|Diocesan Museum]] in [[Cortona]], [[Italy]]. The painting dates from 1436-1437.&lt;ref&gt;''Fra Angelico'' by Laurence B. Kanter, 2005 {{ISBN|1-58839-174-4}} page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The triptych was originally painted for the church of San Domenico in Cortona, and belonged to the [[Order of Saint Dominic]]. It was painted in [[Fiesole]], and then shipped to Cortona, probably just before Fra Angelico painted the Perugia Altarpiece in 1437, with which this work shares many common elements. 

==Predella==
The [[predella]] depicts the story of [[Saint Dominic]] along with other saints:

* [[Saint Peter]]  
* The dream of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]], 
* Saint [[Michael the Archangel]]
* Resurrection of [[Napoleone Orsini]] 
* [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent]], Martyr
* Saint Dominic with the Friars, being served by the Angels and Death of St. Dominic
* Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]

The lane labelled "control" is for quality control purposes and contains the DNA fragment but not treated with [[DNase]]I. ]]

A '''DNase footprinting assay'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0076-6879(86)30011-9 |vauthors=Brenowitz M, Senear DF, Shea MA, Ackers GK |title=Quantitative DNase footprint titration: a method for studying protein-DNA interactions |journal=Methods in Enzymology |volume=130 |issue= |pages=132–81 |year=1986 |pmid=3773731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[DNA footprinting]] technique from [[molecular biology]]/[[biochemistry]] that detects [[DNA]]-[[protein]] interaction using the fact that a protein bound to DNA will often protect that DNA from enzymatic cleavage. This makes it possible to locate a protein binding site on a particular DNA molecule. The method uses an enzyme, [[deoxyribonuclease]] (DNase, for short), to cut the radioactively end-labeled DNA, followed by [[gel electrophoresis]] to detect the resulting cleavage pattern.

For example, the DNA fragment of interest may be [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] amplified using a &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P 5' labeled primer, with the result being many DNA molecules with a radioactive label on one end of one strand of each double stranded molecule. Cleavage by DNase will produce fragments. The fragments which are smaller with respect to the &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P-labelled end will appear further on the gel than the longer fragments. The gel is then used to expose a special photographic film.

The cleavage pattern of the DNA in the absence of a DNA binding protein, typically referred to as free DNA, is compared to the cleavage pattern of DNA in the presence of a DNA binding protein. If the protein binds DNA, the binding site is protected from enzymatic cleavage. This protection will result in a clear area on the gel which is referred to as the "footprint".

By varying the concentration of the DNA-binding protein, the binding affinity of the protein can be estimated according to the minimum concentration of protein at which a footprint is observed.

This technique was developed by David Galas and Albert Schmitz at Geneva in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galas DJ, Schmitz A |title=DNAse footprinting: a simple method for the detection of protein-DNA binding specificity |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=3157–70 |date=Sep 1978 |pmid=212715 |pmc=342238 |doi= 10.1093/nar/5.9.3157|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=212715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23841">The '''dear enemy effect''' or '''dear enemy recognition''' is an [[ethological]] phenomenon in which two neighbouring [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] [[animals]] become less aggressive toward one another once territorial borders are well-established.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, J., {1954}. Evolution and bird sociality. In: ''Evolution As a Process'' (Huxley, J., Hardy, A. and Ford, E., eds). London, Allen and Unwin. pp. 71-83&lt;/ref&gt; As territory owners become accustomed to their neighbours, they expend less time and energy on defensive behaviors directed toward one another. However, aggression toward unfamiliar neighbours remains the same.&lt;ref name="Alcock" &gt;{{cite book | last = Alcock | first = John | title = Animal Behavior, 9th Ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | pages = 281–282 | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-87893-225-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors have suggested the dear enemy effect is territory residents displaying lower levels of aggression toward familiar neighbours compared to unfamiliar individuals who are non-territorial "floaters".&lt;ref name="Bee"&gt;Bee, M.A., (2003).  A test of the "dear enemy effect" in the strawberry dart-poison frog (''Dendrobates pumilio''). Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 54: 601-610&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosell and Bjørkøyli" /&gt;

The dear enemy effect has been observed in a wide range of animals including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates.

The behavioural effect can be modulated by factors such as the location of the familiar and unfamiliar animal, the season, and the presence of females.

The dear enemy effect is the converse of the [[nasty neighbour effect]] in which some species are more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards unfamiliar strangers.

The ultimate function of the dear enemy effect is to increase the individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the animal expressing the behaviour.  This increase in fitness is achieved by reducing the time, energy or risk of injury unnecessarily incurred by defending a territory or its resources (e.g. mate, food, space) against a familiar animal with its own territory; the territory-holder already knows about the abilities of the neighbour, and also knows that the neighbour is unlikely to try to take over the territory because it already has one.

==Mechanism==
The interaction between two neighbours can be modelled as an iterated [[Prisoner’s dilemma|prisoner's dilemma]] game. In this view, a territory owner that acts non-aggressively towards a neighbour can be thought of as [[Cooperation|cooperating]], while a territory owner that acts aggressively towards its neighbour can be considered to have defected. A necessary condition for the prisoner’s dilemma game to hold is that an aggressive individual should enjoy greater benefits than a non-aggressive individual when each is faced with a non-aggressive opponent. This stipulation is plausible, as an aggressive individual might enlarge their territory or steal food or matings from a non-aggressive individual.&lt;ref name="Akçay" /&gt;  When cooperation involves a cost, a possible mechanism for achieving stable co-operation is [[reciprocal altruism]], where pairs of individuals trade bouts of cooperative behaviour with one another.  Dear enemy cooperation could be explained by reciprocal altruism if territorial neighbours use conditional strategies such as [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]]. In the tit-for-tat strategy, a subject will cooperate when its partner (neighbour) cooperates and defect when the partner defects.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, J., (2002).  Conditional strategies in territorial defense: do Carolina wrens play tit-for-tat?  Behavioral Ecology, 13: 664-669. DOI: 10.1093/beheco/13.5.664&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==

===In mammals===
[[File:Badger-badger.jpg|right|thumb|Eurasian badgers respond less aggressively to the scent of familiar conspecifics than unfamiliar]]
Territorial [[Eurasian beaver]]s (''Castor fiber'') presented with a two-way [[Preference tests (animals)|choice]] sniffed both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger longer than from a neighbour.  Furthermore, beavers responded aggressively (stood on the mound on their hind feet, pawing and/or overmarking) longer to castoreum, but not to anal gland secretion, from a stranger than from a neighbour. When the mounds containing the scents were allowed to remain overnight and the beavers' responses measured the following morning, the beavers' responses were stronger to both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger than from a neighbour.&lt;ref name="Rosell and Bjørkøyli"&gt;Rosell, F. and Bjørkøyli, T. (2002). A test of the dear enemy phenomenon in the Eurasian beaver. Animal Behaviour, 63: 1073–1078&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurasian badger]]s (''Meles meles'') can discriminate between self-, neighbour- and unfamiliar- group faeces near their main [[sett]]. Badgers show heightened behavioural responses towards unfamiliar- compared with self-group scents, but there is no difference in response to neighbour- relative to self-group scents. The relative responses towards unfamiliar-group scents are greatest during the breeding seasons, but there is no seasonal differences in the responses to neighbour-group versus self-group scents. In badger populations, levels of aggression between neighbouring territory-holders are likely to be kept relatively low through neighbour recognition. However, increased levels of aggression will be shown towards dispersing or itinerant (alien) badgers, especially during periods such as the breeding season when the potential threats to the long-term fitness of territory owners are greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Palphramand1, K.L. and White, P.C.L., (2007).  Badgers, Meles meles, discriminate between neighbour, alien and self scent.  Animal Behaviour, 74: 429–436&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red squirrels]] are able to discriminate the odours of familiar neighbours and strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Vaché, M., Ferron, J. and Gouat, P., (2001). The ability of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to discriminate conspecific olfactory signatures. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 79: 1296-1300&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this discrimination may be used by males to avoid unnecessary chases and fights by becoming known to their neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Tamiasciurus_hudsonicus/|title=Animal Diversity Web -''Tamiasciurus hudsonicus'' red squirrel|author=Rubin, C.|year=2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[File:Mochuelo Común ( Athene noctua )(1).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The little owl hoots less intensively at familiar neighbours than unfamiliar]]

Audio playback studies are often used to test the dear enemy effect in birds.  These studies have demonstrated several bird species respond more aggressively to played back songs of strangers than to songs of neighbours including the [[alder flycatcher]] (''Empidonax alnorum''),&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, S.F. (2004). Neighbor-stranger discrimination by song in a suboscine bird, the alder flycatcher, ''Empidonax alnorum''. Behavioral Ecology, 15: 799-804  DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arh082&lt;/ref&gt; male [[Dendragapus|blue grouse]],&lt;ref&gt;Falls, J.B. and McNicholl, M.K., (1979). Neighbor-stranger discrimination by song in male blue grouse. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 57: 457-462&lt;/ref&gt; [[European robin]] (''Erithacus rubecula''),&lt;ref&gt;Brindley, E.L., (1991). Response of European robins to playback of song: neighbor recognition and overlapping. Animal Behaviour, 41: 503-512&lt;/ref&gt; and male [[banded wren]] (''Thryothorus pleurostictus'').&lt;ref&gt;Mollesf, L.E. and Vehrencamp, S.L., (2001). Neighbour recognition by resident males in the banded wren, Thryothorus pleurostictus, a tropical songbird with high song type sharing.  Animal Behaviour, 61: 119–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbouring male [[song sparrow]]s (''Melodia melospiza'') differ individually in their aggressiveness. Increased aggression by residents towards intruders indicates that residents not only respond to intrinsic aggressiveness of their neighbours, but also to short-term changes in aggression levels.&lt;ref name="Akçay"&gt;Akçay, C. et al., (2009). Good neighbour, bad neighbour: song sparrows retaliate against aggressive rivals. Animal Behaviour, 78: 97–102&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neighbour–stranger discrimination has been reported in many [[passerine]] birds, it has seldom been investigated in territorial non-passerine species. The nocturnal [[Bird of prey|raptor]], the [[little owl]] (''Athene noctua''), hoots to defend its territory.  Male little owls respond less to their neighbour's hoots played back from the usual location. However, responses to playback of a neighbour from an unusual location are similar to responses to playback of a stranger's hoots from either location.&lt;ref&gt;Hardouin, L.A., Tabel, P. and Bretagnolle, V., (2006).  Neighbour–stranger discrimination in the little owl, ''Athene noctua''. Animal Behaviour, 72: 105–112&lt;/ref&gt;

During the breeding season of the [[skylark]] (''Alauda arvensis''), particular common sequences of syllables (phrases) are produced by all males established in the same location (neighbours), whereas males of different locations (strangers) share only few syllables. Playback experiments provided evidence for neighbour–stranger discrimination consistent with the dear enemy effect, indicating that shared sequences were recognized and identified as markers of the group identity.&lt;ref name="Briefer"&gt;Briefer, E., Aubin, T., Lehongre, K. and Rybak, F., (2008).  How to identify dear enemies: the group signature in the complex song of the skylark ''Alauda arvensis''. Journal of Experimental Biology, 211: 317-326. DOI: 10.1242/jeb.013359&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that the dear enemy effect changes during the breeding season of the skylark.  Playbacks of neighbour and stranger songs at three periods of the breeding season show that neighbours are dear enemies in the middle of the season, when territories are stable, but not at the beginning of the breeding season, during settlement and pair formation, nor at the end, when bird density increases due to the presence of young birds becoming independent. In song sparrows, where neighbours are most often the sires of extra-pair offspring&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=C |title=Extra-pair paternity, song, and genetic quality in song sparrows. |journal=Behavioural Ecology |date=2011 |volume=22 |page=73-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;, males will alter their aggression toward neighbouring males with their female's fertility status. When presented with simulated stranger and neighbour intruders during their female's pre-fertile and post-fertile periods, males displayed the dear enemy effect&lt;ref name="Moser-Purdy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moser-Purdy |first1=C |last2=MacDougall-Shackleton |first2=E |last3=Mennill |first3=D. J. |title=Enemies are not always dear: male song sparrows adjust dear enemy effect expression in response to female fertility |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2017 |volume=126 |page=17-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, when presented with simulated stranger and neighbour intruders during their female's fertile period, males exhibited an equal response to both stimuli, likely in order to protect their paternity&lt;ref name="Moser-Purdy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moser-Purdy |first1=C |last2=MacDougall-Shackleton |first2=E |last3=Mennill |first3=D. J. |title=Enemies are not always dear: male song sparrows adjust dear enemy effect expression in response to female fertility |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2017 |volume=126 |page=17-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, the dear enemy relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Briefer, E., Rybak, F. and Aubin, T., (2008).  When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis.  Animal Behaviour, 76: 1319–1325&lt;/ref&gt;

===In reptiles===
[[File:Anolis sagrei sagrei (displaying).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A brown anole displaying with its [[dewlap]]]]
Males of a territorial lizard, the tawny dragon (''[[Ctenophorus]] decresii''), reduced their aggression levels in repeat interactions with familiar rivals and increased their aggression levels towards unfamiliar males. The time taken for interactions to be settled was also lower towards familiar than unfamiliar males.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, L., (2005).  Rival recognition in the territorial tawny dragon (Ctenophorus decresii).  Acta Ethologica, 8: 45-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Another territorial lizard, the [[common collared lizard]] (''Crotaphytus collaris''), can individually recognize neighbours and will increase aggression towards them as the threat to territorial ownership increases. Resident males treat familiar neighbours that had been moved to the opposite boundary to the shared boundary as equally aggressive as strangers. However, residents responded more aggressively towards strangers than towards neighbours on natural territories and also in neutral arena encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Husakf, J.F. and Fox, S.F., (2003).  Adult male collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, increase aggression towards displaced neighbours.  Animal Behaviour, 65: 391–396&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[brown anole]] lizard (''Anolis sagrei''), dyads of males behave differently
depending on whether the lizards are prior neighbours, with prior neighbours exhibiting fewer bobbing relative to nodding forms of headbob displays than non-neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;McMann, S. and Paterson, A.V., (2012).  Display behavior of resident brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) during close encounters with neighbors and nonneighbors. Herpetological Conservation and Biology, 7(1): 27−37&lt;/ref&gt;

===In amphibians===

Males of the territorial breeding [[agile frog]] (''Rana dalmatina''), have a large variability in call characteristics and are able to discriminate between neighbouring and unfamiliar conspecifics. Calling is of the longest duration in response to an unfamiliar acoustic stimulus; in contrast, the response to a familiar conspecific call does not show any difference from solitary vocalisations.&lt;ref&gt;Lesbarrèresa, D. and Lodéa, T., (2002). Variations in male calls and responses to an unfamiliar advertisement call in a territorial breeding anuran, Rana dalmatina: evidence for a “dear enemy” effect. Ethology, Ecology &amp; Evolution, 14: 287-295. DOI:10.1080/08927014.2002.9522731&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial red-backed salamanders, ''Plethodon cinereus'', defend territories under rocks and logs on the forest floor in the eastern USA.  Individuals are more aggressive to unfamiliar salamanders than to familiar individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, R. G., (1981).  Dear enemy recognition and the costs of aggression between salamanders.  American Naturalist 117: 964-972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fish===

The dear enemy effect in male variegated pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon]] variegatus'') is dependent on the presence of females.  Reduced aggression consistent with dear enemy recognition occurs between conspecific neighbours in the absence of females, but the presence of a female in a male's territory instigates comparably greater aggression between the neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser, J.K., (2003). When are neighbours ‘dear enemies’ and when are they not? The responses of territorial male variegated pupfish, Cyprinodon variegatus, to neighbours, strangers and heterospecifics. Animal Behaviour, 65: 453–462&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have staged three-way contests between male [[convict cichlid]]s (''Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum'') to examine the dear enemy effect. When faced with a familiar neighbour and an unfamiliar intruder simultaneously, residents preferentially confronted the unfamiliar opponent. That is, the establishment of dear enemy recognition between a resident and a neighbour allowed the resident to direct his aggression to the greater competitive threat, i.e. the intruder.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser, J.K. and Itzkowitz, M., (1989).  The benefits of dear enemy recognition in three-contender convict cichlid (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum) contests. Behaviour, 136: 983-1003&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual recognition of noises produced males of the bicolor [[damselfish]] (''Pomacentrus partitus'') have been demonstrated in the field. Playbacks of non-resident sounds from a given fish's territory elicit a greater response from its nearest neighbour than playbacks of the resident's sound. Testing also included switching the sounds of the two nearest neighbours relative to each respective male's territory. Results demonstrated that all males in the colony individually recognize the sounds of their two nearest neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Myrberg, A.A. and Riggio, R.J., (1985).  Acoustically mediated individual recognition by a coral reef fish (Pomacentrus partitus). Animal Behaviour, 33: 411–416&lt;/ref&gt;

===In invertebrates===

The home ranges of colony living ants often overlap the ranges of other conspecific colonies and colonies of other species. In laboratory experiments, the frequency and severity of agonistic interactions among workers from different colonies increases with the distance between their nests; this has been reported for ''[[Leptothorax nylanderi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hkinzk, J., Foitzik, S., Hippert, A. and Hölldobler, B., (1996).  Apparent dear-enemy phenomenon and environment-based recognition cues in the ant Leptothorax nylanderi. Ethology, 102: 510–522. DOI: 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1996.tb01143.x&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pheidole]]'' ants.&lt;ref&gt;Langen, T.A., Tripet, F. and Nonacs, P., (2000).  The red and the black: habituation and the dear-enemy phenomenon in two desert ''Pheidole'' ants.  Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 48: 285-292&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, male bees of the species ''[[Xylocopa micans]]'' have been known to slowly fly into the territory of an adjacent male territory holder in order to test and establish the mutual boundary of their two territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Territorial Behavior in Male Xylocopa micans (Hymenoptera: Anthophoridae)|jstor = 25083909|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date = 1979-04-01|pages = 313–323|volume = 52|issue = 2|first = Gordon W.|last = Frankie|first2 = S. B.|last2 = Vinson|first3 = Alcinda|last3 = Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dear enemy effect has been reported in colonies of the fungus-growing termite [[Macrotermitinae|''Macrotermes falciger'']]. Behavioural tests with workers reveal no alarm behaviour or mortality in pairings of workers from the same colony but a full range from no alarm to overt aggression, with associated death, when individuals were paired from different colonies. The level of mortality increases with differences in the composition of [[Cuticle|cuticular]] [[hydrocarbons]] between colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaib1, M., Franke, S., Francke, W. and Brand, R., (2002).  Cuticular hydrocarbons in a termite: phenotypes and a neighbour–stranger effect. Physiological Entomology, 27, 189–198. DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-3032.2002.00292.x&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crabby Fiddler - Flickr - Andrea Westmoreland.jpg|thumb|right|Male sand fiddler crabs attract mates by waving]]Male sand fiddler crabs (''[[Uca pugilator]]'') defend territories that consist of a breeding burrow and a display area where they wave their claw to attract females. Burrow-holding males engage in agonistic contests with both intruding males that attempt burrow take-overs and with other territory-holding neighbours that apparently attempt to limit waving or other surface activities of rivals. Contests consist of one or more behavioural elements that range from no claw contact to use of the claw to push, grip, or flip an opponent.  In the field, contests with intruders begin at higher intensities and escalate more rapidly than those with neighbours. However, resident-resident contests increase in intensity when burrows are close, neighbours faced each other when exiting burrows, and neighbours were of similar size. Proximity and orientation determine the ease with which a neighbour may be engaged.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, A.E. and McLain, D.K., (2006).  How dear is my enemy: Intruder-resident and resident-resident encounters in male sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator). Behaviour, 143: 597-617&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nasty neighbour effect or no effect==

A range of studies have found evidence of an effect opposite to the dear enemy effect, i.e. more aggression is shown toward neighbours than strangers.  This has been termed the "nasty neighbour" effect.

[[File:Oophaga pumilio Zoo.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Strawberry dart-poison frog]]
{{Listen|filename=Oophaga_pumilio_call.ogg|left|title=Listen to the strawberry dart-poison frog|description=Male advertisement call|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Colonies of the [[weaver ant]] (''Oecophylla smaragdina'') are able to recognize a greater proportion of workers from neighbouring colonies as non-colony members.  When recognized as non-colony members, more aggression is exhibited toward neighbours than non-neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Newey, P.S., Robson, S.K. and Crozier, R.H., (2010).  Weaver ants Oecophylla smaragdina encounter nasty neighbors rather than dear enemies.  Ecology, 91(8):2366-72&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Banded mongoose]] (''Mungos mungo'') groups vocalize more and inspect more scent samples in response to olfactory cues of neighbours than strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, C.A. and Manser, M.B., (2007). ‘Nasty neighbours’ rather than ‘dear enemies’ in a social carnivore. Proc. R. Soc. B., 274: 959-965&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that increased aggression towards neighbours is more common in social species with intense competition between neighbours, as opposed to reduced aggression towards neighbours typical for most solitary species.  Furthermore, animals may respond in this way when encounters with intruders from non-neighbouring colonies are rare and of little consequence.

Female [[New Zealand bellbird]]s (''Anthornis melanura'') are more aggressive toward the songs of neighbouring females. This is opposite to the dear enemy phenomenon and suggests that neighbouring females pose a greater threat than strangers in his species.&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, D.H., Evans, B., Cope, T. and Ji, W. (2008).  A test of the dear enemy hypothesis in female New Zealand bellbirds (Anthornis melanura): female neighbors as threats. Behavioral Ecology, 19 (4): 791-798. DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arn027 [http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/arn027v1]&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of studies have found no evidence of the dear enemy effect showing the effect is not universal. Territorial males of the strawberry dart-poison frog (''Dendrobates pumilio'')&lt;ref name="Bee" /&gt; and the [[spotted antbird]] (''Hylophylax naevioides'')&lt;ref&gt;Bard, S., Hau, M., Wikelski, M. and Wingfield, J.C. (2002).  Vocal distinctiveness and response to conspecific playback in the spotted antbird. Condor, 104: 387-394&lt;/ref&gt; do not discriminate behaviourally between the calls of neighbours and strangers, and female collared lizards show no difference in their behaviour to neighbouring or unfamiliar females.&lt;ref&gt;Husak, J.F. and Fox, S.F., (2003).  Spatial organisation and the dear enemy phenomenon in adult female collared lizards.,  Journal of Herpetology, 37, 211-215 [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1565856?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102326133101]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guinea baboon]] (''Papio papio'') males which live in gangs do not differ in their response behaviour toward neighbouring and stranger males and largely ignore any non-gang member, irrespective of familiarity; that is, they neither show a “dear enemy” nor “nasty neighbour” effect.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej, P., Patzelt, A., Ndao, I., Hammerschmidt, K. and Julia Fischer, J., (2013).  Social monitoring in a multilevel society: a playback study with male Guinea baboons. Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 67(1): 61–68. DOI: 10.1007/s00265-012-1425-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of History and Philosophy of Science''' ('''HPS'''), of the [[University of Cambridge]] is the largest department of [[History and Philosophy of Science]] in the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} It received a maximum rating of 4* for the majority of its submissions to the RAE 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.ac.uk/submissions/submission.aspx?id=60&amp;type=uoa&amp;subid=2533 RAE 2008] University of Cambridge: Philosophy: History and Philosophy of Science. Retrieved 6 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Located in the historic buildings of the Old Physical Chemistry Laboratories on [[Free School Lane]], [[Cambridge]], the Department teaches undergraduate courses towards the Cambridge [[Tripos]] and graduate courses including a taught Masters and PhD supervision in the field of HPS.  The Department shares its premises with the [[Whipple Museum]] and Whipple Library which provide important teaching resources for its teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/dept/ 'About the Department'] HPS Cambridge. Retrieved 5 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff==
The Department of HPS at Cambridge employs twelve full-time teaching staff, approximately thirty research staff, numerous supervisors and research associates from departments and colleges across the [[University of Cambridge]], in addition to external supervisors and examiners. Until 2013 the head of department was Professor [[John Forrester (historian)|John Forrester]], an international authority in the [[History of Mind]], and a leading figure on [[Sigmund Freud]] and the history of [[psychoanalysis]]. The current head of department is Professor Jim Secord. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.hps.cam.ac.uk/index/teaching-officers/secord&lt;/ref&gt;Other teaching staff include, Professor [[Hasok Chang]], Dr [[Eleanor Robson]], Professor [[Simon Schaffer]], Dr [[Tim Lewens]] and Dr [[Patricia Fara]].  [[Emeritus Professor]] [[Nicholas Jardine]] retired from full-time teaching duties in the summer of 2010.

==Degree courses==
The Department offers a nine-month MPhil course in History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science, Medicine and Technology (formerly History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine).  It also supervises graduate students for the Cambridge PhD in HPS and provides  advisors in the related fields of research in History, Philosophy and Social Science.  The Department provides undergraduate teaching and supervision for students who have completed their first year at Cambridge.  Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Cambridge Tripos system, undergraduates from a wide range of fields may study HPS.  The resources of the [[Whipple Museum]] provide for first-hand study of scientific instruments which often provide topics for student dissertations.

==History of medicine==
In recent years, the Department has regained its position as a major{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} centre for the study of the [[History of Medicine]] having formerly been a [[Wellcome]] Unit in this field.  It has played a major{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} role in the [[Wellcome Trust]] funded ''Generation to Reproduction'' project at Cambridge, led by Dr Nick Hopwood, and hosted seminars and day conferences in this field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/medicine/ HPS: History of Medicine'].

'''Dyadic developmental psychotherapy''' is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] treatment method for families that have children with symptoms of [[emotional disorder]]s, including [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] and disorders of [[Attachment disorder|attachment]].&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman, A. 2008 pp.329-337"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A., &amp; Hughes, D., (2008) "Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: An evidence-based treatment for children with complex trauma and disorders of attachment," Child &amp; Adolescent Social Work, 13, pp.329-337&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally developed by Daniel Hughes as an intervention for children whose emotional distress resulted from earlier separation from familiar caregivers.&lt;ref name="hughes2003"&gt;Hughes, D.

Dyadic developmental therapy principally involves creating a "playful, accepting, curious, and empathic" environment in which the therapist attunes to the child's "subjective experiences" and reflects this back to the child by means of eye contact, facial expressions, gestures and movements, voice tone, timing and touch, "co-regulates" emotional affect and "co-constructs" an alternative autobiographical narrative with the child. Dyadic developmental psychotherapy also makes use of [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] strategies. The "dyad" referred to must eventually be the parent-child dyad. The active presence of the primary caregiver is preferred but not required.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

A study by Arthur Becker-Weidman in 2006, which suggested that dyadic developmental therapy is more effective than the "usual treatment methods" for [[reactive attachment disorder]] and [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]],&lt;ref name="bw1"&gt;Becker-Weidman.

Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: a multi year follow-up. in Sturt, S., (ed) New Developments in Child Abuse Research. NY: Nova&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticised by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC). According to the APSAC Taskforce Report and Reply, dyadic developmental psychotherapy does not meet the criteria for designation as "evidence based" nor provide a basis for conclusions about "usual treatment methods".&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al." &gt;Chaffin, M. et al.

"Examining Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy as a Treatment for Adopted and Foster Children: A Review of Research and Theory", ''Research on Social Work Practice November'', 24(6), pp. 715-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

Dyadic developmental psychotherapy is based on the theory that maltreated infants not only frequently have [[Attachment in children|disorganized attachments]] but also, as they mature, are likely to develop rigid self-reliance that becomes a compulsive need to control all aspects of their environment. Hughes cites Lyons-Ruth &amp; Jacobvitz (1999) in support of this theory. Caregivers are seen as a source of fear with the result that children endeavour to control their caregivers through manipulation, overcompliance, intimidation or role reversal in order to keep themselves safe. Such children may also suffer intrusive memories secondary to trauma and as a result may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in treatment. It is anticipated that such children will try to actively avoid the exposure involved in developing a therapeutic relationship and will resist being directed into areas of shame and trauma. Hughes proposes that an attachment based treatment may be more effective for such foster and adoptive children than traditional treatment and parenting interventions.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

It is stated that once an infant's safety needs are met (by attachment) they become more able to focus on learning and responding to the social and emotional needs of caregivers. (Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states "Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

The therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.

==Methods==

Firstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes "The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.

The aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. "As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words." (Hughes 2004 p18)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment. However Hughes considers that attachment based treatment can be undertaken with just the therapist.(Hughes 2004 p25)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

==Controversy==
DDP has been criticised for the lack of a comprehensive manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making "a real logical jump" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"&gt;Pignotti, M., &amp; Mercer, J. (2007). Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions: A systematic research synthesis revisited.   Research on Social Work Practice, 17 (4),  pp. 513–519.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities to certain [[attachment therapy]] practices have also provoked controversy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; It has been suggested that the therapy appears to use age regression and holding techniques—features of attachment therapy not congruent with [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; Becker-Weidman cites Daniel Hughes's 1997 book "Facilitating Developmental Attachment", which contains sections on the use of age regression and holding therapy, as a source document for dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; The advocacy group [[Advocates for Children in Therapy]] include dyadic developmental psychotherapy in their list of "attachment therapies by another name", and continue to list Hughes as a proponent of attachment therapy, citing statements of his that appear to endorse [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/hughes.html Advocates for Children in Therapy - Daniel Hughes].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they cite material from Hughes's website about the use of physical contact in therapy as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To be effective, the child must be engaged by the therapist at the level of preverbal attunement rather than in a setting of rational discussions.  The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self."&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997"&gt;Daniel A. Hughes (1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205224739/http://danielahughes.homestead.com/fdaintro.html Facilitating Developmental Attachment: The Road to Emotional Recovery and Behavioral Change in Foster and Adopted Children]. Publisher Jason Aronson Inc. Retrieved 30 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The APSAC Taskforce report on attachment disorder, reactive attachment disorder and attachment therapy, published in 2006, places Hughes and Becker-Weidman within the attachment therapy paradigm and indeed specifically cites Becker-Weidman for, amongst other things, the use of age regression, though not for coercive or restraining practices (p.&amp;nbsp;79). They also describe DDP as an attachment therapy in their November 2006 Reply to Letters.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}} "Dr. Becker-Weidman is cited three times in the body of the report, none of which refer to coercive techniques. The first citation references his Web site's assertion that traditional therapies are either ineffective or harmful (p. 78). The second citation references his recommendation that children be encouraged to regress to an earlier age as part of treatment (p. 79). The third citation references his assertions, which we believe are unsupported, about practicing an evidence-based treatment (p. 85)."&lt;/ref&gt; Becker-Weidman had stated in his letter to the Taskforce that it was essential to treat a child at its developmental rather than chronological level, but the Taskforce in its November 2006 Reply to Letters disagreed (p.&amp;nbsp;382).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman Letter"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman, Letter to the Editor, Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 379, {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292632}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taskforce in their ''Reply to Letters'' describe Hughes as "a leading [[Attachment therapy|attachment therapist]]" and cite Hughes (together with Kelly and Popper) as examples of attachment therapists who have more recently developed their practices away from the more concerning attachment therapy techniques (p.&amp;nbsp;383).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply3"&gt;"Hughes went on to describe how his own practice of attachment therapy has changed during the years, specifically in terms of less emphasis on parental victory in power struggles, less use of holding techniques, and rejection of cathartic or dysregulated ventilation of past trauma in favor of approaches that sound very similar to well-supported gradual exposure techniques. Along with this, he offered some discussion of how he came to reconsider some of his own past attachment therapy practices."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kansas University/SRS ''Best Practices Report'' (2004) considered that dyadic developmental psychotherapy as described by Becker-Weidman, appeared to be somewhat different from that as described by Hughes. They state that in 2004 Becker-Weidman's claim that dyadic developmental psychotherapy was "evidence based" cited studies on [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]] by Myeroff, Randolph and Levy from the Attachment Center at Evergreen.&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman/Kansas"&gt;Becker-Weidmann, A. (3/7/2004). Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, retrieved
3/20/2004 from http://www.center4familydevelop.com/developmentalpsych.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uta et al."&gt;Uta M. Walter, U., M. and Petr, C. Best Practices in Children's Mental Health: "Reactive Attachment Disorder: Concepts, Treatment and Research" Produced by the University of Kansas School of Social Welfare in conjunction with Kansas Social Rehabilitation Services pp 10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' model is described as more clearly incorporating researched concerns about 'pushing' children to revisit trauma (as this can re-traumatize victims) and as having integrated established principles of trauma treatment into his approach. Avoiding dysregulation is described by Hughes as a primary treatment goal.&lt;ref name="Uta et al."/&gt;

Prior and Glaser state that Hughes's therapy 'reads' as good therapy for abused and neglected children, though with 'little application of attachment theory', but do not include it in their section on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Prior 2006"&gt;Prior, V., and Glaser, D. (2006). ''Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders: Theory, Evidence and Practice'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers, Child and adolescent mental health series. | p268 | {{ISBN|1-84310-245-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trowell, while admiring Hughes's clinical skills, stated that "Parents and carers need their own specific parent work and the children and young people need specific work tailored to their needs ... parents with their own unmet attachment needs from childhood may significantly inhibit their ability to speak frankly with, and feel supported by professionals aiming to help their children".&lt;ref&gt;Trowell, J. (2004). Reflections on 'an attachment-based treatment of maltreated children and young people'. Attachment &amp; Human Development, 6(3), 279-283&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the use of facial expressions in attempts at attunement, Trowell noted, "although the therapist may look and feel sad, the young person may see this as a provocation-- either hit out or the therapist may be perceived to be triumphant (the facial expression may be misread)" (p.&amp;nbsp;281). Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that "There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice. But the ideas in [Hughes's 2004 paper] do not provide a sufficient basis for a treatment manual, and are not to be followed uncritically."

==Evidence==
Two research reports by Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow-up of the first, are the only empirical examination of dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; They reported DDP to be an effective treatment for children with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] who met the [[DSM IV]] criteria for [[reactive attachment disorder]].&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bw3"/&gt; The first report concluded that children who received dyadic developmental psychotherapy had clinically and statistically significant improvements in their functioning as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], while the children in the control group showed no change one year after treatment ended.  The study also used the [[Attachment therapy|Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire]] as a measure,&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; which has not been empirically validated for reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt; Statistical comparisons were performed using multiple [[t-test]]s rather than an [[analysis of variance]]; this has been criticized because t-tests increase the chance of finding any significant differences.&lt;ref name="mercer2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mercer J | year = 2015 | title = Revisiting an Article About Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: The Life Cycle of a Woozle | journal = Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal | doi  = 10.1007/s10560-015-0399-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment group comprised thirty-four subjects whose cases were closed in 2000/01. This was compared to a "usual care group" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of "usual care" or clarify why the "usual care" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

In the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

Becker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"/&gt; The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt; Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.&lt;ref name="Letter to the Editor"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | 
&lt;/ref&gt; The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.&lt;ref name="Reply p3"&gt;"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time." Reply to Letters p3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven &amp; Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, &amp; Hanson (2004) system.&lt;ref name= "Craven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saunders 2004"&gt;Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., &amp; Hanson, R.F.

Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 29, 303-313&lt;/ref&gt; They placed both in Category 3 as "supported and acceptable". This classification means that the evidence basis is weak, but that there is no evidence of harm done by the treatment. The Craven &amp; Lee classification report has been criticized as unduly favourable.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; This critique noted the absence of a comprehensive manual giving details of the dyadic developmental psychotherapy intervention—one of the necessary criteria for assessment using the Saunders et al. guidelines, and one without which no outcome study can be placed in any of the available categories. Craven and Lee rebutted this paper in a reply that concentrated on holding therapy rather than dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="Craven &amp; Lee 2007"&gt;Lee, R.E., &amp; Craven, P. (2007). Reply to Pignotti and Mercer: Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions.  Research on Social Work Practice, 17(4),  pp 520-521.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears from the reports that attachment therapy techniques may have been used in addition to standard DDP. The therapist in Becker-Weidman's study instructed parents to use the "[[Attachment therapy#Parenting techniques|attachment parenting methods]]" of two authors who are described by Jean Mercer as advocating "coercive and intimidating approaches to children in treatment", specifically physical restraint and withholding of food and drink. Because of this deviation from the modern presentation of DDP, Mercer argues that the study cannot be considered a test of DDP in its current form.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Mercer cites Becker-Weidman's research as an example of the [[Woozle effect]], in which "flawed, limited, or exaggerated data" is uncritically repeated and republished until it achieves popular acceptance.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], after whom the Edward Grey Institute is named.]]
The '''Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology''' ('''EGI'''), at [[Oxford University]] in [[England]], is an academic body that conducts research in [[ornithology]] and the general field of [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[conservation biology]], with an emphasis on understanding organisms in natural environments. It is named in honour of [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], a notable politician and ornithologist, and is part of the [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford|Department of Zoology]] at Oxford University.

The Institute houses the [[Alexander Library]], the best ornithological library in [[Europe]] and one of the best in the world, which is named after [[Wilfred Backhouse Alexander|W. B. Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://libguides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/alexanderlibrary |title=Alexander Library of Ornithology Guide: Home |website=[[Bodleian Library]] |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Edward Grey Institute (EGI) was founded in 1938, having grown out of the Oxford Bird Census, itself founded in 1927. It was the brainchild of [[Max Nicholson]], [[Bernard Tucker]], and [[Wilfred Backhouse Alexander|Wilfred ('W. B.') Alexander]], and was initially founded to promote the economic study of ornithology. It took its name from [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Viscount Grey]], at one time [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of the University]] and [[UK Foreign Secretary]], and a lifelong birdwatcher, perhaps best known as the man who remarked, on the eve of the [[First World War]]: "The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9038083/Sir-Edward-Grey-3rd-Baronet Sir Edward Grey, 3rd Baronet] [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Article. Other common versions of the quote are:

&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Director of the fledgling Institute was W. B. Alexander, remembered in the name of the EGI's library, the Alexander Library. Alexander was succeeded in 1945 by former school-teacher [[David Lack]], one of the pioneers of [[population biology]], who had already published ''The Life of the Robin''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lack served as Director until his death in 1973, working with field assistants such as [[Denis Owen]], and oversaw the growth of the EGI into an internationally known centre for research into population biology of birds.

Lack was succeeded by [[Chris Perrins]] in 1974, who continued as Director until his official retirement in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} During this time, work in the EGI expanded from the field of population biology to encompass the new field of [[behavioural ecology]], with [[John Krebs]] and Nick Davies (then at Oxford, later Professor of Behavioural Ecology at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]) co-authoring the textbooks that defined the field. The EGI was also the centre for work on ''[[The Birds of the Western Palearctic]]'', up to its completion in 1990s, and became increasingly important as a training centre for ornithologists who went on to play important roles in conservation.

Following Perrins' retirement, a major endowment in honour of Dr [[Luc Hoffmann]]'s eightieth birthday led to the establishment of the Luc Hoffmann Chair in Field Ornithology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Ben Sheldon]] was elected as the first holder of this chair, and as Director of the EGI in 2004.

By the end of 2006, a total of 165 DPhil students had successfully defended their theses based on work carried out at the EGI; this number is at least matched by the number of postdoctoral and other research visitors who have spent time at the Institute.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Scientific research work on birds has been conducted on all continents and the major research themes of the EGI, population and evolutionary ecology of birds have been supplemented by a very wide range of research activities.

In the fields of [[chronology]] and [[periodization]], an '''epoch''' is an instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular [[calendar era|era]]. The "epoch" then serves as a reference point from which time is measured. [[Time#Measurement|Time measurement units]] are counted from the epoch so that the date and time of events can be specified unambiguously.

Events taking place before the epoch can be dated by counting negatively from the epoch, though in pragmatic [[periodization]] practice, epochs are defined for the past, and another epoch is used to start the next era, therefore serving as the ending of the older preceding era. The whole purpose and criteria of such definitions are to clarify and co-ordinate scholarship about a period, at times, across disciplines.

Epochs are generally chosen to be convenient or significant by a consensus of the time scale's initial users, or by authoritarian fiat. The epoch moment or date is usually defined by ''a specific clear event'', condition, or criterion—the epoch event or epoch criterion—from which the period or era or age is usually characterized or described.

== Calendar eras ==
=== Regnal eras ===
{{see|Regnal era}}
The official [[Japanese era name|Japanese system]] numbers years from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year.
A similar [[Chinese era name|system]] existed in [[China]] before 1912, being based on the accession year of the emperor (1911 was thus the third year of the [[Xuantong]] period). With the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912, the republican era was introduced. It is still very common in [[Taiwan]] to date events via the republican era. The People's Republic of China adopted the common era calendar in 1949 (the 38th year of the Chinese Republic).

=== Pre-modern eras ===
* [[Olympiad]]s, the ancient Greek era of four-year periods beginning in 776 BC.
* [[Ab urbe condita]] (753 BC), used in the Roman imperial period.
* The [[Anno Domini]] or "[[Common Era]]" era, still in use with the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Julian calendar]]s today, marks the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Jesus]] as calculated in the 6th century by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackburn |first1=B |last2=Holford-Strevens |first2=L |date=2003 |title=The Oxford Companion to the Year: An exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Incarnation era |page=881}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anno Mundi]] (years since the creation of the world) as used in the [[Byzantine calendar]] (5509 BC).
* [[Anno Mundi]] (years since the creation of the world) as used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] (3761 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/counting-the-years/ |title=Counting the Jewish Years |website=myjewishlearning.com |last=Solomin |first=Rachel M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Scott E. |date=2006 |url=http://www.rosettacalendar.com/calendars.html |title=Overview of Calendars |website=rosettacalendar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Islamic calendar]] counts "lunar years" by ''Anno Hegiræ'' (in the year of the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]'') or ''AH'' era (AD 622). The year count shifts relative to the solar year as the calendar is [[lunar calendar|purely lunar]]. The official [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]] (used in [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Iran]]) also dates from the ''hijra'', but as it is a [[solar calendar]] its year numbering does not coincide with the religious calendar.
* The term [[Hindu calendar]] may refer to a number of traditional Indian calendars. A notable example of a Hindu epoch is the [[Vikram Samvat]] (58 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3rd| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-70238-6| last1 = Dershowitz| first1 = Nachum| authorlink1 = Nachum Dershowitz | last2 = Reingold| first2 = Edward M.| authorlink2 = Edward Reingold  |title = Calendrical Calculations| date = 2008 | page = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; also used in modern times as  "national calendar" of [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]].
*   [[Buddhist calendar]]s tend to use the epoch of 544 BC (date of Buddha's ''[[parinirvana]]'').

=== Modern eras ===
* The [[Baha'i calendar]] is dated from the vernal equinox of the year the [[Báb]] proclaimed his religion (AD 1844). Years are grouped in Váḥids of 19 years, and Kull-i-Shay’s of 361 (19 x 19) years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. G. |last=Richards |chapter=Calendars |editor-first1=S.

* In [[Thailand]] in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912, New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941, Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era. Except for this era, it is the Gregorian calendar.
* In the [[French Republican Calendar]], a calendar used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793, the epoch was the beginning of the "Republican Era", September 22, 1792 (the day the [[French First Republic]] was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the monarchy).
* The [[Indian national calendar]], introduced in 1957, follows the [[Saka era]] (AD 78).
* [[Minguo calendar]] used by officials of [[Taiwan]] and [[Republic of China (1912–49)|its predecessor]] since January 1, 1912, the first year after [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] and the subsequent establishment of the republic.
* [[North Korea]] uses a system that starts in 1912 (= [[Juche]] 1), the year of the birth of their founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* In the scientific [[Before Present]] system of numbering years for purposes of [[radiocarbon dating]], the reference date is January 1, 1950 (though the use of January 1 is quite irrelevant, as radiocarbon dating has limited precision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c14dating.com/agecalc.html |website=c14dating.com |title=Radiocarbon dating – Age calculation |last=Higham |first=Thomas |authorlink1= Thomas Higham |publisher=Thomas Higham |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stuiver |first=Minze |author2=Polach HA |year=1977 |title=Discussion; reporting of C-14 data. |journal=Radiocarbon |publisher=University of Arizona |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=355–363 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/493/498 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Different branches of [[Freemasonry]] have selected different years to date their documents according to a [[Masonic era]], such as the [[Anno Lucis]] (A.L.).

== Astronomy ==

{{Main|Epoch (astronomy)}}

In astronomy, an epoch is a specific moment in time for which [[Celestial coordinate system|celestial coordinates]] or [[orbital elements]] are specified, and from which other orbital parametrics are thereafter calculated in order to predict future position. The applied tools of the mathematics disciplines of [[Celestial mechanics]] or its subfield [[Orbital mechanics]] (both predict orbital paths and positions) about a [[center of gravity]] are used to generate an [[ephemeris]] (plural: ''ephemerides''; from the Greek word ''ephemeros'' = daily) which is a table of values that gives the positions of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times, or a formula to calculate such given the proper time offset from the epoch. Such calculations generally result in an elliptical path on a plane defined by some point on the orbit, and the two foci of the [[ellipse]]. Viewing from another orbiting body, following its own trace and orbit, creates shifts in three dimensions in the spherical trigonometry used to calculate relative positions. These dynamics in three dimensions are also elliptical, which means the ephemeris need only specify one set of equations to be a useful predictive tool to predict future location of the object of interest.

Over time, inexactitudes and other errors accumulate, creating more and greater errors of prediction, so ephemeris factors need to be recalculated from time to time, and that requires a new epoch to be defined. Different astronomers or groups of astronomers used to define epochs to suit themselves, but in these days of speedy communications, the epochs are generally defined in an international agreement, so astronomers worldwide can collaborate more effectively. It was inefficient and error prone for data observed by one group to need translation (mathematic transformation) so other groups could compare information.

=== J2000.0 ===
The current standard epoch is called "[[J2000.0]]" This is defined by international agreement to be equivalent to:
# The [[Gregorian date]] January 1, 2000 at approximately 12:00 GMT ([[Greenwich Mean Time]]).
# The [[Julian date]] 2451545.0 TT ([[Terrestrial Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=P. K. |editor-last=Seidelman  |encyclopedia=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=University Science Books |date=1992 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# January 1, 2000, 11:59:27.816 TAI ([[International Atomic Time]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=P. K. |editor-last=Seidelman  |encyclopedia=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |location=Sausalito, CA |publisher=University Science Books |date=1992 |title=Glossary: Terrestrial Dynamical Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# January 1, 2000, 11:58:55.816 UTC ([[Coordinated Universal Time]]).{{efn|This article uses a 24-hour clock, so 11:59:27.816 is equivalent to 11:59:27.816 AM.}}

== Computing == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Microsoft Office Excel]] --&gt;
The [[system time|time kept internally]] by a [[computer]] system is usually expressed as the number of time units that have elapsed since a specified epoch, which is nearly always specified as midnight [[Universal Time]] on some particular date.

Software timekeeping systems vary widely in the granularity of their time units; some systems may use time units as large as a day, while others may use [[nanosecond]]s. For example, for an epoch date of midnight UTC (00:00) on January 1, 1900, and a time unit of a second, the time of the midnight (24:00) between January 1 and 2, 1900 is represented by the number 86400, the number of seconds in one day. When times prior to the epoch need to be represented, it is common to use the same system, but with negative numbers.

These representations of time are mainly for internal use. If an end user interaction with dates and times is required, the software will nearly always convert this internal number into a date and time representation that is comprehensible to humans.

=== Notable epoch dates in computing ===
{{See also|System time}}
The following table lists epoch dates used by popular software and other computer-related systems. The time in these systems is stored as the quantity of a particular time unit (days, seconds, nanoseconds, etc.) that has elapsed since a stated time (usually midnight UTC at the beginning of the given date).

=== Problems with epoch-based computer time representation ===

Computers do not generally store arbitrarily large numbers. Instead, each number stored by a computer is allotted a fixed amount of space. Therefore, when the number of time units that have elapsed since a system's epoch exceeds the largest number that can fit in the space allotted to the time representation, the time representation [[arithmetic overflow|overflows]], and problems can occur. While a system's behavior after overflow occurs is not necessarily predictable, in most systems the number representing the time will reset to zero, and the computer system will think that the current time is the epoch time again.

Most famously, older systems which counted time as the number of years elapsed since the epoch of January 1, 1900 and which only allotted enough space to store the numbers 0 through 99, experienced the [[Year 2000 problem]]. These systems (if not corrected beforehand) would interpret the date January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900, leading to unpredictable errors at the beginning of the year 2000.

Even systems which allocate more storage to the time representation are not immune from this kind of error. Many [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s which keep time as seconds elapsed from the epoch date of January 1, 1970, and allot timekeeping enough storage to store numbers as large as  {{nowrap|2 147 483 647}} will experience an overflow problem on January 19, 2038 if not fixed beforehand. This is known as the [[Year 2038 problem]]. A correction involving doubling the storage allocated to timekeeping on these systems will allow them to represent dates more than 290 billion years into the future.

Other more subtle timekeeping problems exist in computing, such as accounting for [[leap second]]s, which are not observed with any predictability or regularity. Additionally, applications which need to represent historical dates and times (for example, representing a date prior to the switch from the [[Julian calendar]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]) must use specialized timekeeping [[library (computing)|libraries]].

Finally, some software must maintain compatibility with older software that does not keep time in strict accordance with traditional timekeeping systems. For example, [[Microsoft Excel]] observes the fictional date of [[February 29, 1900]] in order to maintain compatibility with older versions of [[Lotus 1-2-3]].&lt;ref name="excel-leapyear" /&gt; Lotus 1-2-3 observed the date due to an error; by the time the error was discovered, it was too late to fix it—"a change now would disrupt formulas which were written to accommodate this anomaly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Reingold |first2=Edward |author-link2=Edward Reingold |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |author-link1=Nachum Dershowitz |date=2008 |edition=3rd |title=Calendrical Calculations |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-70238-6 |pages=xxi, xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epoch in satellite-based time systems ===

There are at least six [[satellite navigation]] systems, all of which function by transmitting [[time signal]]s. Of the only two satellite systems with global coverage, [[GPS]] calculates its time signal from an epoch, whereas [[GLONASS]] calculates time as an offset from [[UTC]], with the UTC input adjusted for [[leap seconds]]. Of the only two other systems aiming for global coverage, [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] calculates from an epoch and [[Compass navigation system|Beidou]] calculates from UTC without adjustment for leap seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/Time_References_in_GNSS |title=Time References in GNSS |first1=J.

Juan |last2=Zornoza |first3=M. |last3=Hernández-Pajares |date=2011 |website=gssc.esa.int/navipedia |publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPS also transmits the offset between UTC time and GPS time, and must update this offset every time there is a [[leap second]], requiring GPS receiving devices to handle the update correctly. In contrast, leap seconds are transparent to GLONASS users.
The complexities of calculating UTC from an epoch are explained by the [[European Space Agency]] in Galileo documentation under "Equations to correct system timescale to reference timescale"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2016/gst2016.pdf |title=GNSS Timescale Description Galileo |publisher=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs |date=2016 |at=Section 5d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5588">An '''extreme environment''' contains conditions that are hard to survive for most known [[life form]]s. These conditions may be extremely high or low [[temperature]] or [[pressure]]; high or low content of [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]]; high levels of [[radiation]], [[acidity]], or [[alkalinity]]; absence of water; water containing a high concentration of salt or sugar; presence of [[sulphur]], [[petroleum]], and other [[toxic]] substances.

Examples of extreme environments include the [[geographical pole]]s, very arid [[deserts]], [[volcano]]es, deep [[ocean trench]]es, [[upper atmosphere]], [[Mt Everest]], [[outer space]], and the environments of every [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]] except the [[Earth]]. Any organisms living in these conditions are often very well adapted to their living circumstances, which is usually a result of long-term evolution. Physiologists have long known that organisms living in extreme environments are especially likely to exhibit clear examples of evolutionary adaptation because of the presumably intense past natural selection they have experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Jr., T., and P. A. Carter. 1994. Evolutionary physiology. Annual Review of Physiology 56:579–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On Earth==
The distribution of extreme environments on [[Earth]] has varied through [[geological time]]. Humans generally do not inhabit extreme environments. There are organisms referred to as [[extremophile]]s that do live in such conditions and are so well-adapted that they readily grow and multiply.

==Beyond Earth==
Most of the moons and planets in the [[Solar System]] are also extreme environments. [[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] have not yet found life in any environments beyond Earth, though experiments have shown that [[tardigrades]] can survive the harsh vacuum and intense radiation of outer space. The conceptual modification of  conditions in locations beyond Earth, to make them more habitable by humans and other terrestrial organisms, is known as [[terraforming]].

==Types==
Among extreme environments are [[alkaline]], [[acidic]], extremely cold, extremely hot, [[hyper-saline]], places without water or [[oxygen]], and places altered by humans, such as mine [[tailings]] or oil impacted habitats.

* Alkaline: broadly conceived as natural [[habitats]] above pH 9 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
* Acidic: broadly conceived as natural habitats below pH 5 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
* Extremely cold: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently below -17&amp;nbsp;°C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes montane sites, polar sites, and deep ocean habitats.
* Extremely hot: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently in excess of 40&amp;nbsp;°C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes sites with [[geological thermal]] influences such as Yellowstone and comparable locations worldwide or deep-sea vents.
* Hypersaline: (high salt) environments with salt concentrations greater than that of seawater, that is, &gt;3.5%. Includes salt lakes.
* Under pressure: broadly conceived as habitats under extreme hydrostatic pressure — i.e. aquatic habitats deeper than 2000 meters and enclosed habitats under pressure. Includes habitats in oceans and deep lakes.
* Radiation: broadly conceived as habitats exposed to abnormally high [[radiation]] or of radiation outside the normal range of light. Includes habitats exposed to high UV and IR radiation.
* Without water: broadly conceived as habitats without free water whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes hot and cold desert environments, and some endolithic habitats.
* Without oxygen: broadly conceived as habitats without free oxygen - whether persistently, or with regular frequency, or for protracted periods of time. Includes habitats in deeper sediments.
* Altered by humans, i.e. anthropogenically impacted habitats. Includes mine tailings, oil impacted habitats, and pollution by [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s or [[organic compound]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17226">The '''Government Law Center''' (GLC) of [[Albany Law School]] is a non-profit law and public policy organization and think tank based in [[Albany, New York]]. The GLC is the oldest government law center in the United States, conducting research and education in law and public policy. The Center's areas of expertise include land use planning and zoning, environment, government ethics, local government, aging, public authorities, Chinese Law, racing and gaming, early stage business support for alternate energy, and civilian police review.&lt;ref name=GLCWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Law Center|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=668|work=Albany Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GLC's principal mission is to conduct programs and research that inform the public policy debate through non-partisan, comprehensive analysis of critical government-related issues. The GLC provides research and technical assistance to public officials and presents instruction for the general public.

The GLC has published a number of reports online at ''Government Law Online''. The Center offers fellowships and internships for students to enhance their academic learning.  The current interim Director of the center is Robert Heverly.  Beginning in August 2013, [[Raymond Brescia]] will take over as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Ray Brescia to Lead Government Law Center at Albany Law School|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/about/news/current/Pages/Professor-Ray-Brescia-to-Lead-Government-Law-Center-at-Albany-Law-School.aspx|publisher=Albany Law School|accessdate=7/3/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
&lt;br&gt;
The Government Law Center was founded in 1978, the product of a grant initiated at the federal level and administered by New York State through the [[New York State Department of State]], under the leadership of [[Mario Cuomo|Mario M. Cuomo]] as then-Secretary of State. Cuomo worked with Albany Law School Professors Sandra Stevenson and Bernard Harvith to secure a grant through the United States Office of Personnel Management and the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawksley|first=Jane|title=Albany's government law center serves as model|newspaper=The Business Review|date=October 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Sandra Stevenson served as the GLC's Director for a few months before J. Langdon Marsh became the first full-time director of the GLC on March 1, 1979&lt;ref name=Salkin101&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salkin|first=Patricia|title=Teaching Government Law &amp; Policy in Law School: Reflections on Twenty-Five Years of Experience|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2003|volume=66|pages=101–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center contracted with the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] to prepare its first state legal report in 1980, titled "Selected Legal Problems in the Control of Hazardous Wastes." The Center proceeded to enter into contracts with several New York State agencies, including the [[New York State Department of Family Assistance|New York State Department of Social Services]], [[Adirondack Park Agency]], [[New York State Department of State]], [[New York State Department of Health]], and with the [[New York State Legislature]], to produce reports and offer training. Under Marsh's direction, the Center also focused on issues related to [[hazardous waste]], zoning and planning, environmental quality review, [[economic development]], and local government.

Marsh left the Center in July 1983, and for a brief time following, Joseph W. Bellacosa served as the Center's director. He subsequently was appointed by then-New York State Governor Mario M. Cuomo to serve as a Judge on the Court of Claims and Chief Administrative Judge of all State Courts, followed by a fourteen-year term on the [[New York Court of Appeals]].
In 1983, Professor Sandra M. Stevenson was re-appointed Associate Dean and Director of the Government Law Center, assuming the position she had held in the first months of the Center's existence.&lt;ref name="salkin"/&gt; During her tenure, the GLC conducted training programs in [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) and tying ADR to intellectual property. Under Stevenson's leadership in 1989, Albany Law School and the Government Law Center became the official repository for tapes of oral arguments heard before the New York Court of Appeals.
In 1990, Professor George F. Carpinello was appointed Director. Under Carpinello, the Center introduced the ''Warren M. Anderson Legislative Breakfast Seminar Series'', a series focused on topics of interest to legislators and policy makers, named for the former President Pro Tem and [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate]]. The GLC also began producing a newsletter for the County Attorneys Association of New York State (CAASNY), prepared the first edition of ''Legal Careers in New York State Government'' (with later editions published by the [[New York State Bar Association]]), and placed student interns in the counsel's office of various state agencies.

[[Patricia Salkin|Patricia E. Salkin]], Raymond and Ella Smith Distinguished Professor of Law and Associate Dean of Albany Law School, was appointed Director of the GLC in 1992, and served as the Center's Director until her appointment as dean of the Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center in 2012. In the first years under Salkin's leadership, the GLC began the ''Edgar and Margaret Sandman Fellowship in Aging and Health Law'', and created the Senior Citizen's Law Day, a day-long program providing local seniors with free seminars on important issues related to aging. The ''Aging Law and Policy Program'' was established in 1994 to focus on issues related to aging.&lt;ref name=salkin/&gt;

In 1994, the GLC also received funding through the [[United States Department of Education]] to create the ''Mediation Assistance Program'' to train and state-certify law and non-law students as volunteer mediators for New York's Community Dispute Settlement Program,&lt;ref name=salkin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salkin|first=Patricia|title=Teaching Government Law &amp; Policy in Law School: Reflections on Twenty-Five Years of Experience|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2003|volume=66|pages=102–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the ''Program on Public Policy Dispute Resolution'' to focus on issues emerging in this field.

In the years that followed, a number of additional programs were initiated. ''The Lawrence F. Klepper Legal Assistance Program for Non-Profit Organizations'', helping to place law students with attorneys who provide pro bono or very low-cost services to nonprofits, was established at the GLC in 1994 by friends of the former Executive Director of the [[Legal Aid Society]] and with the support of [[Congregation Beth Emeth]].&lt;ref name=DeMare25&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMare|first=Carol|title=Government Law Center to Mark 25 Years of Service|newspaper=Times Union|date=February 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Edwin L. Crawford Memorial Lecture in Municipal Law'' was launched in 1996 to address issues of state and national importance to municipal officials. In 1998, the GLC's ''Government Law Network'' began as a way for people working in or with government to meet key law and policy makers at exclusive "Networking Breakfast" forums. The Center's ''Alumni Leaders in Government Networking Series'' provided students with an opportunity to interact with notable Albany Law School graduates.

In 1999, the GLC together with the Albany Law Clinic and Justice Center established the ''Semester in Government Program'', offering students full-time internships in government counsel offices in Albany and Washington, D.C. The Center also began producing ''The Government Law &amp; Policy Journal'' for the New York State Bar Association's Committee on Attorneys in Public Service.

In 2000, the GLC started providing services for the City of Albany's newly created ''Citizen's Police Review Board'', established by a law calling upon an academic institution to support the oversight of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Benjamin CPRB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Benjamin|first=Elizabeth|title=Albany Law at Heart of Police Oversight|newspaper=Times Union|date=April 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The GLC moved to its new location on the Albany Law School campus in 2001. The same year, the Center hosted the annual "Saratoga Institute on Racing and Gaming Law" as part of its ''Program on Racing and Gaming Law''.&lt;ref name="DeMare Racing"&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMare|first=Carole|title=Law Center Jumps Into Gaming|newspaper=Times Union|date=November 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center also received funding from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to expand mediation services for area housing communities.

In 2002, the GLC and Squire, Sanders and Dempsey began sponsoring the ''William B. Sanders Law and Public Policy Forum''. New York State officials such as former Governor [[David Paterson|David A. Paterson]], then Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]], and Assembly Speaker [[Sheldon Silver]] have participated. The ''Government Lawyer in Residence'' program at the GLC was established in 2002 to give the Center and law students the resources of a former government attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Few Words with James P King|newspaper=The Business Review|date=October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLC also produced a new edition of the ''Manual for Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers'' published by the New York State Department of Civil Service; a conference on the 30th anniversary of the [[Adirondack Park]]; New York's first conference on "smart growth"; a program to mark the 25th anniversary of the State Environmental Quality Review Act; and a symposium on siting new power plants in New York.

The GLC hosted the inaugural ''Nancy M. Sills '76 Memorial Lecture'', featuring then-Lieutenant Governor [[Mary Donohue|Mary O. Donohue]], at the 10th Annual Senior Citizen's Law Day in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lieutenant Governor Donohue Speaks at Tenth Annual Senior Citizens Law Day|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Winter 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Summer in Government'' was also introduced as a way to provide students with internship placements with government lawyers in Albany.

In 2004 the GLC, in partnership with public television station [[WMHT (TV)|WMHT]], produced "Inside the Inner Circle," focused on the process of state policymaking, featuring former counsels to five New York governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GLC Television Program Takes Viewers "Inside the Inner Circle"|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|volume=Fall 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2005 the Center introduced Graduate and Post-Graduate Fellowships for law and policy research and a Faculty Affiliate program to augment its research capability. Historian and scholar [[Paul Finkelman]] was named Senior Faculty Fellow at the GLC and Albany Law School's President William McKinley Distinguished Professor of Law and Public Policy. The ''Clarence D. "Rapp" Rappleyea Government Lawyer in Residence Program'' was established to recognize the former State Assembly Minority Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clarence D.Rappleyea Appointed Government Lawyer in Residence at the GLC|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 - 2007, the GLC took on a number of new projects: a series of procurement law initiatives to help improve New York State's procurement process and identify potential areas of reform in the 1995 Procurement Stewardship Act; providing technical assistance related to consolidations, mergers, dissolutions, cooperative agreements and shared services as part of the ''Shared Municipal Services Incentive (SMSI) Grant Program'', under a contract with the New York State Department of State; establishing a ''Non-Profit Legal Assistance Program'' with the assistance of then-U.S. Congressman [[Michael R. McNulty]]; and the establishment of the ''Public Authorities Project'', to provide research on legal aspects of public policy issues facing public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GLC Launches Public Authorities Project to Provide|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLC also hosted a number of conferences and programs during 2005 - 2007, including: a [[Cornell University]] co-sponsored invitational series on New York State water resources; a national teleconference on the legal aspects of commercializing hydrogen technology; a forum on the siting of wind facilities in New York, in partnership with the [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]] (NYSERDA);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New York’s Potential for Wind Energy Development|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a national teleconference series on renewable energy, sponsored by the American Council on Renewable Energy; and a symposium on municipal broadband and WiFi policies, in cooperation with the New York State Office for Technology, the New York State Public Service Commission, the New York State Department of State, and the [[Empire State Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=State’s Municipal Broadband Policy|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ''Ethics in Government Act'', the GLC convened a symposium in 2007 keynoted by former Fordham Law School Dean [[John Feerick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=20 Years of Ethics Reform - The Ethics in Government Act Revisited|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Government Law Center proceeded to sponsor and co-sponsor numerous conferences in 2008 - 2009, including a 2009 conference on building in the 21st century, co-sponsored with the [[American Institute of Architects]], New York State and the [[New York City Bar Association]]; a symposium on E-FOIL and the impact of technology on accessing records featuring Miriam Nisbet, Director of the Office of Government Information Services, United States National Archives and Records Administration;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Speakers Debate Challenges of|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a symposium on preserving executive records in 2010, with former Governor of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney General [[Dick Thornburgh]] and presidential historian [[Richard Norton Smith]].

In 2010 - 2011, in conjunction with the Albany Law School's ''Albany Law Review'', the GLC held symposia on education reform with Charles Rose, General Counsel for the [[United States Department of Education]]; baseball and the law, featuring [[John Thorn]], Major League Baseball's official Baseball Historian;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Baseball and the Law Conference|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ([[LGBT]]) rights, keynoted by [[Jeh Johnson]], General Counsel for the [[United States Department of Defense]].

In 2009, Albany Law School was awarded a four-year, $250,000 incentive by NYSERDA to help create sustainable networks in New York State that support early-stage companies focused on [[sustainable energy|renewable and clean energy]] product development. In 2010, the GLC received additional funding from NYSERDA to begin providing legal education and early stage business support to New York's [[cleantech]] and alternative energy companies, including a web-based resource, ''Legal Handbook for Early Stage Business''.

In 2010, the GLC introduced the nationwide ''Public Authorities Information Clearinghouse (PAIC)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Public Authority Reform Research Results in On-Line Clearinghouse and Public Clearinghouse and Publication|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to help government officials, public interest groups, and others navigate documents that pertain to the operation of government of public authorities. A blog on public authorities was launched in 2011.

The '''Grand Genève''' (''Greater Geneva'' in English) is an [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] that extends in [[Switzerland]] ([[canton of Geneva]], le [[district of Nyon]]) and [[France]] (parts of [[Haute-Savoie]] and [[Ain]]) around the city of [[Geneva]]. It has 946,000 inhabitants (2015).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grand-geneve.org/grand-geneve/le-territoire/chiffres-cles&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/alpes/haute-savoie/enquete-sur-le-grand-geneve-les-francais-plus-enthousiastes-que-les-suisses-995033.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{duplication}}&lt;!--what is the point of keeping two timelines with exactly the same scope, one "graphical" and the other in html table format?--&gt;
This more than 20-billion-year '''timeline of our universe''' shows the best estimates of major events from the universe's beginning to anticipated future events. Zero on the scale is the present day. A large step on the scale is one billion years; a small step, one hundred million years. The past is denoted by a minus sign: e.g., the oldest rock on Earth was formed about four billion years ago and this is marked at -4e+09 years, where 4e+09 represents 4 times 10 to the power of 9. The "[[Big Bang]]" event most likely happened 13.8 billion years ago; see [[age of the universe]].

'''Hearing conservation programs''' are designed to prevent hearing loss due to noise.  Regarding occupational exposures to noise, a written hearing conservation program is required by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) "whenever employee noise exposures equal or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average sound level (TWA) of 85 [[decibel]]s (dB) measured on the A scale (slow response) or, equivalently, a dose of fifty percent."&lt;ref&gt;29 CFR 1910.95(c)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  This 8-hour time-weighted average is known as an [[exposure action value]].  While the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) also requires a hearing conservation program, MSHA does not require a written hearing conservation program.  MSHA's hearing conservation program requirement can be found in 30 CFR § 62.150,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msha.gov/30CFR/62.150.htm  30 CFR § 62.150]&lt;/ref&gt; and requires has almost the same exact requirements as the OSHA hearing conservation program requirements.  Therefore, only the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.95 will be discussed in detail.

==Program requirements==

The OSHA standard contains a series of program requirements.
*'''Engineering Controls:''' 29 CFR 1910.95(b)(1) requires that "feasible administrative or engineering controls shall be utilized. If such controls fail to reduce sound levels...personal protective equipment shall be provided and used to reduce sound levels..."
*'''Monitoring:''' 29 CFR 1910.95(d) requires that monitoring be conducted when "any employee's exposure may equal or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels.
*'''Testing:''' 29 CFR 1910.95(g) requires an "audiometric testing program" for "all employees whose exposures equal or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels".
*'''Hearing Protectors:''' 29 CFR 1910.95(i) states that "employers shall make hearing protectors available to all employees exposed to an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels or greater at no cost to the employees"
*'''Training:''' 29 CFR 1910.95(k) mandates an annual "training program" for "all employees who are exposed to noise at or above an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels..." and mandates certain aspects of the training that must be included.  This includes the effects of noise on hearing; purpose, advantages, disadvantages, and attenuation of different types of hearing protectors; purpose audiometric testing.
* '''Record Keeping:''' 29 CFR 1910.95(m) states that employers "shall maintain an accurate record of all employee exposure measurements..."

==Sound survey==
A sound survey is often completed to determine areas of potential high noise exposure. A noise screening is completed initially to determine which areas are higher than 80&amp;nbsp;dB A. For these areas, an official sound survey will take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/new_noise/index.html#walkaround|title=OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) {{!}} Section III: Chapter 5 - Noise {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of survey is normally completed using a [[sound level meter]] (SLM).  There are three types of sound level meters.  Type 0 is precision instrument normally used in laboratories.  Type 1 is for precision measurements taken in the field.  Type 2 sound level meters are less precise than type 1 and are often used to take all-purpose sound level measurements.  Noise monitoring is generally completed using a [[noise dosimeter]] that integrates "all continuous, intermittent and impulsive sound levels"&lt;ref&gt;29 CFR 1910.95(d)(2)(i)&lt;/ref&gt; to determine a person's noise exposure level.

Surveys must be repeated when there are significant changes in machinery and/or processes that would affect the noise level.&lt;ref&gt;OSHA 1910.95 appendix (G)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering and administrative controls==
[[Engineering controls]] and [[administrative controls]] are ranked as the most effective protection from noise in the hierarchy of controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/reducenoiseexposure/noisecontrols.html|title=CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Reducing Noise Exposure, Noise Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|date=2018-02-05|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering controls are measures taken to reduce the intensity of noise at the source or between the source and a person exposed to the noise.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/evaluation.html|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Occupational Noise Exposure - Exposure &amp; Controls {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative controls are limitations around noise sources that limit length of noise exposure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Hearing protection devices==
If engineering controls fail to maintain an 8-hour time-weighted average below 85 dBA, then a hearing protection device (HPD) is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/safety-centers-of-expertise-us/center-for-hearing-conservation/measure/|title=Noise Measurement {{!}} Hearing Conservation Safety Expertise Center {{!}} Worker Health &amp; Safety {{!}} 3M United States|website=www.3m.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two general types of HPDs: earplugs and earmuffs.  Each one has its own benefits and drawbacks.  The selection of the proper HPD to be worn is commonly done by an [[Occupational hygiene|industrial hygienist]] so that the proper amount of noise protection is worn.  OSHA requires that HPD be given free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;29 CFR 1910.95(i)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earplugs===
There are four general classes of [[earplug]]s. These include: pre-molded, formable, custom molded and semi-insert.
  
*Premolded earplugs do not require the plug to be formed before it is inserted into the ear. This prevents the plugs from becoming soiled before insertion.
*Formable earplugs are made of a variety of substances; however, all each substance shares the common feature of being able to be shaped by the user prior to insertion.  One drawback of this is the obvious need for the user to have clean hands while shaping the earplug.  They do have the advantage of forming to the users ear, while many premolded earplugs do not accomplish this very well.
*Custom molded ear plugs are unique for each person, since they are cast from each user's own ear canals.  Therefore, they provide a personalized fit for each individual.
*Semi-inserts are generally a soft earplug on the end of band.  The band aides in maintaining the earplug in position.  They are often useful since they can be quickly removed and inserted.

===Earmuffs===
[[Earmuff]]s are another type of HPD.  The main difference between earmuffs and earplugs, is that earmuffs are not inserted inside the ear canal.  Instead the muffs create a seal around the outside of the ear to prevent noise from reaching the inner ear.  Earmuffs are easy to wear and often provide a more consistent fit than an earplug.  There are earmuffs available that use the principle of [[active noise control]] to help reduce noise exposures. However, the protection earmuffs offer may be mitigated by large sideburns or glasses as the seal of the earmuffs may be broken by these objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/choose.html|title=Choosing the Hearing Protection That's Right For You|last=Stephenson|first=Carol Merry|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noise reduction ratings==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) requires that all hearing protection devices be labeled with their associated noise reduction rating (NRR).&lt;ref&gt;40 CFR code of Federal Regulations, Part 211, Product Noise Labeling, Subpart B - Hearing Protection Devises&lt;/ref&gt;  The NRR provides the estimated attenuation of the hearing protection device.  However, it has been found that the "labeled manufacturers' noise reduction ratings (NRRs) substantially overestimated the actual field attenuation performance."&lt;ref&gt;Park, MY; Casali, JG (December 1991)."A controlled investigation of in-field attenuation performance of selected insert, earmuff, and canal cap hearing protectors". ''Human Factors'' '''33'''(6): 693-714&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berger EH, Franks JR, Behar A, Casali JG, Dixon-Ernst C, Kieper RW, Merry CJ, Mozo BT, Nixon CW, Ohlin D, Royster JD, and Royster LH. (1998) Development of a new standard laboratory protocol for estimating the field attenuation of hearing protection devices. Part III. The validity of using subject-fit data. J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 102:665-672.&lt;/ref&gt;  To determine the amount of noise reduction afforded by a hearing protection device, OSHA recommends that 7&amp;nbsp;dB be subtracted from the NRR.  The NRR is generally given in a C-weighted format, so to obtain the A-weighted reduction, one must subtract 7&amp;nbsp;dB.  OSHA also recommends a 50% safety factor, therefore the final OSHA recommended reduction would be (NRR-7)/2.&lt;ref&gt;CPL 02-02-035 - CPL 2-2.35A - 29 CFR 1910.95(b)(1), Guidelines for Noise Enforcement; Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fit testing for hearing protection'''

The NRR now has some help. Fit testing devices on the market that will verify a proper fit of an HPD (hearing protection device).  The fit of a hearing protector is very important, because if the HPD is not worn properly, the NRR becomes irrelevant.  Products that will verify proper fit include: 3M EARFit Validation System, FitCheck, FitCheck Solo, INTEGRAfit, SafetyMeter, and VeriPro.  Fit-test systems provide a Personal Attenuation Rating (PAR) that is currently dependent upon the company that manufactures the fit-testing system.  Most fit test systems provide an A-weighted PAR, which means that the attenuation can be subtracted from the A-weighted noise exposure assessment of the employee or hearing protector user.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=William|date=2013|title=Comparing Personal Attenuation Ratings for Hearing Protector Fit-test Systems|url=http://www.caohc.org/updatearticles/2013/winter2013.pdf?version=012914|journal=CAOHC Update|volume=|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audiometric testing program==
[[Audiometry|Audiometric testing]] is a part of the hearing conservation program that is used in the identification of significant hearing loss.  Audiometric testing can identify those who have permanent hearing loss.  This is called noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/noise/health_effects/effects.html Noise and Hearing Conservation Technical Manual Chapter: Noise and Health Effects (App I:C)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Completing baseline audiograms and periodically monitoring threshold levels is one way to track any changes in hearing and identify if there is a need to make improvements to the hearing conservation program.  OSHA, which monitors workplaces in the United states to ensure safe and healthful working conditions, specifies that employees should have a baseline audiogram established within 6 months of their first exposure to 85 dBA time-weighted average (TWA). If a worker is unable to obtain a baseline audiogram within 6 months of employment, HPD is required to be worn if the worker is exposed to 85 dBA or above TWA. HPD must be worn until a baseline audiogram is obtained.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hearing Conservation in Occupational, Recreational, Educational, and Home Settings|last=Rawool|first=V.W.|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York: NY|pages=65–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the MSHA, which monitors compliance to standards within the mining industry, an existing audiogram that meets specific standards can be used for the employee’s baseline. Before establishing baseline, it is important that the employee limit excessive noise exposure that could potentially cause a temporary threshold shift and affect results of testing. OSHA stipulates that an employee be noise-free for at least 14 hours prior to testing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Periodic audiometric monitoring, typically completed annually as recommended by OSHA, can identify changes in hearing. There are specific criteria that the change must meet in order to require action. The criterion most commonly used is the standard threshold shift (STS), defined by a change of 10&amp;nbsp;dB or greater averaged at 2000, 3000, and 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Age correction factors can be applied to the change in order to compensate for hearing loss that is age-related rather than work-related. If an STS is found, OSHA requires that the employee be notified of this change within 21 days.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, any employee that is not currently wearing HPD is now required to wear protection. If the employee is already wearing protection, they should be refit with a new device and retrained on appropriate use.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another determination that is made includes whether an STS is “recordable” under OSHA standards, meaning the workplace must report the change to OSHA. In order to be recordable the employee’s new thresholds at 2000, 3000, and 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz must exceed an average of 25&amp;nbsp;dB HL.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; MSHA standard differs slightly in terms of calculation and terminology. MSHA considers whether an STS is “reportable” by determining if the average amount of change that occurs exceeds 25&amp;nbsp;dB HL.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The various measures that are used in occupational audiometric testing allow consistency in standards within workplaces. Completing baseline and follow-up audiograms allows workplaces to detect hearing loss as early as possible and determine whether changes need to be made to provide a safe working environment for their employees.

== Employee training and education ==
Proper training and education of those exposed to noise is the key to preventing [[noise-induced hearing loss]].  If employees are properly trained on how to follow a hearing conservation program, then the risk of noise-induced hearing loss is reduced. By providing information on the physiological effects of noise exposure, the importance of obtaining baseline and annual audiograms, and use of appropriate hearing protection, the program will provide a thorough knowledge base for employees involved. Providing a refresher training when appropriate will support retention of this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hearing Conservation in Occupational, Recreational, Educational and Home Settings|last=Rawool|first=V.W.|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York: NY|pages=174–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSHA requires this training to be completed on an annual basis.  Proper training is imperative since "even with a very modest amount of instruction attenuation performance can be significantly improved."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W. (2004).  "Instruction and the improvement of Hearing Protector Performance" ''Noise and Health'' Oct-Dec;'''7'''(25):41-77  http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2004;volume=7;issue=25;spage=41;epage=47;aulast=Williams&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A, Punch J, Stephenson M, Wolfe E, Paneth N, Murphy W (2007). The Effects of Training Format on Earplug Performance. Int J Audiology 46:609-618&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resources needed to carry out a hearing conservation program ===
To carry out a hearing conservation training, the program may utilize a variety of materials to relay the necessary information. An assortment if written, video, audio, and hands on experience may make the training more interactive and meaningful to employees. It is recommended that materials also be translated into languages other than English so all employees can attend and benefit from the training. Pre- and post-assessments, a safe and secure learning environment, access to training media and equipment, informational handouts/pamphlets, and examples of hearing protection devices are all resources that can contribute to successful HLPP trainings.

=== Initial Training ===
The initial training for employees should cover the following topics:

* The physical and psychological effects of noise-induced hearing loss
* Recognition of hazardous noise may be possible whether it is posted or unposted
* Audiometric testing and its purpose
* The responsibilities of employees and supervisors in the hearing conservation program
* The danger of noise exposure in recreational activities
* Possible effects of hearing loss on job performance and fitness for duty&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hearing Conservation in Occupational, Recreational, Educational and Home Settings|last=Rawool|first=V.W.|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York: NY|pages=174–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors Influencing Employee Motivation to Participate in Hearing Conservation Program ===
It is not enough to provide the employees with the information about occupational hearing loss and hearing conservation. There are many factors that may contribute to the employee's lack of compliance with training. These factors fall under three main categories: individual perceptions or beliefs, individual personality, and influencing variables.

==== Individual Perceptions ====
Every worker has perceptions about their work environment, how noise and ototoxins affect them, and hearing conservation programs. Some workers may believe that they are invulnerable to hearing loss.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These workers may perceive that the noise is not loud enough to cause hearing loss.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Others know that 29% of workers may have noise-induced hearing loss, meaning 71% are not likely to develop a hearing loss due to noise. Because of these statistics, some workers may believe that they will fall into the 71%. Others may believe that they are too young to suffer from hearing loss. Still others have the incorrect belief that loud noise will make the ears tougher. A portion of workers may not realize the implications of a hearing loss and that hearing aids will be able to fix their hearing.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; If there is not a perceived benefit to utilizing hearing protection devices, it is less likely that individuals will participate. If workers perceive that there are barriers to taking action to prevent hearing loss, they are also less likely to participate in the program. These barriers may include hearing protection affecting their ability to perform their job well, their company being shut down due to the noise levels, hearing protector comfort, and chronic irritation and infection of the outer and middle ear.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=William Hal|last2=Sobel|first2=Judith|last3=Griest|first3=Susan E.|last4=Howarth|first4=Linda|last5=Yongbing|first5=Shi|date=2006-06-01|title=Noise Induced Hearing Loss in Children: Preventing the Silent Epidemic|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672293006500029|journal=Journal of Otology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=11–21|doi=10.1016/S1672-2930(06)50002-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individual Personality ====
A small number of individuals may see the use of [[Hearing protection device|HPD]] as weakness or not being manly. This may arise from peer pressure.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==== Influencing Variables ====
Workers who have experienced or are currently experiencing tinnitus are more likely to utilize HPD consistently. Others who have had a temporary hearing loss may be triggered to motivate preventative action. Workers who have suffered from a temporary hearing threshold shift following loud noise exposure may serve as a motivation for the use of HPD. The use of HPDs is more common in companies with more complete hearing conservation programs.

=== Motivational Techniques ===
Motivational techniques can be implemented to promote hearing conservation program compliance and the use of hearing protection. One suggestion is continued education at the workers' audiometric screening.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They should be asked to bring along their current hearing protection device to the screening.  If the results are normal and the inspection of the hearing protection device is good, praise can be given for following protocol.  If there is a shift in their hearing, instruction can be given again about the proper use of hearing protection and the importance of wearing them. Audiograms can be very useful in showing workers how noise can affect their hearing. One specific way to do this is to perform two hearing test on an employee on two different days.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  One day the hearing test will be after wearing hearing protection all day and the other will be after not wearing hearing protection for the day.  The difference can then be discussed with the worker and he/she has a tangible way to see how noise affects hearing.  Another technique is using "internal triggers" to motivate employees to comply to the hearing conservation program.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=William|date=2013|title=Comparing Personal Attenuation Ratings for Hearing Protector Fit-test Systems|url=http://www.caohc.org/updatearticles/2013/winter2013.pdf?version=012914|journal=CAOHC Update|volume=|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the individual already suffers from tinnitus and/or hearing loss they are probably more likely to use hearing protection because he/she does not want that problem to progress with noise exposure.  Finally, the hearing protection offered should be comfortable so the worker will wear it. It is suggested that workers have a variety of hearing protection devices available to them, including at least one type of earmuff and two different forms of earplugs, to fit the individual needs and wants of the workers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Record keeping==
OSHA requires that records of exposure measurements and audiometric tests be maintained.  Records are also required to have the following: 
*name and job classification
*date of the audiogram
*examiner's name
*calibration date
*employee's most recent noise exposure assessment
*background sound pressure levels in audiometric test booths.
Noise exposure measurement records must be maintained for at least 2 years.  Audiometric test records must be retained for the duration of the affected employee's employment.  Additionally, employees, former employees, representatives designated by the individual employee and the Assistant Secretary all must have access to these records.&lt;ref&gt;29 CFR 1910.95(m)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program evaluation==
Proper program evaluation is important in maintaining the health of hearing conservation program.  The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has created a checklist to help evaluate the effectiveness of a hearing conservation program.  It can be found on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/solutions/hearingchecklist.html Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention:  Hearing Conservation Program Checklist] National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health&lt;/ref&gt;  NIOSH recommends that fewer than 5% of exposed employees should have a 15&amp;nbsp;dB significant threshold shift in the same ear and same frequency.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is pushing a higher emphasis on a hearing loss prevention program rather than a hearing conservation program.  While this change may seem superfluous, it is important to note the advancement.  Prevention implies a response by the workplace caused by initial signs of employee hearing loss rather than instilling a new set of policies (such as "buy quiet") and thinking (such as hearing protection training and education) to decrease the possibility of occupational hearing loss from happening in the first place.

The Buy Quiet policy is an easy way to progress towards a safer work environment.  Many traditionally noisy tools and machines are now being redesigned in order to manufacture quieter running equipment, so a "buy quiet" purchase policy should not require new engineering solutions in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-110/pdfs/96-110.pdf|title=PREVENTING OCCUPATIONAL HEARING LOSS — A PRACTICAL GUIDE |editor1=John R. Franks|editor2=Mark R. Stephenson|editor3=Carol J. Merry|year=1996 |publisher=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a part of the "buy quiet" campaign, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection released a products and vendor guidance sheet in order to assist contractors for achieving compliance with the New York City Noise Regulations.

In order to make these plans effective, employees and administration need to be educated in occupational noise-induced hearing loss prevention.  It is also necessary to identify and examine sources of noise first before being able to control the damage it may cause to hearing.  For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has conducted a study and created a database on handheld power tools for the sound power levels they expose their operators to.   This [[NIOSH Power Tools Database|Power Tools Database]] allows contractors in a trade-skill profession to monitor their exposure limits and allow them preparation to prevent permanent hearing damage.

== Hearing conservation for children ==

=== Overview ===
Due to increased worry among both parents and experts regarding [[Noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) in children, it has been suggested that hearing conservation programs be implemented in schools as part of their studies regarding health and wellness. The necessity for these programs is supported by the following reasons: 1. Children are not sheltered from loud noises in their daily lives, and 2. Promoting healthy behaviors at a young age is critical to future application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hearing Conservation|last=Rawool|first=Vishakha Waman|publisher=Theime Medical Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=283|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of a hearing conservation program for children will strongly differ from those created for the occupational settings discussed above. While children may not be exposed to factory of industrial noise on a daily basis, they may be exposed to noise sources such as firearms, music, power tools, sports, and noisy toys. All of these encounters with noise cumulatively increases their risk for developing [[Noise-induced hearing loss]]. With NIHL being a fully preventable ailment, providing children with this type of education has the potential to reduce future incidence of this condition. There are multiple organizations in existence that provide educators with the appropriate material to teach this topic; teachers simply need to be proactive about accessing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Folmer|first=Robert|date=2008-02-01|title=Hearing-Loss Prevention Practices Should Be Taught in Schools|url=http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2007-1021774|journal=Seminars in Hearing|language=en|volume=29|issue=1|pages=067–080|doi=10.1055/s-2007-1021774|issn=0734-0451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are examples of hearing conservation programs that have been designed specifically for children.

=== Creation of Programs ===
This is the primary goal of most hearing conservation programs at the elementary, middle, and high school levels is to spread knowledge about hearing loss and noise exposure. When an educational program is being created or adapted for use with children, behavior change theories are often employed to increase effectiveness. [[Learning theory (education)|Behavior theory]] identifies possible obstacles to change while also highlighting factors that may encourage students to change.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=William Hal|last2=Sobel|first2=Judith|last3=Griest|first3=Susan E.|last4=Howarth|first4=Linda|last5=Yongbing|first5=Shi|date=2006-06-01|title=Noise Induced Hearing Loss in Children: Preventing the Silent Epidemic|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672293006500029|journal=Journal of Otology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=11–21|doi=10.1016/S1672-2930(06)50002-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are elements that are also considered during the implementation of a new program for children:

1.    Adaptation of the program for the specific population (age, demographic, etc.)

2.    Use of interactive games, lessons, and role-playing

3.    Time to apply the skills that are taught

4.    Reoccurring lessons on the same topic area&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Examples of Programs &amp; Campaigns ===

==== Dangerous Decibels ====
Dangerous Decibels is a program designed to teach concepts related to the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss. Proven to be effective for children in 4th through 7th grade, children are engaged in hands-on activities during this 50-minute presentation. The class will learn about what sound is, how their ears hear and detect it, and how they can protect their hearing from dangerous decibels. Throughout the program, the class focuses on three strategies: Turn it Down, Walk Away, and Protect your Ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dangerousdecibels.org/education/outreach-program-overview/|title=The Dangerous Decibels Classroom Presentation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Listen to your Buds ====
Created by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)|American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]], this campaign aims to teach children and their parents about practicing safe listening routines when listening to music through personal devices, such as an iPod. With the help of sponsors, ASHA hosts an educational concert series to promote safe music listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/buds/|title=Listen to Your Buds|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cheers for Ears ====
Run by the Ear Science Institute of Australia, this school program was created to educate elementary-age children on the risks of high listening levels and the effects of hearing loss. Program has a mascot named Charlie and utilizes sound level meters, computer games, apps, and take-home packets to teach the concepts. Teachers also receive addition activities and worksheets for continued learning opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.earscience.org.au/community/community-programs/cheers-for-ears|title=Cheers for Ears|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== It's a Noisy Planet. Protect Their Hearing. ====
Organized by the United States [[National Institutes of Health]], this is a campaign created with the aim to increase parental awareness of both the causes and effects of noise induced hearing loss. By targeting parents instead of children, the goal is for adults to influence the behaviors of their children before bad habits are even created. Resources provided include web-based games and puzzles, downloadable graphics, and tips for school and home environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.noisyplanet.nidcd.nih.gov/|title=It's a Noisy Planet. Protect Their Hearing.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sound Sense ====
Created by The Hearing Foundation of Canada, the Sound Sense classroom program teaches children how hearing works, how it can stop working, and offers ideas for safe listening. The classroom presentation satisfies the requirements for the science unit on sound taught in either grade 3 or 4, as well as the healthy living curriculum in grades 5 and 6. In addition, the webpage provides resources &amp; games for children, parents, and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soundsense.ca/|title=Sound Sense|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== HEARsmart ====
An Australian program initiated by the HEARing Cooperative Research Centre and the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL), HEARsmart aims to improve the hearing health of all Australians, particularly those at greatest of risk of noise-related tinnitus and hearing loss. The program has a particular focus on promoting healthy hearing habits in musicians, live music venues and patrons. Resources include: [https://knowyournoise.nal.gov.au Know Your Noise] - an online risk calculator and speech-in-noise test, a short [https://hearsmart.org/what-problem/tinnitus/ video] that aims to raise awareness of tinnitus in musicians, and a comprehensive [https://hearsmart.org/ website] with detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hearsmart.org/|title=HEARsmart|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effectiveness &amp; program evaluation ===
Just as program evaluation is necessary in workplace settings, it is also an important component of educational hearing conservation programs to determine if any changes need to be made. This evaluation may consist of two main parts: assessment of students' knowledge and assessment of their skills and behaviors. To examine the level of knowledge acquired by the students, a questionnaire is often given with the expectation of an 85% competency level among students. If proficiency is too low, changes should be implemented. If the knowledge level is adequate, assessing behaviors is then necessary to see if the children are using their newfound knowledge. This evaluation can be done through classroom observation of both the students and teachers in noisy classroom environments such as music, gym, technology, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hearing Conservation|last=Rawool|first=Vishakha Waman|publisher=Theime Medical Publishers, Inc|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=292–293|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other regulatory agencies ==
The [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) requires that all feasible engineering and administrative controls be employed to reduce miners' exposure levels to 90 dBA TWA. The action level for enrollment in a hearing conservation program is 85 dBA 8-hour [[Time-weighted average (PEL)|TWA]], integrating all sound levels between 80 dBA to at least 130 dBA. MSHA uses a 5-dB exchange rate (the sound level in decibels that would result in halving [if an increase in sound level] or a doubling [if a decrease.in sound level] the allowable exposure time to maintain the same noise dose). At and above exposure levels of 90 dBA TWA, the miner must wear hearing protection. At and above exposure levels above 105 dBA TWA, the miner must wear dual hearing protection. Miners may not be exposed to sounds exceeding 115 dBA with or without hearing protection devices. MSHA defines an STS as an average decrease in auditory sensitivity of 10&amp;nbsp;dB HL at the frequencies 2000, 3000, and 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz. (30 CFR Part 62&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=30 CFR Part 62|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c29fd670c11d1d61d7993b4a66c346d5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt30.1.62&amp;rgn=div5|website=eCFR - Code of Federal Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) encourages, but does not require, railroads to use administrative controls that reduce noise exposure duration when the worker exceeds 90 dBA TWA. The FRA defines the action level for employee enrollment in a hearing conservation program as an 8-hour TWA of 85 dBA on certain railroads, integrating all sound levels between 80 dBA and 140 dBA. FRA uses a 5-dB exchange rate. Those employees who are always at or above 90 dBA TWA are required to wear hearing protection such that sound levels are attenuated below 90 dBA TWA. (49 CFR Part 229&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=49 CFR Part 229|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title49/49cfr229_main_02.tpl|website=eCFR - Code of Federal Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DOD) specifies that engineering controls are preferential when reducing the noise levels at the source. The use of hearing protective devices is considered an "interim protective measure" while engineering controls are developed. The goal of these controls is to reduce ambient steady-state noise levels to 85 dBA regardless of TWA exposure and to reduce impulse noise levels to below 140 dBP. The DOD requires that personnel be entered into a hearing conservation program when continuous and intermittent noise levels ale grs greater than or equal to 85 dBA TWA, when impulse SPL are at or in excess of 140 dBP, or when the personnel is exposed to ultrasonic frequencies. The DOD integrates all sound levels between 80 dBA to a minimum of 130 dBA when determining an individual or representative noise dose. When used, hearing protectors must be capable of attenuating worker noise exposure below 85 dBA TWA. Hearing protection is required to be carried by personnel who work in designated noise areas, such as those exposed to gunfire or ordnance tests and Service musicians. The DOD defines a significant threshold shift as a 10&amp;nbsp;dB average decrease in hearing thresholds at 2000, 3000, and 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz in either ear, with no age corrections. It is further specified that a shift in 15&amp;nbsp;dB at 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz is an early warning sign for an STS; follow-up retraining is required in this case. (DOD Instruction 6055.12&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOD Instruction 6055.12|url=http://dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/605512p.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The [[European Union]] (EU) requires a hearing conservation program be implemented when the worker exposure levels exceed 80 dBA TWA. Note that this is ''more strict'' than hearing conservation regulations in the United States. The EU specifies several different exposure action values: a "lower" value of 80 dBA at which the employer must make hearing protection devices available to the employee; an "upper" value of 85 dBA at which the employee is required to wear hearing protection; and an "exposure limit" value of 87 dBA, under which the individual's noise exposure shall be limited to preserve hearing. The directive also defines a weekly noise exposure level which is applied to individuals working in circumstances of inconstant noise exposure. Finally, the EU also recommends a variety of noise reduction methods, including administrative controls to reduce worker exposure duration, the provision of quieter equipment, and adequate maintenance of machinery and other noise sources (European Parliament and Council Directive 2003|10|EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIRECTIVE 2003/10/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL|url=http://www.noise-measurement.nl/info/2003_10_eu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7574">'''Holeums''' are hypothetical stable, quantized gravitational bound states of [[Primordial black hole|primordial]] or [[micro black holes]]. Holeums were proposed by L. K. Chavda and Abhijit Chavda in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/19/11/311 Dark matter and stable bound states of primordial black holes]&lt;/ref&gt; They have all the properties associated with [[cold dark matter]]. Holeums are not [[black holes]], even though they are made up of black holes.

==Properties==

The [[binding energy]] &lt;math&gt;E_{n}&lt;/math&gt; of a holeum that consists of two identical micro black holes of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0308054 Dark matter and stable bound states of primordial black holes]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_{n}=-\frac{mc^{2}\alpha_{g}^{2}}{4n^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the principal [[quantum number]], &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,...,\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational counterpart of the [[fine structure constant]]. The latter is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{g}=\frac{m^{2}G}{\hbar c}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]] divided by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;;
: &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum;
: &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]].

The ''n''th excited state of a holeum then has a mass that is given by

: &lt;math&gt;m_{H}=2m+\frac{E_{n}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The holeum's atomic transitions cause it to emit [[gravitational radiation]].

The radius of the ''n''th excited state of a holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{n}=\left(  \frac{n^{2}R}{\alpha_{g}^{2}}\right)  \left(  \frac{\pi^{2}}{{8}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;R=\left(  \frac{2mG}{c^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the two identical micro black holes that constitute the holeum.

The holeum is a stable particle. It is the gravitational analogue of the [[hydrogen atom]]. It occupies space. Although it is made up of black holes, it itself is not a black hole. As the holeum is a purely gravitational system, it emits only gravitational radiation and no [[electromagnetic radiation]]. The holeum can therefore be considered to be a [[dark matter]] particle.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yu. Khlopov, [https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0801.0116 Primordial Black Holes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macro holeums and their properties==

A macro holeum is a quantized gravitational bound state of a large number of micro black holes. The energy eigenvalues of a macro holeum consisting of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; identical micro black holes of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are given by&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0703 Quantized Gravitational Radiation from Black Holes and other macro holeums in the Low Frequency Domain]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_{k}=-\frac{p^{2}mc^{2}}{2n_{k}^{2}}\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p=k\alpha_{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\gg2&lt;/math&gt;. The system is simplified by assuming that all the micro black holes in the core are in the same quantum state described by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and that the outermost, &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; micro black hole is in an arbitrary quantum state described by the principal quantum number &lt;math&gt;n_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''physical radius'' of the bound state is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{k}=\frac{\pi^{2}kRn_{k}^{2}}{16p^{2}\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The mass of the macro holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;M_{k}=mk\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The Schwarzschild radius of the macro holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;R_{k}=kR\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[entropy]] of the system is given by

: &lt;math&gt;S_{k}=k^{2}S\left( 1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy of the individual micro black holes that constitute the macro holeum.

== The ground state of macro holeums ==

The [[ground state]] of macro holeums is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The holeum has maximum binding energy, minimum physical radius, maximum Schwarzschild radius, maximum mass, and maximum entropy in this state.

Such a system can be thought of as consisting of a gas of &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; free (&lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt;) micro black holes that is bounded and therefore isolated from the outside world by a solitary outermost micro black hole whose principal quantum number is &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Stability ==

It can be seen from the above equations that the condition for the stability of holeums is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the relations &lt;math&gt;p=k\alpha _{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{g}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; into this inequality, the condition for the stability of holeums can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;m&lt;m_{P}\left( 6\right) ^{\frac{1}{4}}\left( \frac{n}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The ground state of holeums is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, which gives us &lt;math&gt;m&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the condition for stability. Thus, the ground state of holeums is guaranteed to be always stable.

== Black holeums ==

A holeum is a black hole if its physical radius is less than or equal to its Schwarzschild radius, i.e. if

:&lt;math&gt;r_{k}\leqslant R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Such holeums are termed black holeums. Substituting the expressions for &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and simplifying, we obtain the condition for a holeum to be a black holeum to be

:&lt;math&gt;m\geqslant \frac{m_{P}}{2}\left( \frac{\pi n_{k}}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the ground state, which is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;, this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;m\geqslant \frac{m_{P}}{2}\left( \frac{\pi}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Black holeums are an example of black holes with internal structure. Black holeums are quantum black holes whose internal structure can be fully predicted by means of the quantities &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Holeums and cosmology ==

Holeums are speculated to be the progenitors of a class of short duration [[gamma ray bursts]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Al Dallal, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AdSpR..40.1236A Holeums as potential candidates for some short-lived gamma ray bursts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Al Dallal, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AdSpR..46..468D Primordial black holes and holeums as progenitors of galactic diffuse gamma-ray background]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also speculated that holeums give rise to [[cosmic rays]] of all energies, including [[ultra-high-energy cosmic rays]].&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0454 Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from decays of holeums in Galactic Halos]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''immediations''}}
'''''immediations''''' is an annual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] in the [[history of art]], published by the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], London.  The journal was established in 2004 by Louise Sørensen, John-Paul Stonard, and Linda Goddard.

''immediations'' covers research on any period in the history of art by current or recent members of the postgraduate community of the Courtauld Institute of Art. ''immediations'' also publishes interviews with art historians, artists, conservators and curators, and transcripts of events held at The Courtauld Institute of Art Research Forum.

In 2009, ''immediations'' initiated an occasional series of period-specific, themed volumes with ''immediations Conference Papers 1: Art and Nature, Studies in Medieval Art and Architecture'' ({{ISBN|978-1907485008}}), edited by Laura Cleaver, Kathryn Gerry, and Jim Harris.

2014 marked the journal's tenth year, celebrated by a series of events including a Conference on 17 January 2015 at the Courtauld Institute of Art. The conference featured past contributors and editors, who discussed their current research or the ways in which the trajectory of their careers in the art world reflected their original contributions to ''immediations''.

'''Judicial activism''' refers to [[judiciary|judicial]] rulings that are suspected of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of [[judicial restraint]].&lt;ref name="cwolfe"&gt;{{cite book|first = Christopher |last = Wolfe|title = Judicial activism|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn = 0-8476-8531-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OtQu8dnH9coC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=0-8476-8531-4&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KePXbURFud&amp;sig=rMU-TMUfzmUXC6L3MWGKOkIqECk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3Z_2vZXcAhUPbKwKHXjZD_QQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=0-8476-8531-4&amp;f=false|date = 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of judicial activism and the specific decisions that are activist are controversial political issues. The question of judicial activism is closely related to [[judicial interpretation|constitutional interpretation]], [[statutory construction]], and [[separation of powers]].

==Etymology==
[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] introduced the term "judicial activism" in a January 1947 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kmiec|first=Keenan D.|title=The Origin and Current Meanings of 'Judicial Activism'|journal=Cal. L. Rev.|year=2004|volume=92|pages=1441, 1447|quote=Schlesinger's article profiled all nine Supreme Court justices on the Court at that time and explained the alliances and divisions among them. The article characterized Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] as the 'Judicial Activists' and Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]] as the 'Champions of Self Restraint.' Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] and Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] comprised a middle group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism," is critical of Schlesinger's use of the term; "Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=roger_craig_green "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism"] Craig Green, August 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before this phrase was first used, the general concept already existed. For example, [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to the "despotic behaviour" of [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] federal judges, in particular Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qWlMgSqhRv4C&amp;pg=PA254 Haines &amp; Sherwood, ''The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government and Politics: 1789–1835'', 1944, p.209]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines judicial activism as a "philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in "Takings Clause Jurisprudence: Muddled, Perhaps; Judicial Activism, No" DF O'Scannlain, ''Geo. JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley C. Canon – "Defining the Dimensions of Judicial Activism," ''Judicature'', 66.6, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. David A. Strauss has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning [[case law|judicial precedent]], and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2015}}

Others have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. [[Kermit Roosevelt III]] has argued that "in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with";&lt;ref name=roosevelt&gt;Kermit Roosevelt, III, ''The Myth of Judicial Activism: Making Sense of Supreme Court Decisions'', Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-12691-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12691-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] under [[George W. Bush]], [[Theodore Olson]], said in an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', in regards to [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger|a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated]], that "most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/ted-olson-debate-over-judicial-activism-and-same-sex-marriage|title=Ted Olson on Debate Over Judicial Activism and Same-Sex Marriage|work=Fox News Sunday|first=Chris|last=Wallace|first2=Theodore|last2=Olson|date=August 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] has said that, "An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like."&lt;ref name="flewis"&gt;Frederick P. Lewis, ''The context of judicial activism: the endurance of the Warren Court legacy in a conservative age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 1999, {{ISBN|0-8476-8992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Sedensky, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100605163057/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 Justice questions way court nominees are grilled]," Associated Press, May 14, 2010, accessed May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

Detractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html Romer, ''Governor of Colorado, et al. v. Evans et al.'' (94-1039), 517 U.S. 620 (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of [[judicial review]], and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.

A third view is that so-called "objective" interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, "Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Z. Tamanaha, ''Beyond the Formalist-Realist Divide: The Role of Politics in Judging'', Princeton University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under this view, any judge's use of [[judicial discretion]] will necessarily be shaped by that judge's personal and professional experience and his or her views on a wide range of matters, from legal and juridical philosophy to morals and ethics. This implies a tension between granting flexibility (to enable the dispensing of justice) and placing bounds on that flexibility (to hold judges to ruling from legal grounds rather than extralegal ones).

Some proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient [[majoritarianism]], i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers.&lt;ref&gt;John Hart Ely, ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, chapters 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars have proposed that judicial activism is most appropriate when it restrains the tendency of democratic majorities to act out of passion and prejudice rather than after reasoned deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Zoldan, "Targeted Judicial Activism," 16 Green Bag 2d 465-66 (2014) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2310915]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.

India has a recent history of judicial activism, originating after [[The Emergency (India)|the emergency in India]] which saw attempts by the Government to [[The Emergency (India)#Tendency to control Judiciary|control the judiciary.]] [[Public Interest Litigation]] was thus an instrument devised by the courts to reach out directly to the public, and take [[judicial notice|cognizance]] though the litigant may not be the victim.

The trend has been supported as well criticized.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} New York Times author [[Gardiner Harris]] sums this up as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/world/asia/court-restores-indias-ban-on-gay-sex.html?hp&amp;_r=2&amp; | work=The New York Times | first=Gardiner | last=Harris | title=India's Supreme Court Restores an 1861 Law Banning Gay Sex | date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre''' ('''LPSC''') is a research and development centre functioning under [[Indian Space Research Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpsc.gov.in LPSC Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; It has two units located at Valiamala, in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] of [[Kerala]], and [[Bengaluru]] of [[Karnataka]]. LPSC is augmented by [[ISRO Propulsion Complex]] at [[Mahendragiri]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].

LPSC is engaged in development of liquid and [[Cryogenic#Fuels|cryogenic propulsion]] stages for launch vehicles and auxiliary propulsion systems for both launch vehicles and satellites.  Activities related to liquid propulsion stages, cryogenic propulsion stages and control systems for launch vehicles and spacecraft is done at [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. Precision fabrication facilities, development of transducers and integration of satellite propulsion systems are carried out at [[Bangalore]]. The developmental and flight tests along with assembly and integration are done at [[ISRO Propulsion Complex]], [[Mahendragiri]] in [[Tamil Nadu]].

The development of liquid propellant stages for [[PSLV]], control systems for SLV-3, [[ASLV]], [[PSLV]] and [[GSLV]], satellite propulsion systems including those for [[INSAT]] and IRS and production of pressure transducers are done by the LPSC for [[India]]. The LPSC has developed indigenous cryogenic upper stage for [[GSLV|Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle]] (GSLV) which was successfully test fired by [[ISRO]] on August 4, 2007.

LPSC's current director is Dr. V Narayanan. He succeeded Mr. S Somnath in January, 2018 after which Shri S Somnath was appointed as Director of VSSC.&lt;ref name=Director&gt;{{cite news|last=Correspondent|first=Special|title=New Directors at ISRO centres|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/new-directors-at-isro-centres/article6167830.ece|accessdate=2 July 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modular additions''' are usually side and second-story additions to homes that are pre-fabricated at the facilities. General characteristics of a [[modular home]] apply. For a second-story modular addition the existing house should have a sound structure as modular rooms are 30%+ heavier than the same stick-built. Modular additions are built in the facility, brought to the site and “dropped” by crane on the new location. It is necessary to have a general contractor to supervise the project as there is always some work to tie new rooms into an existing house.

Even though it is assumed that modular additions are less expensive than traditional stick built this is rarely true when compared by square footage. The buyer would generally get more wood and better insulation plus benefits of controlled environment but total cost of the contract would be about the same.

'''''Music Survey''''' was a short-lived [[academic journal]] covering [[classical music|classical]] and [[contemporary classical music|contemporary music]], which flourished in the [[United Kingdom]] for a brief period after [[World War II]]. Though it was published for only five years and in that time had only a small circulation, it had a remarkable impact on British musical and musicological life in the 1950s, and was instrumental in providing a home for the time's pro-[[Benjamin Britten]] and pro-[[Arnold Schoenberg]] writing, as well as launching the critical and editorial careers of [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] and [[Hans Keller]].

The journal was established in 1947, while Mitchell was a teacher at Oakfield School, Dulwich, South London, by the headmaster W.W. (David) Livingston. Keller joined him as co-editor in 1949, when the journal was re-launched in the form of the so-called 'New Series'. Several articles were written by prominent composers such as [[Luigi Dallapiccola]], [[Mátyás Seiber]], and [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]].

''Music Survey'' ceased publication in 1952; in 1981 a single-volume reprint of the 'New Series' was produced.

'''NeuroFocus, Inc.''' was an American multinational [[neuromarketing]] company that was acquired by Nielsen in May 2011. Since that acquisition, Nielsen has acquired additional neuroscience companies and named the consolidated business unit Nielsen [[Consumer neuroscience]].

==Corporate history==

===Founding===

Dr. A.K. Pradeep founded Neurofocus in 2005 in Berkeley, CA. He stated that he started NeuroFocus as a way to provide answers to his marketing clients who were frustrated by their inability to accurately predict consumer responses. According to Pradeep, his moment of inspiration arose from a conversation with a neuroscientist about his studies of the brains of patients with [[Attention Deficit Disorder]] or [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and those suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Pradeep said that it was due to this conversation that he realized the link between neuroscience and marketing. He postulated that when viewing a product, customers experience some of the same neurological effects that his neuroscientist neighbor studied.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Smith, Rick (September 2009). ‘‘The Leap: How 3 Simple Changes can Propel Your Career from Good to Great’’’. New York: Portfolio. pp.134-139. {{ISBN|978-1-59184-256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing companies’ frustrations could therefore be addressed by referring to cognitive neuroscience’s technology and methodology. Neurological studies could help marketers discover if the customer would pay attention to and remember their product.

===Growth and Acquisition===
In February 2008, [[The Nielsen Company]] became a strategic investor in NeuroFocus. Also in 2008, NeuroFocus expanded internationally into Asia, and specifically into Korea and Japan. In March 2009, NeuroFocus ventured into Europe, acquiring its competitor, Neuroco.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neurofocus.com/news/neuroco.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Within that same year, NeuroFocus opened its European headquarters in London. NeuroFocus also established locations in Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Seoul, [[Bogotá]], New York, and Dallas. In March 2010, NeuroFocus announced the addition of [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Eric Kandel]] to NeuroFocus’ advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;http://neurofocus.com/pdfs/ERIC_KANDEL_RELEASE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

NeuroFocus’ premise was that it could provide key insights about customers that traditional marketing techniques could not. NeuroFocus utilized [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[eye tracking]], and [[biometrics]] such as [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=80987&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain insights into customers’ conscious and [[subconscious]] feelings, emotions, and preferences.&lt;ref name="businesstodayegypt.com"&gt;http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=8837&lt;/ref&gt;  NeuroFocus stated that these insights were more accurate than traditional [[focus group]] responses as they were gleaned directly from the brain and therefore uncontaminated by [[cognitive bias]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92768079&lt;/ref&gt; NeuroFocus also claimed that its methodology allowed it to access the subconscious desires that cannot be expressed by the consumer.&lt;ref name="businesstodayegypt.com"/&gt;

NeuroFocus claimed to provide its clients with a prediction of effectiveness through specific scores on the attention, emotion, and memory metrics as well as its derived metrics of novelty, awareness, and purchase intent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cablefax.com/cfp/cfp/just_in/37342.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/does-emotionally-powerful-programming-prime-advertising-effectiveness/&lt;/ref&gt; NeuroFocus reportedly determined these metrics based on the brain wave data collected while consumers viewed client products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/19/BUNF10MEPI.DTL&lt;/ref&gt;  NeuroFocus stated that it could address a client’s needs for insights into its brand, products, packaging, in-store marketing, and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neurofocus.com/pdfs/Insidethemind_DDi.pdf?vnu_content_id=1003783738 Display and Design Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrsa.com.au/index.cfm?a=detail&amp;eid=222&amp;id=4702&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, NeuroFocus announced that it had developed a 3D [[virtual reality simulation]] store research tool that would enable clients to test product designs and store layouts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research-live.com/news/technology/neurofocus-goes-virtual-with-new-3d-store-research-tool/4002875.article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/breakthrough-3d-virtual-reality-based-in-store-research-neurofocus-introduces-n-matrix-3dtm-system-95604464.html&lt;/ref&gt; None of the metrics or methods used by NeuroFocus were available for peer review or replicability studies, arising some quiestioning about the actual meaning of their metrics.

NeuroFocus stated that it provided services to a growing number of [[Fortune 500]] companies,&lt;ref&gt;http://chiefmarketer.com/crm/1027-neuromarketing-loyalty-brain/&lt;/ref&gt; commissioning specialized on-site “Neurolabs” to those clients who desired a lab to perform constant testing tailored to their individual needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research-live.com/news/technology/ae-television-networks-orders-neurolab/4002728.article&lt;/ref&gt;

NeuroFocus was acquired by Nielsen in May 2011. In 2013, two years post the acquisition by Nielsen, Dr. A.K. Pradeep assumed the role and title of Chief Provocateur of Nielsen. Pradeep resigned from the company on June 2, 2014. On May 27, 2015, Nielsen completed an acquisition of Innerscope Research and named the consolidated business unit Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience. Dr. Carl Marci was named Chief Neuroscientist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2015/06/03/nielsen-doubles-down-on-neuro/#5145dff306cd&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oib outside.jpg|thumb|Orient-Institut Beirut]]

The '''Orient-Institut Beirut''' (OIB) ({{lang-ar|المعهد الألماني للأبحاث الشرقية}}) is one of ten German Humanities Institutes Abroad which belong to the [[Max Weber Foundation]]. The OIB was established in 1961 by the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft]] (German Oriental Society) and is part of the Max Weber Foundation since 2003. The OIB supports and promotes independent research on the historical and contemporary Middle East and the Arab world in cooperation with researchers and academic institutions throughout the region.

== History ==
The Orient-Institut Beirut was founded by the German Oriental Society in 1961. It was financed by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology, the [[Fritz Thyssen Foundation]] and the [[VolkswagenStiftung]]. Since 2003 the Orient-Institut Beirut belongs to the Max Weber Foundation – German Humanities Institutes Abroad. In 2009 the [[Orient-Institut Istanbul]] (OI Istanbul) – which had been a branch of the Beirut institute for 20 years – became an independent institution inside the Max Weber Foundation. The OIB, which conducts and supports research on historical and contemporary issues related to Lebanon and the Arab world, has increased his cooperation with academic partners in Egypt since 2010.

== Academic Profile and Tasks ==
The OIB is an interdisciplinary research institute. The study of social, religious, and intellectual history, as well as the study of literature, language and politics figures among the various projects undertaken at the institute. It is part of the OIB's mission to support young academic researchers. The Orient-Institut Beirut employs research associates and supports PhD students, post-docs, research projects, affiliated researchers, and scholars working on the Middle East. The OIB cooperates with numerous academic institutions and organizes academic events (lectures, symposia, and congresses)on a wide variety of issues related to the [[MENA]] region.

== Library ==
The library of the OIB is open for public use and offers 130.000 volumes and 1.700 periodicals. Its collection includes studies on religion, philosophy, and law as well as on literature, history and contemporary themes related to the Middle East. Material is gathered in Western languages, in Arabic and occasionally in Persian and Turkish. All this is supplemented by academic literature from various related disciplines, including political science, social anthropology and sociology. One of the richest resources of the OIB is its collections of periodicals covering politics, religion, and culture as well as several literary magazines published in the Middle East.

== Publication series ==
The OIB publishes two series of publications and one online-publication.
* In the series '''Bibliotheca Islamica''' ({{lang-ar|النشرات الإسلامية}}) manuscripts dating back from the 11th century onwards are edited as books.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BI%20Liste%20dt.22.9.11_aktuell.pdf ''Bibliotheca Islamica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BI%20Liste%20ar.7.9.11_aktuell.pdf ''النشرات الإسلامية''] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critical editions include Arabic, Persian and Turkish texts - on topics ranging from history, prosopography, literature and theology to Sufism. 
* In the series '''Beiruter Texte und Studien''' (Beirut Texts and Studies) &lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BTS-Liste%20Feb_2012.pdf ''Beiruter Texte und Studien'']&lt;/ref&gt; academic studies, monographs, and conference proceedings are published in German, English, Arabic and French.
* In cooperation with the Orient-Institut Istanbul, the OIB publishes the online series '''Orient-Institut Studies''' on perspectivia.net.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.perspectivia.net/content/publikationen/orient-institut-studies/1-2012/ ''Orient-Institut Studies'']&lt;/ref&gt; This series is meant to combine regional and trans-regional perspectives in Middle Eastern and Euro-Asian Studies.

[[File:Blutkreislauf.png|thumbnail|right|Blood circulation: Red = oxygenated (arteries), Blue = deoxygenated (veins)]]

'''Oxygen saturation''' is the fraction of [[oxygen]]-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the [[blood]]. The human body requires and regulates a very precise and specific balance of oxygen in the blood.  Normal '''blood oxygen levels''' in humans are considered 95–100 percent. If the level is below 90 percent, it is considered low resulting in [[hypoxemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hypoxemia/MY00219|work=Mayo Clinic|publisher=mayoclinic.com|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood oxygen levels below 80 percent may compromise organ function, such as the brain and heart, and should be promptly addressed. Continued low oxygen levels may lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest. [[Oxygen therapy]] may be used to assist in raising blood oxygen levels. Oxygenation occurs when [[Allotropes of oxygen#Dioxygen|oxygen]] molecules ({{chem|O|2}}) enter the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the body. For example, [[blood]] is oxygenated in the [[lung]]s, where oxygen molecules travel from the air and into the blood. Oxygenation is commonly used to refer to medical oxygen saturation.

==Definition==
[[File:Oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve.png|thumb|Haemoglobin saturation curve.]]
In [[medicine]], '''oxygen saturation''', commonly referred to as "sats", measures the percentage of [[hemoglobin]] binding sites in the bloodstream occupied by oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3PJVLH1NmQAC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=definition+of+oxygen+saturation+so2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi42bWkksPKAhVHrD4KHfZcC0QQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20oxygen%20saturation%20so2&amp;f=false|title=Clinical Laboratory Medicine|author=Kenneth D. McClatchey|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|location=[[Philadelphia]]|year=2002|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low partial pressures of oxygen, most hemoglobin is deoxygenated. At around 90% (the value varies according to the clinical context) oxygen saturation increases according to an [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve]] and approaches 100% at partial oxygen pressures of &gt;10 kPa. A [[pulse oximeter]] relies on the light absorption characteristics of saturated hemoglobin to give an indication of oxygen saturation.

== Physiology==
The body maintains a stable level of oxygen saturation for the most part by chemical processes of [[aerobic metabolism]] associated with [[breathing]]. Using the [[respiratory system]], red blood cells, specifically the [[hemoglobin]], gather oxygen in the lungs and distribute it to the rest of the body. The needs of the body's blood oxygen may fluctuate such as during exercise when more oxygen is required &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Blood Oxygen Levels at Rest|url=http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/cardio/understanding-blood-oxygen-levels-at-rest.html#b|work=fitday.com|publisher=fitday.com|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when living at higher altitudes. A blood cell is said to be "saturated" when carrying a normal amount of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellison|first=Bronwyn|title=NORMAL RANGE OF BLOOD OXYGEN LEVEL|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/124374-normal-range-blood-oxygen-level/|work=Livestrong.com|publisher=Livestrong.com|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both too high and too low levels can have adverse effects on the body. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=Need citation for adverse effects of high oxygen saturation}}

==Measurement==
An SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (arterial oxygen saturation, as determined by an [[arterial blood gas test]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://incenter.medical.philips.com/doclib/enc/fetch/586262/586457/Understanding_Pulse_Oximetry.pdf%3Fnodeid%3D586458%26vernum%3D2|title=Understanding Pulse Oximetry: SpO2 Concepts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Philips Medical Systems|access-date=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) value below 60% causes [[hypoxemia]] (which can also be caused by [[anemia]]). Hypoxemia due to low SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is indicated by [[cyanosis]]. Oxygen saturation can be measured in different tissues:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Venous oxygen saturation (SvO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is measured to see how much oxygen the body consumes. Under clinical treatment, a SvO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; below 90% indicates that the body is in lack of oxygen, and [[ischemic]] diseases occur. This measurement is often used under treatment with a heart-lung machine (extracorporeal circulation), and can give the perfusionist an idea of how much flow the patient needs to stay healthy.
* Tissue oxygen saturation (StO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be measured by [[near infrared spectroscopy]]. Although the measurements are still widely discussed, they give an idea of tissue oxygenation in various conditions.
* Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an estimation of the oxygen saturation level usually measured with a [[pulse oximeter]] device. It can be calculated with [[pulse oximetry]] according to the following formula:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

:&lt;math chem&gt;S_\ce{pO2}=\frac\ce{HbO2}\ce{{HbO2}+Hb}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

where HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is oxygenated haemoglobin and Hb is deoxygenated haemoglobin

==Pulse oximetry==
{{Main article|Pulse oximetry}}
[[File:Wrist-oximeter.jpg|thumbnail|right|Example pulse oximeter]] Pulse oximetry is a method used to estimate the percentage of oxygen bound to [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name=Aguilar&gt;E. Aguilar Pelaez et al., "LED power reduction trade-offs for ambulatory pulse oximetry," 2007 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Lyon, 2007, pp. 2296-2299.

The pulse oximeter consists of a small device that clips to the body (typically a finger, earlobe or an infant's foot) and transfers its readings to a reading meter by wire or wirelessly. The device uses light-emitting diodes in conjunction with a light-sensitive sensor to measure the absorption of red and infrared light in the extremity. The difference in absorption between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin makes the calculation possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Healthy individuals at sea level usually exhibit oxygen saturation values between 96% and 99%, and should be above 94%. At 1,600 meters' altitude (about one [[mile]] high) oxygen saturation should be above 92%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Normal oxygen level | work = National Jewish Health | publisher = [[MedHelp]]  | date = February 23, 2009 | url = http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Respiratory-Disorders/Normal-oxygen-level/show/760829 | accessdate = 2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (arterial oxygen saturation) value below 90% causes [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (which can also be caused by [[anemia]]). Hypoxia due to low SaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is indicated by [[cyanosis]], but oxygen saturation does not directly reflect tissue oxygenation. The affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen may impair or enhance oxygen release at the tissue level. Oxygen is more readily released to the tissues (i.e., [[hemoglobin]] has a lower affinity for oxygen) when pH is decreased, body temperature is increased, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is increased, and 2,3-DPG levels (a byproduct of glucose metabolism also found in stored blood products) are increased. When the hemoglobin has greater affinity for oxygen, less is available to the tissues. Conditions such as increased pH, decreased temperature, decreased PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and decreased 2,3-DPG will increase oxygen binding to the hemoglobin and limit its release to the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacn.org/WD/Practice/Docs/ch_14_PO.pdf|title=Oxygen Saturation Monitoring by Pulse Oximetry|last=Schutz|first=|date=2001|website=American Association of Critical Care Nurses|format=PDF|dead-url=yes|access-date=September 10, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131222646/http://www.aacn.org/WD/Practice/Docs/ch_14_PO.pdf|archivedate=January 31, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Parable of the Sunfish'''" is an anecdote with which [[Ezra Pound]] opens ''[[ABC of Reading]]'', a 1934 work of literary criticism. Pound uses this anecdote to emphasize an [[empirical]] approach for learning about art, in contrast to relying on commentary rooted in [[abstraction]]. While the parable is based on students' recollections of [[Louis Agassiz]]'s teaching style, Pound's retelling diverges from these sources in several respects. The parable has been used to illustrate the benefits of scientific thinking, but more recent literary criticism has split on whether the parable accurately reflects the scientific process and calls into question Pound's empirical approach to literature.

==The Parable==
[[File:Ezra Pound by E.O. Hoppé in 1920 (LIFE2).JPG|thumb|upright=.50|Ezra Pound in 1920]]
The text of the parable below is excerpted from Pound's ''[[ABC of Reading]]''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
A post-graduate student equipped with honors and diplomas went to [[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]] to receive the final and finishing touches. The great man offered him a small fish and told him to describe it.

Post-Graduate Student: "That's only a sunfish."

Agassiz: "I know that. Write a description of it."

After a few minutes the student returned with the description of the ''Ichthus Heliodiplodokus'', or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from vulgar knowledge, family of ''Heliichtherinkus'', etc., as found in textbooks of the subject.

Agassiz again told the student to describe the fish.

The student produced a four-page essay. Agassiz then told him to look at the fish. At the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it.&amp;#8288;&lt;ref name=Pound /&gt;{{rp|17&amp;ndash;18}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Context==

===''ABC of Reading''===
Pound opens ''ABC of Reading'' with the following pronouncement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proper METHOD for studying poetry and good letters is the method of contemporary biologists, that is careful first-hand examination of the matter, and continual COMPARISON of one 'slide' or specimen with another. No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|17, emphasis in original}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Louis Agassiz.jpg|thumb|upright|Louis Agassiz]]
In the parable, a graduate student is sent to noted biologist [[Louis Agassiz]] to complete his education, and Agassiz asks the student three times to describe a sunfish specimen. The student replies with, in turn, the common name of the fish, a brief summary of the species, and a four-page essay on the species. Agassiz finally tells the student to "look at the fish" and "[a]t the end of three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it."&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|18}} The text of the parable itself spans 131 words over sixteen lines and is often reproduced in full when cited.&lt;ref name=Sieburth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perelman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mezo /&gt;

Pound contrasts this empiricism against knowledge gained through increasingly abstract definitions. As an example, Pound relates what might happen if a European is asked to define "red". After the initial response that red is a color, Pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it described in terms of vibration, with vibration then defined in terms of energy, and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power.&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|19}} Returning to empiricism, Pound reminds the reader that the progress of science increased rapidly once "[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] had suggested the direct examination of phenomena, and after [[Galileo]] and others had stopped discussing things so much, and had begun really to look at them".&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|20}} Pound provides several other examples of the same contrasting ideas throughout the first chapter, ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry, Chinese writing, and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. At the end of the chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge.&lt;ref name="Pound" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

===Literary essays===

Pound subsequently refers to the parable in two essays: "The Teacher's Mission"&lt;ref name=EJ /&gt; and "Mr Housman at Little Bethel".&lt;ref name=Criterion /&gt; Both were republished in ''The Literary Essays of Ezra Pound''&lt;ref name=Pound2 /&gt; and reference Agassiz without including details of the parable. "The Teacher's Mission" in particular provides a straightforward explanation of how Pound wished the parable to be interpreted.

===="Mr Housman at Little Bethel"====

In January 1934, Pound published a critique of [[A. E. Housman]]'s ''The Name and Nature of Poetry'' in the ''Criterion''.&lt;ref name=Criterion /&gt; As part of the critique, Pound offers an emendation to Housman's claim that "the intelligence" of the eighteenth century involved "some repressing and silencing of poetry".&lt;ref name=Pound2 /&gt;{{rp|68}} Pound replies that the root cause was the tendency towards abstract statements, which came about in part because eighteenth century authors "hadn't heard about Professor Agassiz's fish."&lt;ref name=Pound2 /&gt;{{rp|68}}

===="The Teacher's Mission"====

Also in 1934, Pound published an essay critiquing existing methods for teaching literature in general and university-level instruction methods in particular.  He identifies the root of the problem as abstraction and uses the word "liberty" as an example of a term where a specific, concrete meaning has been lost. Pound finds this situation "inexcusable AFTER the era of 'Agassiz and the fish'" and demands an approach to general education that "parallels&amp;nbsp;... biological study based on EXAMINATION and COMPARISON of particular specimens."&lt;ref name=Pound2 /&gt;{{rp|60, emphasis in original}}

==Sources==
Louis Agassiz was a Swiss-born scientist at [[Harvard University]] who, by 1896, had established a reputation for "lock[ing] a student up in a room full of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not let[ting] him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained."&lt;ref name=James /&gt; Several students of Agassiz who went on to prominence recorded this rite of passage, including Henry Blake, [[David Starr Jordan]], [[Addison Emery Verrill]], and [[Burt Green Wilder]].&lt;ref name=Clark2 /&gt; American literary critic [[Robert Scholes]] traces the parable's source to two narratives in particular: those of former students [[Nathaniel Shaler|Nathaniel Southgate Shaler]] and [[Samuel Hubbard Scudder]]. Their anecdotes were reprinted in Lane Cooper's ''Louis Agassiz as a Teacher: Illustrative Extracts on his Method of Instruction''.&lt;ref name=Scholes /&gt;{{rp|655–6}} Their separate accounts differ markedly from Pound's: both students provide oral reports with a wealth of detail after being initially forbidden from consulting outside sources.{{clarify|date=December 2012|reason=Where they different from Pound's in that they HAD details or was the CONTENT different?}}

===Shaler's ''Autobiography''===
[[File:Nathaniel Southgate Shaler.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nathaniel Southgate Shaler]]
[[Nathaniel Shaler]] left his [[humanism|humanist]] studies and joined Agassiz's lab at Harvard University, having already read Agassiz's introductory essay on [[Biological classification|classification]]. His autobiography details his initial interactions with Agassiz. With regard to his first assignment, Shaler recorded that Agassiz brought him a small fish to study with the stipulation that Shaler not discuss it with anyone or read anything on the topic until Agassiz had given him permission. When Shaler asked Agassiz for more explicit instructions, Agassiz replied that he could not be more explicit than saying "[f]ind out what you can without damaging the specimen".&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|98}} After the first hours, Shaler thought he had "compassed that fish," but despite Agassiz always being "within call" he was not asked to present his conclusions.&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|98}} During the course of the following week, Shaler recorded the details of "how the scales went in series, their shape, the form and placement of the teeth, etc."&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|98}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At length on the seventh day, came the question "Well?" and my disgorge of learning to him as he sat on the edge of my table puffing his cigar. At the end of the hour's telling, he swung off and away, saying "That is not right."&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|98}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shaler concluded Agassiz was testing him to see if he was capable of "doing hard, continuous work without the support of a teacher" and redoubled his efforts, starting from scratch and, over the course of seven ten-hour days, managed to describe the specimen to Agassiz's satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Shaler /&gt;{{rp|99}}

===Scudder's "Look at your fish!"===
[[File:SamuelScudder BSNH 1930.png|thumb|right|upright|Samuel Hubbard Scudder]]
[[Samuel Hubbard Scudder]] recorded a similar experience, first published in 1874 as "Look at Your Fish" in ''[[Every Saturday]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt; Agassiz again starts his new student off with a fish preserved in alcohol and instructs the student to "look at it", and promises "by and by I will ask what you have seen".&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|2}}{{efn|Contrast Scudder's specific identification of the specimen with Pound's "''Ichthus Heliodiplodokus''".&lt;ref name=Pound /&gt;{{rp|17}} A sunfish might be either a ''[[Lampridae]]'' or a ''[[Molidae]]'', but a ''[[Diplodocus|diplodokus]]'' is something altogether different. Pound's name, which includes the Greek words for "fish" and "sun," when taxonomical names are typically Latinate, is very likely meant as a joke.&lt;ref name="Colangelo" /&gt;}} As opposed to Pound's decomposing sunfish, Scudder's account emphasizes the care taken to keep the specimen in good condition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was to keep the fish before me in a tin tray, and occasionally moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar&amp;nbsp;... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|2}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scudder provides the additional detail that "instruments of all kinds were interdicted", including any magnifying glass.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|3}} After several hours Agassiz asks for a report and Scudder describes "the fringed [[Gill arches|gill-arches]] and moveable [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]]; the pores of the head, fleshy lips and lidless eyes; the [[lateral line]], the spinous fins and forked tail; the compressed and arched body".&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|3}} Disappointed, Agassiz informs his student that he has failed to observe "the most conspicuous features of the animal" and commands him to "look again, look again!"&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|3}} The mortified Scudder is eventually asked to consider overnight what he has seen, and is able to report to Agassiz the following morning that "the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs", which was the observation Agassiz was looking for.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|4}} However, when Scudder then asked what he should do next, Agassiz replied, "Oh, look at your fish!" which Scudder did for another two full days.&lt;ref name=Scudder /&gt;{{rp|4}}

===Cooper's ''Louis Agassiz as a Teacher''===
In 1917, English professor Lane Cooper from [[Cornell University]] published a collection of reminiscences of Agassiz. The book included notes from several notable contributors, including Scudder and Cooper, [[William James]], Professor [[Addison Emery Verrill]] ("[Agassiz's] plan was to make young students depend on natural objects rather than on statements in books"),&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;{{rp|27}} and Professor [[Edward S. Morse]], who wrote that Agassiz's method was "simply to let the student study intimately one object at a time."&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;{{rp|48 (footnote)}} Cooper prefigures Pound's interest by remarking on the "close, though not obvious, relation between investigation in biology or zoology and the observation and comparison of these organic forms which we call form of literature and works of art",&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;{{rp|2–3}} concluding that "We study a poem, the work of man's art, in the same way that Agassiz made Shaler study a fish."&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;{{rp|4}} Critic [[Robert Scholes]] concludes that Pound had access to this book and used the material within it as the source for the parable that opens ''ABC of Reading''.&lt;ref name=Scholes /&gt;{{rp|655–6}}

==Interpretation and criticism==

===Agassiz===
Science historian Mary P. Winsor provides extensive commentary on Agassiz's initial assignments for his students.  The solution to the "riddle",&lt;ref name=Winsor /&gt;{{rp|14}} as she calls it, lies in a similar anecdote given by Agassiz in his ''Essay on Classification'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose that the innumerable articulated animals, which are counted by tens of thousands, nay, perhaps by hundreds of thousands, had never made their appearance upon the surface of the globe, with one single exception:  that, for instance, our Lobster (''[[Homarus americanus]]'') were the only representative of that extraordinarily diversified type,&amp;mdash;how should we introduce that species of animals in our systems?&lt;ref name=Agassiz /&gt;{{rp|5, quoted in &lt;ref name=Winsor /&gt;{{rp|14&amp;ndash;15}}}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Agassiz provides several potential solutions:  the [[species]] of lobster could have a single [[genus]] "by the side of all the other classes with their orders, families, etc.",{{rp|5}} or a [[family (biology)|family]] with one genus and one species, or a [[class (biology)|class]] with one [[order (biology)|order]] and one genus, etc.  Agassiz concludes a single species is sufficient to derive the entirety of the hierarchy:  at the time, this would have been "a distinct genus, a distinct family, a distinct class, a distinct branch."{{rp|7&amp;ndash;8}}  The point of the sunfish is not observing characteristics that distinguish individuals, species and genus, but rather characteristics that are held in common higher up the taxonomic hierarchy.  Scudder's observation that finally satisfies Agassiz is that the sunfish has bilateral, paired organs; a characteristic that Winsor notes is common to all [[vertebrates]].&lt;ref name=Winsor /&gt;{{rp|14}}

===Pound===
Pound, echoing Cooper, opens ''ABC of Reading'' by stating that the correct method for the study of poetry is "the method of contemporary biologists" and that "No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the fish."&lt;ref name=Pound /&gt; Commentators have summarized Pound's position with the term ''[[empiricism]]'', but have divided over whether the parable endorses or indicts the idea.

The simplest interpretations in scientific writing,&lt;ref name=Whorley /&gt; history of science,&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt; and literary criticism&lt;ref name=Santos /&gt; take the parable at face value, accepting empiricism and observation as legitimate techniques. For example, when writing about [[stellar atmosphere]]s, Dimitri Mihalas states that "it is ''specimens'', not facts, that are the ultimate empirical currency that we must use if we wish to purchase a valid theory" before beginning a discussion of Pound's sunfish.&lt;ref name=Mihalas /&gt;{{rp|emphasis in original}}

Moving from acceptance of empiricism to an understanding of its limitations, Christopher Tilley emphasizes in his comments on "scientific archeology" that Pound's student "was not simply learning about 'reality', the sunfish, but a way of approaching that reality – a discourse bound up in a particular thought tradition (empiricism)".&lt;ref name=Tilley /&gt;{{rp|76}} Robert Scholes reaches a similar conclusion, noting that the student "seems to be reporting about a real and solid world in a perfectly transparent language, but actually he is learning how to produce a specific kind of discourse, controlled by a particular scientific paradigm".&lt;ref name=Scholes /&gt;{{rp|654}}

Author [[Bob Perelman]] takes the suspicion of empiricism one step further in his 1994 ''The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky''. Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in ''ABC of Reading'' that frame Pound's discussion of [[Chinese characters#Ideograms|Chinese ideograms]]. The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts: one of [[Debussy]] and another of [[Ravel]]. Pound states that a person who attended both concerts knows more about the composers than someone who has only read "ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both".&lt;ref name=Pound /&gt;{{rp|24, emphasis in original}} Perelman considers the contradiction between "everyone" and "knowledge" to be the key to Pound's thinking: only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth (whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen); the rest can only make do with "a fog of clichés, received ideas, second-hand and second-rate opinions, written darkness."&lt;ref name=Perelman /&gt;{{rp|52}} With regard to the parable, Perelman observes the lack of "scientific institutions, pedagogic procedures, or communicable terminologies" where any mediating written descriptions ("sunfish", "diplodokus") only serve to obscure knowledge. Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world, and "[w]hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism."&lt;ref name=Perelman /&gt;{{rp|53}}

Two critics have also commented on the parable's implications in describing the nature of knowledge in terms of the decay of Pound's fish. Celeste Goodridge notes that [[Marianne Moore]]'s 1934 review of Pound's ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'' uses a detailed metaphor of a grasshopper wing to describe the conversations therein. In Goodridge's opinion, Moore's "microscopic examination" both undercuts the work as well as "pays homage, in its precision, to Pound's reverence for 'the applicability of scientific method to literary criticism.'"&lt;ref name=Goodridge /&gt;{{rp|73}} Goodridge then reproduces the parable in full and comments, "Agassiz teaches Pound that all knowledge is necessarily fragmented and does not constitute a whole."&lt;ref name=Goodridge /&gt;{{rp|74}} Knowledge of the fish cannot begin until decay has commenced, reducing the specimen to its constituent parts.

Peter Nicholas Baker reaches a fundamentally different conclusion. He begins the discussion of the parable by first quoting Pound on the topic of genius:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The genius can pay in nugget and in lump gold; it is not necessary that he bring up his knowledge into the mint of consciousness, stamp it either into the coin of conscientiously analyzed form-detail knowledge or into the paper money of words before he transmit it.''&lt;ref name=Pound3 /&gt;{{rp|emphasis in original}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Baker finds the most striking feature of the parable to be the absence of description of the fish. Baker asks: "Do readers of this anecdote learn about the fish, or rather about a certain kind of authoritarian teaching practice?"&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;{{rp|79}} Baker claims that Pound's images of coining metal are just as unrealistic as his ideas regarding science and the scientific method. The reader, following Pound's student, reaches knowledge through intuition alone; the decomposing fish, so far as [[epistemology]] is concerned, has become "transparent".&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;{{rp|80}}

'''Political culture''' is defined by the ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]]'' as the "set of attitudes, beliefs and sentiments that give order and meaning to a [[Politics|political]] process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the [[political system]]". It encompasses both the political ideals and operating norms of a [[polity]]. Political culture is thus the manifestation of the psychological and subjective dimensions of politics. A political ''culture'' is the product of both the history of a political system and the histories of the members. Thus, it is rooted equally in public events and private experience.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', New York: Macmillen, 1968, Vol. 12, p. 218 (quoted in Jo Freedman, [http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polparties/polculture.htm The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties] (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions==
In 1963, two Americans, Gabriel Almond&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/january8/obitalmond-18.html Stanford Report, Obit: Gabriel Almond, January 8, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sidney Verba, outlined three types of political culture that can be combined to create civic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verba|first1=Sidney|last2=Almond|first2=Gabriel|title=The Civic Culture|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three key features expressed by both men were composed to establish a link between the public and the government. The first of these features is "deference", which considers the concepts of respect, acknowledgment of "inferiority" or "superiority", and authority in society.

The second key feature is "consensus" which represents the key link between government and public agreement and appeasement. Support for appeasement may not always be shared by the whole nation, but as a whole, people agree to sustain it, meaning it is a common agreement. There are various "Examples of Consensus" in British political culture: how people are governed as a whole, consensus regarding the welfare state, agreement as to who acts as head of state, and with what powers.

The third feature of British political culture is "homogeneity". Church attendance as a whole is decreasing. Sections of the Scottish and Welsh populations have called for independence.

==Political philosophy==
The term political culture was brought into political science to promote the American political system. The concept was used by [[Gabriel Almond]] in the late 50s, and outlined in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' (1963, [[Gabriel Almond|Almond]] &amp; [[Sidney Verba|Verba]]), but was soon opposed by two European political scientists, [[Gerhard Lehmbruch]] and [[Arend Lijphart]]. Lehmbruch analysed politics in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] and Lijphart analysed politics in [[Netherlands]]. Both argued that there are political systems that are more stable than the one in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Lukšič, Igor (2006). ''Politična kultura'', pp. 40–42. [[University of Ljubljana|FDV, Ljubljana]]. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Different typologies of political culture have been proposed. According to political scientist William S. Stewart, all political behavior can be explained as participating in one or more of eight political cultures: [[anarchism]], [[oligarchy]], [[Tory corporatism]], [[fascism]], [[classical liberalism]], radical liberalism, [[democratic socialism]], and [[Leninist socialism]]. Societies that exemplify each of these cultures have existed historically.

[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]] in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' outlined three pure types of political culture based on  level and type of [[political participation]] and the nature of people's attitudes toward politics:
* [[Parochial political culture|Parochial]] – Where citizens are only remotely aware of the presence of central government, and live their lives near enough regardless of the decisions taken by the state, distant and unaware of political phenomena. They have neither knowledge nor interest in politics. This type of political culture is in general congruent with a traditional political structure.
* Subject – Where citizens are aware of central government, and are heavily subjected to its decisions with little scope for dissent. The individual is aware of politics, its actors and institutions. It is affectively oriented towards politics, yet it is on the "downward flow" side of the politics. In general congruent with a centralized authoritarian structure.
* Participant – Citizens are able to influence the government in various ways and they are affected by it. The individual is oriented toward the system as a whole, to both the political and administrative structures and processes (to both the input and output aspects). In general congruent with a democratic political structure.

Almond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can combine to create the [[civic culture]], which mixes the best elements of each.

[[Arend Lijphart]] wrote that there are different classifications of political culture:
* First classification:
** Mass political culture
** [[Elite]] political culture
* Second classification (of elite political culture):
** coalitional
** contradictive

Lijphart also classified the structure of society:
* homogeneous
* heterogeneous

María Eugenia Vázquez Semadeni defines political culture as "the set of discourses and symbolic practices by means of which both individuals and groups articulate their relationship to power, elaborate their political demands and put them at stake."&lt;ref&gt;[Vázquez Semadeni, M. E. (2010). ''La formación de una cultura política republicana: El debate público sobre la masonería. México, 1821-1830.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15386">'''Pseudoenzymes''' are variants of [[enzyme]]s (usually [[protein]]s) that are catalytically deficient (usually inactive), meaning that they perform little or no [[enzyme catalysis]]. They are believed to be represented in all major [[Protein family|enzyme families]] in the [[kingdoms of life]]. Pseudoenzymes are becoming increasingly important to analyse, especially as the [[bioinformatic]] analysis of [[genome]]s reveals their ubiquity. Their important regulatory and sometimes disease-associated functions in metabolic and [[signalling pathway]]s are also shedding new light on the non-catalytic functions of active enzymes ([[Protein moonlighting]]), and are suggesting new ways to target and interpret cellular signalling mechanisms using [[small molecule]]s and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eyers PA, Murphy JM | title = The evolving world of pseudoenzymes: proteins, prejudice and zombies | journal = BMC Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 98 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27835992 | pmc = 5106787 | doi = 10.1186/s12915-016-0322-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most intensively analyzed, and certainly the best understood pseudoenzymes in terms of cellular signalling functions are probably the [[pseudokinase]]s, the pseudoproteases and the pseudophosphatases.

==Structures and roles==
The difference between enzymatically active and inactive [[Sequence homology|homologues]] has been noted (and in some cases, understood when comparing catalytically active and inactive proteins residing in recognisable families) for some time at the sequence level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Todd AE, Orengo CA, Thornton JM | title = Sequence and structural differences between enzyme and nonenzyme homologs | journal = Structure | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 1435–51 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12377129 | doi = 10.1016/s0969-2126(02)00861-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some pseudoenzymes have also been referred to as 'prozymes' when they were analysed in [[protozoan parasite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willert EK, Fitzpatrick R, Phillips MA | title = Allosteric regulation of an essential trypanosome polyamine biosynthetic enzyme by a catalytically dead homolog | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 20 | pages = 8275–80 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17485680 | pmc = 1895940 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0701111104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best studied pseudoenzymes reside amongst various key signalling superfamilies of enzymes, such as the [[protease]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adrain C, Freeman M | title = New lives for old: evolution of pseudoenzyme function illustrated by iRhoms | journal = Nature Reviews.

The authorisation procedure is one of the regulatory tools of the [[Regulation (European Union)|European regulation]] (EC) [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] n°1907/2006 aiming to ban the use of substances of very high concern ([[Substance of very high concern|SVHC]]) included in the Annex XIV of REACH, so as to substitute them by technically and economically feasible alternatives.

This process concerns manufacturers, importers and downstream users of substances. Only representatives of foreign manufacturers can also apply for an authorisation.

Authorisation today impacts many industries, including the [[aerospace]], [[electronics]], [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[energy]], and [[paint]] industries. Moreover, defence applications are not de facto exempted from the authorisation process. Member states must decide on a case by case basis whether a company can benefit or not from this procedure (outlined in article 2.3 of REACH).

== General principles ==
The REACh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language= French|title= Reach Regulation |url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:136:0003:0280:fr:PDF|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; regulation relies on four main procedures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =REACh|url =http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|work =|date =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160724051550/http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|archivedate =2016-07-24|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; registration, evaluation, restriction and authorisation of [[chemical substance]]s.

== From the Candidate List to the Annex XIV of REACH ==
EU Member States or ECHA, on request of the EU Commission, can submit propositions to identify SVHCs, based on the criteria laid down in article 57 of REACH:

*[[Carcinogenic]], [[mutagenic]] or [[toxic]] for reproduction meeting the criteria for classification as CMR category 1A or 1B, in accordance with Regulation n°1272/2008 (CLP),
*Persistents [[bioaccumulative]] and toxic (PBT),
*Very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB),
*Or substances of equivalent concern.

This work is supported by Expert Groups of [[ECHA]] and the EU Member States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SVHC Roadmap to 2020 implementation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/substances-of-potential-concern/svhc-roadmap-to-2020-implementation|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on various criteria and screening methodologies in order to identify the most relevant SVHCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= SVHC Roadmap to 2020 Implementation Plan PDF|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/19126370/svhc_roadmap_implementation_plan_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annex XIV is the last step of this prioritisation process. It lists SVHCs which exhibit a particularly high risk for human health or the environment (based on their inherent properties, quantities and uses) in order to forbid their use in the EU market.

Recommendations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Previous recommendations|url = http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/previous-recommendations|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to include SVHCs in the Annex XIV are made by ECHA and are debated by all relevant stakeholders (Member States, companies, NGOs, etc.). The final decision of inclusion of the substance into Annex XIV is taken by the European Commission.

When listed in Annex XIV of the REACh regulation, a substance is therefore assigned a “sunset date” after which its use will be banned, unless an Authorisation is granted for a definite period of time.

As of today (2015/05/26), 161 substances are listed on the Candidate List&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Candidate List of substances of very high concern for Authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 31 substances are listed in the Annex XIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Authorisation List|url = http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/authorisation-list|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The candidate list is usually updated every 6 months and the Annex XIV is updated every 12 to 18 months.

=== Scope of authorisation ===

The authorisation procedure is complex and concerns [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], importers, downstream users and Only Representatives of substances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Downstream users in a nutshell|url = https://www.ecomundo.eu/en/blog/downstream-users-nutshell|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which:

*No alternative to the Annex XIV substance is deemed technically and/or economically feasible or for which 
*Alternatives may exist but still need time to be fully qualified and deployed.

The banning of the use takes effect at the "Sunset date". As of this date, the use of the substance is only possible for companies which have been granted an authorisation or for those that have submitted their dossier before the Latest Application Date. The latter indeed benefit from a transitional period, pending the [[European Commission|EU Commission]] final decision.

An exception is made for downstream users in the case where an upstream stakeholder, within the [[supply chain]], has been granted an authorisation for this very substance and this very use. From this point of view, it is the supply chain of the substance that matters. For instance, subcontractors of authorised importers will not be covered if the Annex XIV substance they use is supplied via a supply chain for which no authorisation application has been made or granted.

Finally, downstream users that do not need to apply for an authorisation nevertheless have the obligation to notify their use(s) to ECHA (art. 66 of REACH) and check the compliance of their risk management measures.

Concerned companies are thus invited to take measures as soon as a substance they use enters the Candidate list by enquiring on the impacted actors and their strategies.

=== The use applied for ===
==== "Use" under the authorisation process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= How to develop the description of uses in the context of Authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13566/uses_description_in_auth_context_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Authorisation applications are made for one or several specific uses. Article 3 of REACH thus defines a “use” as: “''any processing, formulation, consumption, storage, keeping, treatment, filling into containers, transfer from one container to another, mixing, production of an article or any other use''”.

In the framework of an authorisation dossier, the description of the use applied for has to specify the market, the supply chain, processes or the type of articles concerned. The use applied for has to be consistent enough to cover the [[Exposure scenario|Exposure Scenario]] but also the Analysis of Alternatives. The Use applied for should not be mistaken with the identified use which corresponds to the REACH registration process. An identified use focuses on the process and does not consider performances or markets questions.

==== Cases where no authorisation is needed ====

A few exceptions exist, for which the application for authorisation is not required:

*The '''manufacturer''' of a substance does not require an authorisation since it is not considered as a use,
*'''Impurities''', '''additives''' and '''components of another substance''' do not constitute a use of the substance as such (except if annex XIV refers to it),
*The '''formulation of a mixture''' is considered as a use under REACh and the substance of the Annex XIV '''is only subject to authorisation if it exceeds the required concentrations'''.

If the production of an article may require an authorisation at some point, '''finished articles''' themselves do not require an authorisation to be put on the market, even though they still contain a substance subject to authorisation. Consequently, articles requiring the use of an Annex XIV substance can still be produced outside the EU and then imported. In that particular case, future restrictions procedure could however limit the placing on the market of such articles if a risk remains (art. 58.6 of REACH).

=== Review period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Setting the review period when rac and seac give opinions on an application for authorisation|format=pdf|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13580/seac_rac_review_period_authorisation_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

The review period is the duration for which the EU Commission authorises the use of a substance after the Sunset date.
 
Following durations are considered for the review periods:

*'''&lt; 7 years''': in case the Analysis of Alternatives report is insufficient and/or doubts remain on the impacts of the granting of an authorisation or, alternatively, when a quick transition is possible;
*'''7 years''': standard duration to develop a technically and economically feasible alternative solution;
*'''12 years''' and '''&gt; 12 years''': long cycle of investments, low risks. In exceptional cases, a longer duration may be considered if it can be demonstrated that 12 years would create disproportionate impacts compared with a longer review period.

At the end of the review period, the application for authorisation is reassessed to evaluate the progress made in terms or research &amp; development or substitution. Applications to extend the review period have to be made at the latest 18 months before the expiry date.

The European Commission may also reduce this duration if new circumstances appear, in terms of risks or impacts.

Only the [[General Court (European Union)|Court of the European Union]] is qualified to rule on appeals for applications for authorisation. Member States are, in turn, responsible for controlling the decision’s implementation.

== The Application For Authorisation dossier (AFA) ==

The application for authorisation (AfA) is made up of three main parts: the '''Chemical Safety Report''' (CSR), the '''Analysis of Alternatives''' (AoA) and the '''Socio-Economic Analysis''' (SEA).

The goal of this dossier is to demonstrate that no alternative substance is immediately available, that risks are controlled and that the social and economic advantages of the use of the substance outweigh the risks to human health or the environment.  The dossier usually takes 6 to 18 months of preparation and ECHA’s guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Guidance on Authorisation Applications|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13643/authorisation_application_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are available to assist with its drafting.

The application for authorisation should be filed before the Latest Application Date (LAD), set at 18 months before the sunset date. The LAD enables to benefit from a transitional period, pending the European Commission’s decision.

=== Basic of an AfA ===

An AfA can be made for one or several substances (in that case, grouping will need to be demonstrated on the basis of annex XI of REACH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13632/information_requirements_r6_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =How to report read-across and categories|url =http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13655/pg_report_readacross_en.pdf|work =|date =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150612061448/http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13655/pg_report_readacross_en.pdf|archivedate =2015-06-12|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;), one or several uses applied for and by one or several companies. The latter case is called a joint application and it requires appointing a main applicant that will be the contact point for ECHA.

=== Two submissions routes ===

Two submission routes are planned by the REACh regulation:

{| class="wikitable"

 || 
* Chemical Safety Reports 
* Analysis of Alternatives
* Socio-economic analysis
* Justification for not considering certain risks (if relevant)
|}

=== Content of the dossier ===
==== Chemical Safety Report (CSR) ====

For the adequate control route, the goal of the [[Chemical safety assessment|Chemical Safety Report]] is to prove that threshold values are respected; for the socio-economic route, the goal of the Chemical Safety Report is to demonstrate that risks are reduced to the minimum.

The Chemical Safety Report contains:

* A summary of the risk management measure
* A declaration on the implementation and the communication of risk management measures along the supply chain 
* The identity of the substance and the identified uses
* The assessment of the human and environmental hazard assessment
* The assessment of the properties for which the substance was included in Annex XIV
* The exposure assessment
* The risk characterisation

==== Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) ====
The AoA aims to demonstrate that no alternative is appropriate, i.e. technically and / or economically feasible, less risky and available.

The Analysis of Alternatives therefore presents all the substance’s alternative solutions and contains:

* ''Part 1'' – '''Summary'''
* ''Part 2'' – '''Description of substance’s purpose'''
* ''Part 3'' – '''Identification of potential alternatives '''
* ''Part 4'' – '''Description of the suitability and availability of alternatives'''
* ''Part 5'' – '''Conclusion of the report'''

==== Socio-Economic Analysis (SEA) ====

The Socio-Economic Analysis is a compulsory document for the socio-economic route and can also complete an application justified by the adequate control route. It aims to demonstrate that the advantages of the use of the substance outweigh the risks to human health or the environment. For this purpose, applicants must compare two scenarios:  the ‘use scenario’ (continued use of the substance) on the one hand and the ‘non-use scenario’ (cease of use of the substance) on the other hand to discuss their impacts.

It contains:
* ''Part 1'' – '''Summary'''
* ''Part 2'' – '''Definition of the objective and scope'''
* ''Part 3'' – '''Analysis of impacts'''
* ''Part 4'' – '''Comparison of impacts'''
* ''Part 5'' – '''Conclusion of the report'''

=== Submission of the dossier ===
Dossiers should be submitted during submission windows in February, May, August and November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Submission windows|url = http://echa.europa.eu/applying-for-authorisation/submission-windows|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ECHA strongly advise to follow these windows as plenary sessions of the two committees (RAC and SEAC) are organised in March, June, September and December of each year. Submitting before the plenary sessions, during the submission windows, therefore helps the efficient assessment of the application.

Applications are deemed received after business rules check is successfully passed and provided ECHA fees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Preparing applications for authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/applying-for-authorisation/preparing-applications-for-authorisation|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; are paid on time.

=== Examination of the dossier ===

The examination of the dossier is carried out by the Risk Assessment Committee (RAC) and the Socio-Economic Analysis Committee (SEAC) and opens with a public consultation on alternatives. During 8 weeks, companies, NGOs or any other interested party have the possibility to comment on and possibly challenge the alternatives proposed by the applicant.

The consultation can be followed by additional discussions with the two Committees in order to clarify the application. This process is called Trialogue and stakeholders can be invited to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Meeting of the committee for risk assessment|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13555/stakeholder_participation_in_afa_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duration of the examination varies according to the complexity and the clarity of the dossier. Committees however have the obligation to deliver their first opinion on the dossier 10 months after its submission at the latest. The dossier with the Committee’s opinion is then sent to the Commission. The whole process can take up to 2 years.

== Implementation and feedback ==

As of May 4, 2015,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title =Taking stock of received, processed and granted applications|url =http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21825501/afa_201502_7_nicot_en.pdf|work =|date =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150927024516/http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21825501/afa_201502_7_nicot_en.pdf|archivedate =2015-09-27|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Statistics on received applications|url = http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/applications-for-authorisation/received-applications|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 28 applications for authorisation had been filed for a total of 56 uses.

=== A specific strategy for every use ===

Each dossier requires implementing a specific strategy, being it to define the uses, the analysis of the [[List of industrial processes|industrial processes]] and associated risks, the alternatives, or the socio-economic impacts of the banning of the substance.

Committees expect each dossier to contain a precise description of the industrial process and the operational conditions that are representative of the dossier as well as the risk management measures implemented by the applicant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Experience in the Committee for Risk Assessment|url =http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21825501/afa_201502_9_bowmer_en.pdf|work =|date =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150928183306/http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21825501/afa_201502_9_bowmer_en.pdf|archivedate =2015-09-28|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main issue in the application for authorisation process is the duration of the review period which will be granted. It is therefore critical to bring all the necessary precisions to the dossiers to justify the requested review period duration. A justification that is too weak or an argumentation that is too generic may induce the granting of a shorter-than-requested review period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Setting the review period when rac and seac give opinions on an application for authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13580/seac_rac_review_period_authorisation_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== An in-depth analysis of the companies’ activity ===
Beyond the simple drafting of the application for authorisation dossier, the whole process implies both expertise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language= French|title= Choix d’un consultant : points à vérifier|url = http://reach-info.ineris.fr/sites/reach-info.gesreg.fr/files/pdf/Check-list_Consultant_HD-08-14.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and deep analysis of a company’s activity, on multiple aspects: 
 
* '''Technical''' aspects(Chemical Safety Report, Analysis of Alternatives), 
* '''Business''' aspects (Supply chain security, public consultation) and
* '''Strategic''' aspects (Anticipating the development and growth of the activity within a 5 to 10 years timeframe).

This analysis therefore requires an extensive collection of information and also, possibly, contacts with customers so as to strengthen the analysis of alternatives.

=== Public consultation at the heart of the decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Submission of information on alternatives by interested third parties for the public consultations on alternatives for Applications for Authorisation|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13555/instructions_third_parties_afa_en.pdf|work = |date = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

[[Public consultation]] is one of the core mechanisms of the authorisation process. Stakeholders’ (competing companies, universities, laboratories, NGOS, Member States, etc.) involvement in the consultation process has been growing over the last years (to reach up to 400 comments for a single dossier&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; ) and the influence of comments, in particular concerning alternatives, makes it a major step of the authorisation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Perturbateurs endocriniens : 55 ONG réclament l'interdiction en Europe de l'usage du DEHP dans le PVC|url = http://www.actu-environnement.com/ae/news/lettre-interdiction-behp-pvc-reach-23316.php4|access-date = 2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to streamline this process, templates for comments and instructions are available on the ECHA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13555/instructions_third_parties_afa_en.pdf|url = http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13555/instructions_third_parties_afa_en.pdf|work = echa.europa.eu|access-date = 2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consulting costs ===

Consulting costs of an application for authorisation have been estimated by ECHA and amounts, in average, to around 230,000 EUR for a single use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2303">The '''RISKS Digest''' or '''Forum On Risks to the Public in Computers and Related Systems''' is an online [[periodical]] published since 1985 by the Committee on Computers and Public Policy of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. The editor is [[Peter G. Neumann]].

It is a moderated forum concerned with the security and safety of [[computer]]s, [[software]], and technological systems. Security, and risk, here are taken broadly; RISKS is concerned not merely with so-called [[security hole]]s in software, but with [[unintended consequence]]s and hazards stemming from the design (or lack thereof) of automated systems. Other recurring subjects include [[cryptography]] and the effects of technically ill-considered public policies. RISKS also publishes announcements and Calls for Papers from various technical conferences, and technical book reviews (usually by [[Robert Slade|Rob Slade]], though occasionally by others).

Although RISKS is a forum of a [[computer science]] association, most contributions are readable and informative to anyone with an interest in the subject. It is heavily read by [[system administrator]]s, and [[computer security]] managers, as well as computer scientists and [[engineering|engineers]].

The RISKS Digest is published on a frequent but irregular schedule through the moderated [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] ''[news:comp.risks comp.risks]'', which exists solely to carry the Digest.

Summaries of the forum appear as columns edited by Neumann in the ACM [[SIGSOFT]] ''[[Software Engineering Notes]]'' (SEN) and the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' (CACM).

'''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis''' (English: ''The Gregorian School of Prague'') is an ''[[a cappella]]'' [[male voice choir]] from the [[Czech Republic]], founded in 1987 by '''David Eben'''. Their core repertoire consists of [[Gregorian chant]], [[Bohemia]]n [[plainchant]], and early [[polyphony]], but they also perform modern works including some composed for them.

==Description==

===Schola Gregoriana Pragensis===
The '''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis''' is an award winning choir from the Czech republic with primary focus on Gregorian chant and Bohemian plainchant.  The choir formed in 1987 under the direction of David Eben and was restricted in its repertoire to only [[liturgical]] music for the first two years.  Since the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the choir has extended its repertoire to include a variety of sacred music, with particular focus on Gregorian chant ([[monophonic]] Latin liturgical music) and early polyphony.

The choir has won several awards, including the Choc du monde de le musique, 10 de Repertoire and [[Golden Harmony (Zlatá Harmonie)]].&lt;ref name="supraphon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supraphon.com/en/artists/?item=47 |website=[[Supraphon]] |title=Schola Gregoriana Pragensis |accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since inception they have toured a variety of countries.

Of particular importance is the choir's work in researching and performing Bohemian [[plainchant]] and early polyphony.{{citation needed|reason="Of particular importance" needs to be backed up by a reliable source|date=April 2016}}

The choir has between six and nine members with a repertoire of various sacred music.  They have toured many countries, including Japan, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland.&lt;ref name="supraphon" /&gt;

Their work in the interpretation of medieval music, with particular focus on Bohemian plainsong, is particularly significant with a focus on the symbolism of [[neumatic]] notation from the 10th and 11th centuries.{{citation needed|reason="particularly significant" needs to be backed up by a reliable source|date=April 2016}}  Performances feature the original [[Bohemian]] plainchant tradition, including the earliest examples of polyphony.  In addition they have performed music from 14th and 15th century and more modern compositions, including some written specifically for the group.

They have produced numerous recordings under the [[Supraphon]] and other labels.

The choir has participated in early music festivals, including the Festival Early Music at Utrecht in 2014.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musica-dei-donum.org/concert_reviews/FOMU2014.html|title= Concert review from Festival Early Music Utrecht 2014|publisher= Musica Dei Donum|quote=With the concert of the Schola Gregoriana Pragensis we moved forward almost two centuries.

'''''Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson''''' is a 1990 work about sexual [[decadence]] in [[Western literature]] and the [[visual arts]] by scholar [[Camille Paglia]], in which the author addresses major artists and writers such as [[Donatello]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Emily Brontë]], and [[Oscar Wilde]]. Following Nietzsche, Paglia argues that the primary conflict in Western culture is between the binary forces of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]], [[Apollo]] being associated with order and symmetry, and [[Dionysus]] with chaos, disorder, and nature. The book received critical reviews from numerous feminist scholars, but was praised by some literary critics.

==Background==

By Paglia's own account, the ancestor of ''Sexual Personae'' was a book on aviator [[Amelia Earhart]] that she began to write in high school. Paglia's discovery of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[The Second Sex]]'' in 1963 inspired her to write a book larger in scope. ''Sexual Personae'' began to take shape in essays Paglia wrote in college between 1964 and 1968. The title was inspired by [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'', which Paglia saw on its American release in 1968. The work was finished in 1981, but was rejected by seven major New York publishers before being released by [[Yale University Press]] in 1990. Paglia credits editor Ellen Graham with securing Yale's decision to publish the book. The original preface to ''Sexual Personae'' was removed at the suggestion of Yale editors because of the book's extreme length, but was later published in Paglia's essay collection ''Sex, Art, and American Culture'' (1992).&lt;ref name="Paglia2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |pages=xi, xii, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia describes the method of ''Sexual Personae'' as psychoanalytic and acknowledges a debt to the work of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. Her other major influences were [[James George Frazer|Sir James George Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890), [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]]'s ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'' (1903), [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918), [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920), [[Sándor Ferenczi]]'s ''Thalassa'' (1924), the works of literary critics [[G. Wilson Knight]] and [[Harold Bloom]], [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]]'s ''[[The Great Mother]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Origins and History of Consciousness]]'' (1949), [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''The Nude'' (1956), [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958), [[Norman O. Brown]]'s ''[[Life Against Death]]'' (1959) and ''[[Love's Body]]'' (1966), and [[Leslie Fiedler]]'s ''Love and Death in the American Novel'' (1960). Paglia also acknowledges [[astrology]] as an influence.&lt;ref name="Paglia2" /&gt;

Paglia said of her objectives with the book, "It was intended to please no one and to offend everyone. The entire process of the book was to discover the repressed elements of contemporary culture, whatever they are, and palpate them. One of the main premises was to demonstrate that [[pornography]] is everywhere in major art. Art history as written is completely sex free, repressive and puritanical. I want precision and historical knowledge, but at the same time, I try to zap it with pornographic intensity."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in "20Q: Camille Paglia" by Warren Kalbacker in ''Playboy'' magazine (October 1991); also in Gauntlet # 4 (1992), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Paglia seeks to demonstrate "the unity and continuity of western culture". Accepting the canonical western tradition, she "rejects the modernist idea that culture has collapsed into meaningless fragments." Paglia argues that [[Christianity]] did not destroy [[paganism]], which flourishes in art, eroticism, astrology, and popular culture. She examines [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], the [[Renaissance]], and [[Romanticism]] from the late eighteenth century to 1900, contending that "Romanticism turns almost immediately into [[Decadent movement|Decadence]]." She believes that the "amorality, aggression, sadism, voyeurism, and pornography in great art have been ignored or glossed over by most academic critics" and that sex and nature are "brutal pagan forces." She also stresses the truth in sexual stereotypes and the biological basis of sexual difference, noting that her stance is "sure to cause controversy." Paglia sees the mother as an overwhelming force who condemns men to lifelong sexual anxiety, from which they fleetingly escape through [[rationalism]] and physical achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |pages=xiii |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portraying Western culture as a struggle between [[phallic]], [[Sky deity|sky-religion]] on the one hand, and [[chthonic]], [[Fertility goddess|earth-religion]] on the other, Paglia draws on the Greco-Roman polarity between the Apollonian and Dionysian. She associates Apollo with order, structure, and symmetry, and Dionysus with chaos, disorder, and nature. She analyzes literature and art from the premise that the primary conflict in Western culture has always been between these forces. In her view, the major patterns of continuity in western culture find their origin in paganism.  Other sources of continuity include [[androgyny]], sadism, and the aggressive "western eye," which seeks to refine and dominate nature's ceaseless hostility and thus has created our art and cinema.  Paglia criticizes feminists for sentimentality or wishful thinking about the causes of [[rape]], violence, and poor relations between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |pages=1–2 |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "sexual personae" of Paglia's title include the female vampire ([[Medusa]], [[Lauren Bacall]]); the pythoness (the [[Delphic Oracle]], [[Gracie Allen]]); the beautiful boy ([[Hadrian]]'s [[Antinous]], [[Dorian Gray]]); the epicene man of beauty (Byron, [[Elvis Presley]]); and the male heroine (the passive male sufferer; for example, the old men in [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry).&lt;ref name="Paglia1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |pages=vii–viii, 311, 312 |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers Paglia discusses include Spenser, Shakespeare, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], the [[Marquis de Sade]], Goethe, [[William Blake]], Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[John Keats]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Théophile Gautier]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], Brontë, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[Walter Pater]], Wilde, [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Henry James]], and [[Emily Dickinson]].

==Reception==

===Feminist responses===
''Sexual Personae'' received critical reviews from numerous feminist scholars.

===Other responses===
The critic [[Helen Vendler]] gave ''Sexual Personae'' a negative review in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', writing that while Paglia could be "enlightening and entertaining" when dealing with a subject congenial to her, she failed in her discussions of subjects that demanded more than appreciation of images and stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vendler, Helen|title=Feminism and Literature|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/05/31/feminism-and-literature/|website=Nybooks.com|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a letter of protest from Paglia, Vendler denied that ''Sexual Personae'' constituted poetry criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vendler, Helen, et al|title=Feminism and Literature: An Exchange|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/08/16/feminism-and-literature-an-exchange/|website=Nybooks.com|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Terry Teachout]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', described ''Sexual Personae'' as flawed, but "every bit as intellectually stimulating as it is exasperating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= July 22, 1990 |title=Siding With the Men |first=Terry |last=Teachout}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Anthony Burgess]] wrote of ''Sexual Personae'', "A fine, disturbing book.

The novelist [[John Updike]] wrote that ''Sexual Personae'' "feels less a survey than a curiously ornate harangue. Her percussive style — one short declarative sentence after another — eventually wearies the reader; her diction functions not so much to elicit the secrets of books as to hammer them into submission...

'''Stage theories''' are based on the idea that elements in systems move through a pattern of distinct [[wikt:stage|stage]]s over time and that these stages can be described based on their distinguishing characteristics. Specifically, stages in [[cognitive development]] have a constant order of succession, later stages integrate the achievements of earlier stages, and each is characterized by a particular type of structure of mental processes which is specific to it. The time of appearance may vary to a certain extent depending upon environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1970). Piaget’s theory. In P. H. Mussen, (Ed.), ''Carmichael’s handbook of child development'' (pp. 703-732). New York: Wiley.
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Stage theory" can also be applied beyond psychology to describe phenomena more generally where multiple phases lead to an outcome. The term "stage theory" can thus be applied to various scientific, sociological and business disciplines. In these contexts, stages may not be as rigidly defined, and it is possible for individuals within the multi-stage process to revert to earlier stages or skip some stages entirely.

==Piaget's theory of cognitive development==
:''See also: [[Theory of cognitive development]]''
[[Jean Piaget]]'s theory&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1951
). ''The psychology of intelligence''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of four stages: Sensorimotor: (birth to 2 years), Preoperations: (2 to 7 years), Concrete operations: (7 to 11 years), and Formal Operations: (11 to 16 years).  Each stage has at least two substages, usually called early and fully.

===Underlying assumptions===
* Each stage lays the foundation for the next.
* Everyone goes through the stages in the same order.
* Each stage is qualitatively different. Meaning it is a change in nature, not just quantity
* The child is an active learner. Basically they have to do it on their own, they cannot be told.

===Sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years)===

This stage is represented when infants obtain some control over their surroundings by sensory and motor schemes. &lt;ref&gt;Newman, B. M., &amp; Newman P. R. (2012). ''Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Infants start to identify their actions and the consequences of their actions. &lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Fredrickson B. L., Loftus G. R., &amp; Wagenaar W. A.. (2009). ''Atkinson &amp; Hilgard's Introduction to Psychology''. Cheriton House, UK: Cengage Learning EMEA, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

A child comes into the world knowing almost nothing, but they have the potential that comes in the form of: 
* Brain makeup
* Reflexes e.g. [[sucking]] and [[Visual_search#Visual_orienting_and_attention|visual orienting]]
* Innate tendencies to adapt to environment

Infants use these potentials to explore and gain an understanding about themselves and the environment. They have a lack of [[object permanence]], which means they have little or no ability to conceive things as existing outside their immediate vicinity. For example:  when you place a barrier, such as a piece of wood, in front of an object an infant will believe that the object is nonexistent.

===Object permanence===

Study 

*Infants do not grasp the concept of object permanence when they do not realize that an object exists even when it is not visible at the moment.
* When an object or toy is hidden from an infant they almost immediately lose interest and fail to search for the toy.  This is common in infants that are eight months or younger. &lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Fredrickson B. L., Loftus G. R., &amp; Wagenaar W. A.. (2009). ''Atkinson &amp; Hilgard's Introduction to Psychology''. Cheriton House, UK: Cengage Learning EMEA, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children who are around eight months can form a mental representation of an object in their head proving that they obtain object permanence (sensory motor stage)

===Sensorimotor play===
This play does not provide a purpose other than sensation:
*Swinging on a swing; enjoys the movement 
*Singing songs and simply playing with sounds such as 'Tra-la-la."&lt;ref&gt;Singer, D. G., &amp; Revenson T. A. (1997). ''A Piaget Primer: How a Child Thinks''. Madison, CT: International Universities Press, Inc. p. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; the sound's purpose is only for the satisfaction they bring
*Some play includes listening, tasting and smelling

! Substage!! Age !! Piaget's Label !! Characteristics
|-
| 1 || Birth-1 month || Reflexes || Use of built-in schemes or reflexes such as sucking or looking; no imitation; no ability to integrate information from several senses.
|-
| 2|| 1-4 months || Primary circular reactions || Accommodation of basic schemes (grasping, looking, sucking), as baby practices them endlessly. Beginning coordination of schemes from different senses, such as looking toward a sound; baby does not yet link bodily actions to some result outside the body.
|-
| 3 || 4-8 months || Secondary circular reactions || Baby becomes much more aware of events outside his own body and makes them happen again, in a kind of trial-and-error learning. Imitation may occur, but only of schemes already in the baby's repertoire. Beginning understanding of the "object concept."
|-
| 4 || 8-12 months || Coordination of secondary schemes || Clear intentional means-ends behavior. The baby not only goes after what she wants, but may combine two schemes to do so, such as knocking a pillow away to reach a toy. Imitation of novel behaviors occurs, as does transfer of information from one sense to another (cross-modal transfer).
|-
| 5 || 12-18 months || Tertiary circular reactions || "Experimentation" begins, in which the infant tries out new ways of playing with or manipulating objects. Very active, very purposeful trial-and-error exploration.
|-
| 6 || 18-24 months || Beginning of representational thought || Development of use of symbols to represent objects or events. Child understands that the symbol is separate from the object. Deferred imitation first occurs at this stage.

===Preoperational stage (2 to 7 years)===
Preoperational intelligence means the young child is capable of mental representations, but does not have a system for organizing this thinking (intuitive rather than logical thought).
The child is egocentric – which is they have problems distinguishing from their own perceptions and perceptions of others.
A classic example is, a preoperational child will cover their eyes so they can not see someone and think that that person can not see them either.

The child also has rigid thinking, which involves the following:
* Centration – a child will become completely fixed on one point, not allowing them to see the wider picture. For example, focusing only on the height of the container rather than both the height and width when determining what has the biggest volume.
* State – can only concentrate on what something looks like at that time.
* Appearance – focuses on how something appears rather than reality.
* Lack of Reversibility – can not reverse the steps they have taken. Does not realize that one set of steps can be cancelled by another set of steps.
* Lack of Conservation – realizing that something can have the same properties even if it appears differently.

===Concrete operations (7 to 11 years)===
* Intelligence is now both symbolic and logical.
* Acquires ‘operations’ = a set of general rules and strategies.
* The most critical part of operations is realizing ‘reversibility’ = both physical and mental processes can be reversed and cancelled out by others.
The concrete operational child will overcome the aspects of rigidity apparent in a preoperational child. These are:
* lack of reversibility
* states
* appearance
* conservation
The tasks of concrete operations are:
* Seriation – putting items (such as toys) in height order.
* Classification – the difference between two similar items such as daisies and roses.
* Conservation – realising something can have same properties, even if it appears differently.

It is important to realise that operations and conservations do not develop at the same time. They develop gradually and are not an ‘all or nothing’ phenomenon. For example, the first to develop is number conservation followed by mass conservation, area conservation, liquid conservation and finally solid volume conservation.
Thinking is not abstract. It is limited to concrete phenomena and the child’s own past experiences.

===Formal operations (11 to 16 years)===
* Child is capable of formulating hypotheses and then testing them against reality.
* Thinking is abstract, that is a child/adolescent can formulate all the possible outcomes before beginning the problem. They are also capable of deductive reasoning.

==Limitations of Piaget's theory==
A popular criticism is that Piaget underestimated the abilities of an infant.  Studies have shown that they have more of a capacity in memory and understanding of objects than he believed. &lt;ref&gt;Bee, H. L., &amp; Boyd, D. (2010). ''The Developing Child''. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Piagetian and Post-Piagetian stage theories==
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}

Juan Pascaual-Leone was the first to propose a neo-Piagetian stage theory. Since that time there have been several [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K. F. M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology'' (pp. 179-269). London: Wiley. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Only the ones that cover at least infancy through adulthood are mentioned here.  These include the theories of Robbie Case, Grame Halford, [[Andreas Demetriou]] and [[Kurt W. Fischer]]. The theory of [[Michael Commons]]' [[model of hierarchical complexity]] is also relevant.  The description of stages in these theories is more elaborate and focuses on underlying mechanisms of information processing rather than on reasoning as such. In fact, development in information processing capacity is invoked to explain the development of reasoning. More stages are described (as many as 15 stages), with 4 being added beyond the stage of Formal operations. Most stage sequences map onto one another.  PostPiagetian stages are free of content and context and are therefore very powerful and general.

'''Suicidology''' is the scientific study of [[suicidal behaviour]], the causes of suicidalness and [[suicide prevention]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maris, Berman, Silverman|first=Ronald, Alan, Mortan|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Suicidology|year=2000|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=72 Spring Street, New York, NY 10012|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different fields and disciplines involved with suicidology, the two primary ones being psychology and sociology. Every year, about one million people die by suicide, which is a mortality rate of sixteen per 100,000 or one death every forty seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide prevention (SUPRE)|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide is largely preventable with the right actions, knowledge about suicide, and a change in society's view of suicide to make it more acceptable to talk about suicide.

==Short history==
Most suicidologists think about the history of suicide in terms of courts, church, press, morals, and society. In Ancient Greece, there were several opinions about suicide. It was tolerated and even lauded when committed by patricians (generals and philosophers) but condemned if committed by  [[plebeians]] (common people) or slaves. In Rome, suicide was viewed rather neutrally, even positively because life was held cheaply. During early Christianity, excessive martyrdom and a penchant toward suicide frightened church elders sufficiently for them to introduce a serious deterrent. Suicide was thought of as a crime because it precluded possibility of repentance, and it violated the sixth commandment which is ''Thou shall not kill''. During this time, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] emphasized that suicide was a mortal sin because it disrupted God's power over man's life and death. However, nowhere in the Judeo-Christian Bible is there a directive forbidding suicide. This belief took hold and for hundreds of years thereafter played an important part in the Western view of suicide. Over the last 200 years, the main focus of suicide has moved from accusations that it is a sin to effort at compassion, understanding, and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shneidman|first=Edwin|title=Comprehending Suicide Landmarks in 20th-Century Suicidology|year=2001|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=750 First Street, NE Washingtion DC 20002|pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of study==
There are many points of study within suicidology. Suicidology studies not only death by suicide and attempted suicide but also partial self-destruction, [[suicidal ideation]], [[parasuicide]], and self-destructive behaviors and attitudes.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; Suicidal ideation is when someone is having thoughts or showing gestures of suicide. For example, it could be as simple as someone saying that "life is not worth living any more" or it can be extreme as "I'm going to kill myself by jumping off a bridge." Parasuicide is when someone causes deliberate harm to themselves. For example, if someone were to take an overdose of medicine and live. Self-destructive behaviors are anything that cause harm to oneself. This can be intentional or unintentional. Some examples are alcoholism, risky sports, some sexual disorders, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;   By way of a [[suicide note]] the person who is suiciding has the last word. It is also a way for the person to explain, bring closure (or not), to give guilt, to dictate wishes, to control, to forgive or to blame. Here is a list of the parts that might go into a suicide note.

==Contributors==
One of the first to contribute to the study of suicidology is Edwin S. Shneidman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Shneidman]]&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin Shneidman is considered to be the father of suicidology. Shneidman's definition of suicide is a conscious act of self-induced annihilation, best understood as a multidimensional malaise in a needful individual who defines an issue for which suicide is perceived as the best solution.  He thought of suicide as psychache or intolerable psychological pain. Another notable person in the field of suicidology is [[Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emile Durkheim]]&lt;/ref&gt;  To Durkheim the word suicide is applied to all cases of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the victim himself, which he knows will produce this result. Basically he saw suicide as an external and constraining social fact independent of individual psychopathology.  In David J. Mayo's definition there were four elements to suicide. The first element: A suicide has taken place only if a death has occurred. The second element: The death must be of one's own doing. The third element: The agency of suicide can be active or passive and, lastly, it implies intentionally ending one's own life.  [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Menninger]] had similar views on suicide. Their definition of suicide had three different aspects. One was a murder involving hatred or the wish to kill. The second one was a murder by the self often involving guilt or the wish to be killed. The last one is the wish to die. They thought of suicide being a murderous death wish that was turned back upon one's own self. Sigmund Freud also believed that we had two opposing basic instincts—life (eros) and death (thanatos)—and all instincts sought tension reduction. He also believed that suicide is more likely in advanced civilizations requiring greater repression of sexual and aggressive energy. Jean Baechler's definition of suicide was that suicide denotes all behavior that seeks and finds the solution to an existential problem by making an attempt on the life of the subject. Another worker in the field of suicidology was Joseph H. Davis. The definition he gave for suicide was a suicide is a fatal willful self-inflicted life-threatening act without apparent desire to live; implicit are two basic components lethality and intent. [[Albert Camus]] also did some work in this field. He believed that whether one can live or chooses to live is the only truly serious philosophical problem. He also claimed that man created a god in order to be able to live without a wish to kill himself and that the only human liberty is to come to terms with death. He introduced Darwinian thought into his teachings.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

==Suicide myths==
Here is a list of suicide myths and the truth behind these myths.&lt;ref name="Providing Access to Help 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Providing Access to Help|title=PATH Training Manual|year=2011|publisher=PATH|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Myths !! Truths
|-
| People who die by suicide always leave notes. || Most people don't leave notes. Only a small percentage leave any type of explanations about why they've chosen to kill themselves.
|-
| People who die by suicide don't warn others. || Out of ten people who kill themselves, eight have given definite clues to their intentions. They leave numerous clues and warnings to others, although some of their clues may be non-verbal or difficult to detect.
|-
| People who talk about suicide are only trying to get attention. || Few die by suicide without first letting someone else know how they feel. People thinking about suicide give clues and warnings as cries for help. Over 70% who do threaten to kill themselves either make an attempt or die by suicide. 
|-
| Once someone has already decided to die by suicide, nothing is going to stop them. || Most of the time suicidal people are ambivalent about suicide. Most individuals don't want to die; they just want the pain they are feeling to stop. 
|-
| Once the emotional state improves, the risk of suicide is over. || The highest rates of suicide occur within about three months of an apparent improvement in a severely depressed state. Energy level is the important factor in someone who's improving having the energy to act on a suicidal impulse, if they perceive a stumbling block to recovery. 
|-
| After a person has attempted suicide, it is unlikely they will try again. || People who have attempted suicide are very likely to try again. 80% of people who die by suicide have made at least one previous attempt. 
|-
| Don't mention suicide to someone who's showing signs of severe depression; it will plant the idea in their mind and they will act on it. || Many depressed people have already considered suicide as an option. Talking about suicide generally provides a sense of relief and understanding to the person. Talking about suicide is one of the most helpful things you can do. 
|-
| A non-fatal attempt means that the person wasn't serious about ending their life. || Some people are naive about how to kill themselves. The attempt in and of itself is the most important factor, not the method.

[[File:Anther-schematic.png|thumb|Schematic of [[anther]] ( 1: [[Stamen|Filament]] 2: [[Theca]] 3: Connective 4: [[Pollen|Pollen sac]] or Microsporangium)]]
[[File:Anther-schematic-detail.png|thumb|Section of anther, showing [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]] and release of pollen (1: [[Vascular bundle]] 2: Epidermis 3: Fibrous layer 4: Tapetum 5: Pollen]]
The '''tapetum''' is a specialised layer of nutritive cells found within the anther, of flowering plants, where it is located between the sporangenous tissue and the anther wall.
Tapetum is important for the nutrition and development of pollen grains, as well as a source of precursors for the pollen coat.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. Polowick, V.K. Sawhney 1993. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305736483711509 Differentiation of the Tapetum During Microsporogenesis in Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), with Special Reference to the Tapetal Cell Wall].{{sfn|Furness|Rudall|2001}} Annals of Botany, Volume 72, Issue 6, December 1993, Pages 595–605&lt;/ref&gt; The cells are usually bigger and normally have more than one nucleus per cell. As the sporogenous cells undergo mitosis, the nuclei of tapetal cells also divide. Sometimes, this mitosis is not normal due to which many cells of mature tapetum become [[multinucleate]]. Sometimes polyploidy and polyteny can also be seen. The unusually large nuclear constitution of the tapetum helps it in providing nutrients and regulatory molecules to the forming pollen grains. The following processes are responsible for this:
* Endomitosis
* Normal mitosis not followed by cytokinesis
* Formation of restitution nuclei
* Endoreduplication

Tapetum helps in pollenwall formation, transportation of nutrients to inner side of anther, synthesis of [[callase]] enzyme for separation of microspore tetrads.

== Types of tapetum ==
Two main tapetum types are recognised, '''secretory (glandular)''' and '''plasmodial (amoeboid)'''. In the secretory type a layer of tapetal cells remains around the anther [[locule]], while in the plasmodial type the tapetal cell walls dissolve and their [[protoplasts]] fuse to form a multinucleate plasmodium. A third, less common type, the invasive non-syncytial tapetum has been described in ''[[Canna (plant)|Canna]]'', where the tapetal cell walls break down to invade the anther locule but do not fuse to form a plasmodium. {{sfn|Furness|Rudall|2001}}

Amongst the [[monocots]] [[Acorales]], the first branching [[clade]] has a secretory tapetum, while the other alismatid clade, [[Alismatales]] are predominantly plasmodial. Amongst the late branching clades, the [[lilioid monocots]] are nearly all secretory while the [[commelinid monocots]] are diverse with respect to tapetal pattern.{{sfn|Furness|Rudall|2001}}

The '''Harwell TMG''' [[Stirling engine]], an abbreviation for "Thermo-Mechanical Generator", was invented in 1967 by [[Ted_Cooke-Yarborough|E. H. Cooke-Yarborough]] at the Harwell Labs of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was intended to be a remote [[electric power|electrical power]] source with low cost and very long life, albeit by sacrificing some efficiency.  The TMG (model TMG120) was at one time the only Stirling engine sold by a manufacturer, namely HoMach Systems Ltd., England.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite book
 | title=Principles and Applications of Stirling Engines

 | year=1986

}} p. 195, 113, 109, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine has near [[isothermal]] [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s because 1) the heater area covers the entire cylinder end, 2) it is a short stroke device, with wide shallow cylinders, yielding a high [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratio, 3) the average thickness of the gas space is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;cm, and 4) the working fluid is [[Helium]], a gas having good thermal properties for Stirling engines.  

The engine's displacer also has very low losses.  These low-loss operating characteristics simplify the engine analysis, compared to more conventional Stirling engines.&lt;ref name=West/&gt;{{rp|113}}

The design has many advantages over conventional Stirling engines.  The simplicity of the heater greatly reduces the cost by allowing the TMG to avoid the need for a [[brazing|brazed]] tubular or finned heater, which can account for 40% of the cost of a conventional Stirling engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title=The Philips Stirling Engine
 | author=Clifford.M.Hargreaves
 | year=1991
 | isbn=0-444-88463-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The heat exchangers for the heater and cooler are mechanically trivial.  The regenerator is a simple annulus, referred to as a "flat plate".  Along with the cylinder wall and the displacer, there are a total of four regenerating surfaces.  The TMG is a free piston engine.  There are no rolling [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] or sliding [[Cylinder seal|seal]]s, thus there is very little friction or wear.  The working space is hermetically sealed, allowing it to contain pressurized helium gas for many thousands of hours.  

The [[displacer]] is a [[stainless steel]] can, 27&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.  It is suspended by a low-loss planer metal [[Spring (device)|spring]] centered in a 27.4&amp;nbsp;cm diameter cylinder.  The 2&amp;nbsp;mm radial clearance is divided into two [[concentric]] [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular]] gaps by a thin, open-ended cylinder, which is fixed to the engine's cylinder.  This annulus acts as the [[regenerative heat exchanger|regenerator]], which is much less costly than a [[wire mesh|wire-mesh]] type.  

The engine is a "free-cylinder" design, in which the entire engine is mounted on springs and allowed to vibrate slightly.  This allows the displacer to be driven by positive feedback from the motion of the power piston and the magnets in the [[linear alternator|linear-alternator]] magnets, which have a combined weight of 10&amp;nbsp;kg.

The unique power piston was invented by Cooke-Yarborough, and is called an "articulated diaphragm".  It consists of a stainless steel annulus, with an outer diameter of 35&amp;nbsp;cm and an inner diameter of 26&amp;nbsp;cm.  This annulus is clamped to the engine on the outer edge by two flexible rubber o-rings, and on the inner edge it is similarly clamped, in this case to a rigid center hub that makes up the piston's center.  The o-rings flex but do not slide, thus no lubricant is needed and there is negligible wear in the entire machine.  

The compression space is located between the power-piston hub and the displacer, and this space is cooled by direct conduction through the power piston.  A developmental model of the TMG contained a double articulated diaphragm containing cooling water, which was pumped by a [[thermosyphon]].  The depth of the compression space varies from 0.2 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;mm, as governed by the 2&amp;nbsp;mm displacer stroke and the 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm power piston stroke moving 90 degrees out of phase.

The TMG engine successfully overcomes many of the economic and mechanical difficulties common in conventional Stirling engines. However, there are some limitations of this design.  The simple, low-cost annular regenerator is inefficient compared to other types, (and this contributes to this engine's somewhat low thermal efficiency of only 10%).  The mechanical limitations of the articulated diaphragm only allow a maximum stroke of an estimated 3&amp;nbsp;mm.  These properties limit the maximum obtainable power to about 500 - 1000 Watts from an engine of this design.&lt;ref name=West/&gt;{{rp|195}} Nevertheless, it is rare for a low-cost Stirling engine to obtain this high level of reliability and operating life, which can only be attributed to the ingenuity of the design.

The '''UK Astronomy Technology Centre''' ('''UK ATC''') is based at the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh|Royal Observatory]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and is part of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]].

The UK ATC designs, builds, develops, tests and manages major instrumentation projects in support of UK and international [[Astronomy]]. It has design offices, workshops and test facilities for both ground- and space-based instruments, including a suite of test labs capable of handling the largest current and projected instruments.&lt;ref name="ukatcinfo1"&gt;[http://www.roe.ac.uk/ukatc/information/aboutukatc.pdf UK Astronomy Technology Centre] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519232926/http://www.roe.ac.uk/ukatc/information/aboutukatc.pdf |date=19 May 2011 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9099">The '''water supply in Miyakojima''' involves the history and development of the current water supply on [[Miyakojima]], a small coral island with only one river, which is administered by [[Okinawa Prefecture]] of southwestern [[Japan]].

==Overview==
The water supply in Miyakojima depends mainly on [[Spring (hydrology)|spring water]] or [[ground water]], since there are almost no rivers. Although the yearly rainfall amounts to {{convert|2250|mm|in}}, 40% of it evaporates, 10% flows into the ground and 50% penetrates deep into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Hirara City History[1979:11]Nakanishi[2002:64]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is almost no source of surface water.

==Geology==
Beneath the soil of Miyakojima is a [[Ryukyu limestone]] layer which is porous, highly permeable, and does not preserve rainwater. Under the limestone layer is a Shimajiri [[mudstone]] layer of [[bedrock]], which is an impermeable rock. In the local dialect, it is called ''kucha''. Tectonic movements accompanied by several faults have formed underground valleys, and groundwater flows along these valleys. The underground basins are divided into 22 valleys.&lt;ref&gt;''Nihon no Chikei''2001, {{ISBN|4-13-064717-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 40 per cent of the abundant rainfall on Miyakojima penetrates the surface and quickly flows underground out into the ocean, unused. In addition, the strong subtropical sunshine evaporates as much as 50 per cent of the rainfall. The result is that only 10 per cent of the precipitation flows along the surface. Using natural water resources on Miyakojima has been quite difficult, owing to these natural conditions.

==History==
[[File:Miyako yamato ga.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Entrance to Yamatu-gā]]

In the past, water in deep [[caves]] was used, as suggested by their language. Namely, the spring is called ''urigā'', which means "going down into the cave and drawing water from the spring".

It was usually several meters deep into the ground, in some cases, 20 meters by stepping down the stone steps.&lt;ref&gt;Tokuyama[2008:]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, excavation of wells started&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Committee[1967:17]&lt;/ref&gt; and in an early 18th-century document,&lt;ref&gt;Hirara City History[1979:190]&lt;/ref&gt; 59 wells were recorded. Among them, Yamatsugā which was developed in 1720, was designated as an important site by the Hirara City (now Miyakojima City) education committee. It was a rich spring, and was used only by the government officials at the time. There was a guard posted at the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Nakasone[1988:261-262]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the duty of women to go down to the caves and draw water, and since the [[Meiji era]], girls went down to the caves and draw water, as adult women had other duties.&lt;ref&gt;Nakasone[1988:264]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increase in population, it became a business to sell water from neighboring places.&lt;ref&gt;Nakasone[1988:255]&lt;/ref&gt;

Collecting rainwater in large vases and tanks started in the [[Taishō era]] (1912–1925). The first water supply by manpower was made in 1924; men walked inside a [[tredmill]] 5 meters in diameter, which drew up a chain of water vases continuously from a well, 23 meters deep. The inventor was Chōgi Itosu, who sold the obtained water. A modern water supply plan was proposed in 1934 in Hirara, but in vain. In 1943, the Japanese Navy completed the first water supply from the Susakadā Well, and after 1945, US forces improved and used it.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Committee [1967:31]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1951, a formal construction plan for a water supply from Susakadā to Sodeyama was made and the construction started on March 27, 1952. Many citizens participated in the construction with pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Nakanishi[2002:19]&lt;/ref&gt; Service started on May 4, 1953. In 1954, the construction of water supply started in Gusukube town and by 1977, water supply service covered the entire Miyakojima.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Committee[1967:33]12,15&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1964, the US government established the Miyakojima water supply agency, but it was abolished by the inhabitants. On July 1, 1965, a Miyakojima water supply and sewage organization was established&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Committee[1967:37]16&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increase in the demand of water, investigations on the situation of ground water were started in 1962. On July 15, 1965, Miyakojima ground water control regulations were determined; which were renewed on May 23, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:242]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, there was a considerable [[drought]] in Miyakojima; leading to the investigation for new water sources. Projects for an [[underground dam]] and the conversion of Yonaha Bay into a fresh water lake were considered. The Yonaha Bay project met an opposition campaign in 1981 and was cancelled in 1983. The underground dam project continued and the Fukuzato underground dam and Sunakawa underground dam were completed in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:248]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, rainfall dropped to two-thirds of the annual mean. Water restrictions continued from January 21 to April 1.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:103]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present water sources==
There are springs in the caves such as Yamatu-gā, Susakadā, Bisa-gā, Bora-gā and Kubaka-gā. There is only one river flowing on the surface, Sakida-gā, only {{convert|3|km}} long. The largest spring, called Susakadā, covered all areas of Miyakojima; but after the drought of 1971, the water source of Sodeyama was developed. After the drought of 1993, water sources of Ōno, Nyātsu, Sokohara were developed. There are ''Sodeyama Purification Plant'' and ''Kajidō Purification Plant'', and service reservoirs are at Hisamatsu, Shijō, Karimata and Bora.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:103]&lt;/ref&gt; Two underground reservoirs were completed in 1989 in Susakadā, both 40,000 cubic meters.&lt;ref&gt;Miyakojima Water Organization[1996:219]&lt;/ref&gt; The water in Miyakojima is [[hard water]], which is unsatisfactory both in taste and in the handling of metallic tableware. In 1999, adjustments to the [[pH]] were started at Sodeyama with [[water softening]] using [[lime softening]] in a pellet-reactor.&lt;ref&gt;Shimoji[2001:72]&lt;/ref&gt; Strict surveillance of the quality of the water supply is being done to prevent contamination through infiltration by [[fertilizer]]s and other sources of local drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Shimoji[2001:72]&lt;/ref&gt;
